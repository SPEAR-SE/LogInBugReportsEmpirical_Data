/**
 * Generate the next valid block group ID by incrementing the maximum block
 * group ID allocated so far, with the first 2^10 block group IDs reserved.
 * HDFS-EC introduces a hierarchical protocol to name blocks and groups:
 * Contiguous: {reserved block IDs | flag | block ID}
 * Striped: {reserved block IDs | flag | block group ID | index in group}
 *
 * Following n bits of reserved block IDs, The (n+1)th bit in an ID
 * distinguishes contiguous (0) and striped (1) blocks. For a striped block,
 * bits (n+2) to (64-m) represent the ID of its block group, while the last m
 * bits represent its index of the group. The value m is determined by the
 * maximum number of blocks in a group (MAX_BLOCKS_IN_GROUP).
