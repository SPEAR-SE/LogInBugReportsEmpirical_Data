/**
 * A utility class for the GPG Policy Generator to read and write policies
 * into the FederationStateStore. Policy specific logic is abstracted away in
 * this class, so the PolicyGenerator can avoid dealing with policy
 * construction, reinitialization, and serialization.
 *
 * There are only two exposed methods:
 *
 * {@link #getPolicyManager(String)}
 * Gets the PolicyManager via queue name. Null if there is no policy
 * configured for the specified queue. The PolicyManager can be used to
 * extract the {@link FederationRouterPolicy} and
 * {@link FederationAMRMProxyPolicy}, as well as any policy specific parameters
 *
 * {@link #setPolicyManager(FederationPolicyManager)}
 * Sets the PolicyManager. If the policy configuration is the same, no change
 * occurs. Otherwise, the internal cache is updated and the new configuration
 * is written into the FederationStateStore
 *
 * This class assumes that the GPG is the only service
 * writing policies. Thus, the only FederationStateStore reads occur the first
 * time a queue policy is retrieved - after that, the GPG only writes to the
 * FederationStateStore.
 *
 * The class uses a PolicyManager cache and a SubClusterPolicyConfiguration
 * cache. The primary use for these caches are to serve reads, and to
 * identify when the PolicyGenerator has actually changed the policy
 * so unnecessary FederationStateStore policy writes can be avoided.
