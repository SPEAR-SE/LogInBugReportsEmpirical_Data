/**
 * The difference between the current state and a previous state of a list.
 * 
 * Given a previous state of a set and a sequence of create, delete and modify
 * operations such that the current state of the set can be obtained by applying
 * the operations on the previous state, the following algorithm construct the
 * difference between the current state and the previous state of the set.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Two lists are maintained in the algorithm:
 * - c-list for newly created elements
 * - d-list for the deleted elements
 *
 * Denote the state of an element by the following
 *   (0, 0): neither in c-list nor d-list
 *   (c, 0): in c-list but not in d-list
 *   (0, d): in d-list but not in c-list
 *   (c, d): in both c-list and d-list
 *
 * For each case below, ( , ) at the end shows the result state of the element.
 *
 * Case 1. Suppose the element i is NOT in the previous state.           (0, 0)
 *   1.1. create i in current: add it to c-list                          (c, 0)
 *   1.1.1. create i in current and then create: impossible
 *   1.1.2. create i in current and then delete: remove it from c-list   (0, 0)
 *   1.1.3. create i in current and then modify: replace it in c-list    (c', 0)
 *
 *   1.2. delete i from current: impossible
 *
 *   1.3. modify i in current: impossible
 *
 * Case 2. Suppose the element i is ALREADY in the previous state.       (0, 0)
 *   2.1. create i in current: impossible
 *
 *   2.2. delete i from current: add it to d-list                        (0, d)
 *   2.2.1. delete i from current and then create: add it to c-list      (c, d)
 *   2.2.2. delete i from current and then delete: impossible
 *   2.2.2. delete i from current and then modify: impossible
 *
 *   2.3. modify i in current: put it in both c-list and d-list          (c, d)
 *   2.3.1. modify i in current and then create: impossible
 *   2.3.2. modify i in current and then delete: remove it from c-list   (0, d)
 *   2.3.3. modify i in current and then modify: replace it in c-list    (c', d)
