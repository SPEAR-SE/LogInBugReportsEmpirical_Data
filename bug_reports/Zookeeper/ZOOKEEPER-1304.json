        "description": "**[Sorry. I don't know how to delete an issue that is already submitted. I just learned of the Bookkeeper jira, and I will submit this issue there instead. You can all ignore this issue.]\n\n\nSince I couldn't finish building all hedwig components in CentOS, I built it successfully in Ubuntu, then I deployed it to CentOS (no ubuntu image in my company's cloud). I configured zookeeper, bookies and hubs as they were described in the documentations. First, I copied TestPubSubClient.java's publish and subscribe tests into my own test code. I also had to create another object that extends ClientConfiguration. I named it \"HedwigConf\", and overwrote getDefaultServerHedwigSocketAddress() method because the server was not on the same machine as the workstation. I targetted the right host and publish seemed to work. However, it throws me ServiceDownException for publish sometimes. I checked the logs of the hubs. They seem to have connected ok with the bookies. There was no error or warning there. However, the problem seemed to exist in bookies and zookeeper. This was found in the zookeeper log: \"Got user-level KeeperException when processing sessionid:0x----------- type:create cxid:0x5 zxid:0x29 txntype:-1 reqpath:n/a Error Path:/hedwig/standalone/topics Error:KeeperErrorCode = NoNode for /hedwig/standalone/topics\". Normally this znode path is created automatically. Also, some bookies complained this: \"WARN [NIOServerFactory] org.apache.bookkeeper.proto.NIOServerFactory - Exception in server socket loop: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\". For some reason, this problem comes and goes. Sometimes everything just works and the new topic is saved in a new znode, and the message is saved in bookie(s). I spent hours trying to recreate this yesterday, but I couldn't. Now it is back again. Subscribe seems to have the similar issue.\n",
