At 2015-03-16 10:59:45,710, we close the session 0x14be28f50f4419d but the socket connection between ZK client and ZK Follower is closed at 2015-03-16 10:59:45,715 after session termination.\nlogs from ZK Leader server:\n{code}\n2015-03-16 10:59:45,710 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.PrepRequestProcessor: Processed session termination for sessionid: 0x14be28f50f4419d\n{code}\nlogs from ZK Follower server:\n{code}\n2015-03-16 10:59:45,715 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn: Closed socket connection for client /?.?.?.65:42777 which had sessionid 0x14be28f50f4419d\n{code}\n\nIt looks like Zk client is out-of-sync with ZK server.\nMy question is how ZK client can recover from this error. It looks like the ZK Client won't be disconnected from Follower until session is closed and any ZooKeeper operation will fail with SessionMovedException before session is closed.\nAlso since ZK Leader already closed the socket connection/session to ZK Client at step 3, why it still reject the ZooKeeper operation from client with SessionMovedException. Will it be better to endorse the session/connection between ZK client and ZK Follower? This seems like a bug to me. ",
