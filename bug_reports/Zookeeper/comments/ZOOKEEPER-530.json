[Just found with man 7 ipv6:

NOTES
The sockaddr_in6 structure is bigger than the generic sockaddr.  Programs that assume that all address types can be stored safely in a struct sockaddr need to be changed to use struct sockaddr_storage for that instead., These changes fix the problem for me., Thanks for the patch!, Isabel, is this ready for review? Please click the "submit patch" link if so. 

Also, is there some test we can add for this? Or we just need to run the existing tests on IPv6?
, As explained above, I just tried to use the c-client on a 64bit system with IPv6 support (SuSE 10.3), when connecting to the server I got the errors from above - not consistently though: Whenever the client decided to connect to the IPv4 address all would work fine. So running the existing tests on a IPv6 only, 64bit system should do the trick, I do not know what a test that checks exactly that scenario might look like., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Isabel, the patch looks good. thanks for the fix. 

One thing I noticed in the patch is this -

{code}
	zh->fd = socket(zh->addrs[zh->connect_index].ss_family, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
			if (zh->fd < 0) {
				return api_epilog(zh,handle_socket_error_msg(zh,__LINE__,
				            ZCONNECTIONLOSS,"connect() call failed"));
			}
{code}

there is a new error check, which is a good thing, but can the error be changed to ZSYSTEMERROR, the log message to socket() call failed?
