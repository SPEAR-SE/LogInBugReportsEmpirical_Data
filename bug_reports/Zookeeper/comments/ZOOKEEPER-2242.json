Thank you to [~cbarlock] for reporting the bug.  (Chris, please feel free to assign this to yourself if you'd like to provide a patch.), [~cbarlock], I just realized that a patch was already committed to fix this in ZOOKEEPER-2056, so upcoming new releases will fix this.  I'm resolving this issue as a duplicate.]
