[# shall we modify {{org.apache.zookeeper.version.Info.REVISION}} from int to String and store the git revision in it
 or introduce new variable {{org.apache.zookeeper.version.Info.GIT_REVISION}} for git revision?
# I would prefer to modify it from int to String, if there is no backward compatibility concern. It is not an exposed interface, so backward compatibility should be a concern here.

Any thoughts ?, Perhaps we should simplify and just remove revision?, revision gives very good information in analyzing whether a particular fix included in the build, specially in private builds. If we have option to remove this , we definitely have option to change it. I think it is better to change {{org.apache.zookeeper.version.Info.REVISION}} from int to String and store the git revision.
[~phunt] shall I submit the patch for this?, bq. I think it is better to change org.apache.zookeeper.version.Info.REVISION from int to String and store the git revision.

+1 on the idea. [~arshad.mohammad], are you still interested working on a fix for this issue? If so, please go ahead and submit a pull request, so we can get this in for 3.5.3.

    ZOOKEEPER-2573: Modify Info.REVISION to adapt git repo

----
, Hi [~arshad.mohammad] and [~hanm], I hope you don't mind, but I decided to take a stab at this issue. I would be really glad if you could test it, mainly in a Windows env, that I don't have access. :(

One minor issue I faced is that I think we could use the first 8 characters of the git SHA-1. On unix-like plataforms this is straighforward, just a matter of adding a call to {{cut}} command as below: 

{code}
git rev-parse HEAD | cut -c1-8
{code}

The problem is that on Windows there's no equivalent to {{cut}}, and it seemed cumbersome to add an equivalent. So, I left the full sha1 code as of now:

{code}
git rev-parse HEAD
{code}

**The patch is target at branch-3.4, but I was able to cherry-pick the commit to branch-3.5 and master**.

[~breed], [~phunt], and [~fpj], could you also see if the patch is okay, please?

    Thanks @eribeiro for the patch. Any specific reason to use only the first 8 characters of the git SHA-1. Will this be helpful in analyzing whether a particular fix included in the release?
    
    How about keeping the complete SHA-1?

    Hi @rakeskadr, usually the first 8 characters of commit are enough to identify the commit.
    
    But I think putting the whole SHA-1 is nice, because the more context the better. Also, it simplifies the code even more (to substr the sha1 is annoying on windows).
    
    Thanks for pointing out!

    @rakeshadr My Google searches didn't bring anything about external  ZK revision number use. Of course, many in-house systems can rely on it. So, I am clueless about the best strategy here. :(

    I have checked with my HBase colleagues, they said no dependency with "revision". From ZK point of view, not required to maintain backward compatibility as this is not exposed interface. Still, if any concerns, then we can deprecate and create a new GIT_REVISION or REVISION_HASH etc as this change will go to stable branch-3.4

    As:
    rev=rev.trim()

    Thanks @arshadmohammad, gonna do that.
, Github user rakeshadr commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/137
  
    @eribeiro, Earlier with svn revision(integer value), if there is NFE while parsing arg[1] then it suppress this exception and returns -1. The outer try-catch block guards the from #parseVersionString() function. IIUC, that is reason for separate try-catch blocks.
    
    Anyway, now with the git rev hash the inner try-catch block is not needed as we are dealing with String value. I could see you have removed the inner try-catch block, that looks OK to me. Still we need to maintain the outer try-catch block where it guards MAJ, MINOR, MICRO parsing, right?

    HI @rakeshadr, I have just created a PR targeting branch-3.5 (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/155 ). It can be applied to master too. In fact, I was able to apply PR 155 to branch-3.4 so you may try to use it instead of this one, if you prefer. Otherwise you can squash and merge this one on branch-3.4 and 155 on branch-3.5 and master.

    ZOOKEEPER-2573: Introduce a python script that generates flaky tests report.

    The script is self explaining, here are some notes:
    
    * The original work is done by Appy at Cloudera HBase team.
    * The script is customized to fit ZooKeeper's use cases, in particular ZooKeeper allows duplicate test runs, unlike HBase. For example same test could be run three times, one by the test itself, one by Netty test suite, and one by NIO test suite. Script is updated to account for this factor when processing and analyzing test results.
    * There will be an Apache Jenkins job set up to run this script on regular basis and publish results dashboard somewhere publicly accessible. For a preview of the dashboard, see http://home.apache.org/~hanm/dashboard/report.html.
