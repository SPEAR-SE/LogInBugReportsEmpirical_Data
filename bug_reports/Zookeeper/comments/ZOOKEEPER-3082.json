Thanks forÂ sorting this out. Do you think it fixes ZOOKEEPER-1621?, [~andorm] my (possibly incorrect) read on ZOOKEEPER-1621 is that the issue is related to this one but not strictly a subset. Here we've removed the possibility of the snapshot side of recovery being lost during a disk-full event. There, the issue seems to be in ensuring the transaction log side of recovery is not corrupted by writing empty/incomplete log files. That issue will continue to be present even with the patch from this file applied., Thanks [~nixon]]
