[# This is not a problem, this is the expected behavior
# auth ACL scheme adds ACLs for authorized ids in the session. auth ACL scheme means add ACLs for authorized ids. In your case there were two authorized ids when you executed {{setAcl /test_auth auth:u1:p1:crdwa}}
'x509,'CN=locahost%2COU=CS%2CO=HUAWEI%2CL=Shenzhen%2CST=Guangdong%2CC=CHINA and
digest,'u1:fpT/y03U+EjItKZOSLGvjnJlyng=
So the ACLs are added for these two ids.
# In {{setAcl /test_auth auth:u1:p1:crdwa}} command u1:p1 are meaning less and are completely ignored. I don't know why these are mandatory to pass from CLI. May be you can raise JIRA for this.
# When you logged-in after quit, the 'x509,'CN=locahost%2COU=CS%2CO=HUAWEI%2CL=Shenzhen%2CST=Guangdong%2CC=CHINA got added as authorized id again. Because this id has all the permissions on on /test_auth node, you are able to perform all the operations.  , [~arshad.mohammad] As i mentioned earlier also, pls try to understand the problem before making conclusion. If any clarity required can be discussed or can be followed the steps mentioned in the issue to understand the problem. In this issue pls try to perform the steps mentioned here in 2 case- one when zookeeper started in ssl mode and another when zookeeper started in non-ssl mode and will get the difference., # Thanks [~rakeshsingh] for the advice. These are my opinion based on technical facts and these are not conclusions. If it was concluded it would have been closed as not an issue.
# bq. In this issue pls try to perform the steps mentioned here in 2 case- one when zookeeper started in ssl mode and another when zookeeper started in non-ssl mode and will get the difference
I think this is something new you are taking about. It is not mentioned in the defect description. In the defect description only SSL enabled standalone server is mentioned.
# sure, we can discuss for clarity. Which step  you performed on non SSL server ]
