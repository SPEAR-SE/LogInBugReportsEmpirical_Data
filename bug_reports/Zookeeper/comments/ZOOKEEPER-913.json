[Two possible solutions. Choose the most effective., I like the "version" patch better. However it should be made more general.

We've had problems with this before. We should parse X.Y.Zblah where anything after Z (Z expected to be a number) gets put into some additional field ("extension"?). , I propose we move to support the same format as maven supports:
http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html

<major version>.<minor version>.<incremental version>-<qualifier>

this is close to what we do, but allows for any "qualifier" after the x.y.z-
, this most recent patch implements support for a version format similar to what maven does. 

Added tests, also verified on the command line (build) using -Dversion option. Seems to work ok., Looks great, thanks!, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Thanks Ben, however I'd like to see this go in 3.3.3 as well (was working originally). If someone else doesn't jump in before me I'll submit a patch targeting 3.3 branch when I have a chance., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1031 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1031/])
    ZOOKEEPER-913. Version parser fails to parse "3.3.2-dev" from build.xml
