[add resonable wait times for event polling.

In some cases the poll was expected to not return results (depending on args to the function) and in other cases it was expecting. I suspect the short poll times were to shorten the run time of the test (re no result expected). I moved to 10seconds to handle this, short enough to let the test run in resonable time, long enough to handle slowness in the system (cpu/disk loading outside zk, etc...)
, +1 for the patch ... the tests pass , committed to revision 718445 in trunk and 
revision 718447 in 3.0
