[[~fournc] [~abrahamfine] is this related to the issue you recently resolved against 3.4.11?, [~andorm] can you confirm?, [~phunt] [~abrahamfine]

No, the issue is similar, but it's completely unrelated. This one is caused by:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1423

It only applies to master and branch-3.5 branches, on branch-3.4 the conf command is right.

The attached patch fixes it.
