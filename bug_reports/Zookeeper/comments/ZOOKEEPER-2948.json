[Someone just reported similar to the builds list:

----
it seems that on some nodes the user ids, that are used by the Jenkins slav=
es, have been changed. But there are still some directories residing in /tm=
p with ownership to the old uid. That causes a conflict with our tests, bec=
ause these files can neither be deleted nor moved.

Slave where our jobs fail: H25
But this may not be the only one.

Could you please check and delete (old) temp files there.
In our case it's /tmp/archiva, but other projects may have similar problems=
, Greetings from Infra! I've gone ahead and cleared up /tmp on the Jenkins nodes so hopefully this won't present itself anymore.  Let me know if you encounter any more errors., Github user phunt commented on the issue:
