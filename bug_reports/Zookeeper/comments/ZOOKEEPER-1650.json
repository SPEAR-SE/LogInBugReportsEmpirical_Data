[I can try to submit a patch that increase timeout for that test. Is there a way to trigger solaris build for uncommitted patch?, bq. Is there a way to trigger solaris build for uncommitted patch?

no., This is still failing consistently on solaris, nearly every failure here is due to this issue:
https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-solaris/, Hi, it looks like this issue is same as ZOOKEEPER-1862. Please have a look at the analysis and the attached patch on ZOOKEEPER-1862.

https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/ZooKeeper/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-solaris/844/testReport/org.apache.zookeeper.test/ServerCnxnTest/testServerCnxnExpiry/, I'm marking this as duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-1862. Please feel to reopen if any comments. Thanks!

Please see the build: https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-solaris/850/, [~rakeshr] it looks like you're right: (this job just went green for the first time in a long time)

Thanks!]
