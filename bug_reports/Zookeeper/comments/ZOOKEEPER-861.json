[Uploading the binary SSL certificate file used for doing junit tests., - I copied server.p12 in src/contrib/hedwig/server/src/main/resources/, and that fixed all the unit test failures. 
- ZOOKEEPER-861.patch doesn't apply. What is this patch supposed to do?

--Michi, The patch won't really apply since it is just showing where the binary file server.p12 should be placed.  I don't think there's a way for patches to work when adding new binary files to the source., That's correct, patches only work with non-binaries I'm afraid. The reviewer will need to verify manually as part of the review process., +1. This fixed all the unit test failures. 

--Michi, I just committed this. thanks erwin!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #936 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/936/])
