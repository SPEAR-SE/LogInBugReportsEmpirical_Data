[Yes, the version script can't get the revision number.  I get this as well when obtaining the code from git.  One option would be to remove the version information, or to change the version scripts to return 0 or something if not in a subversion directory., yes, the script should just return 0.0.0 in case it fails to do svn revision... , this patch fixes the unix scripts. have to read through bat scripting to fix it... , Closing - fixed in ZOOKEEPER-241]
