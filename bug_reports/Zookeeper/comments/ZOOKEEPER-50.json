[Ben can you update the docs appropriately? We should ensure that this is fixed in the java code -- and that the C code is correct as well.

Assign it to me or Andrew after updating the appropriate docs (or submitting a patch on this jira if javadoc change required). If you want to fix that would be great too. :-), ZOOKEEPER-23 includes the text to clarify this., this was fixed in 3.0.0
