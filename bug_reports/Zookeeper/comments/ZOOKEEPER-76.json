[Deletes code coverage build targets, Thanks for the patch and the feedback, however this was intentional. Notice that I added a README.txt in the lib/cobertura directory directing ppl how to d/l cobertura and run the build target.

After moving to Apache committers have access to an Apache license for Clover however contributors (non-comitters) do not. I left this target in place to allow anyone access to a coverage tool., Hrm. For whatever reason the build was successful before the commit, however now it's failing due to not being able to find cobertura jar.  (I had run the test target successfully on the patch, weird).

I'm reopening this to see if I can fix (otw I'll apply the submitted patch).
, i just did this as in the patch which amkes the tests work fine. -- getting rid of cobertura in the classpath. 
, This patch (ZOOKEEPER-76.patch) pushes the taskdef into the target, so it won't be run unless one of the cobertura targets is specifically run (then obv the jar needs to be in place).

Please review/vote and I will commit., pats patch seems better.. +1 on pat's patch ... 
, Fixed in 677371 using ZOOKEEPER-76.patch, 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
