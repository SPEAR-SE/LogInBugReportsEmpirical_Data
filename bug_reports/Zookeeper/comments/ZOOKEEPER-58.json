[Excellent catch! I think it is better to do this in either primeConnection or startConnect, that way we make sure everything is setup correctly at the start rather than trying to make sure that we clean up correctly. Of the two my preference would probably be startConnect., New patch, moved added code to startConnect()., +1 Looks good, just marking this issue as having a patch - does a committer fancy applying it? :), yeah, right, I'll take care of it... :-)
, Adding new patch generated against the apache trunk., Ben, you have reviewed this patch before, but since I have regenerated it against the apache trunk, you have to review it again., +1, Committed, 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
