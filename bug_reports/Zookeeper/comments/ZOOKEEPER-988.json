[Xiawei, 
  It is good to open jira's with issues in zookeeper but its much better to provide more information on the issue you are facing. Like in this case, it would be very helpful to get the stack trace on the Sendworker.run thread that died and also the jstack of the zookeeper process. , Hi Xiawei,

As Mahadev mentioned, can you describe the problem in detail and how to reproduce it? Also, please attach zookeeper.log and zoo.cfg from all the nodes.]
