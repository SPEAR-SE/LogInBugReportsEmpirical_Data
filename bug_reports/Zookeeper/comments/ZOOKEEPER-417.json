This message is automatically generated., the release audit generates warnings before the way i added the new keeper exception codes. we made the integers deprecated, so i've made the new ones deprecated as well. should i put the integer in the new error code rather than added a new deprecated constant?

i can't find any failed tests in the test results. what am i missing?, {code}

     [exec] /home/hudson/hudson-slave/workspace/Zookeeper-Patch-vesta.apache.org/trunk/build.xml:703: exec returned: 2

{code}

I see the above int he console ooutput of the tests.

Also for the depreacted integers we dont need to add them to the deperecated api. We should just add them to the new error code., removed the deprecated member, the patch looks good ... i have some comments -- 

line 543  in NIOServerCnxn.java 

{code}
si.setOwner(zk);
zk.submitRequest(si);
{code}

Can we just use some static final Object adn si.setOwner(Object)?

- Is there any use of using zk specifically? If we just use some static object then we can just say that this will be replaced at the leader with the right follower handler and then is a dummy object in followers and single zookeeper wherein it has no spefic use case... the reason I say this is that its a little confusing to understand the code if we dont have comments here .... also if we can use a dummy object rather than zk, its much cleaner. what do you think?, implemented mahadev's suggestion, +1 to the patch ... ill wait for hudson's +1 before committing., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I committed this. the -1 from hudson for jdiff is just because we added another error code which is fine.. thanks ben, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #359 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/359/])
