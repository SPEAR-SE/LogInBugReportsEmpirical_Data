This message is automatically generated., +1 core tests failures unrelated to patch, fyi it was also flagged due to missing tests. Is this already covered by existing tests?, Tryning to please hudson., Still in the process of trying to please hudson., Following the link for test results, it shows that the following caused the error:

java.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.BindException: Address already in use
	at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer.startLeaderElection(QuorumPeer.java:310)

and this patch doesn't change anything on ZooKeeper either, so the changes here are not the causing the failure., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The part of the bookie code changed with this patch was already exercised before on tests, and the reason why they didn't catch the bug is because the error is caused by garbage collected entries in masterKeys (WeakHashMap). I have removed this data structure in this patch, so that there is no more such garbarge collected entries. The code path is still exercised by unit tests, though. , I just committed this. thanks flavio.. , Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #271 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/271/])
    . WeakHashMap in Bookie.java causes NPE (flavio via mahadev)
