This message is automatically generated., AFAIK its not required to include the pdf and html when updating the docs(I've referred other docs JIRAs). Could you create a new patch with only xdocs changes.

BTW, It would be great if someone can comment the reason why html/pdf docs in svn ? Thanks!, Sure, I'll upload a new version. I'm also wondering why the generated html/pdf are tracked by VCS., version 2 uploaded., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
