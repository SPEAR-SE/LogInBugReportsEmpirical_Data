[This 1 UT failure org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Zab1_0Test is not only existed in Open JDK, but also exsited in SUN JDK.

This is due to this test uses a lot of hard-wired port numbers. Most or all other tests automatically assign a free port.

The resolvement is to modify org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Zab1_0Test, specifying a different port instead of the 33556 or just change it to PortAssignment.unique() and add    "import org.apache.zookeeper.PortAssignment;". , Dear Zookeeper committee, I have generated diff patches for3.4 branch and trunk, and all UT in both Open JDK and SUN JDK are passed, need I provide it? , By the way, can I have the honor to be the assignee to fix this issue? Thanks!:), Current all UT passed. ZOOKEEPER-1578-branch-3.4.patch is for branch 3.4., This patch ZOOKEEPER-1578-trunk.patch is for trunk., Hello Patrick,

Thanks very much for your assigning!

I have attached the patches into JIRA ZOOKEEPER-1578 for both branch 3.4
and trunk, all UT are passed.

Hope everything goes well with you.:-)
