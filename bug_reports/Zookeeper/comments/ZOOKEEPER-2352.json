[Hello [~wding].  There have been some recent rpm packaging issues that were never fully resolved.  On ZOOKEEPER-2124, I posted an addendum patch to the spec files to geg

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2124?focusedCommentId=14526870&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14526870

There is also ZOOKEEPER-2275 tracking a similar patch.

Would you be interested in testing with either of those patches to see if they fix the issue for you?

BTW, you might be interested to know that ZOOKEEPER-1604 proposes removing the rpm and deb packaging from the ZooKeeper project, and deferring to downstream consumers like BigTop for packaging needs., Hi Chris, thanks for the response.

I (svn) checked out the latest code from trunk.  It has the same problem.  I am not sure it is the problem in the rpmbuild or in the zookeeper spec. 

The ZOOKEEPER-1604 sounds interesting.  Could you send me some links to this project?  I'd like to test it.
  
Thanks.

, [~wding], sorry, I should clarify that the patches I referenced in my last response are not committed.  You won't see them in a fresh checkout of the latest trunk.  You would have to apply those patches manually yourself to test them.

bq. The ZOOKEEPER-1604 sounds interesting. Could you send me some links to this project? I'd like to test it.

The proposal in ZOOKEEPER-1604 is that the ZooKeeper project stops doing its own rpm and deb packaging.  The job of packaging would be moved to external projects, such as BigTop.  (See bigtop.apache.org.), Hi Chris, just applied the patch and tested.  Here is the output:
      [rpm] + umask 022
      [rpm] + cd /tmp/zookeeper_package_build_wding/BUILD
      [rpm] + cd zookeeper-3.6.0-SNAPSHOT
      [rpm] + pushd /tmp/zookeeper_package_build_wding/BUILD
      [rpm] /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.G8hNUf: 28: /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.G8hNUf: pushd: not found
      [rpm] error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.G8hNUf (%install)
      [rpm]     Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.G8hNUf (%install)

Any idea?
Thanks.

Thanks.

, Hi Chris,

I tracked down to the issue with 'pushd'.  It turns out that in ubuntu, the /bin/sh is a symbol link to /bin/dash (not bash) which does not have 'pushd'.  After I have fixed this, it went further.  The new problem is described from the output:

      [rpm] Executing(%build): /bin/sh -e /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.iOquiw
      [rpm] Executing(%install): /bin/sh -e /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.aymsm1
      [rpm] /tmp/zookeeper_package_build_wding/BUILD /tmp/zookeeper_package_build_wding/BUILD/zookeeper-3.6.0-SNAPSHOT
      [rpm] 
      [rpm] 
      [rpm] RPM build errors:

, Given the packaging has been removed as of ZOOKEEPER-1604 I'm closing this. Please use Bigtop for ZK packaging.]
