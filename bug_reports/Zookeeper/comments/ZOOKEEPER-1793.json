[Alex,  where do you see that test is flaky? These builds look ok to me (https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/, https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper_branch34/), Hi Thawan,

I'm running ant test -Dtestcase=Zab1_0Test on my Mac with trunk, and it fails with the error above once every 3-4 runs

Thanks
Alex, I wasn't able to repro this on my mac.  The jenkins builds look very stable to me. I also don't have issue with this test in our internal branch as well.

When this assert fail, it means that observer didn't flush file to disk. So data read from disk by a separate thread did have the latest value.  , I'm sorry, I missed this jira before creating ZOOKEEPER-1798, which I believe is a duplicate of this one. In that jira, I describe the reason for the test being flaky and propose a solution, which apparently [~thawan] is not very happy with. I'm going to post a response momentarily., Fixed by ZOOKEEPER-1798]
