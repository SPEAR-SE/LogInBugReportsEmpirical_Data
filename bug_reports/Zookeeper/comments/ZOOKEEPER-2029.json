[How about making this as ZooKeeperCriticalThread. I'm planning to handle the exceptions of critical threads by having a special listener. This will make the server down. Please see ZOOKEEPER-1907, Attached patch, where it does {{Leader.LearnerCnxAcceptor}} thread critical. Now, on exception it will notify the listener and by default this will make the server shutdown. Please review. Thanks!, What's the point to set true here?
