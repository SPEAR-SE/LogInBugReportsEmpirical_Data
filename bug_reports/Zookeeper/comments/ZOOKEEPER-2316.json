    @hanm I think the blank line may be fine, it provides separation from the idea on the next line so it doesn't read as a single sentence.

What is the acceptable method to do code changes in pull
requests. Do, I just do another commit in my branch or do
I need to squash the two commits?, Do another commit is fine. We'll squash commits during merge time. You can also squash the commits (I usually do that to make the commit message looks more relevant and better), but that is not strictly required, up to you., +1 overall.
