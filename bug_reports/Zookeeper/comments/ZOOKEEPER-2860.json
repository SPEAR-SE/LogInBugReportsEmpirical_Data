[what's the original problem u meet  and want to deal with?, I've created kerberos account and attached several SPN to it. (this is a valid setup). However when I tried to use sample configuration from the documentation i've got "Client not found in Kerberos database" error from Kerberos. That's because server was trying to acquire TGT, which is not required. And for TGT it needs service account, not SPN.]
