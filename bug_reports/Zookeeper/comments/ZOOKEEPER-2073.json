, Thanks for the patch [~dgosselin]. I see there's 4 places where bptr needs to be free inside zookeeper_process(), maybe we should try to unify that..., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., If I'm not mistaken, I don't think that there are any other places that need to be fixed.
