This message is automatically generated., It would be good to have a test for this., Includes a test that makes sure that leader doesn't adopt a new epoch that it proposed if it didn't get a quorum of followers to ack this epoch., the new test is Zab1_0Test.testAbandonBeforeACKEpoch(). It fails without the patch and passes with the patch., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

ZOOKEEPER-1191. Synchronization issue - wait not in guarded block
ZOOKEEPER-1192. Leader.waitForEpochAck() checks waitingForNewEpoch instead of checking electionFinished, Why wasn't this committed to 3.4? This seems like something that is definitely needed for future patches to work. Specifically, I'm having quite a time with 1264 and I suspect we'll have issues with 1270/1194. We really need to get some coherence here, bugs in election logic should absolutely be going into the 3.4 branch, not just trunk., Please make sure this is put in 3.4 as well., Just merged this into 3.4 branch. Thanks Alex.]
