    I see that when we create a znode we need to check the ACL of the parent. But do we still need to check the parent when we are deleting? /cc @phunt @fpj

This message is automatically generated., this appears to be a misunderstanding of what the DELETE acl protects. CREATE and DELETE are about restricting operations on children of the znode, not the znode itself., Github user eribeiro commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/252
  
    As Ben pointed out, the docs at 
    http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.3-beta/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_ACLPermissions.
    
    state clearly that "DELETE prevents deletion of children "(like CREATE prevents the creation of children). it does not prevent the deletion of the znode itself."
    
    So, closing this PR.
