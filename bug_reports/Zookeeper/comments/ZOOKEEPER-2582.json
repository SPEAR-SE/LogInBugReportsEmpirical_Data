[It should override from later addauth details, # This is not a problem.
# In digest authentication scheme  user alone is not the id. Both user and password form the id.
so user1:pass1 and user1:pass are two different ids
# bq. addauth digest user1:<any of 2 password>, we can able to access the znode.
