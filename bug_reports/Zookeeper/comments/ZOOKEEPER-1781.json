[IMO making it work with snapCount set to 1 would be the best way to resolve this. While it's not realistic for production use it would possibly be interesting for things like testing., I make a patch for ZooKeeper 3.4.5. By reading SyncRequestProcessor.java, I found that a  random number between snapCount/2 and snapCount-1 is used. So, I added an explanation about it in the documentation. And I changed the source code to reset snapCount into 2 if it is configured to 1, because snapCount = 1 is meaningless and snapCount = 2 is the minimum for this algorism., -1 overall.
