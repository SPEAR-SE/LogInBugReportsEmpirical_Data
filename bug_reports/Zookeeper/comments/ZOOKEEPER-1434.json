[In contrast, in 3.4.3, I get

{noformat}
[zk: c0405(CONNECTED) 3] stat /foobar
Node does not exist: /foobar
{noformat}
, Patch for branch-3.3. But no test-cases., This is a tough one to make a call on. It seems that hbase is depending on this behavior (http://markmail.org/message/sih5wdim43hns7oz) , so I'm inclined not to fix it in 3.3, esp given it's already fixed in 3.4 and beyond (ZOOKEEPER-1059)]
