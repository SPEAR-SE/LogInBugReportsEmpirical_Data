[Thanks for the report, please feel free to submit a patch., I added a test in TestClient.cc testChroot function because the bug was introduced when the 'chroot' capability was added.  All the callers of prepend_string checked zh for NULL and returns ZBADARGUMENTS on NULL, but those functions call prepend_string before the zh checked for NULL; so prepend_string also needs to check for NULL., -1 overall.
