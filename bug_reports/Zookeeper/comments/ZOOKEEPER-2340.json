[Thanks [~neha.bathra] for reporting the issue. 
The problem is because bellow expression, in {{bin/zkServer.sh}}, evaluates to true for any value assigned to {{JMXDISABLE}}
{code}
if [ "x$JMXDISABLE" = "x" ]
{code}
I think to fix we can replace above expression with:
{code}
if [ "x$JMXDISABLE" = "x" ] || [ "$JMXDISABLE" = 'true' ]
{code}, I will soon submit a patch., corrected expression should be.
{code}
if [ "x$JMXDISABLE" = "x" ] || [ "$JMXDISABLE" = 'false' ]
 {code}
This case jmx will be enabled for any value other than JMXDISABLE=false, Applied:
