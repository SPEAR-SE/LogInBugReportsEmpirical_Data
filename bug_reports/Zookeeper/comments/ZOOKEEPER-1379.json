[I am submitting a simple patch to solve this annoying issue. And by the way, the indentation in the whole ZookeeperMain.java  should be fixed, but I opted for not doing this in this patch to keep it simple and to a minimum.

Best regards,
Edeward, Hi Edward, the patch looks good except that we don't use wildcards in import statements

e.g.

bq. +import java.util.*;

If you fix that I should be able to commit.

Thanks!

ps. I'm not sure what's up with the formatting, might have had tabs in there at some point and someone converted them to spaces w/o adjusting the indent. (my best guess), Hi Patrick,

Thanks for the feedback and for updating me about not using wildcard imports. I've removed them from the patch. What about including this piece of info in the wiki ( http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/HowToContribute )? It will certainly give a heads up to newbies like me. ;) 

Now I think the patch is ready to commit. :), Hi folks, any interest on commiting this patch? :), [~eribeiro], You forgot to resubmit the patch. I have just done it and if it stale, I'd like to ask you to upload a new one., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1, looks good. [~phunt], is this ready to go for you?, I am obviously biased, but i don't see any problem with this patch, it would be nice to have it merged into trunk. , This is marked for 3.4 however the patch fails to apply on branch-3.4 (applies cleanly to trunk though). I looked at fixing it but it looks like the code has changed significantly (although the same problem exists afaict). 

Please submit an additional patch specific to branch-3.4, I have attached a patch to the 3.4 branch, in addition to one that targets the trunk.

PS: If you like, I can clean up the trunk patch a little bit, I guess.

Cheers,
Edward, Please cleanup and submit the patch, Edward. Don't forget to click on "submit patch" above., Hi Fl√°vio,

I've cleaned up the trunk patch (ZOOKEEPER-1379.4.patch). I have shrink its size from 5.3 KB to 2.3 KB by getting rid of unnecessary changes in the file (mainly involving imports).

Now it's with about the same patch that should be applied to 4.6 branch (ZOOKEEPER-1379.branch-3.4.patch. 

If you or Patrick have any further demand, feel free to say. 

Best regards,
Edward, This issue have a patch for both the trunk (ZOOKEEPER-1379.4.patch) and a patch for 3.4 (ZOOKEEPER-1379.branch-3.4.patch). I didn't know what was the naming convention to a secondary patch that applies to a different branch, so excuse me if I named it wrongly.
