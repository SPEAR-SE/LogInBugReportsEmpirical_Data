[We use the txn log for durability and the updates to the zk database are written synchronously to the log before we respond to the client. Using a txn log is efficient because we only append to the log and write sequentially to the file. Snapshots are written to disk asynchronously, and are only used to speed up recovery. The "source of truth" for the state of a server is the txn log.

In your case, you just need to provision and configure your system accordingly. You could, for example, reduce the frequency of snapshotting with the {{snapCount}} parameter. You also need to make sure you have enough free space. If the device is shared, it is possible that other applications are filling it up.]
