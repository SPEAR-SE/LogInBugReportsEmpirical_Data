[Attached sheet contains the warnings present in previous 3.4.x release. Compare to the previous, we have 8 new {{Medium Priority Warnings}} - Correctness Warnings(2), Dodgy code Warnings(3), Malicious code vulnerability Warnings(3), Attached sheet contains the findbugs to be cleaned up. I've created sub-tasks for each {{Warning Type}} under this parent jira, could use respective sub-tasks for cleaning up the same., I'm adding some of the [findbugs related discussion from ZK-2712 jira|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2712?focusedCommentId=15933929&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15933929] for reference. 

Hi [~hanm], how about moving this task to 3.4.11 release ?, [~rakeshr] Sounds good to me per discussion on ZOOKEEPER-2712. I think we can start RC build for 3.4.10 on dev list and if folks have any opinion regard this matter we can discuss there., Findbugs in {{branch-3.4}} has been cleaned up completely. I'm closing this jira.

Thanks everyone for the good work!]
