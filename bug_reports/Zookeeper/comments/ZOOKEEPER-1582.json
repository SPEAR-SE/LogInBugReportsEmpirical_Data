zkCli.cmd of version 3.4.4 can't connect to zkServer.cmd of version 3.4.4, same problem in Unbuntu 12.04 server 64bit, JDK7 support with 3.4.4 was broken. It should be fixed in 3.4.5, can you retry with 3.4.5 and report the results here? thanks., 3.4.5 works fine,thanks., Resolving as a dup - fixed in 3.4.5, [~phunt] u r resolving it as duplicate of which other ticket exactly?, I believe it was ZOOKEEPER-1550 (although I primarily closed this as a dup given zhouyanming's report that the issue was tested as resolved in 3.4.5), I have the same issue in ZK 3.4.5.

, I don't think it's dup to  ZOOKEEPER-1550 since I saw the same issue in zk 3.4.5., I'm also seeing this on 3.4.6, what exactly are you seeing? this could be simply the connection to the client breaking., I see similar issue with zk3.4.5 as well. After the exception, it seems ZK is being stopped and started again. I do see that happened multiple times. 
How do I confirm if it is the client breaking the connection?

, I'm using HBase 1.1.2 which by default uses ZooKeeper 3.4.6 as the log printed as below.

My code worked well if I ran it on the same machine as the ZooKeeper installed, however, when I ran my code remotely, the same issue occurred. The logs were as followings.

I realized that the problema was a .jar file in one of my configuration folder that needed to be uploaded to ZK.
Worked around with -Djute.maxbuffer= 50000000 java option on both ZK and Solr startup command line., I ran hbase-1.2.3 with zookeeper 3.4.6 on Java 8. The problem is presented in certain time. 2016-11-10

{code}, By the way, how to configure Zookeeper in HBase?  Create a file zoo.cfg?, I think, Apache HBase mailing list is the right forum to get more details on this, please send a query to them. May be these hbase [doc1|https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#zookeeper] or [doc2|http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-5-x/topics/cdh_ig_hbase_cluster_deploy.html] can help you in setting up the env., {{EndOfStreamException}} that mentioned in your comment mostly means that your ZK client already closed the connection/socket. Probably you could look at your HBase application logs and understand ZK client log messages., I am getting the same Exception for zookeeper 3.4.10 version continuously. I have cross checked all the connection they are fine.
