[Not sure if it's related but there was a recent report of ephemeral troubles here: https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/DISTRO-448
(this is 3.4.3 with some SASL fixes, also includes ZOOKEEPER-1489), Hi Deepa, I looked at the transaction logs, afaict this is not a bug, rather the znode you mention is not deleted on session expiration because it was already explicitly deleted by another session.

I dumped the txnlog from zookeeper2, here is the section of interest. Notice that 0x23b6ad600580000 explicitly deletes /ACTIVE/192.168.11.94 prior to session 0x23b6ad21d160000 being closed:

I can see a bit later (same second, notice the zxid) 0x23b6ad600580000 goes ahead and recreates the znode:

{noformat}
12/5/12 3:33:58 AM PST session 0x23b6ad600580000 cxid 0x50bffcf0 zxid 0x800000025 create '/ACTIVE/192.168.11.94,#00004e6f6465,v{s{31,s{'world,'anyone}}},T,18
{noformat}


Is there something I'm missing here? afaict things are working properly, at least on the ZK side of things.
