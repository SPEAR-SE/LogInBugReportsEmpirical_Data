Thanks [~arshad.mohammad]!

Two nits for next time:

* use String.format() instead of concatenation
* testGetClientAddressShouldReturnEmptyStringWhenClientAddressIsNull is a bit too long of a method name, I think. Maybe something like testClientAddressIsNull() would do, given the test file is specific to a class, so there is no ambiguity. 

Thanks!, SUCCESS: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2797 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2797/])
