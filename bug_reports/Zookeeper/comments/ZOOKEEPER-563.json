[Looks like it breaks after ant clean on root, but the recipes will run if ivy downloads the files after ant test on root.  Is the right thing to integrate ivy into recipes/build.xml?
, are you sure steven? I think its still broken with the ant test on root. I am doing thing ant test; cd src/recipes/; ant test 
which seems to be broken as of now. Are you able to run this fine?
