[[~eolivelli] Don't we use it for the jute compilation?, Hi [~eolivelli], [~arshadmohammad] has started working on ZOOKEEPER-1078 so I suggest to ping him, as this ticket relates to the cited one, no?, javacc is compile time zookeeper dependency. It is used to compile jute compiler and it is not required at runtime. It is easy to separate out in maven as it already done in ZOOKEEPER-1078. I will check how it can be handled in ivy, ant. , [~arshad.mohammad]  I agree, it is enough just to exclude it from the generated pom.xml
, # javacc dependency is not something new in zookeeper-3.5.2-alpha release. it is there even in zookeeper-3.5.1-alpha and zookeeper-3.5.0-alpha releases
This dependency is required because jute compiler code is being generated in every build. jute compiler code does not already exist. 
Whether we should have it as run time dependency or not is another aspect, and not related to the concern raised in the jira
# javacc dependency is not present in zookeeper-3.4.8. It is not required because jute compiler code is not being generated every time it is checked-in

What is the problem with javacc dependency? is it causing any problem when you are using with some other project? , I saw the dep while upgrading some projects from version 3.4.x to 3.5.2.
The only problem with the dependency is that it will be redistributed together with any other project with has zookkeeper as dependency .

It is not a "real" problem, in fact I can add the exclusion while upgrading the zookeeper dependency to 3.5.x.

I was very happy that in 3.5.2 some dependencies of 3.4.8 disappeared, as jline, sun.jmx and JMS.

As "javacc" is only for build time tools IMHO it would be better to exclude it from the pom published to the Maven central






, For current build (ant/ivy) we should move it into a new, build specific, ivy "configuration". See ivy.xml for example of other dependencies we treat like this (e.g. jdiff)., GitHub user eolivelli opened a pull request:

, I have tried to do the same as for jdiff

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/76
but in the generated pom ./build/zookeeper-3.6.0-SNAPSHOT/dist-maven/zookeeper-3.6.0-SNAPSHOT.pom there are still the *jdiff* and *javacc* deps
javacc.jar is still inside the generated final tar 
, I have updated the PR with a version which removes jdiff and javacc from the final pom, Github user eolivelli commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/76
  
    Now can zookeeper accepts PRs what should I do  to make the QA bot pick this one?

This message is automatically generated., Can you include this minor issue into 3.5.3?, [~arshad.mohammad] [~phunt] [~eribeiro] [~hanm]
do you have time to review this JIRA in order to get in for 3.5.3-BETA release ?
, I will have a look today and do the needful, Github user arshadmohammad commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/116
  
    Now after this fix, javacc jar is not present in the zookeeper tar ball. So javacc.LICENSE.txt also should not be present. Can you delete javacc.LICENSE.txt from the src\java\lib and include in this MR.
