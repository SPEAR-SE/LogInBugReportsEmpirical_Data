[This patch updates the forrest doc to correctly discuss watch re-establishment during re-sync to a server in the cluster., I just committed this. Thanks Pat., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #212 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/212/])
    . documentation of DataWatcher state transition is misleading regarding auto watch reset on reconnect. (phunt via mahadev)
