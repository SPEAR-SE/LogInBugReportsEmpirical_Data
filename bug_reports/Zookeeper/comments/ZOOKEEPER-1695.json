[Found this when doing a rebase for ZOOKEEPER-1147. One of the error code will also conflicted with we added in that patch as well if the existing codes are declared correctly. , [~shralex] can we get a patch to address this? seems trivial to fix now, save headache later. Thanks., You mean the fact that the error number is > 100 ? I don't think that the numeric value of the error has any significance, is this described anywhere ? For example EphemeralOnLocalSession was just added after reconfig errors with the value 122. 

The comment there says

 /** This interface contains the original static final int constants
     * which have now been replaced with an enumeration in Code. 
 , should this really be a blocker ? Thawan, Patrick, can you please clarify why you think this is a problem (see my previous comment) ?, I think the system errors are supposed to have values greater than -100. I'll upload a patch., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~michim],
Can we move up the following err sequence numbers, as we are moving 'ZNEWCONFIGNOQUORUM = -120  and ZRECONFIGINPROGRESS = -121' to system errors ?
{code}
  ZEPHEMERALONLOCALSESSION = -122, /*!< Attempt to create ephemeral node on a local session */
  ZNOWATCHER = -123 /*!< The watcher couldn't be found */
{code}, Move up EphemeralOnLocalSession to -119., -119 is already used by NOTREADONLY. We have few set of KeeperException.Codes defined without adding entry to CodeDeprecated interface.
{code}
        /** Session moved to another server, so operation is ignored */
        SESSIONMOVED (-118),
        /** State-changing request is passed to read-only server */
        NOTREADONLY (-119),
        /** Attempts to remove a non-existing watcher */
        NOWATCHER (-123);
{code}, Oops I didn't realize that. I'll move it to -120., Move EphemeralOnLocalSession to -120., I forgot to tell one more, in java we missed NOWATCHER, its still -123., please modify to -121. To avoid confusion, should we have entry in CodeDeprecated interface too eventhough its deprecated ?, Move NOWATCHER to -121., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
