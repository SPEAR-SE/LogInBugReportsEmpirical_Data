>  the server does not match with the serverid

which server ? the new one ? I don't really understand what you mean here. Could you paste here the configuration file of the new server, and its myid. But essentially, the server is only supposed to make sure that myid appears in the configuration file (when booting), not much more than that. What check would you expect ?]
