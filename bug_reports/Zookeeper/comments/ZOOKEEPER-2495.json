[[~ramanala]: out of curiosity, using what filesystem did this happen with? , [~rgs] : I did not reproduce this issue on any particular file system. I have a small testing tool that drives applications into such corner cases by simulating possible error conditions. In reality, ENOSPC and EDQUOT can be encountered in all modern file systems such as ext4. EIO can be thrown to applications if the file system is mounted in a synchronous mode.
