I'm a bit worried about the test failure though. I'm sure it's not related to this patch, but maybe it's related to the remove-watch feature?, trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1588584
branch-3.4: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1588585, Thanks for the fast reply, [~michim]. I think the failure:

{noformat}
src/c/tests/TestWatchers.cc:667: Assertion: assertion failed [Expression: ensureCondition( deliveryTracker.deliveryCounterEquals(2),1000)<1000]
{noformat}

is related to old code (i.e.: the test case is testNodeWatcher1, which is old). Also, in my setup those tests fail very often due to missed timeouts mostly.  , Ok, I opened a JIRA for this test failure.
