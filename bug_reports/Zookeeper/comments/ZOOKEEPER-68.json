[Changes second call to indexOf to lastIndexOf, the patch seems fine but not generated from the trunk. you should do an svn diff from the top level directory. I created a patch thats from the trunk and uploaded it., I just committed this to trunk. Thanks Jakob., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #16 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/16/]), 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
