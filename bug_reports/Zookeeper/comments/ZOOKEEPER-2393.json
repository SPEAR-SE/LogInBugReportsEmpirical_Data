This message is automatically generated., [~arshad.mohammad], thank you for putting this patch together quickly.  Thank you also for updating the license information.  I tested this successfully by building a distro tarball.  I verified that both server and client produce logs as expected out of the box, without additional deployment steps for an SLF4J binding.

In zookeeperAdmin.xml, we have 3 remaining references to 1.2.16 in some sample classpath settings.  Could you please update those to 1.2.17?, Thanks [~cnauroth], Submitting new patch, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. From build build #3108 java version "1.8.0_66" is used instead of java version "1.7.0_80". So java doc warnings are not because of this patch

That's strange.  I can't figure out what would have caused this.  I tried submitting another pre-commit run manually, and the same thing happened.  It was even on a different Jenkins host.  I have started a thread on the dev list to discuss this.

I confirmed locally that the patch does not introduce new JavaDoc warnings.

+1.  I'll commit this shortly.
, [~arshad.mohammad], thank you for the patch.  I have committed this to trunk and branch-3.5.

I was unable to complete the doc update on branch-3.5 due to ZOOKEEPER-2364.  The docs will get a full refresh after we fix that one., FAILURE: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2858 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2858/])
