    ZOOKEEPER-2690: Update documentation source for ZOOKEEPER-2574

    ZOOKEEPER-2690: Update documentation source for ZOOKEEPER-2574
    
    Added the documentation changes from PR https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/111/ to the source (zookeeperAdmin.xml) and generated the new version of the html and pdf documents.
    
    Note: I have not updated the 2nd paragraph from ZOOKEEPER-2574 as change "ZOOKEEPER-2349: Update documentation for snapCount" has a more recent version of that part of the text. (ZOOKEEPER-2349 was committed on Sep 11, 2017 while ZOOKEEPER-2574 was committed on Jan 23, 2017.)
