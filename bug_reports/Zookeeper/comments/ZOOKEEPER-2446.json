[It's weird... because I took a look and the {{ivi:makepom}} tasks uses a template file with the {{<license/>}} hardcoded there: https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/pom.template#L35 , Definitely that template is not being used... the generated {{pom.xml}} files also miss some other fields, such as {{<description/>}} or {{<url/>}}., Thanks [~wikier] for reporting this issue. I wonder if we need a license header since it is a generated file. We can definitely update the fields you're suggesting, do you want to take a crack at it?, Well, license header would be something else. What I'm reporting here is the lack of license field in the {{pom.xml}}: https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Licenses That field is used in Maven to declare the license of the artifact. 

As I said, it's weird, because it is already in the custom template: https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/pom.template#L35 So I guess the actual source of the issue is that the custom template is not being used by the {{ivi:makepom}} Ant tasks., Ah, I see. I thought we had solved it in ZOOKEEPER-2373, is it where we broke it?, Right, then this duplicates ZOOKEEPER-2373. I reported it because I didn't see any current snapshot pushed to https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/zookeeper/zookeeper/ with that issue fixed.]
