[This patch has the content mentioned in the JIRA, plus supporting sample code files:
DataMonitor.java (for the java example)
Executor.java (for the java example)
SyncPrimitive.java (for the tutorial)

I put all the sample Java source into resources/images only because the build system creates the links to them from the output html correctly. There might be a better place, if anyone is familiar with the build system. 

Also, this patch contains an image file
2pc.png

site.xml and index.xml contain updates so that they point to the new files.

There is a change in skinconf.xml to beautify program listings.

Finally, some changes to zookeeperAdmin.xml, since one of the sections from the source forge zookeeperLogging content is actually more appropriate for an admins guide than for an internals guide. , It would be great if we could inline the src examples rather than pointing to resources/images.

Also the patch fails to validate when running forrest.

[exec] /home/phunt/dev/workspace/gitzk_svn/src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/javaExample.xml:81:24: The content of element type "para" must match "(footnoteref|xref|abbrev|acronym|citetitle|emphasis|footnote|phrase|quote|trademark|link|ulink|command|computeroutput|email|filename|literal|option|replaceable|systemitem|userinput|inlinemediaobject)".
, This patch fixes the above problems:

-inlines the example source code
-vailidates correctly

Also, this patch catches in its net a couple of instances of converting computerout sdoc tags to programlisting tags, this goes here
