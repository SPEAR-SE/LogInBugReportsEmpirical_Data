[I am attaching a patch to solve the issue, but I think we still think further if the interesting additional questions raised by Tally should be addressed., I think this patch would be a nice addition, but it is still subject to further discussion as it removes a previously thrown exception (UnknownHostException), effectively modifying the method signature. Plus, Tally comments are very insightful. Is it the best strategy? What do you think?

This message is automatically generated., I'm looking at this, but is this for 3.5 or 3.4?, I am really sorry for the mess up, Camille, but it's for 3.4. :( I'll fix this now. 

PS: I can't figure it now why it's not applying to trunk anymore because I am not able to checkout and work on zookeeper now, so I'll only be able to see the problem at home. :(, The previous patches 1 and 2 don't apply to trunk anymore. A new version is attached., This looks to apply to trunk, but not 3.4. Do you want this patch on both branches?, Um... I was planning only on latest release (3.4.6) or even later (3.5) if you decide so. I'll take a look at 3.4 branch tough. Previous patches failed due to a merge conflict. OTOH, branch 3.4 should be very different from the trunk, right? I can take a look at it, tough., Trunk only is fine, but then we need to change the tags to 3.5 instead of 3.4.6. Up to you., Okay. I've just changed to 3.5.0. Thanks., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

spaces between != and (possibly) you can drop the parentheses around `ia != null`.

long lines — make 'em < 80 maybe?

{noformat}
+            LOG.error("Unable to connect to server (UnknowHostException): " + address);

{} is preferred to string concatenation, so:

{noformat}

{noformat}

{noformat}
+    public boolean updateServerList(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses, InetSocketAddress currentHost) {

line too long.

{noformat}
+	boolean updateServerList(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses, InetSocketAddress currentHost);
{noformat}

ditto.

, tl;dr: new version of the patch, addressing the [~rgs] suggestions 

Hi [~rgs], thank you very much for your suggestions! Sorry for the delay, I have been reading [~fpj] and [~breed]'s ZooKeeper book during the last two days. ;) 

Well, I've addressed them as far as I could. Unfortunately, I couldn't remove the visibility operator (public) from updateListServer() because it breaks code elsewhere, but I tried to reduce the line sizes of the parts affected by the patch as much as I could while minimizing change. They still overflow the 80 lines, but by a small range this time. If you have further ideas, please let me know. :)

Best regards,
Edward, Hi [~eribeiro],

thanks for updating the patch. For things like:

{noformat}
+    public StaticHostProvider(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses, long randomnessSeed) {
{noformat}

you could move some params to the next line (and indent w/ 8 spaces from the start of the upper line - note that JIRA might indent it funnily), i.e.:

{noformat}
+    public StaticHostProvider(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses,
+                long randomnessSeed) {
{noformat}

Some more nits:

{noformat}
+               // the hostName is an literal IP address. Then we can set the host string as the hostname
{noformat}

*is a literal IP address.

{noformat}
+             // Both the two implementations of InetAddress are final class, so we can trust the return value of
{noformat}

*Both implementations of InetAddress are final classes, ...

In:

{noformat}
+            LOG.error("(UnknowHostException) Unable to connect to server: {}", address);
{noformat}

I wonder if instead of pre-pending `(UnknowHostException)` we should just append the exception, i.e.:

{noformat}
+            LOG.error("Unable to connect to server: {}: {}", address, e);
{noformat}

maybe this is more informative?

In:

{noformat}
+    public boolean updateServerList(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses, 
+                                    InetSocketAddress currentHost) { 
{noformat}

it seems the indentation for the wrapped parameter is more than it should be. Maybe (8 spaces after the identifier from above):

{noformat}
+    public boolean updateServerList(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses, 
+                InetSocketAddress currentHost) { 
{noformat}

?

In:

{noformat}
+	boolean updateServerList(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses, InetSocketAddress currentHost);
{noformat}

maybe:

{noformat}
+	boolean updateServerList(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses,
+                    InetSocketAddress currentHost);
{noformat}

Any idea what has gone wrong?, Probably nothing to do with your patch.
Can we keep the trivial formatting code reviews to a minimum please, [~rgs]? I really don't think reformatting everything this patch touches just because it happens to touch it is a good practice in general., Unfortunately [~eribeiro], this fails when I run it on my mac on the two tests you added... are you sure this works on all platforms?, Sure [~fournc] - but tbh requesting minimum formatting diligence (i.e.: spelling, indentation and consistency) on every + line (not the context ones) isn't trivial formatting but just basic sanity. Sadly, many patches don't have it which makes it very hard for people testing patches that haven't been committed yet, testing trunk, etc. Being able to read through those — and related — patches fast  and without losing focus because of inconsistent style really helps when testing stuff.

It would certainly have helped me when finding bugs like ZOOKEEPER-1805 and ZOOKEEPER-1807 for which I had to read through a lot of code with mixed styles or no style at all :(, [~fournc] Really?! What a pity. :( I didn't check on mac, but will do as soon as possible (I am not a mac user tbh). Thanks for pointing out. I will reevaluate the tests., Patch for 3.4, Hello, I adapted the existing patch for 3.4.
