[Cloned issue to allow me to attach patch., Hey [~fittey], thanks for taking a stab at this issue. But cloning an issue is not the way we work here, AFAIK. 

First, we are switching to a Github based workflow, so you can clone the ZK repo from GH, make the changes in your branch and then submit as a PR to ZK at GH. So, attaching is not even required anymore. More details here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/HowToContribute

Second, it would be nice if you could sync with the current  ZOOKEEPER-2230 assignee so that you can discuss and decide for a solution that covers both cases. In any case, the committers will have the final word and can decide what could fits bets to merge.

So, no need yet another JIRA issue to address the same problem. Please, close this one and discuss your solution (pinging committers if necessary) at  ZOOKEEPER-2230. 

Best Regards!, OK, thx. I've done a PR on ZOOKEEPER-2230. Closing this., Duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-2230]
