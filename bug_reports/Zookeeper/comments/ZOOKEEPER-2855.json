[Thanks Jeffrey for finding this issue. 

Looking at the code and the steps you wrote down, it seems that we're not doing the right thing when processing the packetsCommitted:

for(Long zxid: packetsCommitted) {
   fzk.commit(zxid);
}

This isn't doing any reconfig related processing, which should be similar to what's done when a COMMIT_AND_ACTIVATE is received.


,   I encountered the same problem.  I have 3 nodes, and 4th node add as observer.  I use zkCli.sh reconfig command add success.
but the files of  4th node's conf dir is here:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root staff  535 Oct 30 20:12 configuration.xsl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root staff 2717 Oct 30 20:12 log4j.properties
-rw-r--r-- 1 root staff  268 Oct 30 20:12 zoo.cfg
-rw-r--r-- 1 root staff  253 Oct 30 20:12 zoo.cfg.dynamic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root staff  197 Oct 30 20:12 zoo.cfg.dynamic.10000066d
-rw-r--r-- 1 root staff  278 Oct 30 20:12 zoo.cfg.dynamic.next

In some reason, i can't upload the debug log. ]
