[Thanks for reporting [~abutala]. That test, testLastZxid, wasn't waiting for the client to be connected so the test was racy. I changed it such that it uses createClient() as all other tests do. I also removed the calls to zookeeper_close() since most other tests don't clean up anyway. 

It passes now.

Thank you for the patch Raul. I'll check this in, but I'd like to keep the zookeeper_close calls. I agree most test cases don't do cleanups, but they really should :), http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1576961, FAILURE: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2246 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2246/])

, bq. Ok so zookeeper_close is hanging. I'll revert the commit.

Hmmm, weird. I'll look into it. , Oh, it's fine not to call zookeeper_close() because it is being called already by the destructor of the watchCtx:

{noformat}
    ~watchCtx() {
        if (zh) {
            zookeeper_close(zh);
            zh = 0;
        }
    }
{noformat}

Calling it again apparently causes the hangs you are seeing..., I see that makes sense. I'll commit your original patch., trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1577317, SUCCESS: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2251 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2251/])
