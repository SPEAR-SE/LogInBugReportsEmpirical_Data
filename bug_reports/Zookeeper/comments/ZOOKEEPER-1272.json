[related to this bug:
The multi case in DataTree.processTxn sets rc.err. However in the FinalRequestProcessor the value of rc.err is not copied to err. I didn't notice this when refactoring...
So rc.err should not be set in the first place., It should throw an exception if the error code != 0, but the exception it throws must be the exception of the failing op that caused the multi-op to fail., Sorry Marshall, what do you want to express? Do you agree, that the following changes should be made:

- remove code that sets rc.err in DataTree.processTxn
- remove code that conditionally throws an Exception in ZooKeeper.multiInternal() if return value of cnxn.sendRequest != 0, I'll need to take some time to look at the code in question... hopefully later tonight and then i'll get back to you.]
