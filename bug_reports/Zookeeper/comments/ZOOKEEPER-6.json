[Andrew could you take a look at this one?, Addressed the changed detailed in this JIRA re the extern constants. I didn't change the jute - don't think this is a good idea, esp as also effects the java. Should be limited exposure since jute naming starts with caps.

Also fixed a problem in zkfuse where previous changes to c client code were not reflected there (ie context passed to watcher).
