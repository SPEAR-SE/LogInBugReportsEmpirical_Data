This message is automatically generated., [~hdeng] is this not an issue in trunk as well? How does the NOTICE file differ in trunk vs the file on the branch?, [~phunt] The trunk branch has a different "NOTICE.txt"., With your patch applied to branch-3.4 are they the same?, [~phunt] They are not the same. The version in the trunk has the author's license. I am not sure whether I should put this in branch-3.4.
I think so far this will fix the incompatibility with ".gitattributes"., That resolved the issue for me in git - thanks Hongchao!]
