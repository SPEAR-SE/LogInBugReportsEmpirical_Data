    @achimbab Thanks for the patch.
    
    I'm wondering if you ran into this bug while running ZooKeeper? This code is pretty old and should never actually be executed (for reasons described here: https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/461/files#diff-e08c1cfd3802a0c3156847175ab8e24bR514). 
    
    I would be happy to merge in this fix but please rename the JIRA and the pull request to something more descriptive (as I do not have permissions to change the name of a Pull Request). Something like "fix potential null pointer exception when deleting node".

    @afine 
    No, I didn't run into this bug.
    I'm renamed the JIRA, the pull request and the commit message.
    Thank you.
