[this seems to happen on my 3.2 branch as well (consitently).... Ill post the logs from the test.... , the test times out after printing just a few lines., Since I cannot reproduce, I tried to come up with an explanation for the failure of this test. I suspect that due to timing, one cnx manager tried to connect to the other before the other was available to receive connections. Consequently, the patch I propose retries to connect a number of times. It also times out itself instead of waiting for junit to kill it. , +1 the patch passes the tests for me... tahnks flavio ... ,
