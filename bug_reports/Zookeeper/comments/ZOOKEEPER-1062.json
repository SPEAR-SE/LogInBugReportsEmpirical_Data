This message is automatically generated., It is very complicated to write a proper unit test. I am not sure that it worth the effort so I am skipping that., Thanks for the patch Botond, it looks good to me overall. I have 2 comments:

- Replace tabs with spaces.
- The code to check if end_timeval is smaller than or equal to curr_timeval could be written more compactly like this:

{noformat}
+            if (end_timeval.tv_sec < curr_timeval.tv_sec ||
+                (end_timeval.tv_sec == curr_timeval.tv_sec &&
+                 end_timeval.tv_usec <= curr_timeval.tv_usec)) {
{noformat}, Removed tabs.
Simplified condition check, +1 Thanks Botond!, trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1595374
