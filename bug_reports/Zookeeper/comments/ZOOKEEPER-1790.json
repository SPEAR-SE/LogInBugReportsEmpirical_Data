[I misunderstood the code - there may not be a problem after all.

            if (sid == QuorumPeer.OBSERVER_ID) {
                /*
                 * Choose identifier at random. We need a value to identify
                 * the connection.
                 */
                
                sid = observerCounter--;
 
Where OBSERVER_ID = Long.MAX_VALUE and observerCounter is initially -1.
So seems that the first thing being sent is a positive number, whereas the newly introduced protocol numbers are negative, so everything seems ok.

Frankly I don't fully understand how these type of observers are connecting. I don't see any tests or any other code besides above using OBSERVER_ID.

Closing this for now, if anyone sees a problem please reopen.

, In our internal deployment, we use negative sid to for observers  (actually all of them is -1) . This is probably not the intended usage but it worked so far.  It would be nice to add to release note of 3.5 if there is a change in the valid sid range. , I was wondering if this has anything to do with ZOOKEEPER-1807., [~fpj]: I don't think it's related - my initial assessment was wrong. It isn't connection attempts that generate the extra traffic I am seeing but the Notifications (as commented in ZOOKEEPER-1807). , The problem described in this JIRA turned out not be a problem as I mention in the first comment.

[~thawan], I'm actually not sure if -1 would work or not - there aren't any tests for this in 3.4 or 3.5. I can't think of anything specific 
that changed that would prevent it from working, but I may be wrong. As you pointed out you wouldn't be able to dynamically change
the parameters of such observers., Closing issues after releasing 3.4.6.]
