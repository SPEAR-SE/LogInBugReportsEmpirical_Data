This message is automatically generated., +1 from me, tests don't need to be included as there are no functional changes (compiler would pick up any problems). We are a bit inconsistent about when we initialise inline in the class, and when we initialise in the constructor, but that's not for this patch to fix. 

Will (attempt to) commit shortly. 

, I just committed this (svn revision 889843). Thanks Patrick!
