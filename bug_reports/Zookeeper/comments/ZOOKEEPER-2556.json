[Thanks for reporting this! Removing this from static config seems like a one-line change in editStaticConfig (QuorumPeerConfig.java). There's a bunch of parameters that are already being removed, so you can just add it there., [~shralex]Thanks for feedback. , [~shralex] Do i need to add testcase for this change.?, I think so, but take a look at testReconfigRemoveClientFromStatic in src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/ReconfigLegacyTest.java
I think its pretty close to what you need. Maybe just change and rename that test
to include all the parameters removed from static config., Thank you [~shralex] :), pls review, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Pls review and commit if looks fine., Hi, thanks for the patch! I have only one suggestion.
Instead of a new separate test for peerType, perhaps you could add a few more lines to one of the existing tests. Looking at this again perhaps the best one would be testConfigFileBackwardCompatibility() where it already checks that "server." and "clientPort" are being removed, you could add that "peerType" is also being removed.

Alex, Thanks for feedback, changed based on feedback., looks good, but I think the check that peerType is not in cfg shouldn't be in the inner loop., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

[~hanm], [~breed], would you guys be able to commit this ? I still need to learn the new git procedure :), [~shralex] I don't have write access :-) Also one suggestion - given that we have git merge script integrated in the repo maybe [~rakeshsingh] should create a PR for ZOOKEEPER-2556 and then a committer can merge the PR. The benefit of committing through PR is the contributors get their credit in commit history, i.e. see [this|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/commit/f6349d16fcd5f04b560095417fd2a1813ac3e855]. , Committed. Thanks again Rakesh!, FAILURE: Integrated in Jenkins build ZooKeeper-trunk #3142 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/3142/])
