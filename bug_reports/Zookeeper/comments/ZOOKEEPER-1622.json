[I haven't checked if the 40th bit will be set only by 2022, but otherwise the change seems good to me, nice catch. I guess we just missed the opportunity of having the equivalent of the Y2K bug for zookeeper in 2022. ;-), Nice catch Eric! I think we do document that id be between 0 and 255 but maybe we should error out if that is not the case.
