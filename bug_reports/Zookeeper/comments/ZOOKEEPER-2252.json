{noformat}, As per the logic test case expectation can be met only if java.net.UnknownHostException is thrown for both invalid host "a" and invalid host "b". But above test run log shows that UnknownHostException is thrown only for "a". 

If we can figure out how invalid host "b" some time becomes valid, may be we can find root cause., any thoughts?, The test passes locally ({{ant -Dtestcase=StaticHostProviderTest -Dtest.method=testTwoInvalidHostAddresses -Dtest.output=yes test-core-java}}).

I attach this patch to the JIRA ticket so as to print some debug information on Jenkins.


Maybe misconfiguration of Jenkins host?


, I attached the patch 4 hours ago, but Jenkins seems not triggered.
How can we trigger Jenkins?
, It is not triggered because you have uploaded patch file but not submitted patch. I submitted your patch, Thank you, but still not triggered?
, Not sure why not triggering. let me give one more try, renamed and submitted the patch again, Hmm, no idea why things got stuck. I've trigger rebuild of trunk and trunk-openjdk7:

https://builds.apache.org/view/All/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2791/
https://builds.apache.org/view/All/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-openjdk7/907/

Lets see if that gets things going.

[~suda]: could you re-upload & re-submit the patch when (if?) the above builds finish? Thanks!, Sure.

This message is automatically generated., In one of our test environment this test case is failing because host name "a" is resolved to a valid host, as per the test case assumption host "a" is an invalid host. I think this is the reason everywhere for this test case failure.
So if we change the host name in test case from "a" to some thing which would really be an invalid host then the test will not fail., changed the host name to invalidHost1 which i am quite sure will not resolved as an valid host., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~arshad.mohammad]. Are you still debugging this in CI or is that patch ready to be merged?, This patch is ready for merge., My reported issue ZOOKEEPER-2337 has been closed as a duplicate of this issue, but I notice that the proposed fix here uses another hostname that may or may not be valid on the machine doing the build.

I created a GitHub pull request here: https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/48 which uses syntactically invalid hostnames. These can never be valid on any system, but still have the correct behaviour for the tests. This is much safer than trying to guess a syntactically valid hostname that isn't resolvable on any machine in the universe., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The test failure was in TestReconfig.cc.  This has been a flaky test, so the failure is unrelated to this patch.

I don't understand why this reported a release audit warning.  The patch doesn't create any new files that need a license header applied.  The audit output file is missing from Jenkins.  This can't be related to the patch.  I ran the release audit check locally, and it was fine.

I will wait until Thursday, 12/10, to commit this, in case [~rgs] or any other committers would like to review., [~cnauroth]: lgtm, please apply. Thanks!, I have committed this to trunk and branch-3.5  [~timothyjward], thank you for the patch., FAILURE: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2827 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2827/])
