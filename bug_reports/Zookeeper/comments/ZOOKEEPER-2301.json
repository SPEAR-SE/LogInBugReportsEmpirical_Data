Mind taking a look?, (also, there's some extra white space and tabs.. you can see them via git diff --color-words ...), Thanks [~rgs] for your review comment.  Compilation error in previous patch was because of {{QuorumPeerTest}} was added in java\main instead of java\test folder. Corrected the errors submitting new patch, Applied:
