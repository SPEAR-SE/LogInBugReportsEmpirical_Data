[[~jlord] Looks like, since ZOOKEEPER-1012, we currently prioritize the server JVM_FLAGS. 
{code}
"$JAVA" "-Dzookeeper.log.dir=${ZOO_LOG_DIR}" "-Dzookeeper.root.logger=${ZOO_LOG4J_PROP}" "-Dzookeeper.log.file=${ZOO_LOG_FILE}" \
     -cp "$CLASSPATH" $CLIENT_JVMFLAGS $JVMFLAGS \
     org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeperMain "$@"
{code}
Note: My testing seems to indicate that HotSpot prioritizes the leftmost params. Let me know if you can find hard documented evidence that we can always expect this behavior. 

While I think completely removing JVMFLAGS from the client may be inconvenient for some, the current order seems backwards to me. 

What do you think [~jlord] [~hanm]?]
