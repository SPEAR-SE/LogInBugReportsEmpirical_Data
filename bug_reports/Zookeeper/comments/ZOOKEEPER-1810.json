[W.r.t. zk-107 the change in message format was the additional configuration fiend in notifications, which 
is assumed to be at the end. Then there are the new backwardCompatibility flag

                        // ZK-107 sends the configuration info in every message.
                        // So messages are 36 bytes + size of configuration info 
                        // (variable length, shoulld be at the end of the message).
                        boolean backCompatibility36 = (response.buffer.capacity() == 36);

which need to be adjusted because now we may have the version so the size without config may be bigger.

Instead of this flag perhaps we could just check the size to determine that there's a version, and then use the version to see if the message has a config field. Also perhaps it would be cleaner to have a config size field before the config field,so that we get rid of the assumption that config must be last in the message, which makes it more difficult to extend.

This message is automatically generated., This is strange. There is a new findbugs warning about the constructor of class Messenger in FastLeaderElection, but there were no changes in that constructor.
And I think the core tests complains about the tests that have been moved from package org.apache.zookeeper.test to org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum., I think that:

{noformat}
+                                if(LOG.isInfoEnabled()){
+                                    LOG.info("Backward compatibility mode (36 bits), server id: " + response.sid);
+                                }
{noformat}

can do without the LOG.isInfoEnabled since it's already called by LOG.info and response.sid isn't computed (just a value accessed, so no savings).
, Extra newline in:

{noformat}
+public class FLELostMessageTest extends ZKTestCase {
+    protected static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FLELostMessageTest.class);
+
+
+    int count;
{noformat}

Super nit in src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/FLEBackwardElectionRoundTest.java:

{noformat}
+        cnxManagers[0].toSend(0l, FLETestUtils.createMsg(ServerState.FOLLOWING.ordinal(), 0, 0, 1));
{noformat}

if the same Msg is created again and again, can't we just create it once and reuse?

In :
{noformat}
+                            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
+                                LOG.debug("Receive new notification message. My id = "
+                                        + self.getId());
+                            }
{noformat}

no need for LOG.isDebugEnabled., Thank you for the comments [~rgs]!
I will do the clean up.
I don't know what you mean with the "Super nit" in:
bq. Super nit in src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/FLEBackwardElectionRoundTest.java:
Is it that the line is too long?, Ok, now I get it. I thought the next line belonged to the next comment., Yeah - sorry that was a bit confusing. I guess - if it isn't too much of a hassle - reviewboards to make things a bit easier., (I meant for future patches - we can keep on going with this one inside the ticket if it's easier.), I think this covers the comments from [~rgs] and findbug warning issue.
Regarding "isDebugEnabled", my understanding is that this is required for points in which there could be a drop in performance, but it doesn't make a big difference in other points. I have understood also that there is a preference for using "{}" in the logs instead of concatenating strings., Some style changes.
