This message is automatically generated., Hi - sorry to assign this back to you.  I added the updated file as a patch.  However, the system wasn't all that pleased :).   I'm not 100% sure this code even exists in the code base anywhere, so there isn't something to "patch" in a traditional sense.  Rather, the website itself that contains this code needs to be updated...., Hey Joe. No worries. I think what you intend is to update this file:

src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/zookeeperTutorial.xml

The easiest way to do this is 
1) svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/zookeeper/trunk
2) edit the tutorial
3) svn diff > ZOOKEEPER-1418.patch
(from within the trunk directory)
4) attach that file here

can you give that a try? If you run into trouble just lmk. Appreciate you sticking with it. Regards., First attempt was bad/incorrect.  I'll submit a new (hopefully better/correct) one.]
