Actually this verification point is missing many times. Just tried one sample script to verify the line endings:
{code}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if awk  '/\r$/{exit 0;} 1{exit 1;}' DynamicConfigBackwardCompatibilityTest.java
then
  echo "is DOS"
fi

if [[ "$(head -1 DynamicConfigBackwardCompatibilityTest.java)" == *$'\r' ]]; then echo DOS; fi
{code}, Fixed in ZOOKEEPER-1992]
