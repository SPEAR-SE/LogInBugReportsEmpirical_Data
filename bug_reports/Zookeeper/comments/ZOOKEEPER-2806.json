    ZOOKEEPER-2806: Flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.FLEBackwardElectionRoundTest.testBackwardElectionRound

    Here is an example of a test failure: https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper_branch34_jdk8/1016/testReport/org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum/FLEBackwardElectionRoundTest/testBackwardElectionRound/
    
    This flaky test is caused by the reuse of a `ByteBuffer` object between `QuorumCnxManager`s. 
    
    When sending a `ByteBuffer` we reset its position first:
    
    ```
            synchronized void send(ByteBuffer b) throws IOException {
                byte[] msgBytes = new byte[b.capacity()];
                try {
                    b.position(0);
                    b.get(msgBytes);
                } catch (BufferUnderflowException be) {
                    LOG.error("BufferUnderflowException ", be);
                    return;
                }
                dout.writeInt(b.capacity());
                dout.write(b.array());
                dout.flush();
            }
    ```
    
    `b.get(msgBytes);` changes the position of the `ByteBuffer`. So we can have a race here that results in a `BufferUnderflowException` causing a message never to be sent and this test to fail. 
    
    The fix is to create a new `ByteBuffer` for each message we send in the test.
