[this is a preleminary patch that introduces a stat structure just for the client. This breaks all the client api's that use Stat. This does not have changes to the tests and other examples in this patch. I am still testing and making changes to the tests and examples., I think the patch would be simpler and we would avoid breaking the client API if we kept Stat for clients and added the size and # of children and then used InternalStat for the current Stat structure., true!! thats what i thought initially -- but then I thought that its better to explicitly break the api and let the users know that something has changed so that there applications do not implicitly break (compiling no error but then malloc or something you would get problems)... not sure... , Updated per Ben's suggestion, added tests and updated docs.

There is still a user Stat which now contains the 2 additional fields, there is also now a StatPersisted which is the information persisted to disk by the server.
, Submitting patch, questionable whether this is incompatible, but marking it as such so that we are sure to document in the release notes.
, the cnage looks good ..... is it possible to add some tests in the c test code? (since this marks an api change in c client as well) , Sure, I'll look at cppunit that we already have and see what we can do., I looked at the c tests and they are all mock based. I'll open another jira for the c tests - that we should have tests that run against actual java server.

Resubmitting this patch.
, this patch no longer applies after ZOOKEEPER-38 :). pat can you update the patch?, Updated to resolve conflict w/ latest code in svn.
