[I met this problem too, while i use open ssl capability on zookeeper server and zookeeper client. while i close ssl capability and will not cause this problem.

you can modify source of BinaryInputArchive like below and find what

public String readString(String tag) throws IOException {
 int len = in.readInt();
 if (len == -1) return null; 
 
 checkLength(len);
 byte b[] = new byte[len];
 in.readFully(b); 
 String tobeReturnString = new String(b, "UTF8");
 LOG.info("####################Just readString String's lengh="+len+" and this string is:"+tobeReturnString);
 
 return tobeReturnString;
 }
 
 static public final int maxBuffer = Integer.getInteger("jute.maxbuffer", 0xfffff);

public byte[] readBuffer(String tag) throws IOException {
 int len = readInt(tag);
 if (len == -1) return null;
 checkLength(len);
 byte[] arr = new byte[len];
 in.readFully(arr); 
 String tobeReturnString = new String(arr, "UTF8");
 LOG.info("####################Just readBuffer String's lengh="+len+" and this string is:"+tobeReturnString);
 return arr;
 }, 你好，我这边的zookeeper，是偶现shutdown，你遇到的也是吗？

这个问题的触发条件是什么啊？如何能够复现？, Me too!. I met OutOfMemory error cause zookeeper shutdown. but you can add crontab task to restart zookeeper to resolve this issue. 

Of course, you should insure that zookeeper client jar has same version with zookeeper server firstly.,  I met OutOfMemory error cause zookeeper shutdown. and restart not ok.

   1.   Maybe the client write too much too the ZooKeeper, which bigger than the  jute.maxbuffer

  

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2101    Transaction larger than max buffer of jute makes zookeeper unavailable

 , Yes, that is one reason and easy to resolve. But i know that even if i send  length of data just no more than one hundred byte, once enabled ssl capability, several hours later, just zookeeper leader node will get this exception.
