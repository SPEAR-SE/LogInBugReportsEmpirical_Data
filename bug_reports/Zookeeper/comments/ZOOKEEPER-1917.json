[This is what I get when using this setAcl command with the cli:

{noformat}
setAcl /test-acl digest:super:/qrRr7/v21dMo0iDVdd2lttJEyw=:cdrwa
{noformat}

First, what goes into the transaction log and I extract with logformatter:

{noformat}
23/04/14 11:28:26 BST session 0x1458e0f5a130001 cxid 0xd zxid 0x1f setACL '/test-acl,v{s{31,s{'digest,'super:/qrRr7/v21dMo0iDVdd2lttJEyw=}}},1
{noformat}

I also get this log message, but the encoding seems to be incorrect:

{noformat}
2014-04-23 11:28:26,120 [myid:] - DEBUG [ProcessThread(sid:0 
cport:-1)::PrepRequestProcessor@305] - Client credentials: ['ip,'127.0.0.1
, 'digest,'super:Aayiuo6ORq4pteRsUdo6sM7mmf4=

, I took a stab at optionally encrypting snapshots and txn logs at rest in ZOOKEEPER-1688. The patch on that issue worked with 3.4 in the lab. I would say it's at the 'discussion starter' phase., Thanks for pointing it out, [~apurtell]. It sounds like a great feature to have. We might still want to try a fix without full encryption, though. , I asked for more details on the original bug and got an email from Red Hat Security Response Team.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1067265

The original bug is *not* about ACL password. Some applications use ZooKeeper to store their passwords (like in a znode "/my/password"), and the transaction log files are not encrypted, so if you have read permission, you can see the password stored in the znode. Their fix is to encrypt the password before storing it in ZooKeeper., That's pretty weird... So if someone stores their social security number or credit card number then we should request a CVE entry is created?

Putting the reason behind the report aside, it sounds like a good idea not to store the password hash as is. [~andrew.purtell@gmail.com]'s solution is definitely an option, but it seems to be more appropriate if you're concerned about sensitive data being exposed.  If all you're trying to do is to avoid having passwords exposed, then perhaps that's overkill and we could simply find a way to avoid having it in the logs.

In any case, I'm just trying to figure out what our story is, and we should recommend to anyone concerned about it. What do you think?, Yes, it is pretty weird. I guess we can set the expectation by documenting that transaction logs and snapshots are not encrypted, and it is the user's responsibility to secure these files. I am -0 on ZOOKEEPER-1688. I don't think we should be dealing with on-disk encryption ourselves. The user can easily manage on-disk encryption outside of ZooKeeper. , Added a note to the administrator page. Could anyone have a look and see if this is ok?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
