This message is automatically generated., I think this will also fix ZOOKEEPER-1069, which resulted in a corrupted on-disk log. I am trying out the patch now, but we only saw the problem once in months of testing, so it'll be hard for me to verify for sure., +1, I have just committed this one (Committed revision 1135515.). Thanks, Vishal.]
