[Hi Thomas :) I think I can reproduce this issue on the current trunk.
Could you please assign this to me if good for you? I can do it.
Thank you!

[zk: localhost:2801(CONNECTED) 12] setAcl /node1 ip:127.0.0.1:cdwa
[zk: localhost:2801(CONNECTED) 13] get /node1
Authentication is not valid : /node1
[zk: localhost:2801(CONNECTED) 14] getAcl /node1

, Bruce, feel free to take this over. I'm not able to assign it to you though (your name does not appear in the list)., Hi Committers, could you please review this patch? Thanks a lot!, Please review this patch., Sorry for not getting into this JIRA earlier. Can you justify why we should prevent client from reading ACL value? What is the security concern if you allow unauthorized access to ACL list? 

I think ACL can be considered as metadata. In unix file system, you can still read file permission event if you don't have read permission. Additionally, exists() call don't perform any ACL check as well. I don't know if that is intentional or it is just another bug. 

, In the file system, you would need read permission on the directory to see the permissions for a file (and whether it exists or not).
, ok, ok]
