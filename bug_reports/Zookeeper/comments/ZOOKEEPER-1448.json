Please let us know if you need help writing a test for this. I'm not familiar with this code path myself, but I'm pretty sure some other folks will be able to help.

Thanks!

This message is automatically generated., I looked at this and think it's good, will do another pass on it soon and check it in if it's ready. It would be great if you could give me a patch for the 3.3.X branch though so we can get it there as well., I noticed something that needs to be addressed:

1) the most recent patch replaces slf4j with log4j, which I don't think we want (we want to move trunk to slf4j fully)

2) there is a prior comment "My last patch was for 3.3 branch" but I can't seem to find it. Could you please attach the 3.3 patch under a separate file name, so that it will be easy to distinguish? Typically we name patches "ZOOKEEPER-####.patch" however in the case of needing more than one patch (for various branches) we typically indicate the non-trunk patch as something like "ZOOKEEPER-####_branch3.3.patch" or similar.

Thanks!, I've attached a patch for 3.3 branch.

I use log4j because I want to test whether a line is written to the logs or not. I use for that a custom writeappender as I've seen in another testcase. I don't think I could do the same with slf4j., I looked at the patch. THe patch looks good except for the point that Pat mentioned above that its moving the test toward log4j than using slf4j. For now I am moving this out to 3.4.5 for getting it done right. Botond, if you have sometime would you please update the patch using slf4j in the testcase., If I can get a patch that applies to the 3.4 branch cleanly and removes the references to log4j, then I can include it in 3.4.6. I suppose this is also an issue for 3.5.0, no? , Updated unittest to remove log4j dependency, I don't see any change in 3.5.0 for the DataTree class so I think it is applicable for 3.5.0 as well. Although I haven't tested it, Thanks, Botond. I'm submitting the patch to let jenkins run it., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
