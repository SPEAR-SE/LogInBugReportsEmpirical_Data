[See below for sample stack traces from both the NIO connection and the Netty connection.  I believe this has been broken since release 3.3.0 by the ZOOKEEPER-572 patch.  Prior to that patch, the code had been allocating an 8-byte buffer for reading the trace mask argument.

, I'm attaching a patch.  Summary:
* Both the NIO and Netty connection classes now use a correctly sized buffer for reading the trace mask.
* {{FourLetterWordsTest}} has a new test to cover {{stmk}}.
* {{FourLetterWordsNettyTest}} is a new suite that subclasses {{FourLetterWordsTest}} but configures the Netty connection factory.  This will repeat all of the four-letter word tests through Netty., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Just few comments:
# We have {{NioNettySuiteTest}} and it will run {{FourLetterWordsTest}} against Netty. Can we remove {{FourLetterWordsNettyTest}} ?
# Its good to have timeout params in tests, {{@Test(timeout = 30000)}}
, [~rakeshr], thank you for your code review.  I'm attaching patch v002.

Thanks for the tip about {{NioNettySuiteTest}}.  I wasn't aware of that.  I dropped {{FourLetterWordsNettyTest}}.

None of the tests in this suite had specified a timeout, so I handled it by setting a JUnit timeout rule for the whole suite.  That will automatically cover any new tests added to the suite in the future too., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~cnauroth] for the patch. Here is one review comment.
To trace all the log level mask value is 1022
{code}
long ALL = CLIENT_REQUEST_TRACE_MASK | CLIENT_DATA_PACKET_TRACE_MASK
                | CLIENT_PING_TRACE_MASK | SERVER_PACKET_TRACE_MASK
                | SESSION_TRACE_MASK|EVENT_DELIVERY_TRACE_MASK|SERVER_PING_TRACE_MASK|WARNING_TRACE_MASK|JMX_TRACE_MASK;
{code}
After applying your patch, when this mask is set netcat using {{echo stmk 1022|netcat host port}}, {{java.nio.BufferUnderflowException}} exception is thrown.
This happens because " 1022" is not serialized to 8 bytes but actually 5 bytes. 
So can you make it work even in this scenario by reading the number of bytes available


, Hello [~arshad.mohammad].  Thank you for reviewing.

bq. After applying your patch, when this mask is set netcat using echo stmk 1022|netcat host port, java.nio.BufferUnderflowException exception is thrown.

{{stmk}} expects as input the 64-bit binary integral value (Java {{long}}) containing the mask, not a text representation like the example shown above.  Therefore, we must parse exactly 8 bytes.

It takes some extra work in the shell to encode a trace mask value like this.  In ZOOKEEPER-2229, I'm updating documentation for some of the four-letter words.  Here is an example I gave for one way to encode the argument properly:

{code}
perl -e "print 'stmk', pack('q>', 0b0011111010)" | nc localhost 2181
{code}

This is admittedly a strange interface compared to the other four-letter words.  I think all of the other four-letter words accept text input instead of binary.  However, I approached this patch as just restoring the existing functionality that had been broken in ZOOKEEPER-572, not changing the interface, for reasons of backwards-compatibility., IMHO, smtk interface complexity can be avoided with proper handling at the server side. Here is code snippet what i am suggesting
{code}
incomingBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(8);
int rc = sock.read(incomingBuffer);
if (rc < 0) {
    throw new IOException("Read error");
}            
incomingBuffer.flip();
byte[] inputBytes=new byte[rc];
incomingBuffer.get(inputBytes);
String inputString=new String(inputBytes);
long traceMask = Long.parseLong(inputString.trim());
ZooTrace.setTextTraceLevel(traceMask);
{code}
, Thank you again, [~arshad.mohammad].

The change proposed in this comment would be backwards-incompatible with the functionality that existed before it was broken by the ZOOKEEPER-572 patch, because it would change the parameter from a binary encoding to a text encoding.  My goal in this patch is to restore the broken functionality in the 3.4 line, not introduce new or different functionality.

I agree that the interface of {{stmk}} is awkward.  We could consider a backwards-incompatible improvement in version 3.5 or later.  However, if we're going to take the leap to a backwards-incompatible change, then I'd favor doing something even bolder.  For example, we could restructure the trace logging into different Log4J categories, and then support it through dynamic reconfiguration of Log4J.  This is something that would be outside the scope of this JIRA though, and tracked in a separate JIRA targeted to 3.5 or later.

Honestly, I have to believe almost no one is using {{stmk}} at this point.  As per ZOOKEEPER-2229, it is undocumented, and it has been broken for years.  :-)  Even still, ZooKeeper has a formally published backwards-compatibility policy, and I'd prefer that we stick to it.

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/ReleaseManagement, I strongly agree with [~cnauroth] in that backwards incompatible changes should not be targeted to minor release (by the way, what version does this patch addresses? 4.5.6, 4.5 ? We need to update this JIRA.

Ideally, backwards incompatible changes should be done on major changes (5.0, e.g.), even if the feature is seemingly not used because ZooKeeper is used by a **a lot** of projects. ;), [~eribeiro], thanks for taking a look too.  I'm updating fix version to show that I'm targeting releases 3.4.7 and 3.5.2 with this patch., ...and 3.6.0 (trunk)., Merged (trunk and 3.5):
