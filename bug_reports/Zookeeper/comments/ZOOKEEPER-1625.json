This message is automatically generated., The patch includes only changes to zkServer.sh. I manually verified that it finds the client port in static or dynamic config file or reports an error if the port is not found., +1

    ZOOKEEPER-1625. zkServer.sh is looking for clientPort in config file, but it may
no longer be there with ZK-1411 (Alexander Shraer via michim) (Revision 1437257)

     Result = SUCCESS

, Previously we relied on the server code itself to check that the client port parameter was set, however now we're additionally checking in the zkServer script. Seems like an unnecessary check.

also is the following necessary/useful?

bq. +       echo "Client port not found in static config file. Looking in dynamic config file."

, Hi Patrick,

with 1411 the client port may be correctly defined in the dynamic configuration file - it doesn't need to be in the old config file, the server will not detect that anything is wrong because everything is actually fine. The message you would get when running "zkServer.sh status" is "the server is probably not running", which is not helpful - the server is running but the script didn't find the clientport. This should be reported differently by the script. The message you quote is indeed not necessary, but may be useful to identify what really happened if something goes wrong.]
