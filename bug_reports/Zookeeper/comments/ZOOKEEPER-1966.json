This message is automatically generated., Rev'ed to include additional gitattributes suggested by [~bhavanki] in ZOOKEEPER-1953., The patch itself seems to work, thank you! I did this in my checked-out trunk with the Git problems:

{noformat}
patch -p0 --binary < ZOOKEEPER-1966.patch
{noformat}

If the loss of CRLF does become an issue later, .gitattributes can be modified to convert them back to CRLF in the working copy (see ZOOKEEPER-1953 for details)., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Second patch also works. (My first comment was just for the first patch.) Note that the second patch will get you CRLF line endings on the VS files, although you may have to do this to force it after the patch is applied and committed:

{noformat}
rm src/c/Cli.vcxproj src/c/Cli.vcxproj.filters src/c/zookeeper-vs2013.sln src/c/zookeeper.vcxproj src/c/zookeeper.vcxproj.filters
git reset --hard HEAD
{noformat}, The QA failure is still due to svn version problems on the jenkins machine. Since this is just reformatting, I don't see a problem with checking this in if it works for everyone. [~bhavanki], is it a +1 from you?, Yes sir, +1! :), +1, Committed revision 1611064. I've removed the files and reintroduced them. For the removal: Committed revision 1611063., Somehow it appears that the new files (now in the project root) are CRLF, even in the Subversion repository. I checked this by doing a fresh SVN checkout and examining the files. For example:

{noformat}
[zookeeper-trunk] $ svn info
Path: .
Working Copy Root Path: /Users/bhavanki/dev/zookeeper-trunk
URL: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/zookeeper/trunk

[zookeeper-trunk] $ svn status
[zookeeper-trunk] $ file zookeeper-vs2013.sln
zookeeper-vs2013.sln: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
{noformat}, VS 2013 project files stripped with dos2unix.
, Yep, file location took a turn for the worse. I pulled the files here via git-svn and the files show unstaged changes after checkout which looks like an artefact of what we're hoping to fix.

[~fpj], I've attached zip file with offending files tweaked by dos2unix for a second go.

If this fails, perhaps we should ping the Apache SVN folks as this shouldn't be this hard., I'm sorry for the mess, I hope this finally fixes it: Committed revision 1611309., SUCCESS: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2375 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2375/])

, I think it's good now. Thanks! (I also agree that it shouldn't be this hard. I think Git's the problem here.)]
