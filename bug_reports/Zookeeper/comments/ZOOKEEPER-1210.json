[I debugged this issue somewhat.

The support for the Buildroot directive in the RPM spec files got removed in rpm 4.6.0 (AFAICT).

The spec files created in the ZOOKEEPER-999 issue define Buildroot: %{_build_dir}, which is silently ignored on systems that use rpm >= 4.6. These include Fedora >= 10 and RHEL >=6.0

One solution for this issue might be to pass "--buildroot=${package.buildroot}/BUILD" to the "rpm" ant task. "--buildroot" option is supported by both old and new rpmbuild versions.

, Tadeusz,
 Mind uploading a patch?, I created this patch at work. My employer (Wirtualna Polska S.A.) is OK with me submitting patches upstream., The following patch fixes rpm buildroot misplacement on systems with rpm >= 4.6. Earlier rpm versions support --buildroot commandline flag, so this patch doesn't break building on older systems.
