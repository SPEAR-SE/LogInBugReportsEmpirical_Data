This message is automatically generated., +1 the patch looks good. 
Though we sshould add apis for getting the sesssion timeout. In c we have zoo_recv_timeout (which sadly doesnt have any docs on it) but in java we dont have any. We should add it and document saying that the session timeout is negotiated and how and why. This could be another jira!, Added ZOOKEEPER-593 which addresses the issue Mahadev mentioned - good catch!, +1 looks good., I just committed this. thanks pat., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #625 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/625/])
