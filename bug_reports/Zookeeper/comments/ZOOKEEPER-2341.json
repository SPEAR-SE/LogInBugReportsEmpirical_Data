[Hi [~kmortensen@basistech.com].  Thank you for the bug report.  We fixed this for the upcoming 3.5.2-alpha release.  This was tracked in issue ZOOKEEPER-2281.  However, we did not backport the fix to the 3.4 maintenance line.  I just reopened that issue so that we can consider it for ZooKeeper 3.4.8.  I'm going to resolve this one as a duplicate.  I recommend adding yourself as a watcher on ZOOKEEPER-2281 if you'd like further updates.]
