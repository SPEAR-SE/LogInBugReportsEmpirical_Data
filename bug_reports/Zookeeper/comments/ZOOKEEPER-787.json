[thanks for the heads up, marking as blocker for next rel., Since the poms were correct and the deployed location simply wrong, I copied the artifacts to the correct path which is org/apache/zookeeper. Give it a few hours to sync to central., Hello, 

thank you for the copy, but its still not in the right location.

With groupid = "org.apache.zookeeper" and artificatid = "zookeeper", the right location is:

http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/zookeeper/zookeeper/3.3.1/zookeeper-3.3.1.pom

So it would be great to give it another try! :-)
, would also like to see this fixed, maybe with another move to path /org/apache. thx a lot, brain cramp, it's in the proper location now., checked with 3.3.1 and works for me.

thank you!, A user verified (see comment) that this is now fixed. Closing.]
