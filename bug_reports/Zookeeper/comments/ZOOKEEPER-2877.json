[Hi [~hanm]
I tested this issue on latest release and I could not reproduce it. 
Assert at line 939, (l.self.getCurrentEpoch() is getting evaluated to 1) is working fine. Please let me know whether am I missing anything?

Nikhil, bq. I could not reproduce it. 

This one is a flaky test for sure and we've seen it from time to time on our nightly builds, albeit not very frequently.

It's not unusual that you can't reproduce a flaky test like this locally because the failure scenarios are usually un-deterministic if's caused by concurrency issues like race conditions or depend on other facts such as interferences from other tests and the host load. My suggestions on reproducing a test is to:

* Stress test it, in isolation or in batch with rest of unit tests. Easy to do if you write a script or using Jenkins. When you run it enough number of times you might get lucky to get a hit.
* Introduce faults in the test artificially which increase the probability of hitting a failure. Examples including adding sleep calls here and there.
