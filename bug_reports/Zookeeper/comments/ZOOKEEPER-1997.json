[With reconfig you still cannot grow from standalone to quorum mode. There are many many use cases for the standalone mode -- most notable for embedded unit tests or for non-HA clusters which are use for simulations or test environments where we don't need quorum mode., If I get it right, this is proposing to have standalone mode only if there is no line in the config file, and quorum mode if there is at least one line, this way the ensemble can grow through reconfiguration. Is this right?

I'm not sure I got the discussion about testStandaloneQuorum, but I think I need to check that test case to be able to understand it. , [~fpj] 
I thought over the problem and propose the following:
1. when there is a single in zoo.cfg. It should still be standalone. (backward compatibility)
2. when there is a dynamicConfigFile in zoo.cfg, and the dynamic file is not empty, it shouldn't be standalone. Well, you can add more servers to the first one.
3. I am not sure how to handle when both server lists exist in zoo.cfg and zoo.cfg.dynamic. So I am assuming it won't. Well, I will try to take a look and might include this check in ZOOKEEPER-1992., why not just use the standaloneDisabled flag introduced in ZOOKEEPER-1691 ?

Yeah.. That's what I am doing now... The logic s too messy in QuorumPeerConfig.java T-T]
