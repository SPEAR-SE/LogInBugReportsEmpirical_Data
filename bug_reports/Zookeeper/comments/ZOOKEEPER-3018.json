[[~danielchan] Thanks for opening this jira. It's better to track the investigation here.

Are you able to verify the issue with the latest stable version (3.4.11 or 3.4.12) by any chance?, No, we haven't tried those versions yet.

We got two more same issue reported today. 

Is there someone looking into this issue yet? I think it is critical as many developers in the community are using ephemeral nodes in their projects.

 , We have another incident of same issue reported.

This session owns this ephemeral node:

0x162a60381242e0c:
        /consumers/cosStepExecutors/ids/cosStepExecutors_1523203806120_den01fkd.us.oracle.com-1523203806187-7327e8bb

 

Doing "stat /consumers/cosStepExecutors/ids/cosStepExecutors_1523203806120_den01fkd.us.oracle.com-1523203806187-7327e8bb":

"cons" indicated the session is still there:

echo cons | nc den01fkd 2181 | grep 162a60381242e0c
 /10.196.42.142:22166[1](queued=0,recved=549,sent=549,sid=0x162a60381242e0c,lop=PING,est=1523536225314,to=9000,lcxid=0x8f8c,lzxid=0xd8ed,lresp=1523665779797,llat=0,minlat=0,avglat=0,maxlat=1)

 

However, SessionTracker "dump" indicated the session is already expired:

10 expire at Sat Apr 14 00:15:08 UTC 2018:
        .....
        .....
        0x162a60381242e0c

 

It seems session states are not consistent in Zookeeper causing the issue.

[~andorm], could you please have someone to take a look as zookeeper breaks the ephemeral node behavior?

 

 , might related to ZOOKEEPER-2919, [~danielchan]

Do you see the same behaviour on your servers? e.g. new leader election around session expiration

...or there's no sign of session expiration in the logs at all?

If possible, would you please attach the log files of all your Zk servers?, [~andorm]

For the 2nd incident, it was just a standalone config and so no leader election will occur.

Yes, there was no session expiration in the logs at all for session 0x162a60381242e0c.

 , [~andorm]
