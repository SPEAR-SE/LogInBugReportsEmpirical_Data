[Anyone else seeing this? We haven't updated our internal ZooKeeper version in quite a while so it's possible this is fixed in newer versions...., [~marshall]: doesn't ring a bell... is it easy to repro with 3.4.6 or 3.5.1?, This segfault seems to be a symptom of [ZOOKEEPER-1485|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1485].

I reproduced the same log error messages and backtrace by modifying the client xid initialization to set it to a negative value close to the special XIDs and performing a few simple operations from the c cli. When the client sends a request with an xid of \-4, it treats the response it receives as an auth response and accesses zh->auth_h.auth->scheme, which was never set., I agree with [~makuchta], this looks identical to ZOOKEEPER-1485. The tell-tale is that right before this error, in every occurrence we've seen, we see this super important indicator of ZOOKEEPER-1485:

{code}
Socket [10.170.243.7:2181] zk retcode=-2, errno=115(Operation now in progress): unexpected server response: expected 0xfffffff9, but received 0xfffffff8
{code}

I'll close this as a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-1485. Nice sleuthing on this one [~makuchta]]
