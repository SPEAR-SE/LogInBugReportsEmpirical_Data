[Fixed the formatting of the C acl APIs, in the patch their are lines that are huge in length. Can we break them up into newlines? its easier to read/modify the xml file if it fits in a 80 char screen., I did that with all the lines but the API lines. Not sure it will help but here's an updated patch that reformats the xml (html still the same) for the API lines in the patch. enjoy ;-), removed the generated from the patch, +1 for the patch., I just committed this.
