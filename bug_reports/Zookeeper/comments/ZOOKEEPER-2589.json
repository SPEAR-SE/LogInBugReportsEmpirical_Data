[Theoretically, the reason for this problem is same as the ZOOKEEPER-2547.  As you have enabled the SSL, you must have configured serverCnxnFactory= org.apache.zookeeper.server.NettyServerCnxnFactory in server. NettyServerCnxnFactory is not adding the client IP as authorized ip which leads to this problem.
May be, you can take ZOOKEEPER-2547 latest patch, verify it and give feedback here., Thanks for feedback. will verify against that patch and feedback]
