[I have:

1- Created a new class extending thread to handle the connection requests of followers (FollowerCnxAcceptor). An object of this class is shut down when the leader object owning it is shut down;
2- I have removed the naked notify. After inspecting the code, it seems there there is no one waiting on the notification that call generates.

Tests pass without a problem.
, There is a potential race condition with this code:

1) say leader shutdown is called
2) shutdown will call cnxAcceptor.halt()
3) acceptor is currently blocked on accept (for up to 1 sec)
4) shutdown method completes, including shutting down entire followers set (followerhandlers)
5) accept call in acceptor returns true (socket != null)
6) acceptor now adds followerhandler to followers set, Modification to class FollowerCnxAcceptor to address Pat's comment., Updated the patch a bit to log in both the expected and unexpected cases.

Note: there is a very small timing issue during shutdown where acceptor may return and result in a handler being added to the followers set, but this will eventually timeout on it's own., +1 Looks good, Committed revision 698743.
