[I just committed this. Thanks, Chris., afaict this was only committed to the trunk as:
New Revision: 794704

It should have been committed to both trunk and 3.2

reopening so that it can be committed to the 3.2 branch, Committed to 3.2 branch as well (revision 794765). Thanks for the reminder, Pat., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #393 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/393/])
