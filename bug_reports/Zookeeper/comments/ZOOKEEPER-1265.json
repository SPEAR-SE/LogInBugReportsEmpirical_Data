This message is automatically generated., lgtm, thanks Thomas!, Don't the books say that all switch statements should have a default case? Perhaps we should refactor to print a warning in cases where we haven't handled a particular case? There will be some exceptions, but in general it seems like a good idea.

Something that PMD or checkstyle (findbugs?) can catch?, There might be books saying so. Checkstyle can warn you on missing defaults and fall throughs as currently used. My long term goal however is to get rid of most of the switch statements altogether. Switch statements are often a sign of missing object orientation. Logic that should be in a method of the object switched over is external of the object in the switch cases.
I will update my devel branch on github soon and give some comments on it., I'd be happy to see patches that add limited/targeted PMD/Checkstyle type checks. Now that most of the std warnings are addressed we could start looking at these more for the high value targets., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1348 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1348/])
