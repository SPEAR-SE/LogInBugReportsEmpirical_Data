[This has been reported for my check_zookeeper.pl Nagios plugin too:

https://github.com/harisekhon/nagios-plugins/issues/51

Apparently doing an 'srst' to reset the stats fixes it. I wouldn't be surprised if this was due to correcting a server's time in a sudden large step via ntpdate.

I've worked around this in my code by resetting the returned value to N/A and notifying the user to do 'srst'.

The more I think about this the more it seems like a minor ZooKeeper bug in not checking whether min latency < 0 for sanity.

I propose a simple fix that ZooKeeper check < 0 and if so do an internal 'srst' on it's stats., reproduced too

since [ZOOKEEPER-1366 |https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1366] has replaced *System.currentTimeMillis* to *System.nanoTime*,this issue can not be reproduced. Am I right?
