This message is automatically generated., This patch doesn't touch JavaDocs, so the JavaDoc warning unrelated.

This is a documentation-only patch, so test failures are unrelated.  It looks like TestReconfig.cc continues to fail intermittently.

[~rgs], I forgot to mention that the same patch file can apply to trunk, branch-3.5 and branch-3.4.  Thanks again., Merged for trunk & 3.5:
