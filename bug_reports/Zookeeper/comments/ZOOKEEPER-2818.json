    I think it is worth to add a little bit description here - something like: `the acl version of the node`. I know, the name already encodes the semantic but being explicit is always better.

    In that case dn't we need to consider remain two args(path,acl) also..? if you agree, might be handle in another jira..?

    I think we can add documentation to the other parameters as part of this JIRA as the additional work required does not justify creating another JIRA which brings overheads for both of us.

    Thanks for updating. Yes no need patch every parameter in this patch. 
    
    >> given aclVersion matches the aclVersion of the node.
    
    How about this: `given aclVersion matches the acl version of the node`. Similarly for the param:
    
    >> aclVersion the given aclVersion for the node
    
    `aclVersion - the given acl version of the node`.
    
    Copy pasting does not make it more descriptive, thus my suggestion.

    @brahmareddybattula yes you should be added to contributor list. I think @rakeshadr could help get you added to the contributor list and assign ZOOKEEPER-2818 to you. I don't have JIRA admin permission yet.
