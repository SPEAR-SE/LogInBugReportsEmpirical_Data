[The patch includes the change to zookeeper.c and to get_set_test.py., Could someone do a code review on this prior to me submitting the patch?

Many thanks,
Chris, chris, 3.4.0 is the upcoming release, so I marked this fix for 3.4. Would that work?, the patch looks good to me!, Yeah, absolutely!! I wasn't sure what to put for versions, so I just picked something after 3.3.3. :-)

This message is automatically generated., This fix is wrong. 

Compilation gives a warning about invalid type being passed.

A good fix would be to change "struct Stat *stat = NULL"; to "struct Stat;" and pass &stat to zoo_set2. I've attached a patch to this effect. The current implementation passes a NULL pointer to zoo_set2, which means the stat never gets set., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hmm, sorry about that. When I made that change, the function returned the stat dict properly, whereas prior to the change, it just returned None. Thanks for taking a closer look and finding a better solution., I just committed this to trunk. Thanks Ivan and Chris., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1146 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1146/])
    ZOOKEEPER-1028. In python bindings, zookeeper.set2() should return a stat dict but instead returns None. (Chris Medaglia and Ivan Kelly via mahadev)
