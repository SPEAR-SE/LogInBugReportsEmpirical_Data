 Dont we need to do this for build.xml files in recipes/rest and others?, No, the toplevel build.xml is the only file in which we specify an explicit target. As a result the other builds should build fine - although I didn't test that as my main goal here is to get the trunk build working on jdk7 and setup a jenkins job.

I think this should just go in as-is., Just pushed this. thanks pat!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1304 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1304/])
