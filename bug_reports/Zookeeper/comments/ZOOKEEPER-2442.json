Presumably we want this for trunk and 3.5.x, right? I'll merge to trunk first. 

cc: [~cnauroth] who is getting the next 3.5.x release ready. , Oh, forgot to mention, a super small nit for next time. In:

{code}
-        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
-            LOG.debug("Opening channel to server " + sid);
-        }
+        LOG.debug("Opening channel to server " + sid);
{code}

I think for LOG statements using {} (extrapolation) instead of + (concatenation) reads nicer (specially for statements with multiple vars in them., Merged to trunk:
