[chagingng the fix and affects versions. would be good to have in 3.1.0.

nitay, do you want someone to review the patch? Here is hte process for patch contribution

http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/HowToContribute

The patch needs to be submitted and made patch available for someone to review the patch., Besides the ZOOKEEPER- before the name, is my patch okay format wise? It's generated from a git checkout, not an svn one. I think the only difference is you need to use patch -p1 instead of -p0. Otherwise it should work the same.

Thanks,
-n, git checkout is fine... the guidelines is that usually the patch is geenrated from the trunk, so the reviewer does not have to worry abt -p1 or -p2 ... though its good for a starting point :).. , Nitay, try the --no-prefix option next time, that's what I use:

example:

git diff --no-prefix master > ~/Desktop/ZOOKEEPER-249.patch
, +1 the patch looks good., I just committed this. Thanks nitay., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #168 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/168/])
