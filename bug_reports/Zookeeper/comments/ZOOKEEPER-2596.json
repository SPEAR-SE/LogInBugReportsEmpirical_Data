[I am unsure as to why any domain information is being returned by gethostname in this situation.  I built a small test application that calls gethostname subroutine on the same server and as expected only the machine name is returned.  However, host.name is populated with machine.domain.com in the logs from the code snippet in the description., Issue appeared within Apache NiFi built-in zookeeper instance.  Problem did not replicate with stand-alone installation of zookeeper.  Will report this issue to NiFi JIRA., Thanks for reporting and dealing with it yourself, [~blkdragn]. If there is ever anything worth reporting back to the zookeeper community, please feel free to comment here or directly on the list.]
