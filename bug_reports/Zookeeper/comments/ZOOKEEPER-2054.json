This message is automatically generated., +1 looks good to me. Thanks Michi., Thanks [~michim].

If I understood correctly with this patch {{NioNettySuiteHammerTest}} should pass. Unfortunately [NioNettySuiteHammerTest/testHammer|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/2375//testReport/org.apache.zookeeper.test/NioNettySuiteHammerTest/testHammer/] test case is still failing, am I missing anything ?, test-patch.sh is already started by the time this patch gets applied, so the pre-commit build is actually not picking up this change, and the ulimit -n is still set to 1024. I belive the test will start passing once this patch gets checked in., yeah, from the below logs I'm also inferring the same. we can observe once this is in:)

{code}, I hope this should go to 3.4, 3.5 branches as well ?, no, only for trunk since the pre-commit build always runs against trunk., Thanks [~michim], I got it. I will commit this in sometime., Committed to trunk : http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1630026, FAILURE: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2463 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2463/])
