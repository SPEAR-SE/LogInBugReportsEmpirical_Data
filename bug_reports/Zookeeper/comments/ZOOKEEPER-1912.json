[Attach log files and config files, Thanks for reporting this. Having two servers thinking they could be leaders is not really a bug. It is a bug if we have two servers leading and both having quorums of supporters concurrently, which your case doesn't seem to imply.

If you can find a way of reducing the amount of time we have concurrent leaders, then fine with me, but in my experience it doesn't happen often.

Your tool sounds like a cool one!, [~fpj] can we close this one based on your feedback?]
