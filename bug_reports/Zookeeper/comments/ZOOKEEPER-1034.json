[src/contrib/zkperl now both checks to see if it can find zookeeper_version.h in some sane places, and the Makefile.PL compiles and prints the client version, warning if it's not 3.x

this could be a fatal error but we have only been checking to see if '#include "zookeeper_version.h"' works for some time now, so warning seemed safer.

this change sorta-depends on ZOOKEEEPER-1033 putting stuff into a sane location, but the failure mode without ZOOKEEPER-1033 is the same, as users today need to tweak Makefile.PL options in order to get the perl module to install.

, Hi Nicholas, I tried this patch however the instructions in the README don't seem to match - at least I can't build using them. 

Can you update the patch to include updates to the README? (looks like there's quite a bit of stale data in there that might also be cleaned up, re old releases and such).

Thanks., do you mean the section that refers to the --path-to-stuff?  how are you trying to build that's failing?, include update to README, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., pretty sure that failing core test isn't related to 1034., Patrick, please let me know what specific problem you were having with the build - I'd like to make sure this gets into 3.4.0, Looks like the jenkins builds will be down for a while. Nicholas can you post the results of ant test for this patch?, 'ant test' output from trunk, after removing ZOOKEEPER-1033 and ZOOKEEPER-1034

identify the directory that contains the zookeeper.h and other
ZooKeeper C include files."
