[I ran the RAT tool which generated the attached file.

RAT tool used: http://code.google.com/p/arat/
, Updates based on RAT. Added license headers to many files and addressed missing licenses for imported jars. Also removed cobertura GPL jars., Output of RAT subsequent to applying the attached ZOOKEEPER-75.patch file.
, Owen let me know if anything else needs to be addressed., +1. Please don't forget to delete the cobertura library. You also picked up a lot of whitespace changes. Were those intentional?, Comitted patch as svn revision 677109.

(the whitespace change is due to my editor - eats unnecessary trailing whitespace), Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #27 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/27/]), 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
