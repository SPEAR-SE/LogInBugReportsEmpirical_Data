[This appears not to have been fixed. The test code for chroot stripping contains the following comment:
{quote}
// the c client async callbacks do
// not callback with the path, so
// we dont need to test taht for now
// we should fix that though soon!
{quote}
This is incorrect. Adding a test for the correctness of chroot stripping for async callbacks (e.g. create) causes the test to fail.
