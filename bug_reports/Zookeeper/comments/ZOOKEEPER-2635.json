Branch 3.5: commit e99c68316ecf19a1941fbf1290f11c4a65c1e268
Trunk: commit cd0e323831c8b4cde64976325bfc79bb53cdd9b7, Reopen issue due to recent commits of ZOOKEEPER-2642 (and possibly others that touch doc source.)., GitHub user hanm opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/202

    ZOOKEEPER-2635: regenerate document for branch-3.5 before release.

    Will create a separate PR for master (though there is not much need, but previous commit by Flavio also updated doc for master, so just for completeness sake.).
    
    I don't believe anyone is going to review bin diffs by naked eye, so I am going to merge this right away.
