[[~arshad.mohammad], do you see this error on your local dev environment or jenkins CI?

I've just pulled the latest commit from branch-3.4 (e93d5b27f1cc2c66df39b45be321e90c798bdc9b) and was able to {{ant clean compile}} on my laptop., Nice observation, Arshad. Could you please provide a PR, will resolve this asap. Thanks!

[~eribeiro], could you try {{ant test compile}}. , Excuse me, you right [~rakeshr]! 

BTW, the error is reproducible with {{ant test compile}} and {{ant tar}}. As I could see, the ClientBase's method signature lacking on branch-3.4 was introduced by ZOOKEEPER-2508 (commit: 685a5268)., [~eribeiro], yes it is failing in CI as well [CI Failure Link|https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper_branch34_jdk7/1375/], +1 patch looks good.

Ignore compilation error as the QA ran against {{master branch}}, where the method already exists., The new method is the only change from ZK-2508 that we need to backport to branch-3.4???

I don't have time to look at the whole changeset now...
