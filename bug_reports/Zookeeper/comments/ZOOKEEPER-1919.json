[[~michim] or [~fournc] could you look at this follow-on to ZOOKEEPER-1910?, Unfortunately my C is rusty to put it mildly. [~michim]?, Oops, sorry for the delay. I'll come up with the patch in the next days. Thanks for the follow-up [~phunt]!, Sorry for the delay here. This patch updates the C implementation so that the remove watches API is vis-Ã -vis with the Java implementation, according to [~rakeshr]'s latest changes.

I'll add some tests tomorrow, but wanted to put this out to get feedback on the how the API will look (no big changes though). 

It would be nice to have this in before the first 3.5.0 alpha release, to avoid having people start using the differing APIs (between Java and C).

cc: [~phunt], [~fpj], [~michim], Thanks [~rgs] for the patch. Just few minor comments:

# Instead of "watchers", can we use "watches". Just to sync with the java side API names.
# It would be good to rename union - 'RemoveWatches' to 'WatchesRequest' or a better name, as this union has two types of requests, one for just checking the watch existence and another for remove watch.
, Sorry for the delay [~rakeshr]! I've addressed your comments plus I cleaned up some related items too (i.e.: consistent naming, better tests, etc.).
