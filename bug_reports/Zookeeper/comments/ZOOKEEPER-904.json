[Fix for trunk, Thanks for the patch, feel free to click "submit patch" once you have a patch ready to go. It transitions the workflow and lets us (committers) know to review your patch., We should consider this for 3.3.2 as well, or at least 3.3.3, I would love it in 3.3.2, will upload a patch for that version., for 3.3.2 release, good catch. +1 for the patch.  Ill run ant test and will commit to both 3.3.2 and 3.4.

, Ran the tests, it passes. I just committed this to 3.3 and trunk.

thanks Camille., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #981 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/981/])
