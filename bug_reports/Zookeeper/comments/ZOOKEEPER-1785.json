This message is automatically generated., I couldn't quite reproduce the problem. I used a static conf file like this:

{noformat}
dataDir=/tmp/zktest/data0
syncLimit=2
tickTime=2000
initLimit=5
server.0=localhost:2000:3000:participant;localhost:4000
server.1=localhost:2001:3001:participant;localhost:4001
server.2=localhost:2002:3002:participant;localhost:4002
{noformat}

but the server generates .dynamic conf file when it starts, so the status command succeeds without this patch. I verified the patch correctly finds the client port from the static conf file by running the status command before starting the server. [~shralex], doesn't the server always generate .dynamic conf file during startup, or is there a case where the .dynamic conf file doesn't get generated?, I think you're right - initially the dynamic config was written out only once the first reconfig happened, but in ZOOKEEPER-1783 we changed that, so the current jira seems to be no longer necessary., -1 overall.
