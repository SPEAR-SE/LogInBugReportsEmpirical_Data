[Ugh. In both Follower and Observer we probably need to catch all exceptions that flow out of syncWithLeader and close the socket, not just IOException.

{noformat}
   try {
            InetSocketAddress addr = findLeader();
            LOG.info("Observing " + addr);
            try {
                connectToLeader(addr);
                long newLeaderZxid = registerWithLeader(Leader.OBSERVERINFO);
                
                syncWithLeader(newLeaderZxid);
                QuorumPacket qp = new QuorumPacket();
                while (self.isRunning()) {
                    readPacket(qp);
                    processPacket(qp);                   
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                LOG.warn("Exception when observing the leader", e);
                try {
                    sock.close();
                } catch (IOException e1) {
                    e1.printStackTrace();
                }
    
                // clear pending revalidations
                pendingRevalidations.clear();
            }
        } finally {
            zk.unregisterJMX(this);
        }

{noformat}, [~ddvinay]: looks like you've updated the wrong ticket?, Sorry I was not intended to create/update any issue, but was searching for existing issues and resolutions to the problems which I am cuurently facing while creating a Hadoop cluster.

Once again I am really sorry for the it., What should truncate do when no log files are found? Just return true? Throw IOException? Return false?
I can write a fix for this but not sure what the behavior at truncate should be when there are no log files in the directory., In that case, it seems like FileTxnSnapLog.truncateLog() should throw an exception to make Learner.syncWithLeader fail. Otherwise the follower ends up missing some transactions.

Why would the log files be missing though? The follower must have told the leader that it has lastzxid that's higher than the zxid in the TRUNC message. I guess somebody outside of ZooKeeper could delete the log files..., there were no logs in the directory and nobody removed them.. the node had been off for more than a day, Looks like from the log file that Steven posted they had a snapshot file but no log files for whatever reason. 
I think it should throw an IOException in this case, but we should also catch all exceptions in Observer/Follower observeLeader/followLeader to close the socket on any Exception (Follower does this in 3.5 but not in 3.4.X, Observer never seems to do it).

This message is automatically generated., Yeah, followLeader and observeLeader should catch the same things. thanks for fixing this [~fournc]!

Should the message in:

{noformat}
+            if(input == null) {
+                throw new IOException("No log files found to truncate!");
+            }
{noformat}

give the operator a hint of why this might have happened or how it should be fixed?, I'm totally open to suggestions I'm just trying to get 3.5 out the door., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hmm, how about:

"No log files found to truncate! This could happen if you still have snapshots from an old setup or log files were deleted accidentally or dataLogDir was changed in zoo.cfg."

?

It's at least a hint of what might be happening. , Updated with that change. [~michim], [~shralex] could one of you review this and check it in? I will also attach a 3.4 version., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
