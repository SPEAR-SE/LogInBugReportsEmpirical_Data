[ZOOKEEPER-2360.patch is for trunk and branch-3.5, looks like I'll need to adjust it a bit for branch-3.4., Here it is for branch34., In both cases I built the tests as well as the "tar" artifact, also ran a releaseaudit. I checked that only commons-collections 3.2.2 was included/used in each case., +1 for both patches.  I'll plan on committing after we get a pre-commit run., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., [~cnauroth], [~phunt]: i am planning on cutting an RC for 3.4.8 tonight, is this a must have? Can we delay it for 3.4.9?, bq. -1 tests included. The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.

It's not possible to add new tests for this, because it's just updating the minor version of a dependency.  Existing tests are sufficient.

bq. -1 core tests. The patch failed core unit tests.

The failure was in TestReconfig.cc, which has been flaky.  It isn't related to this patch., [~rgs], there has been a push across Apache projects to upgrade the commons-collections dependency.  It's a simple change, so I'd like to go ahead and put it into 3.4.8.  I'll plan on committing in an hour unless I hear objections.  Thanks!, -1 overall.
