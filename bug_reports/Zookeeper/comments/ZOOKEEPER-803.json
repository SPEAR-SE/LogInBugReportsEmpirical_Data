[This diff shows a bug where the client developer confused disconnections and expired sessions. In the zookeeper programing model, clients reconnect themselves automatically when disconnected. However, should the session expire the application is responsible for reconnecting.

In this case the developer attempted to throttle reconnects, however, due to a bug the application created a new connection each time.

A small number of clients running the buggy code took down a 3 node Zookeeper cluster by exhausting 65k file descriptor limit. It only recovered after shutting down clients, restarting the Zookeepers, and then restarting the well-behaved clients., thanks for this - approx how many clients are we talking about?, Maybe 8-10 clients were running the buggy code. Not too many.]
