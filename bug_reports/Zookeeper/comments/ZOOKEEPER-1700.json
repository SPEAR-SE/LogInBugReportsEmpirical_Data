[Patrick is looking into this. On my laptop the test consistently passes., Pat, I had it running in a loop and it eventually failed, but it was not testJoin, it was testTripleElection. I've observed the same warning for setLastSeenQuorumVerifier in testJoin, but again it didn't cause any harm.

The part that I've seen in the logs that called my attention was this one:

I think the threads are not joining because they are dying. , hmm, I think I've spotted a bug, the notify() in line 205 of FLETest seems wrong. Let me upload a patch so that you check and try., Here is the patch, I have been running FLETest in a loop for about an hour and no test error or failure., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~fpj] while that's likely an issue it doesn't address the problem I'm seeing. I applied the patch and it's still consistently failing, seemly getting hung up in the learner setLastSeenQuorumVerifier:

, [~phunt] could you please verify that connectOne is not called from connectNewPeers - in this case there
are no new peers so the check in connectNewPeers should never invoke connectOne. In fact its not necessary to call connectNewPeers in this case since the version of the current config is the same as the version of the lastSeen config, so we're not learning of new peers., [~shralex] this is very odd. It looks to me like a jvm issue - I find that hard to believe but I don't know what else it could be.

It would explain why only I see this. (ubuntu jdk1.6.0_37)

the following code

{noformat}
    public synchronized QuorumVerifier getLastSeenQuorumVerifier(){
        LOG.info("called getLastSeenQuorumVerifier " + lastSeenQuorumVerifier);
        return lastSeenQuorumVerifier;        
    }
    
    public synchronized void connectNewPeers(){
        LOG.info("connectnewpeers called");
        QuorumVerifier qv = getQuorumVerifier();
        LOG.info("got qv");
        QuorumVerifier lsqv2 = getLastSeenQuorumVerifier();
        LOG.info("got lsqv2");
{noformat}

results in this

No exception is generated (caught throwable in call to connectNewPeer)

I'm about to try with a different jvm version.


, I see what it is, the toString command is attempting to resolve the hostname. That's taking some time on my system (30seconds) and the test is failing before the name is resolved:

I instrumented QuorumServer.toString and see the following:

{noformat}
                LOG.info("resolving:" + clientAddr);
                sw.append(clientAddr.getHostName() + ":" + String.valueOf(clientAddr.getPort()));
{noformat}

notice that "0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:11221" is quick while "/0.0.0.0:11221" is slow.
