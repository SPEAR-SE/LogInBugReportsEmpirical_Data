[Log files from all 5 ensemble nodes., Diffing the zktreeutil dumps of each server is also interesting. There are a few minor differences with local sessions:

diff -a node1.zktree node3.zktree 
8933,8934d8932

Whereas node2 is MASSIVELY different.

In particular, the /binchanges value is different:

|--[binchanges]                                                 |--[binchanges]
|   |                                                           |   |   
|   |--[version => 3]                                         | |   |--[version => 2]

Yes, the server is supposed to refuse the client connection if the client has seen a higher zxid than the server.

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/ZooKeeperServer.java#L825

Does /binchanges on node2 eventually become 3, or is it stuck at 2?, [~michim] - thanks for looking at this issue. I saw the same code you linked to and agree on the intended behavior. The log message in that block of code is NOT present. 

We did not see /binchanges update to the correct value of 3. It looked to be stuck at 2. Which really defies explanation., Well, but you are using local sessions right? Which means that upon a ConnectionLoss and moving to a new server you *will* get a SessionExpired (if your session was local), right? After your session expires, your new client won't know anything about your last highest seen zxid?, [~rgs] - No, we are not using local sessions. , I am working with Marshall on this issue.  Upon investigating more, I noticed that all of our processes that had problems had just re-established a connection to node2 immediately before getting stale state from that ZK (through node2).  This seems to match with Marshall's observation that dumping state with zktreeutil on node2 shows a state that is out of date.  It was even stale some time afterward.

So right now I am investigating how node2 could think its local database was at zxid N+1 (hence why it accepted the connection from the client), but somehow the state of the database is reflecting zxid <= N.  Leader election happened about 15 seconds prior to this, but connections were just getting session connected events.  I'm still digging through the leader election logs, but nothing stands out as suspicious to me yet.

Any help or ideas for things to look for would be much appreciated.]
