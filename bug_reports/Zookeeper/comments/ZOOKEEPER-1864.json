This message is automatically generated., [~shralex], could you review this patch? The test is failing, but I'm not sure why., I wouldn't worry too much about this failure in Zab1_0 test since it uses hard-wired ports, so its possible that they were taken. I run it locally and this test passes.

I suggest to move this block of code to the very end of parseProperties and remove it from parse(), otherwise its just duplicate., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~michim] for the patch.

If I understood correctly the cause of NPE could be, not initialized the 'quorumVerifier' while parsing. But when looking at the code, QPC.parseProperties() is getting called inside QPC.parse(path) and there is no way of coming out without initializing 'quorumVerifier'. Any idea how the curator-test has been written and starting the server ?, [~michim] I gone through the curator-test (I could have done this earlier:( ). It seems they are directly calling QPC#parseProperties() for building the config, in that case this fix make sense.
{code}
QuorumPeerConfig config = new QuorumPeerConfig();
config.parseProperties(properties);
{code}, Cool, thank you for doing that Rakesh., Thanks [~michim] for the patch and [~shralex] for the reviews
