[Actually digging further it looks like the ensemble would have recovered eventually.  But it was happening so often that we thought it was not recovering.  I'll dig in deeper to try to get the root cause of the drops, and open a new JIRA if it is related to ZK.  Sorry to have filed a JIRA without seeing all of what was going on.]
