[This patch splits the previous Exception into IOException and RuntimeException. We need to catch IOException, since it is thrown inside the block, and we also want to catch RuntimeExceptions so that we can warn an operator about the responder thread dying. Findbugs does not like having a block catching exception., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
