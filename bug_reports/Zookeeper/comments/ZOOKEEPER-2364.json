[Here is a patch that would bring the trunk version of this file over to branch-3.5.  That's enough to unblock the {{ant docs}} build, but this content is quite out of date.

I'd appreciate if someone with more release management experience could comment on the docs situation and how the process is supposed to work.  This file appears to be redundant with docs/releasenotes.html, which is up-to-date., Digging into revision history a bit more, it seems that releasenotes.xml was deleted from branch-3.5 during the 3.5.0 release preparation.  Since then, subsequent releases have made modifications directly to releasenotes.html.

https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/commits/branch-3.5/docs/releasenotes.html, After further discussion on the dev list, I found out that the removal of src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/releasenotes.xml is an intentional choice to eliminate a dual-maintenace problem in managing the release notes.  Unfortunately, Forrest/Cocoon seems quite insistent that there be a releasenotes.xml file to pass validation.  The only option I could find was a "disable all validation" property, which I don't think is what we want.

I'm proposing that we keep an empty placeholder releasenotes.xml file in place just to satisfy the build.  When committing rendered docs, committers will have to avoid committing changes in the generated releasenotes.html and releasenotes.pdf files.  I have attached v002 patches for both trunk and branch-3.5 to implement this approach.

Feedback welcome, especially from those of you who have more long-term history on how the docs build and release process is supposed to work., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~cnauroth] can you give my patch a try? It turns out that "api" was working because of some special setup in the default forrest config. Took me about 4 hours to figure this out. Arg! See https://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_90/faq.html#cli-xconf for more details.

Once I figured out why api was special it was easy to fix - I added an exclude for releasenotes in the cli.xconf file and pulled the default into our forrest subdir.

With this patch we should remove releasenotes from the src/docs/... directory and use the HTML directly from Jira (my original intent but I only got half way there)., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~phunt], nice job!  Thanks for picking this up.  I had tried to find something like this in the Forrest documentation, but I wasn't able to find the magic myself.

+1 for the patch.  I verified the docs build on both trunk and branch-3.5.  I also tried intentionally introducing a broken link, and the doc build failed as expected, so that proves the change doesn't relax the validation more than we want.  I will commit this later today.

bq. With this patch we should remove releasenotes from the src/docs/... directory

I will do {{svn rm src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/releasenotes.xml}} when I commit to trunk.  This part won't be necessary for the branch-3.5 commit., I have committed this to trunk and branch-3.5.  [~phunt], thank you for digging into Forrest and finding a solution., SUCCESS: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2863 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2863/])
