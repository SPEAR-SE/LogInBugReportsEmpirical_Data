This message is automatically generated., QA says that this patch fails core tests. The patch doesn't even modify core ZooKeeper, though. From the output, it looks like the C tests are still failing, and it can't be caused by this patch.
, I have already fixed this in ZOOKEEPER-380. WOuld you be able to aadd  the test to ZOOKEEPER-380? You will have the apply the patch and then change your test so that it uses the new api. 

Also, the c tests has some problems. I am working on it.

, cancelled the patch since ZOOKEEPER-380 includes the change already., We'll solve this issue in ZOOKEEPER-380.]
