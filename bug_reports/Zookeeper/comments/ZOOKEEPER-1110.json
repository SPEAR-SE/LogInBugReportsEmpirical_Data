[Hi xiliu,

Sorry it took this long to respond!

I don't think this is a valid bug. The intention of the original code is to wait for the fd to become writable for a given amount of time, which I think is the right thing to do. This patch will make zookeeper_close() nonblocking; if the fd is not writable, it'll simply return ZOK without actually sending the request. That's not what we want to do.

Let me know if I misunderstood your bug report. Otherwise, I'll close this ticket as invalid.

Thanks!
--Michi, please do as you wish.
