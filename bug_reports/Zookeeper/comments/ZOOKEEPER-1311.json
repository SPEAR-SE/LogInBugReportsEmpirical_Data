[As part of fixing this it would be great to have something we could use to validate ZK deployment to the maven repo as part of the release process. Mahadev and I tested this ourselves, but didn't notice the test issue., It could be tested with a pom.xml that pulls in the different parts. I don't know how to automate that testing though., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
