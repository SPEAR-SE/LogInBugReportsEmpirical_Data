[The log indicates that your leader can't talk with follower. It's not unusual, as it totally depends on your network condition and also your configuration. An immediate action to try is to increase the tickTime and syncLimit.Â 

Unless there is more evidence, I don't think this is a bug but more like a configuration issue., Feel free to reopen the Jira with more evidence if this is a bug.]
