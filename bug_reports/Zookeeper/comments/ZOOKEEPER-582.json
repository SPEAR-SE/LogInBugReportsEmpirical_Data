[As Ben mentioned we will never see this situation during normal operation of ZK.

The case where we did see this was a result of a user running the migration tool that we provide to upgrade from version 2 to version 3 of ZooKeeper. The tool migrates the data by writing a single snapshot file where the zxid is maintained (it does not write a log file). As a result of the scenario Ben mentioned (snap with no associated log file) this could cause this bug to occur. If you have run the migration tool, documented here:
http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.0.0/releasenotes.html#migration_data
you can verify whether or not you have this situation by looking at your ZooKeeper datadirectory

Here's an example

-rw-r--r--  1 root search 67108880 Nov 17 19:31 log.300022b61
-rw-r--r--  1 root search 67108880 Nov 17 19:38 log.3000292d0
-rw-r--r--  1 root search  3646608 Nov  5 12:13 snapshot.1db5df6e2d6
-rw-r--r--  1 root search  3616579 Nov 17 19:31 snapshot.3000292c9
-rw-r--r--  1 root search  3616708 Nov 17 19:38 snapshot.300038d32

where the files are of the form <file>.<epoch><xid> 
epoch and xid both being 4 byte values represented as hex

Notice that the snapshot.1db5df6e2d6 has epoch of 0x1db, while the other
files have epoch of 0x3, this is the scenario described in the description of this
JIRA. (there is no log file associated with epoch 0x1db)

If you see this in your datadir - a snapshot with an epoch where there are no log files with
this same epoch, then this bug pertains.  If you see snapshots of a particular epoch
and log files with the same epoch then this bug does NOT pertain.

This message is automatically generated., looks good mahadev just two things:

1) (minor) in getLastLoggedZxid() you should be useing maxLogZxid instead of calling getLastLoggedZxid() again.

2) when doing the sanity check with the leaders zxid you should be checking epochs not zxids. it is possible for a follower to see something later and have to truncate from the same epoch, put a follower should never see a later epoch., for 1) good catch.. i missed that

for 2) good point....ill fix that .... , addressed ben's comments in this patch., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., latest patch for 3.2 branch. I ran the tests and they pass., latest patch for the 3.1 branch. I ran the tests and they pass on this branch as well., attached the wrong patch for 3.1 .. attaching again., looks like am really tired. this time i think its the correct file!, +1 great job mahadev!, I just committed this to 3.1, 3.2 and trunk. thanks ben!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #546 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/546/])
    . ZooKeeper can revert to old data when a snapshot is created outside of normal processing (ben reed and mahadev via mahadev)
