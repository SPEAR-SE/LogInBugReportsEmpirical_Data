This message is automatically generated., Mark can you please update the patch? looks like it doesnt apply., Sorry - I'm at a loss for the moment - that patch was made off latest trunk and applies to latest trunk for me. I'm obviously missing something..., Try resynching your code base and creating the patch again. It doesn't apply cleanly for me due to the import statements, which were cleaned up in a checkin on 9/14., Silly me - my orig checkout is off the 3.3 branch not trunk - my bad - new patch coming., patch to trunk, here is the 3.3 patch, committed to 3.3/3.4/trunk. Thanks Mark!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1319 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1319/])
