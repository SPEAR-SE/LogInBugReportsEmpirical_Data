[Good catch. Here's what I notice in branch-3.3:

* {{Leader.java:240}} - the initial read timeout is set to {{syncLimit}} ticks, but the first thing we wait for is an ACK from the follower saying that it has got up-to-date, which should be subject to {{initLimit}}
* I also saw that in {{Learner.java:220}}, the connection should be established with {{initLimit}} as the connection timeout (this is not fixed in branch-3.4). However, because there's a retry loop, there's no guarantee that we will connect in less than initLimit or syncLimit. So {{initLimit}} is not a hard limit at all; but it isn't already for other reasons. 

In branch-3.4:

* {{LearnerHandler.java:336}} sets the initial timeout to {{initLimit}}, but never sets it back again after the ACK. And it should just be setting the timeout in {{Leader.java:254}} anyhow. 

, These patches fix the problem. However I don't see a reasonable way to add a unit test for this with our current infrastructure. I will verify manually., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1 looks good. it is reasonable to do a test for this?, I can't see a way to do it with our current infrastructure. I'm going to verify manually. I'm also talking to my QA team about adding this to their system test regime., I verified this fix by running a very large snapshot file with the unfixed code and initlimit=200 and synclimit=2 (ticktime = 2000 in all cases), which failed to allow sufficient time during the init phase. I then re-ran this using the fixed code and the quorum came up successfully.
