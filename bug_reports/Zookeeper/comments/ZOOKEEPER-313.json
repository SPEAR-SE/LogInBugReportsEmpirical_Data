[excellent find! thanx for the test case too! you are correct the new leader transaction is not being logged but should be. (actually according to our design spec, it must be.), sunanda,
 can you try out our latest release 3.1.0? We had a bug in 3.0 and 3.0.1 - ZOOKEEPER-251

which has been resolved in 3.1. 

 I tried the above scenario on 3.1 but cannot reproduce it. I can reproduce that in 3.0.0 and 3.0.1
Also, as ben mentioned even in 3.1 we do not log the new leader transaction whcih we should (this is not really incorrect but would be just to follow our design spec).
, sunanda, 

i am makring this as a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-251. I have openened ZOOKEEPER-335 for logging the new leader election txn. 
Please feel free to reopen if that is not the case.
