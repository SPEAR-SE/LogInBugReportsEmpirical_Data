[Hello [~sershe].

I believe your concerns are addressed in ZOOKEEPER-2139, which has a patch committed for the 3.5.2-alpha release candidate that I'm about to create shortly.  That patch allows for more fine-grained configuration of the client without needing to rely on global JVM properties.

I'll resolve this as a duplicate.  (If I misunderstood, please feel free to reopen.)]
