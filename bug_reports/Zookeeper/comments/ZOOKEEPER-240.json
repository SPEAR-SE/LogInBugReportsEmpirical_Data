[Jute generated toString methods rely on CSVOutputArchive which in turn relies on Jute's Utils.java. the toCSVBuffer doesn't check for null buffer, which it should.

Note: if you fix this (add null check to toCSVBuffer) please be sure to review the rest of the code in Utils.java for similar problem(s).
