[Hi [~mheffner]-

Thanks for reporting this issue and uploading logs.

I have been trying to reproduce the issue with both 3.3.6 and 3.4.8 and have been unsuccessful. I have been simulated zxid rollover by changing `if ((request.zxid & 0xffffffffL) == 0xffffffffL) {` to `if ((request.zxid & 0xffffffffL) == SOME_SMALLER_VALUE) {` and in my testing, ZooKeeper has handled it properly.

I was wondering if you had additional logs that showed what was happening while the cluster is down. As far as I can tell the uploaded logs cover only a second and are from only 2 machines. Would it be possible logs for the first few minutes after the rollover from all the machines in the cluster? It would be great to see all of the leader election messages that are being exchanged. 

Thanks,
Abe]
