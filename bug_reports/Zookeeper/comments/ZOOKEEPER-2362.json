[According to the thread this is ZK 3.4.6/Curator 2.8.0.

It would be great if you could provide a reproducible test case? We'd incorporate it into the patch. Also would help verify the logic., What is the ensemble size and are you attached to the leader or a follower when this happens? You might also turn on debug logging and see if that provides any insight. Attaching the logs here could get more eyes on it., It is possible that I can provide a reproducible test case, though it would likely mean writing code which simply did the above operations endlessly. I wonder if someone more familiar with the relevant code might be able to make more sense of either the potential for this error or may be able to design a better test case?

Unfortunately, it is not happening often: just once during a 6 month period (and another time from another user); I will check if I have relevant ZooKeeper logs, but probably not.

The ensemble size was 5, and I am not sure if connected to leader or follower., I am moving this out to 3.4.10 for now. Hope this will get concluded by that time., I see this issue to be still there. If it is a release blocker, can I go ahead and take this? [~hanm], Assigned to you [~atris], have fun with this.]
