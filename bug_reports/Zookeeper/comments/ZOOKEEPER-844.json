This message is automatically generated., IIRC qabot will apply the most recent patch, it only knows about trunk though (no branches).

The easiest way to address is to attach the patch for br33 first, then attach the patch for trunk. Pretty hacky but it works ok for me.

The other option is to just attach both patches and state in a comment the problem, ask a committer to review it manually instead of waiting on qabot.

Thanks!, First the 3.3.2 patch..., patch to HEAD, +1 looks good to me. Thanks Camille!, Committed to trunk/3.3. Thanks Camille!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #959 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/959/])
