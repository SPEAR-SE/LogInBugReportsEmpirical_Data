[actually afaik it's ok to do this, the request will be queued. why do you think this is a bug?, It's related to this ticket:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-800

Inside zoo_add_auth() function, send_last_auth_info() gets called if the handle is in ZOO_CONNECTED_STATE or ZOO_ASSOCIATING_STATE. However, it doesn't get called if it's in ZOO_CLOSED_STATE, which is usually the case right after zookeeper_init() returns.
