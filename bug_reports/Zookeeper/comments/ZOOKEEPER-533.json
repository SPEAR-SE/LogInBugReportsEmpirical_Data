[Turns out fileset fails if "erroronmissingdir" is not set to false (defaults to true)

I fixed this (added the attr as false) and also cleaned up the code a bit (moved the common build code into the reused build xml file)

double clean works with this.
, I just committed this. thanks pat., reopening - the "erroronemptydir" only works with ant 1.7.1, I will provide a new patch to get it working with 1.7.0 again., 533_2 is a new patch - it allows building with 1.7.0 (while still fixing the original problem), I just committed this... I ran it with 1.7.0 and it works fine... , Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #477 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/477/])
