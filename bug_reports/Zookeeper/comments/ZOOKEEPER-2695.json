[IllegalArgumentException is thrown only for known error code, as per the current source code, only 0 and -12 can throw IllegalArgumentException. So IllegalArgumentException is thrown only for know error codes. My earlier understanding on this was wrong., For unknown errors, clients always throw NullPointerException
Suppose in new version of server for getChildren() API for new scenario new error code is added.
This new error code will be unknown error code for the old clients. Old clients will throw NullPointerException while processing these unknown
{code}
java.lang.NullPointerException

	at org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.create(KeeperException.java:51)

{code}, Submitting the fix, throwing {{SystemErrorException}} for all errors which are not known to client ]
