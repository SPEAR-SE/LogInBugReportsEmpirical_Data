[Also, is there an implied order to the returned list? specifically is it the same order as the "ops" list? The javadocs should mention this., Taking the easy question first, yes, the order is implied.

Regarding the javadoc, I believe that this refers to a capability that was removed because it turned out to be redundant after we decided to return a list., Yes, the order of the results will exactly match the order of the operations.

Ted is correct, the "alternative method" was removed and we instead just return a list. Javadoc comments should be updated accordingly., Thanks Marshall/Ted!

I updated the javadoc to correct the inaccuracies. I also added @since tags to let users know when this was introduced.

This message is automatically generated., I feel, it would be good provides sample usage of multi and transaction in javadocs. Below are few suggestions:

+multi usage as method-level javadoc:+
{noformat}
* <P>
* In the following example of multi-update, <code>zkper</code> represents
* an active ZK client connection:  
* <PRE>
* Op createEphe1 = Op.create("/sample", new String ( "sample" ).getBytes (),
*        org.apache.zookeeper.ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode
*       .fromFlag ( 2 ) );
* Op createEphe2 = Op.create("/sample", new String ( "sample" ).getBytes (),
*        org.apache.zookeeper.ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode
*        .fromFlag ( 2 ) );
* List<Op> ops = new ArrayList<Op>();
* ops.add(createEphe1);
* ops.add(createEphe2);
* zkper.multi(ops);
* </PRE>
{noformat}

+Transaction usage as class-level javadoc:+
{noformat}
* <P>
* In the following example of transaction, <code>zkper</code> represents
* an active ZK client connection:  
* <PRE>
*   Transaction transaction = zkper.transaction();
*   transaction.create("/sample", new String ( "sample" ).getBytes (),
*        org.apache.zookeeper.ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode
*        .fromFlag ( 2 ) );
*   transaction.create("/sample", new String ( "sample" ).getBytes (),
*        org.apache.zookeeper.ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode
*        .fromFlag ( 2 ) );
*   transaction.commit();
* </PRE>

    ZOOKEEPER-1336. javadoc for multi is confusing, references functionality that doesn't seem to exist. (phunt via mahadev)
