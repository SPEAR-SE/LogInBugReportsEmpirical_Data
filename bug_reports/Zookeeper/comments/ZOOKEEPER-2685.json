[[~shamim_er] Do you mind clarify what you are trying to achieve here? In particular, what is the "version issue" you referred to? Please note that ZooKeeper already supports client/server SSL which is implemented in ZOOKEEPER-2125 for 3.5.x, and there is currently no plan to port this feature to 3.4 branch (see the recent comments in ZOOKEEPER-2125.)., We are not in position to upgrade zookeeper version. so want to to know is there any patch which can be applied on 3.4.x so that we can achieve SSL.  , [~shamim_er] There is no patch that could be directly applied on branch-3.4 to get SSL feature. Technically it might be possible but no one (at least publicly) is working on this. ]
