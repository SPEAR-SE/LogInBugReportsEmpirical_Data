This message is automatically generated., [~biju74], thank you for patch v2.

Right now, failures will write a message of "insufficient permissions".  However, it's possible that the commands failed for reasons unrelated to permissions, such as a general I/O error.  Could we go back to the more general "could not do" error messages that were in the first patch?

There is still a separate {{rm}} call for "version-2", which needs its own separate check of the exit code.

[~biju74] or [~mnarayan], are either of you interested in providing another revision of the patch?, Updated patch with changes for review comments., [~cnauroth] attached new patch with the suggested changes.
