[Take a look at zkServer.sh in the src/c/tests subdirectory

This is run as part of the setup for the test that's failing (first time it's run during the test)

Notice that fuser is run early in the setup, I don't see this on hudson.zones.apache.org (although I don't know where the tests are actually running?)

You might checkout this script and ensure it's able to run on the target system.

Also, I recently submitted a patch to fix a similar problem in the trunk/bin/zkServer.sh file. Basically
I now store the pid file and use kill to stop the server. You might want to try out that patch on this
script. Or if you can identify this as the problem let me know and I'll submit a patch.
, I just took a loko at this.
it seems like the following happened -- 
- their was running java server by user gkesavan on vesta
- this java server could not be killed by hadoopqa since gkesavan was the owner
- the tests run against this server, and looks to see if a node does not exist, but it did since it was running against the server by gkesavan

i have killed the server by gkesavan (luckily it was runing a version of zookeepper where echo kill | nc localhost 22181 worked :))
now everything should be fine., this was just a problem with setup.]
