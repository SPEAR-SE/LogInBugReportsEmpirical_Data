This message is automatically generated., How do I change what branch it's applied to?, Please let me know what I need to do to get this accepted., Hi [~lindvall] when you submit patches they are always applied to trunk by the patchbot. The best way to address this is to submit a patch to trunk, and a separate patch to any other branches if necessary (if the trunk patch doesn't apply cleanly to the branch). Always submit the trunk related patch last as that is the one that the patchbot will apply/test against trunk code.

Also you need to use patch/svn diff semantics "git diff --no-prefix" or "svn diff" as appropriate.

We typically name things ZOOKEEPER-####.patch to keep committers from losing their marbles any further. ;-) (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/HowToContribute)

Thanks!, Okay. I'll check it out when I have some time (I'm not sure when I'll have a chance to get to it).

The issue isn't a blocker for me, because I'm applying this patch as part of the build process of the zookeeper gem, but for anyone else using the C client, it's going to likely make a difference for how well they handle server timeouts (it's made a huge difference in production for me)., ZOOKEEPER-1756.patch and br34 supersede previous versions. trunk and branch34 respectively., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks!, NP. [~lindvall] is it possible to add a test for this problem/change?, The only way I was able to repro it was with a test-harness I wrote to replication network failures, and only was able to identify the problem by an excess of log messages.

Here's the code I had used:
https://github.com/zk-ruby/zookeeper/blob/master/zoomonkey/zoomonkey.rb, [~michim] any chance you could review this for commit?
