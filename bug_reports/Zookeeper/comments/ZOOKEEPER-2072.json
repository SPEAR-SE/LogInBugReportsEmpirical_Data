I need to make this change as part of Netty SSL work.

If I tried changing the [code|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NettyServerCnxnFactory.java#L256] by doing
{code}
        bootstrap.setPipelineFactory(new ChannelPipelineFactory() {
            @Override
            public ChannelPipeline getPipeline() throws Exception {
                ChannelPipeline p = Channels.pipeline();
                p.addLast("servercnxnfactory", channelHandler);

                return p;
            }
        });
{code}

NettyServerCnxnTest is failing. The test was introduced in ZOOKEEPER-1179. It seems that it was assuming single pipeline. I was wondering if a thread sleep would be a quick fix here. Or anyone has any idea.=?, QA run this, To confirm, if I apply the patch you uploaded, should I see NettyServerCnxnTest failing consistently?, -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~fpj].
I changed NettyServerCnxnTest to avoid failure by thread sleeping.

I just wanna test what other failures might happen for netty server. , If you wanna see NettyServerCnxnTest failing, just copy previous [code|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NettyServerCnxnTest.java#L75-75] back., [~fpj]
I have uploaded a patch for the changes I am gonna make for Netty Server part.
I personally verified that the test failures are irrelevant or known issues (ZOOKEEPER-2068) that we will fix for Netty + SSL.
Please help review, share feedback, take people in for discussion.

This message is automatically generated., Just talked with [~phunt] and he agrees this is necessary.

It doesn't change any current logic on netty server. The channelHandler is still shared. It however allows adding stateful handlers like SslHandler.

Can someone review and give feedback? Or should I include this change to the SSL work?, [~hdeng]

This change is already in the Zookeeper-2063 patch correct?, [~iandi]
As I mentioned, I uploaded my previous work to coordinate..

I would like to separate the work into:
1. ZOOKEEPER-2069: Netty Client
2. ZOOKEEPER-2072: set channelpipeline factory
3. ZOOKEEPER-2068: test failure for netty server
4. more problems.

Once we are confident that Netty connection is working great, we will get pluggable SSL.

How does my plan sound? Let me know your thoughts., Awesome work!

I have seen many JIRA issues are progressing related to netty implementation. I'd prefer to have an umbrella jira and make all these are subtasks to that. It would be helpful to others(users/reviewers et.) to understand it well., oops, there is ZOOKEEPER-2063 umbrella jira. I feel we can move all the netty related jira as subtasks. This would be easy to review and do commits one by one based on the dependency. Whats your opinion ?, +1 patch looks nice, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
