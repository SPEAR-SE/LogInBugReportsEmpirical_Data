[jira chopped up the code snippet a bit.

Looks like this issue occurs in 2 places: ~line 217 and 331

hmm.... these two sections of code look suspiciously similar, refactoring opportunity? :-), I have a patch for it already, but the problem I have is that the current code from trunk is not compiling, so I cannot test it., This patches fixes the prolem pointed out by findbugs, and adds a new method to QuorumCnxManager to avoid code repetition., I see a small discrepancy:

Can setThreads ever be called with a null channel? (s parameter) There is a null check in setThreads that seems unnecessary. In toSend and receiveConnection methods we are opening a new channel. In the Listener.run() method we are doing an client = ss.accept() (may return null in certain circumstances), then calling client.socket() with no check for null, then passing client to setThreads. Should we remove the null check or is the accept returns null not being handled properly?
, This issue has been resolved by the patch of jira 127., 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
