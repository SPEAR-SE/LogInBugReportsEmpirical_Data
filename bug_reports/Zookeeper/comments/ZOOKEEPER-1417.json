[Modify c-client to match Java behavior. Only update lastZxid when receiving request response (ignore zxid from ping and watch notification)  , Here is my current understanding on how this part works.

The client receives 3 types of responses: ping, watch notification and request response. 

Ping: we should ignore its zxid

Watch notification: when watch is triggered, it will be remove from the list of active watchers, so last zxid delivered as part of notification shouldn't affect how watches are being triggered on reconnect

request response: we should always update last zxid when receive this type of packet.   , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
