, the bug https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1090 leads to data not same

int mt c client
int ia_deserialize_string(struct iarchive *ia, const char *name, char **s)
{   
    struct buff_struct *priv = ia->priv;
    int32_t len;
    int rc = ia_deserialize_int(ia, "len", &len);
    if (rc < 0)
        return rc;
    if ((priv->len - priv->off) < len) {
        LOG_ERROR(("Invalid length and offset: %d - %d < %d",
                   priv->len, priv->off, len ));
        return -E2BIG;
    }
    if (len < 0) {
        LOG_ERROR(("Invalid length: %d", len));
        return -EINVAL;
    }
    *s = malloc(len+1);
    if (!*s) {
        return -ENOMEM;
    }
    memcpy(*s, priv->buffer+priv->off, len);
    (*s)[len] = '\0';
    priv->off += len;
    return 0;
}

len = -1  so *s is not initializedï¼Œ random value
free(*s) lead to core , i met the same core dump today.
if *s in ia_deserialize_string was inialized in any case, things will get better.

a patch (based on r1163106) may help:
