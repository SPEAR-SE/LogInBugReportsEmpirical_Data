[Currently, in the code for both server and client, we check for a non-null system property:

{{(System.getProperty("java.security.auth.login.config") != null)}} 

as a statement of intention to negotiate via SASL.


, I don't think we should expose that to the user, it might change. Instead we should have a method on the session. If the implementation ever changed we could update the method w/o effecting the user code.]
