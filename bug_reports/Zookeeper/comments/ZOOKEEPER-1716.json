 static String toCSVBuffer(byte array[]) {
    if (array == null || array.length == 0) {
      return "";

    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(array.length * 2 + 1);

{code}

(As a side note, why does Utils implements it's own Arrays.equals?, The vm will intrinsitize the implementation rendering meaning that it will utilize SSE cmp if available on the platform etc, doing single byte compare will be orders of magnitude slower), Please review, this should resolve the issue., Please review, -1 overall.
