[in the case of malformedobjectnameexception we should also catch/rethrow this exception at a low enough level such that we can log (WARN) the name that was invalid (sun doesn't include that in the error message and it would be useful), Replaced printStackTrace with proper logging and exception handling. Some of this (jmx esp) was fixed in an earlier patch, this is final cleanup.

Note: I've created a bookeeper issue related to tis' use of pst in main line code : ZOOKEEPER-391, +1 the patch looks good., I just committed this. thanks pat.]
