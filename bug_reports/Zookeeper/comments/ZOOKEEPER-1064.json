[Ted, you're going to want to coordinate with Eric's work on ZOOKEEPER-999.

Note that we never intended zkServer.sh (*.sh) to be used as part of an init chain. Rather this was to help developers and users to get started running the server/client. Fine w/me if we want to incorporate such, however we shouldn't lose the original intent (I should be able to checkout the source, build and then run bin/zkServer.sh to start the server). Does it make more sense to have a single set of scripts, or to have two sets that are specialized (I don't know, asking).
, In ZOOKEEPER-999, src/packages/deb/init.d script is supporting LSB compatibility.  You probably don't need to do anything if the patch is committed., Awesome!

, based on the comments this is resolved by ZOOKEEPER-999]
