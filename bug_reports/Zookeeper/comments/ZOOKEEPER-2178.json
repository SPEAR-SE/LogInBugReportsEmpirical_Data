[I spotted the problem while reviewing Jenkins builds:

https://builds.apache.org/view/All/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-WinVS2008/1783/

I'm attaching a patch.  Testing through the native CLI looks good so far.

This corrects the mismatched method signature, removes the include of unistd.h, and implements calls to {{QueryPerformanceCounter}} for Windows.  We still include unistd.h on non-Windows, because there was an existing include of unistd.h guarded by an {{#ifndef _WIN32}}.

Here is the relevant API documentation for the Windows functions called by the patch:

    ZOOKEEPER-2178: fix flaky StandaloneDisabledTest

    The flaky (that existing for a long time) is caused by a ghost server that although not appear in the quorum's config but still up and running and send requests to the quorum {2, 3, 4}. Fix is simply kill the server 1 after it's used. Verified that with the fix the test survive stress test (100+ runs) while w/o the fix the tests fails frequently, on internal Jenkins machine.
