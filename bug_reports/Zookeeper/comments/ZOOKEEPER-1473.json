This message is automatically generated., Some nits:

{noformat}
+    public static final String COMMIT_LOG_COUNT = "zoookeeper.commitLogCount";
{noformat}

typo: zookeeper

{noformat}
+        LOG.info(COMMIT_LOG_COUNT+ "=" + commitLogCount);
{noformat}

can we have string extrapolation instead of concatenation (more readable, easy to do mass changes if you want to change the LOG calls, etc):

{noformat}
+        LOG.info("{} = {}", COMMIT_LOG_COUNT, commitLogCount);
{noformat}
