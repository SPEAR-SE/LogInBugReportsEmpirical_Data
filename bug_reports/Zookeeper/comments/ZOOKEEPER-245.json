[This patch addresses the comments, specifically:

1) updated readme to point to existing docs. this was essentially a duplicate
anyway, now just points to the local docs/index.html (getting started has the detail)

2) update c readme, there was some pretty old sourceforge stuff there

3) updated admin and started to reflect running from release tar, rather than src., +1 for the patch... , I just committed this.
