[Recently Apache Hadoop upgraded ZooKeeper from 3.4.8 to 3.4.13 due to security concern (HADOOP-15816). And then ZK tests fail because Hadoop is using Curator 2.12.0 (YARN-8937)., Thanks [~ajisakaa] for bringing this issue to our notice

getQuorumPeer method was added to inject custom QuorumPeer in test classes. I think adding this method does not violate any backward compatibility requirement. It is completely co-incident that curator had exactly same method name.
 
I see you have changed method name in curator to getTestingQuorumPeer.
What change you want to see in ZooKeeper. Do you want to rename getQuorumPeer method to something else., Thanks [~arshad.mohammad] for the reply.
bq. What change you want to see in ZooKeeper. Do you want to rename getQuorumPeer method to something else.
Yes. I want to rename getQuorumPeer method to something else., Logically, for this issue change should be done only in curator, not in ZooKeeper. Problem is there because the way ZooKeeper is used by curator.

I want to understand how to avoid this problem from zookeeper side. Shall I check before creating new method whether same method is available or not in the downstream projects? I don’t think this is logical thing.

Any thoughts on how to avoid this kind of issues in future?, bq. Shall I check before creating new method whether same method is available or not in the downstream projects? I don’t think this is logical thing.
Agreed.

IMO, if using module, we can avoid this kind of issues in future. http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/, This problem is likely to be fixed by Apache Curator side, so closing this.]
