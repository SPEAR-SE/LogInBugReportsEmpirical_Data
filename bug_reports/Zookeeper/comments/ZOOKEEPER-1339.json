This message is automatically generated., Hi Eric,

Good catch! It looks like gcc doesn't inline when -O0 is given (which is the case with --enable-debug), and it doesn't compile extern inline functions by themselves. Using static inline is the right way to go.

http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Inline.html

The patch isn't applying because it includes some extra lines. Could you update the patch?

Thanks!
--Michi, Hi Michi,

Thanks for your reply. Would you mind to explain something about the 'extra lines'? I just changed the two related lines and generated the patch by git command, no manual operations.

Regards,
Eric, Hi Eric,

Sorry I meant extra slashes. You probably need to use --no-prefix option.

{code}
git diff --no-prefix > my.patch
{code}

To verify that the patch applies cleanly, go to the top directory in svn and run:

{code}
patch -p0 < my.patch
{code}

Thanks!
--Michi, strip additional slashes in previous patch, Hi Michi,

A new version patch was submitted following your suggestions, please check it.

Regards,
Eric, Hi Eric,

The patch looks good. I'll check this in.

Thanks!

, If using static inline in hashtable_itr.h, we may want to delete same definition in hashtable_itr.c. Otherwise we got these errors

, Looks like changing extern inline to static inline introduced some other compilation error. 

--Michi, ... or not. 

--Michi, It works well. Forget my comment which mixed with local change., I'm backporting this to 3.4 and 3.3 branches.
