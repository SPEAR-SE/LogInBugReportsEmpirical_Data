[What is the latency of the network? Try compare the latency with initLimit / syncLimit see if they are at similar scale. If not (for example if network is slow try increase initLimit/syncLimit see if that alleviate the problem).
In certain cases due to ZOOKEEPER-900 / 901 the leader election might takes a long time to finish., I kept the defaults for initLimit and syncLimit in that case. When downgrading to ZooKeeper 3.4 leader election works perfectly (also using the defaults for that attributes). However, checking that by increasing these values might be reasonable as a next step I guess., I am also seeing exactly same issue
