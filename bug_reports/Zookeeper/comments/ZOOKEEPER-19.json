[Patch submitted on SF at:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1986201&group_id=209147&atid=1008546, What is the status of jute? Is it worth porting this patch? Or should I just close this issue and wait for a replacement to jute?, i would suggest clsoing this patch for now. We intend to replace Jute sometime in the future.
, By Mahadev's suggestion, I'm closing this issue for now.]
