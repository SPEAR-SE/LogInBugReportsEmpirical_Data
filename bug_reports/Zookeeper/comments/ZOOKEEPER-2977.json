[To avoid this issue, below method can return copy of authinfo:

org.apache.zookeeper.server.ServerCnxn.addAuthInfo(Id){

    //return Collections.unmodifiableList(authInfo);

    return Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList(authInfo));

}, Hi [~sumitagrawal]

I think this a great fix and it looks like it has been accidentally fixed in 3.5 and master branches by ZOOKEEPER-1525.

Would you mind creating a Pull Request on GitHub and possibly put together a small unit test to validate the behaviour?, Hi [~andorm]

Attached the patch with test case as similar to other test cases. Please suggest changes related to test case if needed., Thanks [~sumitagrawal]

Would you please kindly create a pull request on github, so that more eyes of the community could see it?

Thanks!, GitHub user sumitagrawl opened a pull request:

, Hi [~andorm],

Please help in getting reviewed., Github user anmolnar commented on the issue:

    @sumitagrawl Thanks for opening this pull request and thanks for the contribution.
    This stuff with the test looks good to me.
    Given that this is a fix in base class (ServerCnxn) rather than the NIO implementation, have you considered adding similar test to Netty as well?
    It might be even better to have a separate test file for the common code, so we don't have to replicate tests every time we test something in here.
    What do you think?

    @sumitagrawl Good analysis and fix. Few minor comments,
    - Please take care indentation in the tests.  Presently, it uses tab.
    - Please add comments in test as a quick reference to the issue to show the expectations and background of this test,  something like, https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/DataTreeTest.java#L70
    - break; is not needed in loop, pls remove.

    @rakeshadr @anmolnar @afine 
    Changes are done creating separate ServerCnxnTest.java for this purpose to avoid test duplicates. Also all above review comments are handled.
