This message is automatically generated., cancelling the patch... looks like getaddrinfo() does not set the errno value. So, we will have to set it manually in case of error conditions from getaddrinfo(), this patch should fix the issue.

This message is automatically generated., looks good mahadev. thanx for fixing. one problem:

{quote}
             LOG_ERROR(("getaddrinfo: %s\n", strerror(errno)));
+            errno = getaddrinfo_errno(rc);
{quote}

should be

{quote}
+            errno = getaddrinfo_errno(rc);
             LOG_ERROR(("getaddrinfo: %s\n", strerror(errno)));
{quote}

any idea why the test is failing?, cancelling patch, hudson fails with:

     [exec]      [exec] Zookeeper_simpleSystem::testIPV6 : assertion : elapsed 1000

....

     [exec]      [exec] /grid/0/hudson/hudson-slave/workspace/Zookeeper-Patch-h8.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/trunk/src/c/tests/TestClient.cc:582: Assertion: assertion failed [Expression: zk]

     [exec]      [exec] make: *** [run-check] Error 1, the issue is problem with getaddrinfo implementaiton on the hudson machine. According to the spec getaddrinfo should work on a ipv6 host with ai_flags=AI_ADDRCONFIG and ai_family=AF_UNSPEC, but looks like it returns EAI_ADDRFAMILY. 

I put in a retry with ai_flags=0 in case of the above errors. It seems like its a good optimization to use AI_ADDRCONFIG for AF_UNSPEC

http://www.ops.ietf.org/lists/v6ops/v6ops.2003/msg01377.html, so a retry should make it work in case of such faulty implementations of getaddrinfo., the earlier patch doesnt compile on hudson machine and needs specific include for netdb,h header file., this patch adds a gcc parameter so that all the return codes of getaddrinfo are defined. the tests pass on the hudson machine now., Fixed a problem on my machine (ubuntu karmic) - missing EAI_NODATA check., -1 overall.
