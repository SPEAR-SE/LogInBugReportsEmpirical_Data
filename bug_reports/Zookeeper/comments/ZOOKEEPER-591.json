[The reason of the deadlock is that the io thread didn't check whether there is some sync commands still in processing, before it returned. I think some kind of pending sync commands and thread mutex should be added to make sure the zookeeper handler can be closed properly. Has anyone have a look at this bug yet?, Upping the priority and assigning to 3.3.0, ben, did you get a chance to take a look at it ?, looking at the code, it looks like that there is a race condition wherein after free_completions is called by do_io(), calls could still be queued, which will cause the above problem to happen. I am attachign a patch which will not allow calls to be queued as soon as zookeeper_close() is callled.

Qian, can you try out this patch and post the results. Its not possible to write a unit test for this., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
