[Hi [~xiaoheipangzi]

Thanks for the nice contribution, I really appreciate your enthusiasm to develop such a handy tool.

However, have you checked if it would be possible to similar check with our existing static analysis tool, findbugs?

In addition to that, there's an ongoing effort in [https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/490] to integrate Google's error prone compiler for very similar purposes. I'm not sure if you've seen that, but I think it worth to consider bringing these existing tools up to speed before implementing something new from scratch., Hi [~andorm]

Thinks for your pertinent suggestions.

I develop this tool from scratch because: 
 # I apply  findbugs to check this bug ,  but findbugs leave it out(I assume because it does not perform  interprocedural  analysis in this check).
 # i am not  very familiar with findbugs and  Google's error prone .
 # [WALA|https://github.com/wala/WALA](a famous static analysis tool developed by IBM) is my sidekicks, I have developed some static analysis tool based on  it , so I choose it again.

I will try my best to check if findbugs own this rule(eg. callee return null but caller does not check), if not, i will try my best to add this rule.

Anyway, I develop this tool based on my finding of zookeeper-3006 and _[Alibaba Java Coding Guidelines|https://github.com/alibaba/p3c]_ which clearly indicates that callee can return null but caller must check it.

On the other hand, massive non-null checker also bother me, just as talk in [Avoiding != null statements|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/271526/avoiding-null-statements/271874#271874] . Now i am at the crossroads(+)

[https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/525], I committed your patch to 3.5 and master, and leave this issue resolved for now.

The same problem existing in 3.4, however there is a little more work required to properly structure the exception handling in 3.4 so it's on par with 3.5. [~xiaoheipangzi] if you are interested, you can send a pull request targeting branch-3.4 with your fix (and make sure the exception is caught and socket closed etc). , FAILURE: Integrated in Jenkins build ZooKeeper-trunk #62 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/62/])
