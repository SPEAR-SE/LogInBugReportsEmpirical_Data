[As Henry suggested, if I see self-contained task I'll use ZOOKEEPER-704 as umbrella ticket., Hi Sergey - 

Can you attach the logs from (at least) the leader node to this ticket? I'd like to figure this one out asap.

cheers,
Henry, Logs, Sergey - 

In the cfg files for nodes 3 and 5, did you include the following line? 

peerType=observer

See http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.3.0/zookeeperObservers.html for details. The observer log contains this line:

2010-05-06 22:46:00,876 - INFO  [QuorumPeer:/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:2183:QuorumPeer@642] - FOLLOWING

which is a big red flag because observers should never adopt the FOLLOWING state. 

If I don't have that line I can reproduce your issue. If I add it, the observers work as expected. Can you check your cfg files?

cheers,
Henry, Henry, you're right. I overlooked to add "peerType".

Anyway, wouldn't it be better if server warned about such inconsistency in a config?
It can infer from servers list that it should be an observer, so it could either WARN in logs that "peerType=observer" is missing, or just make itself an observer.
, Simple patch as per my suggestion above. 
(In git format. LMK if it's not acceptable.), reopening to improve the config parsing, Hi Sergey, thanks for the patch, see this page for details on contributing:
http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/HowToContribute

git is fine, but you need to use the "--no-prefix" option when doing the diff, otw the patch will fail with the automated verification of the patch.

also, in future it's good to name the patch after the jira ie ZOOKEEPER-769.patch, it helps reviewers and makes easier to keep track of many patches.

Regards., Sergey - 

Great, thanks for making this patch! ISTR there was some reason why we didn't infer peerType from the servers list, but I can't remember what it was...

As for your patch, a few small comments:

1. Use --no-prefix and just attach the output of git-diff (no mail headers etc) - Hudson is rather picky about the patch formats it can apply
2. It would be great to include a test that reads a configuration and checks that the behaviour is correct
3. If the peerTypes don't match up, should we default to the server list (on the assumption that that will be consistent across all servers)?
4. Once you've added the patch, click 'submit patch' to start Hudson moving.

cheers,
Henry, New patch, formatted with --no-prefix.

In case of inconsistency peerType is set to one from the servers list.

Thanks for your patience!

Henry, I made a few small changes to your patch to make the logic a little easier to follow. Take a look and let me know if you think this is ok, otherwise I'll commit the patch tomorrow. Thanks!

This message is automatically generated., Failures do not look related to this patch (although I could be mistaken). ZkDatabaseCorruptionTest is the most recent broken test - passes fine for me locally?, Hudson seems to be having problems these days, 2 of the machines (h7/h8) have been offline all week, and h1 seems to be having issues as well. I think the failure is unrelated. ff to commit., I just committed this - thanks Sergey!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #831 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/831/])
