[I'm not sure this will fix the issue.  IP address spoofing is rather simple to do.  You are not guaranteed to get a result back, but for 4 letter commands doing DoS you really don't care all that much.  In fact it might be better because you don't have to worry about your node being bogged down with responses from someone else.

If we restrict it to the loopback device or something like that, it is much more likely to restrict bad users., Thanks [~revans2] for the information. yes, IP based restriction will not be effective., Currently 4lw commands are executed without authentication and command white-listing mechanism is available to control DoS.  But I think still Authentication should be supported for example IP based as mentioned in this JIRA ...  Is there any other way of authentication ?]
