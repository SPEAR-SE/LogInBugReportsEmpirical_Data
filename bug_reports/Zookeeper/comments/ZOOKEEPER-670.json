[Henry can you take a look at this one?, Not a blocker, pushing to 3.4.0, It seems like this is no longer an issue on the trunk (fixed by ZOOKEEPER-888). I've run {{zk.py}} against the latest version and I see no segfault but unfortunately on the 3.3 branch it still crashes. , not a blocker. Moving it out of 3.4 release., This issue has been fixed in 3.4 by ZOOKEEPER-888.]
