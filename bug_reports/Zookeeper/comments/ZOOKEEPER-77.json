[According to the stack trace the line causing the problem is:

    a_.writeString(path,"path");

in watcher event.

Should it ever be the case that the path can be null?

We should look at the static code analysis output to see if this is flagged.
, Assigning to Ben as this seems related to ZOOKEEPER-16, I can confirm that the reason is a null path. if I set the path to a default string in case it is null the NPE is gone., Dup of ZOOKEEPER-16 - I've updated 16 to make sure that as part of path checking we verify that the path is non-null.]
