This message is automatically generated., +1 thanks Alex., trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1587335, FAILURE: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2290 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2290/])
ZOOKEEPER-1357. Zab1_0Test uses hard-wired port numbers. Specifically, it uses the same port for leader in two different tests. The second test periodically fails complaining that the port is still in use. (Alexander Shraer via michim) (michim: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1587335)
