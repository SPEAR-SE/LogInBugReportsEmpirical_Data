[Thanks [~benjamin.jaton] for reporting this, though it seems not a defect. I think your standalone zookeeper is not really standalone other wise it could have not opened quorum peer communication and leader election ports. 
Please provide bellow information to further 
# quorum configuration of A and B 
Example:
{code}
server.1=host1:2888:3888:participant
server.2=host2:2889:3889:participant
{code}
#  Do you have bellow configuration in your standalone server? what is the configured value?
## dynamicConfigFile
## standaloneEnabled
## server.x, OK I apologize for the confusion, I didn't think about the standaloneEnabled flag.
I meant standalone as "not in a cluster", but *I do set standaloneEnabled=false* because the goal is to add other nodes to form a 3 nodes cluster.

Before B joins A here is the configuration:

node A has:
{code}standaloneEnabled=false
dynamicConfigFile=/tmp/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg.dynamic{code}
{code}server.1=hostA:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181
version=100000000{code}

node B has:
{code}standaloneEnabled=false
dynamicConfigFile=/tmp/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg.dynamic.1000004dc{code}
{code}server.1=hostA:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181
server.2=hostB:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181
version=1000004dc{code}

, # Thanks [~benjamin.jaton] for providing configuration details, with these configurations the issue is getting reproduced.
# Another observation is, A becomes leader but B is still unable to join quorum.
# In my opinion, this an issue and it should be addressed.
# But, this is totally different issue from ZOOKEEPER-832. It is better to handle this issue separately as part of this jira ZOOKEEPER-2273. [~benjamin.jaton] do you have specific reason to club this issue with ZOOKEEPER-832
, In my tests I believe that B does join the quorum. Both nodes eventually end up with :
{code}server.1=hostA:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181
server.2=hostB:2888:3888:participant;0.0.0.0:2181{code}

I have taken the patch proposed in ZOOKEEPER-832 and it does resolve this issue.
