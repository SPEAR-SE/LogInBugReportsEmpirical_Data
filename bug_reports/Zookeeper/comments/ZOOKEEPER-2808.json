This message is automatically generated., [~hanm] we can clear the ACL of the config node after clear the datatree at the beginning of the deserialization, what I did in the patch is creating a 'clean' config node every time we call addConfigNode., [~lvfangmin] Sounds good to me. It is a clean solution. 
[~rakeshr] Could you please add [~lvfangmin] to contributor list and assign this issue to him?, Github user hanm commented on the issue:
