[I think I found the problem, please see the analysis. In this case, snapshotting has happened and created new log file. But the rolledover log file is kept open, this is causing the test case failure.

FileTxnLog.java
{code}
    public synchronized void rollLog() throws IOException {
        if (logStream != null) {
            this.logStream.flush();
            this.logStream = null;
            oa = null;
        }
    }
    public synchronized void close() throws IOException {
        if (logStream != null) {
            logStream.close();
        }
{code}

Following logs shows the rollover and snapshot operations:

{noformat}, Thanks for looking at the analysis. Sorry for the delay as am busy with internal schedules, actually the test case is failing in the trunk for the following reason.

ZKDatabase#getProposalsFromTxnLog is not closing the iterator which had opened. I prepared initial draft patch to understand the problem.
[~michim] Could you please apply in your env and see the test case is passing consistently.
{code}
itr = snapLog.readTxnLog(startZxid, false);
{code}

Also, in the patch I kept iterator closure inside TxnLogProposalIterator#remove, becuase I failed to find better way to close the iterator:(. Alternate apporach I'm thinking is instanceof check and implement  TxnLogProposalIterator#close api, but this also feel not good.

This message is automatically generated., Is this for 3.5.0 only?, Hi [~fpj], [~michim], [~phunt], 
Actually I've observed the following two cases:

# FileTxnLog.java - 'logStream' is not getting closed after the rollover. I have seen it is not affecting anywhere, because there is 'streamsToFlush' collection in place, which will be closed always. I think logStream#closure is good to have kind of. In my patch I didn't included this change and after the discussion if required will modify the patch with 'logStream#close'.
# FileTxnIterator is keeping PositionInputStream reference and is not closed properly in many places.

As [~michim] mentioned earlier, the test case is failing only in trunk, but this is an issue for 3.4.6 as well. IMHO, FileTxnIterator closure needs improvement in both 3.4 branch as well as trunk., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Attached latest patch, includes following changes:
FilTxneSnapLog#restore - closed iterator in finally block
LearnerHandler - Provided conditional closing by using instanceof TxnLogProposalIterator checks. Also added one test case for covering this logic.

This message is automatically generated.,  Hi Michi/Flavio/Patrick,

Could you please review the latest patch. I feel this should go to 3.4 branch as well, shall I mark fix for 3.4 and move this to the sub-task of ZOOKEEPER-1833. If you agree, I'll upload the patch for 3.4 branch version, once I get a +1 for the trunk patch., Hi All, The same is failing in latest trunk build also and if we push this in, it will reduce one test failure and will make one step ahead to a clean build.

https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-WinVS2008_java/651/testReport/junit/org.apache.zookeeper.test/TruncateTest/testTruncate/, This one is marked for 3.4.6, but it only has a trunk patch. [~rakeshr], do you have a 3.4 patch for this one?, ok. I'll get the 3.4 patch in sometime., [~fpj] Thanks for the interest. Attached branch 3.4 patch, could you please look at it.
Also, I had done the following changes in existing trunk patch.
 - Modified String concatenation in logs
- Modified TruncateTest.java by including verification for zkdb#truncateLog , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
