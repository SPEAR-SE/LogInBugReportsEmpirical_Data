Ant task 'compile_jute' doesn't trigger ivy-init.

Run 'ant clean compile-test' or 'ant clean jar' first. Jute compilation will be triggered in both.

What would you like to achieve?, Hi Andor Molnar,

    Thanks for solution. it seems issue has been resolved.

    According to REDAME of [https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/tree/master/src/c]

    step 1 in INSTALLATION mentioned that  *ant compile_jute* command creates 'generated' folder.

    but because of above error the folder was unable to create., [~adityap]

I see, that must be a documentation error. Let me follow up on this and fix it.

Thanks for the heads-up., I think 'build-generated' task would be a good replacement in the docs.

[~adityap] Would you please give it a try?, * As mentioned in on GitHub zookeeper [page|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/tree/master/src/c], I could build zookeeper 3.4.10  using command : *‘ant compile_jute’*. However, same command is not working with zookeeper 3.4.11.  below are the steps followed: 
{noformat}
git clone https://github.com/apache/zookeeper
cd zookeeper
git checkkout tags/release-3.4.10  ### tags/release-3.4.11  for v3.4.11
ant compile_jute   ### works for v3.4.10 however not working for v3.4.11
cd src/c
ACLOCAL="aclocal -I /usr/share/aclocal" autoreconf -if
./configure && make && sudo make install
sudo make distclean
{noformat}
With ‘ant compile_jute’ facing an issue mentioned in description. 

* So , As suggested by you, I have used *‘ant clean jar’*  command v 3.4.11 which worked. Thanks for the help.
New set of instructions for v3.4.11:  
{noformat}
git clone https://github.com/apache/zookeeper
cd zookeeper
git checkkout tags/release-3.4.11
ant clean jar 
cd src/c
ACLOCAL="aclocal -I /usr/share/aclocal" autoreconf -if
./configure && make && sudo make install
sudo make distclean
{noformat}

* Also, I tried to use command *‘ant build-generated’*  for v3.4.11 but unfortunately it gives me the same error : *
