[Could you check if you still have this problem with trunk, Jeffrey? We have improved that test in ZOOKEEPER-1292 but it got only to trunk. If necessary, we can think of porting it to the 4.2 branch.
, The test case failed in trunk as well on windows. Sometimes failed with a different error(shown below) than the "Leader hasn't joined" error. How do you think to remove the lead thread alive check from the 3.4 test case as it should be covered in the majority verification? Thanks.

, I haven't had a chance to run on a windows box yet, but the message you have above says that it didn't get a majority, so it's not that the leader hasn't joined. In any case, do you understand the reason why it fails on windows and not in other environments? Perhaps looking at the logs will give us some insight., {bq}

In trunk, it failed before the test can reach "Leader hasn't joined" verification because assert failed in step "Fewer than a a majority has joined".

The reason failed on windows is that windows quit a thread as soon as the thread function exits while it seems doesn't happen on a linux box., I ran it and checked the logs. The triple election test is just not completing. It goes through the first and the second rounds, but after the second leader dies, it doesn't elect the third. It needs some more investigation, I don't think removing the check as you suggest actually fixes it. , Yes, trunk has other issues running on windows. Removing the check is only for 3.4 test case. [~fpj] are you planning to attack this for trunk? otherwise, I'll try to dig the issue with my limited zookeeper knowledge., If you have cycles to look into it, please go ahead. There are other issues I'm looking into, so some help would be welcome., [~enis] found that cause. Basically windows run of testTripleElection took more than 10 secs. After bumping up waitCounter to 200, FLETest passes consistently. I'll try to create a patch to port zookeeper-1292 to 3.4. Meanwhile I'll check why windows run takes longer than linux and may open another JIRA. Thanks., Actually after bumping up the waitCounter, "Fewer than a a majority has joined" failure is gone while I still got "Leader hasn't joined" randomly in test case testSingleElection , testDoubleElection or testTripleElection. I think we should remove the check which doesn't verify any thing more., Thanks for looking into it, Jeffrey. Are we still talking about the 3.4 branch or this is about trunk too? Here are a couple of comments:

- On top of making sure that a quorum leaves leader election, we should also check that the leader ends up thinking that it is the leader. It is a simple sanity check and I don't see a reason for removing it if we are not talking about the test failures on Windows.
- If you're still focusing on the 3.4, then the best path I can see is to apply ZOOKEEPER-1292 to branch 3.4. If it still doesn't work in trunk, as we have observed, then we need to work on a patch on top ZOOKEEPER-1292. I'm not comfortable removing checks, though, unless it is clear that it is not verifying anything., The patch fixes two issues:

1) Thread racing issue. In the test case we have the following:
{code}
   ... 
   self.notify();                 
   /*
    * I'm done so joining. 
    */
   ...
   break;
{code}

Basically we notify main thread before current LEThread exit(the break statement). While the main thread could execute verification step before thread exit depending on thread scheduling. This would fail the test.

In addition, we check thread.alive isn't accurate because we have other scenarios that a thread could die.

2) Increasing wait for the test running on slow boxes.
