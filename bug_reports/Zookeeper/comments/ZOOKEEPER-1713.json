[German, Do you want to propose a patch? This is an easy one., Yes I would and yes it should be easy :)


, It seems that the nanosecs value affected by this problem is always 0 in my machine, so there is actually no difference. But I guess that for those machines that provide a value there will be.
This means I haven't been able to check that there was a problem and it was removed, although it seems obvious in the code. I did test that zkfuse worked ok after (and in my case also before) the patch was applied., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
