[i'm not sure we want to remove this. the NoSyncConnected state is to indicated that you have connected to a server that is not synced with the rest of the cluster. the state held by the server is valid but could be stale and the server will reject any change requests. we don't support it now which is why it is not used, but we may sometime., not a blocker for 3.2, moving to 3.3, removing the fix release spec for the time being - we probably don't want to do this till v4 timeframe anyway as it's non-b/w compat.]
