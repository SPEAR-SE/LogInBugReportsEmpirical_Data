    Notice that the release audit jars are being dumped into build/lib - I'd recommend we fix that as part of this patch as well.

    the reports are output to build/test/owasp/ in order to match what we do with clover

    Looks like similar issue (exclusion) with slf4j-api and log4j. Can you clean those up as well?
