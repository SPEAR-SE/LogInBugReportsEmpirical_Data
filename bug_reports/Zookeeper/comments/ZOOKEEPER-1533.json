--Michi, I just did this for all of my current issues with outstanding patches. I didn't know that part of the workflow., BTW, thanks for helping me with the workflow., The patch looks good to me. Could you also fix this existing typo?

<listitem><para>then name of a znode - the one to be watched</para></listitem>

should be:

<listitem><para>the name of a znode - the one to be watched</para></listitem>

--Michi, Fixed a requested typo. Also, fixed the whitespace (changed tabs to spaces) around the affected markup to be consistent with other parts in the file., +1

Thanks for the patch Warren. I'll check this in.
