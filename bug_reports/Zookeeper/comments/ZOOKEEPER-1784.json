This message is automatically generated., [~shralex]: so that code path, processing INFORMANDACTIVATE, doesn't have (it seems) a corresponding test case. Should we add one or extend an existing one to cover it?, I actually was just looking at this. 

The reconfig tests apparently are not testing the COMMITANDACTIVATE or OBSERVEANDACTIVATE paths in syncwithleader currently (I had a test where a server misses a reconfig and learns about it later but apparently its not through this code path). The only test that I see using the INFORMANDACTIVATE path is Zab1_0Test (testNormalObserverRun) For the COMMITANDACTIVATE its FollowerResyncConcurrencyTest, QuorumTest and Zab1_0Test

We should try to understand how the tests above are activating these paths., [~shralex] is this something we need to consider for 3.5? How big of an issue is it?, [~phunt], [~shralex]: note that we can maybe fix the typo for 3.5.0 and punt on adding the tests?, I like Raul's proposal. We definitely need to fix the typo for 3.5.0, but we can have a separate JIRA to add tests separately.

This message is automatically generated., [~shralex] yeah, this can be tested independently like Zab1_0Test #testObserverConversation(). The defect scenario path occurs during the initial observer to leader sync up, I also feel its difficult to test through reconfig tests., -1 overall.

, [~shralex]
I realize this patch is missing in branch-3.5.
Is it on purpose?, BTW, the fix-versions says "3.5.1".
I think it should also go into branch-3.5, Should go to branch-3.5 as well. , done. thanks for noticing this. ]
