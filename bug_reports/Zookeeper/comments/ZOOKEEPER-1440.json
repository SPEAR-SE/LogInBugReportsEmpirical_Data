, I think we need to revert this commit. The patch as committed introduces a socket leak - there is a race condition where 1) the run method could be processing a socket operation that throws an ioexception, and 2) the shutdown flag being set. As a result we might not close the socket.
, I see it - I'll work on a new patch, Previous patch introduced socket leaks. This patch should be better., Focus this change solely on the spurious error messages., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
