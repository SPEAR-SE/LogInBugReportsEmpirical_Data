I'll commit it once I hear back from you., Revised patch builds fine on the following non-x86 architectures: armel, armhf and powerpc.

See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/zookeeper/3.3.4+dfsg1-2ubuntu4 for details.

Also builds just fine on x86 as well!, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
