[Hi Johan,

Could you provide a patch for this? I think the package should depend on the virtual package java6-runtime instead of a specific jre.

Also, please note that we are deprecating deb/rpm package support in 3.5 in favor of bigtop.

This message is automatically generated., Regarding 'tests included':
Could not find any automated tests for the packages build.
It has manually been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (single zookeeper) I will test cluster as well. But packaes installs fine now., [~fpj] I have not looked into the BigTop build that closely. But it looks like it will include a to large package set for production use. I will look at BigTop when I have time and if I can get the BigTop packages working it is fine by me.

I am only interested in a working deb package..., [~fpj] I have not looked into the BigTop build that closely. But it looks like it will include a to large package set for production use. I will look at BigTop when I have time and if I can get the BigTop packages working it is fine by me.

I am only interested in a working deb package..., Cluster works fin as well on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Given the packaging has been removed as of ZOOKEEPER-1604 I'm closing this. Please use Bigtop for ZK packaging.]
