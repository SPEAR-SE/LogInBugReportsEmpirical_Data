[Amith, this seems to be encoding issue.
Can you please provide the encoding on server and client side., Lakshman i have used UTF-8 on both client and server side
, Got it. This is not a problem with encoding.

ZooKeeper always deals with byte array as data.

You are using third party library ZKClient. It provides some user friendly APIs to deal with Objects rather than byte array. This library internally takes care of serializing the input data and send to ZooKeeper in byte array form. So, when you serialize a String object it contains some extra binary information like type info

Reason why this is not happening in cli mode is "In cli mode its directly persisting the String.getBytes rather than persisting in the serialized form."

, Not an issue. Please feel free to reopen the issue if you still see some problem.]
