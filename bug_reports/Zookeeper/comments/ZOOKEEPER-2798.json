    ZOOKEEPER-2798 Fix flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ReadOnlyModeTest.testConnectionEvents

    When a client connection occurs, the `ClientCnxn`'s `state` is changed and then a watcher event is queued. This test is unreliable because it expects the watcher to fire immediately after the state changes. This test adds a `CountDownLatch` to the watcher, to  better track when it has been fired. 
    
    This flaky test can be reliably reproduced by adding a `Thread.sleep` right before `states.add(event.getState());`.

    One nit : now there are three variables that encode the connection state and three waitForxxxConnected functions. These could be refactored so we use a single variable and a parameterized function to encode the state and state changes.

    lgtm. One nit, could be done in this patch or separately. Up to you @afine.
