Thanks for your interest; please see https://reviews.apache.org/r/1959/

-Eugene, Hi Patrick, 

As with ZOOKEEPER-1181, I would like to lobby for this to be in 3.4.0. This fix addresses a significant functional bug in SASL authentication.

Review request for zookeeper.


Changes
-------

add link to JIRA.


Summary
-------

There are 3 places where ClientCnxn should queue a AuthFailed event if client fails to authenticate. Without sending this event, clients may be stuck watching for a SaslAuthenticated event that will never come (since the client failed to authenticate).

This patch fixes SaslAuthFailTest.testBadSaslAuthNotifiesWatch() to test for the AuthFailed event : previously, the test was incorrectly not testing for this event.

It also removes the testBadSaslAuthNotifiesWatch() method from the SaslAuthTest class : this method belongs in SaslAuthFailTest, not SaslAuthTest. The former tests unsuccessful SASL authentication; the latter, successful SASL authentication. 


This addresses bug ZOOKEEPER-1185.

Testing
-------

All unit tests pass. Also tested with an HBase cluster with an hbase shell running as an unauthenticated Zookeeper client. As expected, hbase shell could not access cluster, but, as expected, did not hang.


Thanks,

Eugene

, Eugene,
 Just a minor nit, commented on the review board. Other than that it looks good. Ill go ahead and commit it to 3.4 and 3.5 as soon as its updated.

thanks!, Hi Mahadev, I didn't see your comment on https://reviews.apache.org/r/1959/ - did you not publish it perhaps?
-Eugene, patch that fixes the following statement in ClientCnxn.java from:

{code}
if ((p.ctx == null) || (clientCnxn.zooKeeperSaslClient == null) ||
                              (clientCnxn.zooKeeperSaslClient.getSaslState() == ZooKeeperSaslClient.SaslState.FAILED))
{code}

to 
{code}
if ((clientCnxn == null) || (clientCnxn.zooKeeperSaslClient == null) ||
                              (clientCnxn.zooKeeperSaslClient.getSaslState() == ZooKeeperSaslClient.SaslState.FAILED))
{code}, Just committed this. Thanks Eugene. I ran tests manually to make sure my changes were fine., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
