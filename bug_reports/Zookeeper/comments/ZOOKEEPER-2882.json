Similar for ZOOKEEPER-2883., i just added close_buffer_oarchive(&oa, 1); statement after default: statement in zoo_amulti(), when i executed ant test on windows 10 OS, it showed following failed message:

BUILD FAILED
\zookeeper\zookeeper\build.xml:1339: The following error occurred while executing this line:
\zookeeper\zookeeper\build.xml:1220: The following error occurred while executing this line:
\zookeeper\zookeeper\build.xml:1224: Tests failed!

Total time: 551 minutes 16 seconds

how to solve it?, {{Total time: 551 minutes 16 seconds}}

It's the first time I've ever seen unit tests took this long :)

The error message here indicates that some, if not all of the tests were failing. That is not cool, but usually OK as we have some flaky tests. Were you able to identify which tests were failing? 

Another suggestion is - since you are making change to C client, you can just run C tests and skip java tests. Something like:
{{ant test-core-cppunit}}, when i executed ant test-core-cppunit command, it showed me following error message:

BUILD FAILED

d:\niugx\work\zookeeper\zookeeper\build.xml:1285: The following error occurred while executing this line:
d:\niugx\work\zookeeper\zookeeper\build.xml:1277: Execute failed: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "autoreconf" (in directory "d:\niugx\work\zookeeper\zookeeper\src\c"): CreateProcess error=2, 系统找不到指定的文件。

        at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Execute.launch(Execute.java:426)

so, whether i need to do something (e.g. initialize or configure ) before executing ant test-core-cppunit?, when i executed ant test-core-cppunit command, it showed me following error message:

so, whether i need to do something (e.g. initialize or configure ) before executing ant test-core-cppunit?, Looks like you did not have autoconf installed, which is required to run C client / unit tests. We don't have terribly good document on c client regarding set up dev env, but this link was what I followed and found useful: http://wiki.wsmoak.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=browse&diff=1&id=ZooKeeperBuild. If you are on other systems the steps should be similar....]
