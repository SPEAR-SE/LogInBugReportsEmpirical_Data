[Good catch, upload a patch if you have a chance to work on one, please. We have deprecated implementations 0 1 2 of leader election, so this parameter won't be necessary any longer in future releases. , Cancelling as there is no patch attached., I think this issue has been fixed in ZOOKEEPER-1932[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1932](commitId:a680655a3569) and the code about checking in the parseProperties() function in QuorumPeerConfig.java is here[https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeerConfig.java#L259].so its status should be changed to RESOLVED ]
