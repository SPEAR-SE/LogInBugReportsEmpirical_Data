[Could you please post a code snippet that reproduces this error?

Best,

Edward, {code:java}
import zookeeper

zk=zookeeper.init("localhost:2181")
stat, acl = zookeeper.get_acl(zk, "/")
zookeeper.create(zk, "/zk_imagesearch1", "fs", acl, 0)
{code}, [~lordofkey]

It's a zkpython snippet which cannot reproduce this error after I test.

The validity of ACL parameters (e.g. must be an ASCII string) should be checked in your client side.

do you test it on python3?

in my test, python2 is ok, and the error allways occurs in python3. in python3 there is no type of ASCII string

the solution has been pushed on github [https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/585]  , [~lordofkey]

sorry I test it with python2.will test with python3 later.

some problem with PR-585.The contributor guide is [here]([https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/HowToContribute])]

BTW,you can try to use *kazoo* when python3 don't work(:D)]
