[FollowerResyncConcurrencyTest is inherently a bit transient, but if you are seeing it fail regularly without any changes, please post the details.
QuorumTest should also not be failing.
I think these failures are due to changes you made in 1154, and probably due to errors in your code or the tests needing to be updated based on changes you made., Vishal, can you post the logs on the test failures? Does this happen on trunk as well? Or just 3.3 branch?, Thanks folks for looking at this. This is happening on trunk and I located the reason for some of the failures.

1. The timeouts were due to logging at DEBUG level, instead of default INFO. Once I bumped the logging level back down to the default, the tests are passing on my "fast" machine.
2. JVM crashes were mea culpa. They don't repro without my patch.
3. There are some tests (eg Netty hammer tests) which are timing out on a "slow" machine (ie my laptop). I will try bumping up their JUnit timeouts and see if I can get them to pass. 

Thanks!
