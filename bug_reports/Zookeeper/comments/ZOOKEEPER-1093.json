This message is automatically generated., I'd like to see this go into 3.4.0, I'm assuming that it's not possible to test (easily -- see testBadPeerAddressInQuorum if you want to try). Is the code exercised, what could we look at in the console output to verify?, Actually, this got fixed in ZOOKEEPER-1097, so I will close this up.]
