{code}, a simple fix. We are already guarded on our client and followerhandler ports. This one gurads against the quurom ports. I did write a test case, but havent been able to get it working since we unfortunately do not use FLE in most of our testing. I will try and upload a test case within a day!, added a testcase in QuorumpeerMainTest. , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Doesnt seem to be related to the patch but will have to take a closer look., The log also says this:
