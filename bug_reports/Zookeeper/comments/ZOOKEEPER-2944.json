    Throwing an exception sounds like a pretty reasonable thing to do, however it's probably client code dependent. Perhaps a note that this may (likely?) have to be handled as an error condition...
    
    I'll commit this in the mean time. Please feel free to followup with additional jiras as necessary/appropriate.
    
    Thanks!
