[Looks like this test was added via ZOOKEEPER-1413, Thawan can you take a look?, As part of fixing duplicate NEWLEADER packet (ZOOKEEPER-1324), lastProcessedZxid on each server can be different when the quorum start up and there is no new request (They may point to the last txn from the previous epoch). As shown in the log here

2013-10-24 10:42:07,301 [myid:] - INFO  [main:FollowerResyncConcurrencyTest@588] - Timeout waiting for zxid to sync: leader 0x100003ecc clean 0x200000000 restarted 0x100003ecc

I can switch to rely on other method to verify that all server has up-to-date data instead of checking lastProcessedZxid
