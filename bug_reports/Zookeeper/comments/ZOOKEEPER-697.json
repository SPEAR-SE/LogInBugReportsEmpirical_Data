[looks like a connectionloss error on the client side. I suspect that clover is making things too slow and causing connectionloss to happen. This mostly looks like a false alarm. We can certainly remove it as being a blocker.

, take a look at the end of the log. notice that the client is timing out after not hearing from the server for 20sec. then the server expires the session. there's no indication why this is happening. gc seems unlikely cause. why isn't the client reconnecting to another server? this seems similar to the asynchammer test failure in the sense that it looks like the server io pipe gets blocked up for some reason... it's vey weird., good point..... This is quite weird. , downgrading from blocker, haven't seen this again after many runs. we'll keep an eye but shouldn't block 3.3.0 (and may have been fixed), not a blocker for 3.3.0, tracking in 3.3.1. Have not seen these since, ie not reproduceable but let's keep an eye open., not a blocker. Moving it out of 3.4 release.]
