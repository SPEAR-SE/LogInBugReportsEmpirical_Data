[can I work on this issue?, hi  Prabhunath

I just run this command in my environment, the following is the output:

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 2] create / /.///
Node already exists: /

I didn't see any error or excepetion.

Did I miss anything?  or what version of zookeeper you are using?, The jira description says that the affected version is 3.3.3, which is fairly old. I can't think of any specific issue right now, but odds are that it has been fixed already. [~chenyuyun-emc] perhaps you can try with 3.3.3 to see if you can repro?, This is in 3.3.3 version ., I just checked this on Zookeeper 3.3.3 and start the zookeeper server , then run cli command:

[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 2] create / /.///
