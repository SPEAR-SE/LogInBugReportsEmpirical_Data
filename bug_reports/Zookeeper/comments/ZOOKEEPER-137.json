[This patch adds a new WatcherTest to verify the failure condition. I've updated the clientcnxn code (and zookeeper.java) to correctly materialize the watchers that need to process an incoming watch event.

All tests now pass, including the new test case that explicitly verifies this case.

Note: hudson has been seeing intermittent failures due to this issue. ClientTest was occasionally failing due to missing events., Please review and commit this., +1 Looks good, Committed revision 698734., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #94 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/94/]), 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
