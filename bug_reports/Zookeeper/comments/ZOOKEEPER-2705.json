[Hi [~stondofitz], 

Looks like you hit https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2464 that was recently fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2680 

TL;DR: {{DataNode.getChildren()}} could either return an empty collection or null, and this broke ContainerManager at line 151, as shown in your log.

Could you confirm it is the same issue, please?, Yeah this looks like the same issue. 

Is there any timeline for releasing 3.5.3?, I am afraid there's no timeline yet. But you can follow and engange on the undergoing discussion about 3.5.x release at zookeeper-user mailing list thread below.
