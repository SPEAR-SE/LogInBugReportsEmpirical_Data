[it still existed one random port in 3.4.10, it's no random jmx port., Not sure what you mean by "random". Could you elaborate? Perhaps show what is leading to you believe this?

I ran 3.4.10/jdk8 on ubuntu 17.04 and see the following:

{noformat}

my config is

{noformat}
clientPort=2181
server.1=localhost:3181:4181
server.2=localhost:3182:4182
server.3=localhost:3183:4183
{noformat}

This all looks fine to me. Nothing "random" that I noticed.
, Thx for your reply. It seems ok in your situation.
But i ran 3.4.8/jdk8 on CentOS 7.1 and see the following:
{code:java}
[root@zk146 ~]# netstat -ntlp
Active Internet connections (only servers)

[root@zk146 ~]# 
{code}

My config is:
{code:java}
server.148=zk148:2888:3888
server.146=zk146:2888:3888
server.147=zk147:2888:3888
{code}

My zookeeper process id is 29322, and there's a 34006 port listened on.

And, in your enviroment, your zookeeper process id is 19, and there's a 2183 port listened on which is not configed., I have three servers in the ensemble running on the single machine (17/18/19). The client ports are 2181/2182/2183 respectively. The quorum/election ports are similarly configured. I used configs generated from https://github.com/phunt/zkconf - perhaps the way you are starting the services is different. I'd recommend looking at the command lines used to start the java process. Perhaps you do a bit of analysis to find out which thread in the JVM is using that port, etc...., As you say, you running three servers on the single machine(17/18/19), there should be 9 ports listened on the single machine as followed:
{code:java}
for zk17: 2181 3181 4181
for zk18: 2182 3182 4182
for zk19: 2183 3183 4183
{code}
But i just fond zk19 is fine, zk18 and zk17 missing the port used for followers use to connect to the leader. 
I'm not sure whether my understanding is correct.
