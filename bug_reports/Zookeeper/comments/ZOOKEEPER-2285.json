# CI test report show that now {{org.apache.zookeeper.test.QuorumTest.testSessionMove()}} is not skipped, it is run and passed., Hello, I am collecting some bug reports from Apache Jira for analysis, the one's I'm trying to collect are the fixed and closed ones.

This message is automatically generated., +1 LGTM - though this skipped test seems not the deciding factor that causes pre-commit builds getting -1, but we should get this in as the test itself is legitimate (verified the patch with a 200 test runs for this specific test on my cluster.)., For the completeness's sake, copy the discussion from dev-list to here for the record..

- The skipped test does not cause a build failure. In fact, this same test has been skipped for the past 70+ pre-commit builds, among which there are a couple of succeeded ones [1].
- The failure of this pre-commit build (3302) is caused by build.xml:1605, according to Jenkins. It is not obvious to me what failed from the log though. Will dig deeper.

Regarding the skipped test, it's QuorumTest::testSessionMove
https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/test/QuorumTest.java#L253

This test (along with some others in QuorumTest) is ignored in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-733, because "session moved tests are currently ignored since they fail in netty. ". Then later, in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-907, all other ignored tests were activated, but not this one with no particular reason. I assume that just an overlook..

Also there is an existing JIRA about this skipped test, we should probably un-skip this test as it's legitimate.
