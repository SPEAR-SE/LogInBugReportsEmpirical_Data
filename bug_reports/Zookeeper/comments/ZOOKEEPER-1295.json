[If this value is different on client and server, is it not the case that "the system property must be set on all servers and clients otherwise problems will arise" as the document states?  I'd love to be able to change this without downtime to prevent occurrences of ZOOKEEPER-706 or HBASE-4246, [~davelatham] I'm also confused about this principle to set both servers an clients. What happens if we only set the server side?, ZOOKEEPER-2402 separates the jute.maxbuffer for client and server. Also default values are corrected. , This is already fixed as part of ZOOKEEPER-2402]
