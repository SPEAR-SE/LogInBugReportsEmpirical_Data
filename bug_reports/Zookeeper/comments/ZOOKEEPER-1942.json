In my case the exception stack trace is printed in the log repeatedly every few seconds, cluttering it up. A fix would be appreciated :-)

Regards, Hendrik, Can this make it into 3.5.0? It's a small and safe change..., [~amichai] could you produce a patch and start the workflow by clicking on "Submit patch" above?, This looks like it got fixed with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2056. Closing...., Great, thanks!

btw this bug says it's fixed in 3.5.2, and ZOOKEEPER-2056 says it's fixed in 3.5.1, while a final 3.5.0 has not been released yet... can someone explain why all these branches are developed in parallel and none released?, The fix bug field is irrelevant, I had changed it before [~misquith] noticed that it has been fixed. The fix version field in ZOOKEEPER-2056 is the one to refer to. 

The 3.5.1 release has been voted and we are just waiting the RM  ([~michim]) to come back from the dead and make it available. 3.4.7 is also waiting on the RM ([~rgs]) to generate a release candidate., So when can we expect any of the releases?
, [~amichai]: as soon as we get enough votes for 3.4.7-rc0:
