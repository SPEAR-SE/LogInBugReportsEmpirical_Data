[makring this to be fixed in 3.2. 3.0.1 has already been released., it just came to my mind that we put validating path at the client side in  ZOOKEEPER-16. can you try using 3.1* versions? you should get errors in both the cases in 3.1* versions.
, We started verifying paths in 3.1 - this is likely happening in 3.1.0+

We are checking the path and not handling the case where sequential flag is
specified, we need to check for this case. 

we should add tests specific to this case

one thing I noticed - validatepath was never intended to be part of the public API
this method should be made private, or moved out of ZooKeeper class ASAP, Confirmed same issue on 3.1.0, the fix for this is included in ZOOKEEPER-355
