    ZOOKEEPER-2837: Add a special START_SERVER_JVMFLAGS option only for `start` command to distinguish JVMFLAGS and SERVER_JVMFLAGS

    Add a special START_SERVER_JVMFLAGS option only for `start` command to distinguish JVMFLAGS and SERVER_JVMFLAGS. If we use the normal way to add JVM options with `JVMFLAGS` in `conf/java.env`, then it will effect almost all shell scripts under `bin` directory. Even if using `SERVER_JVMFLAGS` will effect some commands like `zkServer.sh status`, include four-letters commands.
    For example, if the JVMFLAGS is 
    ```bash
    export JVMFLAGS="-Xms3G -Xmx3G -Xmn1G -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=70 -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:-PrintGCTimeStamps -Xloggc:/home/zookeeper/logs/zookeeper_`date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S'`.gc -XX:-UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=10 -XX:GCLogFileSize=64M"
    ```
    then we will get too many GC log files due to using the `mntr` four-letters commands in some monitor situation.

    Even if had been fixed the issues by adding the `START_SERVER_JVMFLAGS` option, but i still don't understand why the execution of `mntr` 4lw command would use the `JVMFLAGS` option. I list the process call links about executing command, but still cannot figure out.
