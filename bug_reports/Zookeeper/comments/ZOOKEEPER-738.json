[The attached patch removes the extra semicolon after the call to JType.genCDecl (which comes with its own semicolon already):

src/java/main/org/apache/jute/compiler/JType.java:
 52         String genCDecl(String name) {
 53                 return "    " + mCName + " "+name+";\n";
 54         }

The attached diff is against http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/zookeeper/trunk at revision 932666 specifically.

(Regenerated the files like this: rm -rf src/{c,java}/generated/ && ant compile_jute)

Testing done: I diff:ed the C and Java files that "ant compile_jute" generates in the ZK tree *with* and *without* this patch applied, and I confirmed that the only difference between the two is that with the patch applied the extra semicolon is not present any more.  (Diff:ed like this: diff -ru src{.orig,}/c/generated/), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
