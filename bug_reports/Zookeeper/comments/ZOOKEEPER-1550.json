[Robert mentions in mailing list thread linked above that this bug happens on both Openjdk 6 and Openjdk 7 on Ubuntu and Debian Linux., It seems that, unlike Oracle's JDK 6, OpenJDK 6 returns a non-null value from javax.security.auth.login.Configuration.getConfiguration(), even if the user hasn't explicitly set a login configuration. This patch tests for both a non-null Configuration *and* the designated AppConfigurationEntry within that Configuration for the Zookeeper client. 

This fix is tested with OpenJDK 6:

{code}
java version "1.6.0_24"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.11.4) (amazon-52.1.11.4.46.amzn1-x86_64)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.0-b12, mixed mode)
{code}

Will report on whether this works with OpenJDK 7 soon.
, -checks for non-null designated client login AppConfigurationEntry. (rather than just a non-null login Configuration).
-adds client-side test related to login configuration
-adds ZooKeeper:getSaslClient() method so that the above test can work., Thanks Eugene.

Robert, can you verify this patch as well? 

Thanks, Looks like it works to me.  I haven't had time to do anything in-depth, but I did try the 'connect and do getChildren("/")' program using a jar built with this patch and it succeeded on both OpenJDK 6 and 7 as well as Oracle 6., Awesome, Ill check this in and kick of the builds on jdk 7 and see if it all works.

 Still failing :)..., -Add accessor: Login.getLoginContextName() for use with test
-Remove loginContextName member from ZooKeeperSaslClient; use login.getLoginContextName() instead
