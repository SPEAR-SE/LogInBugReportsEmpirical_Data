[Please assign this issue to me. It exists in latest release as well.
What is the expected behavior of pp_zk function. Is it supposed to return print function or a string or just print a statement?, The issue is very simple in fact :)
Someone replace all call to {{print a string}} with {{print(a string)}} Which should apply only to code, not to comments :)

So basically, replacing :


{noformat}
def pp_zk(handle,root, indent = 0):
    """Pretty print(a zookeeper tree, starting at root""")
{noformat}

With :


{noformat}
def pp_zk(handle,root, indent = 0):
    """Pretty print a zookeeper tree, starting at root"""
{noformat}

Should be the fix :)

Hope this helps.
