[it would be easier to manage these types of issues if someone would review/commit my maven support. hint hint.. ;-) ZOOKEEPER-1078, Ivan/Pat,
 Is there a patch needed for this? Or we just need to publish the jars on release?, You just need to publish the jars. They're already generated by the ant package target, I updated the "how to release" page to ensure this will happen as a result of running through the std process. I also verified the required jar is generated in dist-maven during "ant package". We should be good for 3.4.0.]
