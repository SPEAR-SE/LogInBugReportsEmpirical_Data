[I have updated the config example, and have added a description of how the two ports are used. The description for the first port in a server entry was actually missing, so I have used this opportunity to include that description as well., The current patch updates the documentation to explain how to configure a set of ZooKeeper servers with the default leader election. This description eliminates the old way of configuring that works with the original leader election algorithm, though. Although the new way of configuring should also work with the original leader election, it would be misleading to configure another port and not use it. 

Since we have currently two implementations (there are two more, but we've been focusing on two), and they require different ways of configuring the servers, I wonder if we should support both. Also, if we have different ways of configuring, then to have both ways enabled, we would need to have both "electionAlg" and server specs to determine if the configuration is correct, thus creating a dependency between parameters. It is probably best to create another jira to discuss the configuration issue, and leave this one for documentation.

For now, I'm canceling this patch, and once we decide upon server configuration, I can come back to this issue and update the patch., I updated the patch to the latest docs in svn and also fixed a few other problems with the quickstart - formatting and change to the log4j lib location.
