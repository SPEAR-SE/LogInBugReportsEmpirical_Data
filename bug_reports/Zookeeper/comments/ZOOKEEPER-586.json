[c client compiles with this patch but the tests fail, this updated patch fixes (in addition to prev) the zkServer.sh to handle
slow java startup under cygwin/viruscheckers

Also fixes a problem with host name resolution on zookeeper_init (cygwin)

currently there are still 2 failures:

_st is failing testing watch notification (auto watch reset)

_mt is core dumping

(assumes that ZOOKEEPER-606 is already applied), Updated patch to latest code - fixed problem with pid variable., I'm submitting this so that we can get it into the code base. With this latest patch the client compiles under cygwin (1.5) however not all the tests run. I also tested the patch on ubuntu and it worked fine. I think we should commit as it allows the code to compile under cygwin, we can fix the cygwin tests later (also the issue of the new cygwin version, and what we will support going fwd)., added a JIRA to track fixing the tests under cygwin - ZOOKEEPER-674, +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., ben, can you update the jira with the test results from cygwin? Ill commit if it passes..... 

Also, pat do you want to open a jira to track fixing tests for cygwin later? you can assign it to 3.4... , refreshed to work with trunk and cygwin 1.7. (we should check that it still compiles under earlier cygwin versions.), I'm seeing two issues on cygwin 15:

 src/zookeeper.c: In function `send_set_watches':
src/zookeeper.c:1286: warning: passing arg 2 of `collect_keys' from incompatible
 pointer type
src/zookeeper.c:1287: warning: passing arg 2 of `collect_keys' from incompatible
 pointer type
src/zookeeper.c:1288: warning: passing arg 2 of `collect_keys' from incompatible
 pointer type
make: *** [zookeeper.lo] Error 1

if you cast the second args to (int*) it fixes the issue.

The second problem is:
 ./libtool: eval: line 1005: syntax error near unexpected token `|'
./libtool: eval: line 1005: `/usr/bin/nm -B   ./.libs/libzkst.a ./.libs/libhasht
able.a |  | /usr/bin/sed -e '/^[BCDGRS][ ]/s/.*[ ]\([^ ]*\)/\1 DATA/;s/^.*[ ]__n
m__\([^ ]*\)[ ][^ ]*/\1 DATA/;/^I[ ]/d;/^[AITW][ ]/s/.* //' | sort | uniq > .lib

notice the | | btw the nm and sed calls, what's supposed to be here?
, I got around the libtool problem by copying /usr/bin/libtool over the version generated by ./configure, that got me past that issue.

however now I see the following :

tests/LibCMocks.cc: In function `long int random()':
tests/LibCMocks.cc:170: error: new declaration `long int random()'
/usr/include/cygwin/stdlib.h:27: error: ambiguates old declaration `int random()
'
make[1]: *** [zktest_st-LibCMocks.o] Error 1, yeah on cygwin 1.7 random returns a long int. which is what linux does as well. cygwin 1.5 returns an int. do we want to support both? it's making the code a bit ugly with all the ifdefs for a platform we really don't support., I think so. If we want it to work., that is my question. isn't it working on cygwin 1.7 good enough? btw the way, it compiles, but the tests still don't run cleanly., I think a comment in the README saying 1.7 cygwin required to compile on windows for c library should be good enough. I dont think we will be able to officially support cygwin anytime in the near future., I don't think an extra ifdef is going to pull down the quality of that code much. 1.7 only recently came out. think of all the users still on 1.5. Doesn't seem like a big deal to me to add it., made to work with 1.5, looks good, compiles cleanly now (well there's still that libtool issue, but nothing we can do onthat afaict)

ran cli_mt and cli_st against a running zk server and it worked fine.
