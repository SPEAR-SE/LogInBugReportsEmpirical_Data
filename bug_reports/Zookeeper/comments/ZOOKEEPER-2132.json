[hi asad, thanks for reporting. I'm wondering if this is a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-1797., Hey Flavio, we had already applied the patch for ZOOKEEPER-1797 before discovering this bug. The logic to determine log files to delete has not changed in that patch, meaning it does not read the file to determine if it contains needed zxids but instead relies on the assumption that log files will always roll at the time of a snapshot.
, I would like to work on this. Please assign to me]
