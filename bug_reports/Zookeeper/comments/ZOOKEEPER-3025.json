[[~hanm] - could you take a look at this issue? Seems to be related to recent commit.

Also note original authors: [~andschwa] and [~dforsyth] may have insight?, Ah, my bad. Turns out to be caused by [https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/486/commits/b030f29c02bd87f10c0ac995f4c8abf85eb7bf9b]

We'd tested on Linux, but not Windows, which has an extra include file. Writing a patch currently., GitHub user andschwa opened a pull request:

    ZOOKEEPER-3025: Make `hashtable` search `include`

    When ZOOKEEPER-2999 removed the directory side-effect of
    `include_directories(include)`, and added it as a target-level include
    to the `zookeeper` library, this broke the Windows build. It worked on
    Linux (where the patch was tested) because `winconfig.h` and is not
    included, but on Windows, the `hashtable` library included
    `winconfig.h` (found in `include`) but no longer knew where to find
    it. The fix is to add `include` to the `hashtable` library's list of
    include directories.
