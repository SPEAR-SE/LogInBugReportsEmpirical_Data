[lgtm, +1. cc: [~phunt], [~hdeng], +1. Committed to trunk and 3.5.0

thanks Tim!

you probably don't have a JIRA username, I couldn't assign the JIRA to you., Happy to help, Alexander. I'm not sure what "assign the JIRA" means.

FYI, I must have registered incorrectly. I first registered with Confluence as tbc. When I tried to log into JIRA it wouldn't accept my password. I created a JIRA account as tbc0., Hi Tim, thank you for the patch! Assigning JIRA means changing the Assignee field under the People section. I added you to the contributor list so that your name shows up., FAILURE: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2413 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2413/])
