[Since we are allowing to connect the secure cluster without jaas.conf, I think, we need to maintain ACL such that only authorised user will be able to access..

Please correct me If I am wrong.., From the JIRA description it is setting the ACLs wrongly.
{code}
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 1] create -s /tmp-seq 'sd:er:'
Created /tmp-seq0000000003
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 2] create -s /tmp-seq 'sd:er:'
Created /tmp-seq0000000004
{code}

When creating the znode, it needs to pass valid ACL with the format - "scheme:id:perm"
+Example:+ create -s /tmp-seq "data" "sasl:zookeeper/hadoop@HADOOP.COM:cdrwa"

Please test with the above changes and let me know any issues.

Also, please refer [SASL wiki pages|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Zookeeper+and+SASL] for more info., I'm marking this as 'not a problem' because this will work fine if sets the ACL properly. Please reopen if anyone differs with me.]
