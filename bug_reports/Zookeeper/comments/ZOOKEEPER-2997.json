    ZOOKEEPER-2997: CMake should not force static CRT linking

    By removing this code, CMake will use its own defaults for the CRT
    flags (e.g., `/MDd` for debug configurations). With it removed, the
    user can override this behavior by setting the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`
    manually when configuring ZooKeeper.
