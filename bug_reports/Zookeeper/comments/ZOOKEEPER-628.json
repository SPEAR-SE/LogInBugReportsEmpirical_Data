It seems that the server 10.81.12.144 still keep lots of sessions which should have be expired , Qian this is great information. Can you tar/gzip the log files from all the servers and attach them? Any/all log files you have would be useful for us to see., qian,
 I was thinking about how this could happen and I think this could be possible with some amount of corruption in the zk database. ZOOKEEPER-596 should get rid of all those scenarios. Would it be possible for you to upload the zookeeper data directory and snapshots for all the servers? It would come in very handy to find out what the problem could have been. you can tar and zip it up and upload it on the jira., err...sorry, i wasn't aware of these comments,
the log files below the level of WARN were not recorded due to a wrong log4j.properties, and the data directory and snapshots contains some sensitive information, sorry that I cannot upload them. :-(, Can this issue be closed? A possible causing bug has been closed, last activity 20 months ago, no logs available, and ZK version 3.2.x]
