[this patch fixes the issue. 
ZOOKEEPER-326 made the ZookeeperServerMain args to take just a config file rather than its initial semantics of taking a clientport and datadir.

The ZookeeperServerMain class now takes the same arguments that it did earlier with an additional optional argument of ticktime.

so the command will look like 
ZooKeeperServerMain port datadir [ticktime]
ticktime being optional.

If users want to use a config file for a standalone server they can use 

QuorumPeerMain configfile
, also the c tests fail to run right now since the api for ZookeeperServerMain changed. Now it passes again with the patch., Sorry I didn't catch the problem with src/c/tests/zkServer.sh invoking ZooKeeperMain directly.

The only issue I had with your proposed patch here is that the original problem I encountered in ZOOKEEPER-326 returns -- if you start a standalone server using QuorumPeerMain, it ignores tickTime settings there again.  This contradicts the information here:

http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.1.0/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_InstallingSingleMode

and it also just would be nice, I think, for the standard zkServer.sh (which uses QuorumPeerMain) and standard config file to work fully for standalone installations out of the box.

My revisions in the attached patch allow ZooKeeperMain to take a single config file as an alternate set of arguments, in which case it works like QuorumPeerMain.  This seems to resolve both my original issue, support the addition of a command-line tickTime argument as per your patch, and allow the src/c/tests/zkServer.sh script to work as-is., +1 for the aptch .... good changes chris... , I just committed this. Thanks chris., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #243 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/243/])
