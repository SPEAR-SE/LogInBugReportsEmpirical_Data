[This also is sent when you have a list of hosts and the first host is offline..... you'll receive a syncdisconnected when the lib fails to connect.

It happens once for each server in the list hosts.  Should it even happen before you're connected?, This patch ensures that we don't send duplicate state change notifications to the watcher. Watcher is assumed to initially be in "disconnected" state. Updated docs to this effect.

I reviewed the c code and it looks ok, I don't see dups being sent to c watcher. Please ensure this is true and I didn't miss something.

Also note that I fixed a problem with the C cli code. In some cases the watcher might be called before zookeeper_init returns - as a result the old code was segfaulting due to zh being used in the watcher. Should have been using the "zzh" param instead.

Verified all tests still pass - c and java, also added a new client test to verify that dup state change events are no longer sent to client., Committed revision 738316., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #212 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/212/])
