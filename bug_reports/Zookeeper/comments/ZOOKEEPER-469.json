[I've pulled this from ZOOKEEPER-316 because it was getting lost there, I think, and is technically unrelated to the problem first reported there.  This should be a much more straightforward fix for a problem that doesn't relate to any licensing issues for cppunit, for example.  Sorry for any confusion., +1 to the patch. I will commit it to both 3.2.1 and trunk., I just committed this to trunk and 3.2.1. thanks chris., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #393 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/393/])
