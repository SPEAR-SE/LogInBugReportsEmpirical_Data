[w/o the zookeeper server log it will be difficult to determine. please attach the server log from the time you saw the issue.

It looks like you are running standalone server on localhost? Perhaps your machine is swapping or doing heavy IO and the
server was unable to respond in time? You are using a very low timeout of 2 seconds, which means that if the server doesn't
respond w/in 0.6 seconds the operation will timeout. My best guess is that the timeout is due to this (we've seen it before, esp
in cases where ppl used vms - ie vmware, on over-virtualized system)., are you still seeing this problem? If so please provide the logs etc... detailed in the previous comment.

if it's resolved please close, also it would be interesting to know how it was resolved., just noticed the CONNECTION REFUSED error at 03:09:20,309:3813. This probably indicates that the server went down (the process wasnt running).

Qian,
 As pat mentioned, can you upload the server logs during this time?
