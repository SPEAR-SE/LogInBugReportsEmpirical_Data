[Do you mean here https://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html? The Downloads link there points to http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/zookeeper/. I tried a few mirrors there and they all seem up to date. , Yes.  For instance, when I just now visited the mirror page it takes me to http://www.us.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/.  Now that page no longer has a directory for zookeeper-3.4.6.  The top of the page says that older releases are available form http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/zookeeper/, but the latest release on that page is 3.3.2. So there is no where within those pages were you can download 3.4.6., Hmm, I am not sure how that's updated.

[~phunt], [~fpj], [~michim], [~coreyg]: does any one know how  http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/zookeeper is kept up to date?, It's an rsync cron that pulls from rsync.a.o, Oh - I see. Thanks [~coreyg]! Presumably only PMCs have access?, Access to what?, [~coreyg]: sorry, to rsync.apache.org., rsync.a.o == https://www.apache.org/ and the available rsync module == https://www.apache.org/dist/ and is what our mirror network and our archive mirror pulls from (the archive mirror doesn't remove anything though)., As pointed out by [~fpj], the right archive link is: http://archive.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/. We'll update the site to point there. , [~coreyg] If you go here:

http://apache.mirror.anlx.net/zookeeper/

and check the archives link, it points to:

http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/zookeeper/

but it should be instead:

http://archive.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/

How do we fix that link?, Not sure ATM, file an INFRA JIRA?, [~coreyg] [~rgs] I've created INFRA-10947., I have just fixed this. The file to be updated, HEADER.html, can be updated in dist.apache.org by any committer here.]
