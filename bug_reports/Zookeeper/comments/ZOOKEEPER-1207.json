[Seems this is some weird error message that should not be output, but at the EOD is not a problem in itself. Would be great to get into 3.4.0 (avoid user confusion) but not a blocker., Hi Pat,

Yes, Presently there is no config option for enabling or disabling r/o and turned on by default. I also feel it can be turned off by default and can give config options (IMO we can follow the similar pattern of 'Observer' ZooKeeper server startup.)

For ex: In zoo.cfg,
server.1=10.18.52.25:2252:2252:readonly
	or 
peerType=readonly

If you agree I can work on the approach. Suggest me if any better solution.


*Cause of exception:-*
After spawing the rozk, quorumpeer is going ahead with lookForLeader().
Since this has completed within 'sleep(Math.max(2000, tickTime));' and interrupting rozk thread inorder to avoid the startup of rozk('fastfail' approach).


Thanks,
Rakesh, Moving this to 3.4.1. We can skip Readonly ZK server for this release. There are multiple issues with it., It seems we have 'readonlymode.enabled' configuration which is OFF by default(Reference ZOOKEEPER-1268). Now the mentioned error message will not occur with default configs, can we close this JIRA or anything more to be done ? ]
