[In the equivalent Java client test, the essential idea is to use a known seed of 1, but instead of using the random numbers directly from that, it passes the numbers generated into the client's invidiaul random number generators to be the seeds. , Marshall, I'm wondering if the bug has something to do with the following: when you create a client, the second parameter to the constructor determines the random seed used by the client. That second parameter I think is supposed to be the client's id, but what is passed is clients.size(). I might be wrong here but I don't see where this vector of clients is cleared in between tests, so is it true that at some point the set size is fixed and all the seeds are the same ?, I think I have just come across this issue here:

https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2072/console

Any chance we can get it fixed?, Hi, I am bringing this up 3 years after its last been discussed. I am trying to run unit tests on the C client and am still having problems in the Zookeeper_reconfig set of tests. Is it the same issue that has never been solved? I need to add more unit tests for a feature I'm implementing but I don't know if its wise to do so until this is resolved., This issue should be a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-2152, which is resolved as fixed. The code fix was committed as SVN r1757565 on Aug 24 2016, and after that there is no Jenkins build report failures for TestReconfig.cc. If you still experience the issue, please provide more information such as:
* The branch you are testing (git commit hash).
* Does the failure happen with, or without applying your patch?
* Steps on reproduce and detailed log information (the test log + server log).
For now, I am closing this issue as duplicate, please either open a new JIRA issue or comment on ZOOKEEPER-2152.]
