This message is automatically generated., [~shralex], The fix looks good to me. Can you write a simple test case to test the scenario. My be you can include bellow test in the patch.
{code}
package org.apache.zookeeper.server;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;
public class ServerConfigTest {
    @Test
    public void testParseStringArray() {
        ServerConfig config = new ServerConfig();
        long tickTime = 2000;
        String[] args = new String[] { "123", "dataDir", Long.toString(tickTime), "60" };
        config.parse(args);
        assertEquals(tickTime, config.tickTime);
    }
}
{code}, Hey [~shralex], it would be really cool if we got this patch patch merged. :) Would you mind to open a Github PR with your patch and maybe close the https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/74 (it was the original solution as you pointed out at ZOOKEEPER-2472, but the PR looks fishy...)

    ZOOKEEPER-2470: ServerConfig#parse(String[]) ignores tickTime

----
, I had an email chat with @shralex and he said I could get this issue to push forward. Even though the issue is *quite trivial*, I've got in touch with him because it would be really important to have this bug fixed for 3.4, 3.5 and master branches asap.
, Github user hanm commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/125
  
    patch looks good, it would be great if there is also a test (though the fix is pretty obvious..).
, Github user eribeiro commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/125
  
    +1, the fix is quite trivial, but I am gonna add an unit test to guard against regressions, for example. 
, Github user eribeiro commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/125
  
    @hanm Added a couple of tests to (hopefully) guard against regressions. :+1:

    +1. @rakeshadr please take a look and merge if this looks good to you.
, Github user eribeiro commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/125
  
    @hanm @rakeshadr Just a reminder: this patch will need to be applied to branch-3.5 and master too. The `zk-merge-pr.py` allows to do this, but a cherry-pick of this PR commit also does the work.
