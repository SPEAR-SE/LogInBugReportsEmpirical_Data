[so I've took the code that opens a connection from the zookeeper source code and executed on our servers.

From server 2 to 3 which are on the same data centre, we don't see any issues.
{code:title=SocketMain.java}
Opening channel to server
All good: server3.dns.name/23.175.15.52:4882
{code}

but from server 2 to 1 which are on a different data centre, we get the bellow exception.

{code:title=SocketMain.java}
Cannot open channel to at election address server1.dns.name/192.168.4.4:4882=>java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
{code}

I don't think this is really a zookeeper bug but I appreciate any pointers.

By the way, I don't get this issue if I use the same code to connect to one of our application servers on a different port.
