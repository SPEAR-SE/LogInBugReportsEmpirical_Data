[This is caused by this line in configure:

PACKAGE_STRING='zookeeper C client 3.4.1'

I changed it to 3.4.2, and rebuilt by hand, and the C client now reports the correct version.

This isn't really critical, but could cause confusion so should be fixed... , Thanks marshall. I think I forgot to edit the file when doing the release. Will go ahead and fix it for 3.4.3., I've fixed the issue. 3.4.3 should have the right client version.]
