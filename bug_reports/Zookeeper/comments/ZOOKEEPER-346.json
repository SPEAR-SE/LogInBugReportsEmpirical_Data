[+1 - esp as we now have similar capabilities through JMX.
, this patch removes the kill command, updates the docs, and also updates the zkServer.sh script to use pids and unix "kill" cli to manage the process.

Note: I removed kill entirely due to it's potential security issues. There was
 consideration to keep it defaulted to off, but in the end if you have local 
access to the server there is no reason not to just use command line kill, 
fuser, JMX, whatever.

I also included a small change to the build.xml to allow either the java or cppunit tests to be run individually., submitting this patch - there are no tests, code/feature was removed.
, just changed the script to gracefully error out in case its not able to find the pid file. other than that +1. ill wait for hudson to run through it., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
