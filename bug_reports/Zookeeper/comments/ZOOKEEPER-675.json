[Henry can you look at this ASAP? Ben says that this is happening every 3rd time he runs the tests on his system. We really should address this to minimize false positive test failures in 3.3.0 (ben thinks the test itself is broken, not the code)., turned out not to be the issue ben was seeing, moving back to 3.4.0, not a blocker. Moving it out of 3.4 release., We have deprecated the LeaderElection implementation, so I suggest we don't fix this issue.]
