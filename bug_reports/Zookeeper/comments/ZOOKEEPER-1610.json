[An alternative to refactor the lines of org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/flexible/QuorumHierarchical.java would be too make the for-each loop to unbox the sid to a primitive type as follows:

        for (long sid: serverWeight.keySet()){
           if (serverWeight.get(sid) != qm.serverWeight.get(sid))
                return false;
        }
        for (long sid: groupWeight.keySet()){
           if (groupWeight.get(sid) != qm.groupWeight.get(sid))
                return false;
        }
        for (long sid: serverGroup.keySet()){
           if (serverGroup.get(sid) != qm.serverGroup.get(sid))
                return false;
        }

Any of those two solutions (the one in the patch or the one above) will suffice to this specific case.
