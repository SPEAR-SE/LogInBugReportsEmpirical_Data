See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/32965 over at Homebrew's Github for fuller logs and details., That indeed is a bug caused by the proposed patch, sorry for that. Obviously {{config.h}} is not being installed which would have to be changed. 

Objections to add {{config.h}} to the installed headers?, A less intrusive alternative would be simply renaming the zookeeper specific implementation of {{htonll}} into something like e.g. {{zoo_htonll}} - actually, I think that is the best way out of this little mess., +1 for renaming the function., Removed previous patch suggestion as it proved to be faulty due to  {{config.h}} not getting installed., Thank you for the patch Till.

    OK. The Mac issue I see is caused by MacOS -  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2049
    Just to confirm, what version of MacOS and Zookeeper did you build with?
    Should we upgrade the client to use Zookeeper 3.4.7?
