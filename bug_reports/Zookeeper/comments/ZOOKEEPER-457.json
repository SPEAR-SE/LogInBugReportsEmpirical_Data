[The 3.2.0 release candidate has already been cut, please see/discuss on the zookeeper-dev list thread.

Is this something critical for 3.2.0 or can it wait for 3.2.1/3.3.0? (again, please discuss on the list thread)
, it doesn't matter, i just tried to pick something that seemed ok, but obviously it didnt work.

we can push it back., For reference, this is currently in HBase's ZooKeeper jar. The relevant HBase issue is: HBASE-1329., Marking for 3.3, we may also want to consider for 3.2.1 (this is not strictly a bug however), Looks good, +1. Thanks Ryan!
