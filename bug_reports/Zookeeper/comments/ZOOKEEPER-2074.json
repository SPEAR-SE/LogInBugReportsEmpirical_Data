[Please assign this Jira to me, I will upload patch soon, I have attached patch , Please review it., Looks like a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-1897..., Hi Simon, , I donâ€™t think it is duplicate, In that jira they are not checking command result.
But I want, we should check command result and then do exit with 1 if command result is false.
, Please can someone review my patch and assign this issue to me..Thank in advance, Thanks [~surendrasingh] for the patch. Can you move the command result check and {{System.exit(1);}} one level up to the ZooKeeperMain#main() method. I could see {{ZooKeeperMain#run()}} has default access, if someone embedded this in their code then may exit the JVM, right? , Thanks [~rakeshr] .

Yes you are correct , I will change the patch and upload soon.., [~rakeshr]

I have attached new patch, please review it.
Thanks in advance.
, +1 lgtm, @Rakesh

ZOOKEEPER-2074 Incorrect exit codes for "./zkCli.sh cmd arg" (surendra singh lilhore via michim) (michim: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1658307)

, with this patch even successful commands return 1 if processZKCmd returns false., [~michim] did you revert the change? Do we want to revert or fix?, Yes, I just reverted the change:

, Thanks [~michim] for pointing out this case. [~surendrasingh] could you re-look at it., Thanks [~michim] , [~rakeshr] Yes I will check it..

But I have one doubt, why processZKCmd() will return false if command is success.

when watch is false ??

{code}
	 // execute from commandMap
        CliCommand cliCmd = commandMapCli.get(cmd);
        if(cliCmd != null) {
            cliCmd.setZk(zk);
            watch = cliCmd.parse(args).exec();
        } else if (!commandMap.containsKey(cmd)) {
             usage();
        }
{code}

I saw some command like "getAcl" which prints the command output on console, it will always return false 

{code}
	@Override
    public boolean exec() throws KeeperException, InterruptedException {
        String path = args[1];
        Stat stat = new Stat();
        List<ACL> acl = zk.getACL(path, stat);
        for (ACL a : acl) {
            out.println(a.getId() + ": "
                        + getPermString(a.getPerms()));
        }

        if (cl.hasOption("s")) {
            new StatPrinter(out).print(stat);
        }
        return false;
    }

This message is automatically generated., [~michim] I have attached new patch. Please can you review.., Thanks [~surendrasingh] for taking care this. Could you tell me, any specific reason to not to return the status after executing the {{"redo"}} command. IMO, we can return after executing the command. Please verify this case also.
{code}
            history.put(commandCount, history.get(i));
            processCmd( cl);
{code}, 
Thanks [~rakeshr] for review

{{"redo"}} is not useful as Command line args for ZkCli.sh.

It is used only when we are executing command on cli prompt.

{code}./zkCli.sh -server IP:PORT redo 0{code}

This command always return false

{code}
	 } else if (cmd.equals("redo") && args.length >= 2) {
            Integer i = Integer.decode(args[1]);
            if (commandCount <= i){ // don't allow redoing this redo
                System.out.println("Command index out of range");
                return false;
           }

This message is automatically generated., I do not believe the test failure is relevant to this patch, That is a known failure taken care of by ZOOKEEPER-2080., hey [~abrahamfine], this patch is a complement of ZOOKEEPER-1898, right? I am linking the two so that we can expose the relation between the two issues.

LGTM (informal review). :), [~eribeiro] indeed, they are related. thanks for taking a look!, Looks good - however DEFAULT_EXIT_CODE is really the default error exit code, right? Can you change variable, e.g. DEFAULT_EXIT_CODE_ON_ERROR or something like that?, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
