[Hi Jakub,

I think this is fixed in ZOOKEEPER-1597. Could you try this patch?

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1597
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12562553/ZOOKEEPER-1597.patch

Thanks!
--Michi, SVN rejects changes on zookeeper.vcproj (I'm trying to apply it on 3.4.4). Applying this patch and manually patching problematic file makes the solution properly open.

Looks like the problems has been fixed, thank you. :), Fixed with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1597]
