[Two things, first in:

{noformat}
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 60] create /anode "somecontent" digest:'user:IAEttLCxci/qWhKN2QJ6u1nrQgw=':cdrwa
{noformat}

the extra single quotes shouldn't be there, zkCli won't parse them correctly. So you just want:

{noformat}
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 60] create /anode "somecontent" digest:user:IAEttLCxci/qWhKN2QJ6u1nrQgw=:cdrwa
{noformat}

Second, the permissions in the ACL affect everything *under* /anode as well, not /anode alone. Because znodes can also hold other znodes (i.e.: act like "directories") the ACLs are a reference to what can be done with the children too. So, if you want to forbid anyone from deleting /anode you'd have to set the proper ACLs in /. 

Makes sense?
, Hi Raul,

yeah, that makes sense. 
Thanks a lot.]
