    <target name="compile" depends="ivy-retrieve,clover,build-generated">
        <javac srcdir="${java.src.dir}" destdir="${build.classes}" includeantruntime="false"

This message is automatically generated., Hmm, I tried what you suggested but ant/javac complains:

{noformat}
compile:
    [javac] Compiling 210 source files to /home/fpj/code/zookeeper-3.5.1-alpha/build/classes
    [javac] javac: invalid flag: -Dfile.encoding=utf8
{noformat}

This change worked instead for me:

{noformat}
<target name="compile" depends="ivy-retrieve,clover,build-generated">
        <javac srcdir="${java.src.dir}" destdir="${build.classes}" includeantruntime="false"
               target="${javac.target}" source="${javac.source}" debug="on" encoding="UTF-8">
            <classpath refid="java.classpath"/>
            <compilerarg value="-Xlint:all"/>
            <compilerarg value="-Xlint:-path"/>
        </javac>
    </target>
{noformat}

In general, is everyone happy that we change the encoding to utf-8? I personally don't see a big problem, but perhaps we should send a separate note to the dev list to see if anyone has a concern. What do you think? 
, Yeah, I think it should be fine. I'll start a quick thread. , The 2nd uploaded patch added the new encoding, but remove the the — utf-8 char (which should stay). , If we set the source encoding, then I recommend making it consistent across all invocations of {{<javac>}}.  That would involve making the same change for targets like jute and compile-test.  Under contrib, we also have {{<javac>}} invocations in src/contrib/rest/build.xml and src/contrib/zooinspector/build.xml., yup, that makes sense. maybe we should update this ticket description to 'use utf-8 everywhere' then?, -1 overall.

That way, we'll actually know this works :-) Other than that, +1. Thanks [~michim]!, +1 (non-binding) for the patch, pending resolution of the last feedback from Raúl.  I tested a full build locally.  The test failure from the last Jenkins run is unrelated.  The {{TestReconfig}} CPPUnit test failed, and this one has been failing intermittently already on trunk.
