[Hey, are you guys still working on this? The referenced HADOOP-8315 jira is still blocked on the 3.4.5 test jar showing up., I believe this is addressed with the latest ant build.xml, but we should verify and ensure this happens as part of the 3.4.6 release

[~mahadev] any chance you'll be able to fix this for 3.4.5?, [~mahadev], could you please have a look at this?, Any word on this? Hadoop would really like to update to 3.4.5, and I don't want to have to host an artifact in my apache.org home dir :), I reached out to infra@ but no help. I've created a jira here if you want to track: INFRA-6797, The Nexus folks were kind enough to resolve this.

We need to make sure that for 3.4.6 we publish the jars correctly though (iirc Giri has updated the deploy target to correctly do this for 3.4.6 and later, we need to verify though)]
