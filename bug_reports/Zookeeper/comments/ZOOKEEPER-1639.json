[[~fpj] & [~shralex] is this something we need to worry about for 3.4.6?, I'm missing some context here. What kind of incorrect behavior does this bug induce? , The context is that I was trying to add a new system znode (for holding the configuration) and couldn't understand why the new node is initially there but suddenly disappears! The reason turned out to be that the node I attached it too is not the one being used after the call to deserializeSnapshot. 

I don't think it affects the users - just an internal cleaning up issue.]
