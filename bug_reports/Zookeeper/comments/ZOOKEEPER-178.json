[these are the logs that I saw FLE test failing with ant test., i tried tge tests after ZOOKEEPER-159 was checked in. I ran it 3 times and it failed on the third. Their seems to be a bug and we should fix it .... without leader election we wont be able to run :) , I'm uploading a patch to make it pass. It is a small, but safe modification to make the unit test pass. I've run 20 times on my machine, and it passed on all 20., great work flavio... i ran the test 30 times ... it passed .... looks like you the patch fixes the problem... , Thanks for checking, Mahadev. Now, is your comment a +1?, +1 Looks good!, -1, I ran the FLETest 10 times and it failed twice. I will attach log., Committed revision 703602., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #110 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/110/])
