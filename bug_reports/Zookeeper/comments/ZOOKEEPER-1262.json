[Actually, using the SessionID is not very good. You would only be able to create 1 lock per path per connection. Using a UUID would be better., my response on list:

You're right, we should have an "error handling" section in that doc,
the assumption is that this is the algo when things are working, but
what happens if things go awry?

One way to handle the issue you describe, is when the client
reconnects to the cluster, if the session is not expired it could look
at any outstanding requests it made and not gotten responses for. In
this case it could scan the list looking for any znode that it created
(see the Stat object) and make a determination based on that.

the docs detailing this?, Sure - I'll work on something., Here is an updated recipes page (and its diff), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
