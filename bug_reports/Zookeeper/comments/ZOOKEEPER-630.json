This message is automatically generated., When you say duplicate you mean that the other file contains the same set of tests? What I mean is, we aren't effectively removing tests as part of this patch, is that right?, That's what I mean, yes. Same set of tests (although now slightly different since Flavio's patch updated the one I left in), no logical test removal. , Except there's one test that should have been removed, which wasn't removed in the duplicate (the test to make sure that an exception is thrown if the wrong LE algorithm is used - this is no longer appropriate). So we are removing that test, but it should be removed anyhow.
