[This program triggers the problem for me roughly 10% of the time with ZK 3.4.8 - note that if I don't use a thread to start ZooKeeperServer, the connection always comes in after the server has had a chance to register itself with JMX (imports omitted - attaching full file here in a sec):

{noformat} , [~steve_rowe] Thanks for reporting this issue. According to git blame, the latest changes around the startup method in ZooKeeperServer are due to ZOOKEEPER-1907, which actually turned out to be quite problematic, so this could be another issue due to that patch, I'm not sure.

[~rakesh_r] could you have a look, please?

CC [~rgs] [~phunt], FWIW, I was able to work around the problem in Solr tests by subclassing ZooKeeperServer and ordering server JMX registration before setting up its request processing pipeline, like so:

{code:java}
 private class TestZooKeeperServer extends ZooKeeperServer {
    @Override protected void registerJMX() {
      // no-op - super.registerJMX() is called in overridden startup()
    }
    /** Register in JMX before starting the request processors. */
    @Override public void startup() {
      super.registerJMX();
      super.startup();
    }
    public TestZooKeeperServer(FileTxnSnapLog txnLogFactory, int tickTime,
                               int minSessionTimeout, int maxSessionTimeout,
                               DataTreeBuilder treeBuilder, ZKDatabase zkDb) {
      super(txnLogFactory, tickTime, minSessionTimeout, maxSessionTimeout, treeBuilder, zkDb);
    }
  }
{code}, Similarly to the subclassed ZooKeeperServer above, if I apply the following patch to ZK 3.4.8 and run the attached test case with it, the JMX registration race no longer happens:

, Thanks [~steve_rowe] for reporting this issue and good analysis.

bq. According to git blame, the latest changes around the startup method in ZooKeeperServer are due to ZOOKEEPER-1907, which actually turned out to be quite problematic, so this could be another issue due to that patch, I'm not sure.

[~fpj], sure I'm happy to investigate this. To understand the impact of ZOOKEEPER-1907, first I took the code before ZOOKEEPER-1907 commit version {{da3e7e0d4b66ac5a25d40ae2d0102b1b57994b62}}. I've debugged the code and able to re-produce the issue even without ZOOKEEPER-1907 changes.

Coming back to the issues reported in this jira, there are two issues. IIUC, both the cases are due to the race between server startup and processing a client connection request. I've tried an attempt to figure it out, please see the below sequence that creating the trouble.
# NullPointerException while creating session

5=> Now, it will invoke {{zkServer.finishSessionInit()}}. Here it invokes {{serverCnxnFactory.registerConnection(cnxn);}} and hitting the path error., I think I found the code changes which results in this bug. Its due to the change in startup sequence - ZOOKEEPER-2026.

Here it just moved up setting 'zkServer' reference before starting up the standalone server fully. Internally, this 'zkServer' reference is used to see ZooKeeperServer's running status. In the defect scenario, the standalone server is partially started(by Thread1) and simultaneously client(by Thread2) send a connection request. Since the 'zkServer' is not null it proceeds to process the connection request and causing the trouble. Please refer my previous comment to understand the problematic call sequence.

{code}
ZooKeeperServer.java

    private void readConnectRequest() throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        if (zkServer == null) {
            throw new IOException("ZooKeeperServer not running");
        }
        zkServer.processConnectRequest(this, incomingBuffer);
        initialized = true;
    }
{code}

Probably should use server RUNNING state instead of "zkServer == null" checks to know the running status. Server is updating the state to RUNNING after starting all the services.
{code}
ZooKeeperServer.java

    public synchronized void startup() {
        if (sessionTracker == null) {
            createSessionTracker();
        }
        startSessionTracker();
        setupRequestProcessors();

        registerJMX();

        state = State.RUNNING;
        notifyAll();
    }
{code}, I've run into similar issues, with the register call causing an AssertionError, which is not caught anywhere, which results in test failures (especially if you have multiple QuorumPeers running in the same jvm during tests).  JMX registration gets confused if you have individual nodes starting and stopping.   (Asserts are only enabled for us during testing/ci, so it doesn't affect production).
I worked around it be calling {code}MBeanRegistry.setInstance(new FakeMBeanRegistry()){code}.  Where {code}FakeMBeanRegistry{code} looks like:

{code}
  public static class FakeMBeanRegistry extends MBeanRegistry {
    @Override public void register(ZKMBeanInfo bean, ZKMBeanInfo parent) throws JMException {}
    @Override public void unregister(ZKMBeanInfo bean) {}
    @Override public void unregisterAll() {}
  }
{code}

Maybe there should be a flag to disable all JMX registrations (e.g. for most tests), and it could be handled with something like this fake class., Thanks [~jbrosenberg@gmail.com]. Disbaling or mocking may affect the {{org.apache.zookeeper.testJMXEnv#ensureAll(expectednames)}} verification, isn't it?. In unit tests, it verifies all the registered jmx beans to ensure that the server is started fully.

[~fpj], I have one idea to fix this issue by modifying the condition {{zkServer == null}} with {{zkServer.isRunning()}} status check. After seeing the code changes, I feel to push this logic carefully after 3.5.2 release, which is waiting to be released soon. Also, I think needs to identify and add more unit test cases covering server startup/shutdown/restart corner cases in order to push this change. Now, I'm planning to revert ZOOKEEPER-2026 committed changes and re-open the jira. Does this makes sense to you?, Yes, agreed, you wouldn't use a FakeMBeanRegistry for tests that are actually testing the jmx functionality!
However, I think it makes sense to have it be something easily configurable/settable for most tests (and especially for tests which launch multiple peers in the same jvm)., [~rakeshr] hi Rakesh, how is the progress of this issue?, [~ozawa], thanks for the interest. I was busy with other things and will give priority to this issue. I will update patch soon. I'm planning to include this in 3.4.9 release and please see the [3.4.9 release discussion|http://goo.gl/SJJhbx], Attached initial patch where I've used {{zkServer.isRunning()}} status to check whether the server is up and running. Appreciate your help in reviews. Thanks!, fyi: The patch got a green [build_3284|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/3284/] , unfortunately there is a {{Permission denied}} issue in the build and due to that its not commenting to the jira. Anyone has idea about this problem?

, Thank you [~suda] for the feedback., [~rakeshr], looks like your patch is against trunk - if you make a branch-3.4 version of the patch, I'll run Solr's tests using a build off that branch (I'm assuming the next Solr ZK dep version will be 3.4.9)., Thanks [~steve_rowe]. I'm attaching another patch based on br-3.4, would be great to see your feedback on this.

[~fpj], [~phunt], [~rgs], do you have some cycles to review this. Thanks!, [~rakeshr]: looks good to me, one nit though. In testClientConnectionRequestDuringStartup:

{code}
+        CountdownWatcher watcher = new CountdownWatcher();
+        new ZooKeeper(HOSTPORT, ClientBase.CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, watcher);

lets assign the ZooKeeper object to a var and explicitly clean it up when done. Other than that, +1.

This message is automatically generated., ZOOKEEPER-2383-br-3-4.patch may also be updated with this fix as well., One small suggestion - the condition of {code} zkServer == null || !zkServer.isRunning() {code} could be refactored into a dedicated method such as {code} boolean isZKServerRunning(ZooKeeperServer zkServer) { return zkServer != null && zkServer.isRunning(); }{code}, which centralized such logic and make it reusable later. We could put it in Command.java or ZKUtil.java maybe?, Thanks [~hanm] for the reviews. It looks like {{ZKUtil.java}} has ZooKeeper client related operations.

This message is automatically generated., [~rgs], would you take another look at the latest patch and help me pushing this in. Thanks!, [~rgs] possible for you take another look?, I am moving this out to 3.4.10 for now. Please feel free to discuss the target version, Thanks!, I've got +1(non-binding) from [~steve_rowe] and [~hanm].

Hi [~fpj], [~rgs], do you have some cycles to review the proposed patch considering the bug priority. Thanks!, [~rakesh_r] I have checked the 3.4 patch. In {{NettyServerCnxn}}, it looks like we are only updating the code for 4lws. Don't we have to also update it here:

{noformat}
                        if (zks == null) {

                        }
{noformat}

This is in {{NettyServerCnxn.receiveMessage}.

About the test case:

# I ran it with and without the changes. With the changes, it works fine. Without the changes, it hangs forever. I noticed in the logs that it gets:

{noformat}
java.lang.AssertionError: Since zk server is not started createsession method to be invoked
{noformat}

but it never exists as the client keeps trying to connect. It sounds like some thread is hanging and not letting the test framework exit.

# This sentence doesn't make much sense to me: {{Since zk server is not started createsession method to be invoked}}
# Please reduce the test case timeout to no longer than 30s., Thanks [~fpj] for the comments. 

bq. In NettyServerCnxn, it looks like we are only updating the code for 4lws. Don't we have to also update it here:

I think, I have handled this case and the following condition present in [ZOOKEEPER-2383-br-3-4.patch|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12821043/ZOOKEEPER-2383-br-3-4.patch]. Am I missing any other case apart from the below line of code.

Without patch it fails at {{simplezks.waitForStartupInvocation(10)}}. On the other side {{SimpleZooKeeperServer#startup}} thread is waiting at startupDelayLatch.await() and this is causing an indefinite wait. How about adding the countdown logic in finally so that it will proceed:
{code}

            Assert.assertFalse(
                    "Should fail to create zk client session as server is not fully started",

            startupDelayLatch.countDown();
        }

bq. This sentence doesn't make much sense to me: Since zk server is not started createsession method to be invoked
I will modify this to "Should fail to create zk client session as server is not fully started"

Agreed.

FYI, apart from the above, I had fixed [Michael's comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2383?focusedCommentId=15409673&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15409673] and [Raul's comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2383?focusedCommentId=15408826&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15408826] in trunk patch, need to rebase branch-3-4 patch to incorporate these comments., [~rakesh_r] the try/finally suggestion sounds good.

I have a couple more comments that I'm not sure we can address, but I have have them written down at least:

# It sounds like you have covered all necessary {{zkServer == null}} cases, but I'm concerned we might have missed any, I'm not sure there is a way of guaranteeing and the only course of action is visual inspection. It'd be much better if we could sort out the problem in the startup call instead of relying on the methods accessing the {{zkServer}} to check whether the server is running.
# The test case isn't covering the whole modified code. In particular, it is not covering the 4lw changes this patch is making., Actually, what prevents us from doing this:

Agreed, would need to add more test cases covering 4lw and netty server.

bq. Actually, what prevents us from doing this:
Its an interesting thought to view the problem from different angle and frame a simple solution. I could see the following changes will happen if we move #start() at the end.

# If someone sends 4lw command to the server during startup, zk server won't respond to it and will not print message {{"This ZooKeeper instance is not currently serving requests"}}.
# There is a change in the client and server side logging.

Ideally server startup won't take too much time, only exceptional case is zks#loadData() is too large. I'm not aware about the use case of 4lws during startup, do anyone expect quick output shows server not running rather than connection timeout?, [~fpj], any thoughts about the above points? Thanks!, Will this proposed fix induce any other component integration test failures. Would be great to see your view on the above analysis. Thanks!, Moving the {{start()}} call to the end of the {{startup()}} method will cause the change of behavior you point out, that's correct, we shouldn't do it.

Applying the test alone without the other changes still makes the test run forever. We need to fix it.

There are a few format suggestions I wanted to make, perhaps it is better to have a pull request for this. , Thanks [~fpj]. OK, I'll modify the test case and create pull request., GitHub user rakeshadr opened a pull request:

, Thank you [~fpj] for the help in resolving this.
bq. pull request #101 merged fine onto master, but not branch 3.5. I haven't tried branch 3.4.
I've tried cherry pick the commits to branch-3.5 locally and it worked. Is there anything specific to be done to {{branch 3.5}}?. But it requires a separate PR for {{branch 3.4}} as the code is different from master branch, I'will create a PR for {{branch 3.4}} shortly., Thanks [~hanm] for merging this to {{branch-3.5}}, GitHub user rakeshadr opened a pull request:

    @rakeshadr The test file is put in source folder (src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/ZooKeeperServerStartupTest.java) - it should be put in test folder (src/java/test) right?
