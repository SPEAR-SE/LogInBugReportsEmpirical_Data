This message is automatically generated., 0002 is the correct/latest patch is that right? (I should ignore 0001?) We typically name new versions of our patches the same name, jira handles this properly, otw it can be confusing... (0001 vs 0002, or 0001 and 0002....?), Hi Rakesh, makes sense to me to include in 3.4.6 as well as trunk. I tried the patch against 3.4.6 but it fails, can you create it?

I looked through the patch and it looks ok to me. Kudos on adding the tests. One suggestion - pass into multiHavingErrors the expected error, rather than allowing either.
, I'll prepare the patch for 3.4.6.

Thanks for the review.  BTW I didn't get the comment, can you please explain it again.
bq.One suggestion - pass into multiHavingErrors the expected error, rather than allowing either.

In tests, I'm preparing the 'expectedResultCodes' and pass to the api for assertions.
{code}
multiHavingErrors(zk, opList, expectedResultCodes);
{code}, The following is what I was referring to:

{noformat}
+        } else {
+            try {
+                zk.multi(ops);
+                Assert.fail("Shouldn't have validated in ZooKeeper client!");
+            } catch (KeeperException.BadArgumentsException e) {
+                // expected
+            } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
+                // expected
+            }
+        }
{noformat}

Which is expected? And in which cases?
, Attached latest patch fixing review comment. Also removed one unnecessary arg from "private List<OpResult> validatePath(Iterable<Op> ops)" method.

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~phunt], could you please look at the latest patch and would like to know the feedback. Thanks, This is one I think should go into 3.4, I just haven't had the time to do the patch justice (looked at it briefly a couple times). I'll see if I have time, but it would be nice if someone who worked on multi originally might weigh in ([~tdunning] or [~marshall] ?), I'm not too familiar with how the client-side path validation works in the java client code. We don't do anything similar to that in the C client code (that I'm aware of). Can someone explain how that is safe? If the client is connected to a server that does not have a fully sync'd copy of the database then the client may preemptively fail the multi-op whereas if it had forwarded the entire multi-op to the server it would have properly succeeded. 

It's really important to understand that the original design we followed with a multi-op was to treat it as a transaction (write operation) rather than a read operation. As a transaction/write operation, it's my understanding of zab that we are required to forward the operation on to the leader rather than taking any action locally so that the leader can broadcast out the transaction to the entire ensemble for consideration. 

If the client does any path validation locally that seems like a violation of the zab protocol as I understand it.

Someone feel free to correct me if I am misunderstanding things., Thanks [~marshall] for the interest.

AFAIK, the idea of path validation is to "fail fast in the client side itself with user friendly error messages". I think, this will not violate the zab protocol. Also, the path validation utility is used in all the other zookeeper.java client apis. 
Since the znode string path (user passed parameter) is not following the basic znode path principles, the operation will definitely fail in server side and will not goes to zab protocol logic. If we have this utility in place, this will do the validation in client side itself and give the proper error message. 

Zookeeper java client has special path validation utility, which will do very basic validation of znode path string, like :
- Path cannot be null
- Path length must be > 0
- Path must start with / character
- Path must not end with / character 
- and many more..please see 'org.apache.zookeeper.common.PathUtils.java' for the understanding., Thanks [~rakeshr] that significantly clears things up. This is different from what we do in the C client so I was completely misinterpreting things. I thought it was actually validating path existence rather than validating syntax and path sanity/validation. As such, my concerns are completely resolved.

I'll look over the patch itself and make sure I don't have any other concerns., After having much more clarity after [~rakeshr]'s comments, this patch looks good to me. +1., Thanks a lot [~marshall] for your time and reviews., Thanks Rakesh! Thanks Marshall! Committed to 3.4.6 and trunk., SUCCESS: Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #2158 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/2158/])
