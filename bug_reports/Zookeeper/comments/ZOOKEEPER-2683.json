[Test case expectation is wrong. Test case is expecting the old leader to be the follower only, which is not correct.
Old leader can become the leader again., QuorumPeerMain.getQuorumPeer visibility changed to protected to simply the test case. This is just improvement
Fix can be without this change but it is good to have., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Quick comments on the patch: why not just do this instead?
{code}
assertTrue(
                "Leader failed to transition to new state. Current state is "
                        + leader.getServerState(),
            ClientBase.waitForServerState(leader, 15000,
                QuorumStats.Provider.LOOKING_STATE, QuorumStats.Provider.FOLLOWING_STATE,
                QuorumStats.Provider.LEADING_STATE));
{code}, Thanks [~hanm] for review. 
Old leader is already in QuorumStats.Provider.LEADING_STATE that is why I think it is not good to include in the assert list., GitHub user arshadmohammad opened a pull request:

    ZOOKEEPER-2683: RaceConditionTest is flaky

    RaceConditionTest assertion is wrong, It fails when old leader becomes leader again.

, [~arshad.mohammad] make sense, we could improve waitForServerState so it captures state transitions between same states, but your current code is fine. +1, merging., Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:
