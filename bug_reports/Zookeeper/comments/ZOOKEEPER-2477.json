- Comment-1)
{code}
<para><computeroutput>$ bin/zkCli.sh 127.0.0.1:2181</computeroutput></para>
{code}
Here, please add {{-server}} option.

- Comment-2)
{code}
-          <para>Running either program gives you a shell in which to execute
-          simple file-system-like operations. To connect to ZooKeeper with the
-          multithreaded client, for example, you would run:</para>
{code}
Probably can retain the shell info and can rephrase like, {{This will give you a simple shell to execute file-like operations on ZooKeeper.}} in zookeeperAdmin.xml

- Comment-3)
{code}
<programlisting>bin/zkCli.sh -server 127.0.0.1:2181</programlisting>
{code}
Please include {{$}} symbol, just to make consistent everywhere
{code}
<programlisting>$ bin/zkCli.sh -server 127.0.0.1:2181</programlisting>
{code}

- Comment-4)
{code}
<para>This lets you perform simple, file-like operations.</para>
{code}
Again this also can be rephrased something like,
{code}
<para>This will give you a simple shell to execute file-like operations on ZooKeeper.</para>
{code}, [~rakeshr] Thanks for the feedback! I will address comments 1 and 3 in this patch and address 2 and 4 in a separate patch (as I think they are outside the intent of this jira and not worth backporting)., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Abe, there's a problem in the 3.4 patch - the "c client" section replaced the c cli usage with java cli, but otw it's still referring to the c client. You probably want to do the same thing you did with trunk, although it might be good to call out the c cli as a sample/example in that section, just not call it out as something to use other than as a c client sample.

Otw the patch looks good., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
