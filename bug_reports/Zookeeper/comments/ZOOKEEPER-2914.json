    Thanks @dolphy17 - I will look at this, but I already noticed that it's not applying to branch-3.4 (it does apply cleanly to branch-3.5 and trunk) - can you submit a separate pull request for branch-3.4?

    Thanks @dolphy17 . In future please try to base on a branch as close to the current head of the release branch as possible (helps in testing/signoff). Also this is not the default branch for the repo so you'll need to close manually.

    Sure. I might have forgotten to fast forward branch-3.4 before patching it if that's what you mean.
