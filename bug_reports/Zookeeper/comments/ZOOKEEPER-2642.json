    [ZOOKEEPER-2642] Resurrect the reconfig() methods that were in ZooKeeper.java.

    Resurrect the reconfig() methods that were in ZooKeeper.java. While 3.5.x is an alpha there are clients in production that are relying on the current specification. The reconfig() methods are marked deprecated to inform that they will be removed later. The "new" methods in the new class ZooKeeperAdmin were renamed reconfigure() to avoid getting the deprecation annotation inherited and to provide clarity. Both reconfig() and reconfigure() are implemented via protected methods in ZooKeeper.java

    Resurrect the reconfig() methods that were in ZooKeeper.java. While 3.5.x is an alpha there are clients in production that are relying
    on the current specification. The reconfig() methods are marked deprecated to inform that they will be removed later. The "new" methods
    in the new class ZooKeeperAdmin were renamed reconfigure() to avoid getting the deprecation annotation inherited and to provide clarity.

This message is automatically generated., I don't mind making this change, although it is a bit odd to deprecate a method in an  alpha API. Does anyone else have a concern about this?, bq. although it is a bit odd to deprecate a method in an alpha API.

FWIW as a user I'd think it as notice of a breaking API shipped in 3.5 where it will happen in 3.6. This is pretty standard practice. I suppose since 3.5 has always been tagged alpha it would not be unreasonable to make breaking changes in place in 3.5. However 3.5 has been alpha for a long time, and some have given up waiting and resorted to using it in production (!), so as a courtesy to them it seems reasonable., Github user hanm commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/122
  
    Please also update the reconfig documentation about deprecating old API and about the new API in ZooKeeperAdmin:
    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/zookeeperReconfig.xml#L299
    
    Other than this, the patch lgtm.

, Github user fpj commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/122
  
    Just so that I understand, when are we going to be removing this methods, in trunk? I'm asking this for two reasons:
    
    1. So that users know in which version these methods are going away
    2. What changes we need to apply to trunk. In trunk, we would need to at least change in the admin class `reconfig()` to `reconfigure()`, but it sounds like we don't need to bring back the old `reconfig` methods.

    >> it sounds like we don't need to bring back the old reconfig methods.
    
    Agree, for trunk the change would be just rename ZooKeeperAdmin::reconfig to ZooKeeperAdmin::reconfigure so it's consistent with branch-3.5 (with some documentation updates and tests update.).

    Are you OK with us removing the deprecated methods when 3.5 becomes GA?

    We need to either create a new issue or have a different pull request for 3.5 under this same issue. I'd rather do the latter just so that we wrap this up in one shot, but it depends on whether @Randgalt is willing to do it.

    No. I'd vote against that. Breaking changes should be in a 3.6 version. That was the genesis of this issue to begin with. Regardless of the intent of the ZK team, 3.5.x has been in production in a large number of companies for years now. To break a public API without increment the version will cause unnecessary problems.

    Sounds OK to me.
    
    >> We need to either create a new issue or have a different pull request for 3.5 under this same issue
    
    I think this pull request (122) should target branch 3.5, because it keeps the old API. We need create a new PR that target master which only contain updates to the API name (reconfig -> reconfigure) and some doc / test updates without bringing back the old APIs.
    
    @Randgalt Could you update the base branch of this PR to be branch-3.5 instead of master? I think this PR is ready to land in branch-3.5.
    
    @fpj I can create a new PR target master that only contain API name changes, if @Randgalt does not get ahead of me on this work.

    No we don't (what @fpj prefers wrapping both PR in one shot under ZOOKEEPER-2642). 
    
    @Randgalt Do you mind update the current PR (https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/122) so it apply to master, by removing the old reconfig APIs? 
, Github user Randgalt commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/122
  
    OK - to be clear, I have PR #151 which applies the legacy API to branch-3.5. Then, I'll rework _this_ PR (against master) to only have the Admin API, right?
