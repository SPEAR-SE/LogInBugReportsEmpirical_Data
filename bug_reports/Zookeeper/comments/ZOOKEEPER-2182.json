[As per the contribution wiki, test suite classes must end with "Test" in the class name.

I'm attaching a patch.  It looks big, but it's a straightforward change.  It's just {{git mv X.java XTest.java}}, followed by updating the class name within the file.

There is one more small change in {{ClientRetryTest}}.  It turns out this test had a bug that was causing it to fail.  It's probably been this way for a very long time.  The test is trying to cover the case of client connections getting rejected for exceeding max server connections, then validating that the client connection can proceed after one of the other existing client connections is closed.  It never actually closed a client though, so I added a close call:

{code}
                cdw1.reset();
                zk.close(); // <-- I added this line.
                cdw1.waitForDisconnected(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT);
{code}
