This message is automatically generated., I must agree that the test awkward. Now, it takes 2 seconds on my laptop, so I don't understand why it takes 40 seconds on your computer, Pat.

I think the idea of the test is not bad, but the implementation could be improved. For example, we could check if the latency if at most 10% higher after populating (10% is an arbitrary number, since it will be impossible to get exact values).

If you guys feel strongly about removing it, I don't object and +1 it., its a little tricky to have latency tests as a part of unit testing. I think we should remove it. ben are you going to remove the file and commit?, Committed revision 912052.
