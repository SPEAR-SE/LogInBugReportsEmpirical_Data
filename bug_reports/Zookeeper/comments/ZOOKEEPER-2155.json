[Thanks for the report [~linking12] - though, watches are expected to be cleared when an Observer resyncs with the Leader. Given that clients get disconnected when the Observer goes from OBSERVING → LOOKING, it's also expected for them to reset their watches when the Observer becomes available again (i.e.: LOOKING → OBSERVING)., [~rgs] per your previous comment - should this defect be closed?, Unless we can get a better description of what's going on ... , Please reopen if there is more information here]
