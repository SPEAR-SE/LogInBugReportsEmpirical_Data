[Hi Matan,

Do you have logs that you could attach?. 

Thanks
Powell., It's been a while so I tried this again on ZK 3.4.6 following the same steps I outlined above and it is consistent.  DEBUG logs are attached.

Note that I used 88.198.26.2 as the dummy IP for this test that I blackholed.

I'm interested to know if this is by design or actually an issue.

Thanks!, this isn't surprising given the way we implement connections in QuorumCnxManager. I'd personally love to see a better implementation of that class using selectors and such. ]
