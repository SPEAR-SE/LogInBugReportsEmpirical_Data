[Nice one! Fixing this would be a great opportunity for someone interested to learn more about server side code. ;-), Unable to replicate this bug. I've tested using the CLI:

[zk: (CONNECTED) 2] setAcl /dummy world:anyone:cdrwa
Node does not exist: /dummy

I have also tested this scenario using the attached python script:

Connecting to localhost:2181 -- 
Setting ACL on /dummy
Exception: no node

Am I missing something? , i think the problem was in a the client library on top of zookeeper, i tried debugging the server code but its doing everything correct  and raising the exception and no node error code. the python script savu attached works as expected, i'm closing this out as invalid., According to the comment this should have been closed out as invalid. Marking as such.]
