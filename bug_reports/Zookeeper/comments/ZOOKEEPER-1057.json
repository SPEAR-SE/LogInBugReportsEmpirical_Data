[Woody,
 Would you be uploading a patch for this?, Not a blocker., Ben,
 Can you take a look at this? Do you think this should be a blocker for 3.4?, Is this still and issue? Sounds pretty serious., It would be good indeed if someone could have a look at this. The description gives some pretty good hint of where the problem is, so it might not be too hard., I'm not sure what the description mean with reusing the file descriptor. We set zh->fd to -1 after the close in handle_error and when we create a socket it should get a new fd, no?, On holidays. Back on December 17th.

I will read mails from time to time.
, I'll take a look., This patch adds a test to validate that the c client gets connected to the second server in the list if the first server is down when zookeeper_init is called., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Do we know if this is a problem in the test case or it might be an error in the implementation?
Because if there is any chance that this is a bug, then I think this JIRA should be marked as a Blocker., This is a problem with the test case, and we still don't know if there is a bug in the c client. The test is failing because zoo_deterministic_conn_order() is broken with the dynamic reconfig change. I'll mark this as a blocker until we know for sure there is no bug in the client code., If this is a change due to reconfig, do we really need to block 3.4.6?, ZOOKEEPER-1057-b3.4 is the port of Michi's test case to 3.4 branch. It fails for me.
It uses a standalone server, instead of TestQuorumServer, since I figured that we just need a server listening on one port to test this., The trunk version of the b3.4 patch, for whatever it is worth.
I guess it will work just as Michi's patch., The test is simpler and looks better if integrated into TestClient.cc.
The attached patch can be applied both to trunk and branch 3.4.
With this version, the test case passes for the single threaded version, but for the multithreaded version it hangs forever (or at least more than a few minutes)., The attached patch has a proposed test case that passes both in trunk and 3.4.
It was my mistake, one zookeeper_close too many in the last patch., ... and now with the deterministic connection order, to make sure it is not just luck that it was working.
I am very sorry for the spam, I think I need the holidays., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1, it is good for me. [~michim], could you give it a look, please?, +1 The patch looks good to me, though I thought zoo_deterministic_conn_order was broken in trunk. I'll commit this patch and open a separate jira when I have a test case that shows zoo_deterministic_conn_order is broken., trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1556948
