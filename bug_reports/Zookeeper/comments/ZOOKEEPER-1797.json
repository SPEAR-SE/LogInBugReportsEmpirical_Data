[Thanks for reporting this issue, Derek. This happens only if you are using autopurge, yes? , Perhaps, but also when using a well-intentioned cron job innocently invoking PurgeTxnLog. :), [~fpj] I've reviewed the code, AFAIK both autopurge and cron job will be affected and can mistakenly delete the log or snap files. Kindly see the proposed patch when you get sometime. Also, I've tried to simulate the case through one test case. Thanks.

+Proposed algo:+
If logs are rolling or a new snapshot is created during this process, these newest N snapshots or logs will be excluded from current purging cycle. Here my idea is not to loose any info, anyway it can be taken care on next cycle., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I tried to reproduce this issue using the unit-test code of the attachment patch(testPurgeWhenLogRollingInProgress) in zookeeper ver 3.4.5.
But I could not reproduce.

So, I tried to reproduce the bug with earthquake.
Earthquake is a framework of fault injectors and implementation level model checkers. It aims to find bugs in distributed system related to hardware faults and non-determinism.
For more information please refer to the github.
https://github.com/osrg/earthquake

As a result, znode loss could be reproduced successfully. I'd like to share the test case with zookeeper community because it is useful for checking degrading which can be caused during development.
The test case can be found in the below branch of our zookeeper repository:
https://github.com/osrg/zookeeper/tree/zookeeper-1797

Useful information for using the test case and reproducing the bug can be found in the below file:
https://github.com/osrg/zookeeper/tree/zookeeper-1797/earthquake/zookeeper-1797/README.txt

Because of immaturity of earthquake, the test code isn't user friendly. But the test case itself is useful and earthquake can be used for testing zookeeper and find other bugs potentially, so I'd like to hear your comments.

Regards,
Fukuda
, In addition, You can try earthquake in just one-line command, too: `docker run -i -t --rm osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-1797`
