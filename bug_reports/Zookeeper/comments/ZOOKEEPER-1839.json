[From threaddump, it seems the deadlock is occuring in following way:

NettyServerCnxn -> sendCloseSession
When closing it got an exception and invokes CnxnChannelHandler#exceptionCaught, this will acquire 'factory.cnxns' and call NioWorker#close. Now closure will try to acquire 'channels lock'

NioWorker -> writeFromTaskLoop
Here NioWorker has acquired 'channels lock' and fireExceptionCaught. Now, exceptionCaught will be calling NettyServerCnxn#close() and try to acquire lock on 'factory.cnxns', I have attached an initial draft patch. In the proposed fix, it will close the connection channel outside the 'ServerConnectionFactory.cnxns' lock. Please help me to review the changes.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the patch Rakesh, it looks good to me. One minor nit about code formatting:

{noformat}
+                LOG.warn(
+                        "Ignoring exception closing cnxn sessionid 0x"
+                                + Long.toHexString(cnxn.getSessionId()), e);
{noformat}

could be:

{noformat}
+                LOG.warn("Ignoring exception closing cnxn sessionid 0x"
+                         + Long.toHexString(cnxn.getSessionId()), e);
{noformat}

Rakesh, where did you see this deadlock? Is this related to some of the windows test failures?, Thank you Michi for the review, updated the modified patch by addressing the comment. I've observed this, when running NioNettySuiteTest in Windows machine. But when analyzing the threaddump and netty source code, I feel this case can occur in any env., -1 overall.
