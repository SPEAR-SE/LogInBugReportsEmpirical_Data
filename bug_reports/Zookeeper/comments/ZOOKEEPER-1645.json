[Attached a patch to add the three missing packages to the Import-Package MANIFEST header, Committed to 3.4.6 and trunk. Thanks Arnoud!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1836 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1836/])
    ZOOKEEPER-1645. ZooKeeper OSGi package imports not complete (Arnoud Glimmerveen via phunt) (Revision 1446828)

     Result = SUCCESS

, Great that the patch is applied, but while reviewing the changes myself I realized something: the build.xml creates two jar files. The attached patch only fixed the headers for the jar created in the *jar* target and not the one in *bin-jar*. Not sure if I understand the build.xml correctly, but it appears the latter is to be uploaded to maven. In any case, the headers should be consistent in both jar files.
I think the patch provided for ZOOKEEPER-1334 may have the same issue!

Should I create a new issue for this?, Yes, please create a new jira with the fixes for both.

Note - "jar" creates a jar with both classes and sources included, "bin-jar" is just the classes (no source).

Thanks for catching this!, Closing issues after releasing 3.4.6.]
