[fixed documentation with correct default for snapcount

also fixed what looked like a typo in the docs - seems some text from another parameter was incorrectly
copied for this parameter. I think I fixed this by removing the unneccessary text (it's copied from another
param in that same document), +1 the patch looks good., I just committed this. thanks pat.]
