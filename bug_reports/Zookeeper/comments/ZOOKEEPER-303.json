[The {{readlink}} command is used to canonicalize the start script, following symlinks recursively. This is a useful feature to have as it allows the scripts to be symlinked. I've attached a patch that detects if readlink is available. If it's not then you have to call the scripts directly (without symlinks) - which is a good compromise as it means the scripts can be used on Macs, while still supporting symlinks on Linux. 

Note also, as a workaround you can install GNU readlink (MacPorts: {{port install coreutils}}) and change {{readlink}} to {{greadlink}} in the scripts., +1 the patch looks good. .. ZOOKEEPER-299 is a duplicate of this ...
