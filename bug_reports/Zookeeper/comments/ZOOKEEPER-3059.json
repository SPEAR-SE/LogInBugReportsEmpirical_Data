This one reminds me the other issue I've just linked. You might want to take a look at the patch attached to it., [~andorm] Thanks for pointing out the jira. I was earlier thinking about taking a similar approach and making the close call less restrictive so as to work in the case of auth failed too, however going through the documentation a bit i see that auth_failed is considered similar to session expired (both are fatal events) and for session expire we do kill the event thread automatically, hence i went with a similar approach to kill the event thread in case of auth failed too, rather than leaving it to the user (by changing the close method and expecting the event thread to be shutdown when that is called post auth failed). What do you think?Â , [~hanm] [~phunt] [~andorm] Can i bother you guys for a review? :), Of course, anytime [~abhishek.chouhan]
