[sample program and gdb stack traces., client log with debug logging on., Thanks Kapil - I'll take a look. From the stack trace it looks as though a pending completion callback is null and therefore something weird is going on with a completion dispatcher being freed before it is finished being used. As per usual I can't reproduce on my machine, but this is enough information to dig into it. , i've uploaded the core file here http://kapilt.com/files/zkpython-segfault-on-close-core.bz2

a little more poking around in gdb, shows the packet to be a ping one.

(gdb) print hdr
$8 = {xid = -2, zxid = 181, err = 0}
,  Compressed the core file is small enough to just attach to the ticket. , Note that this is the same assertion as in ZOOKEEPER-707, which is not related to the python client. 

I need to understand why it's an error for the completion callback to be null when processing a ping, since send_ping explicitly queues a null callback... ]
