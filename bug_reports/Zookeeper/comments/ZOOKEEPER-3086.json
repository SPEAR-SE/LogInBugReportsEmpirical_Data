[[~elessar] thanks for reporting the issue, you mentioned at step 5, the follower blocks on Learner.ping forever due to the lack of write timeout, but in the follower/leader socket, we do set the timeout to be tickTime * syncLimit, it should timed out if we cannot send the ping within that time., ZK codebase uses `Socket.setSoTimeout` to setup a timeout, however based on the [documentation|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#setSoTimeout-int-] it's only used for read operations.
{quote}With this option set to a non-zero timeout, a read() call on the InputStream associated with this Socket will block for only this amount of time.
