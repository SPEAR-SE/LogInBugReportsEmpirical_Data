[The patch queue now has a setting:

(10:28:53 AM) nigelcdn: There's a new file in src/java/test/bin/test-patch.properties in which is defined the acceptable number of warnings
(10:29:03 AM) nigelcdn: use it very judiciously ;-)

after this issue is fixed we should adjust that file back to 0.
, The patch for this issue should also update src/java/test/bin/test-patch.properties to set OK_FINDBUGS_WARNINGS=0, This issue has been resolved in ZOOKEEPER-900. We should resolve this issue, perhaps after getting a confirmation from Hudson., fyi, I had not included test-patch.properties file in my diff., Agreed, I've seen that 900 didn't include it. I'd rather let Pat take care of wrapping up this issue... , Sounds good. Let's clear out 900 then we can adjust the OK setting back to 0 (as part of this jira) once 900 is committed., This patch addressed 4 out of 10 of the findbugs issues.

Flavio please take a look at the remaining 6 - they are in quorum code., I have fixed all remaining warnings, but the ones on QuorumCnxManager. I want to check if they are being fixed in one of the current pending patches that Vishal has been working on. It makes more sense to fix them separately.

For Follower, Observer, and Learner, I have removed the synchronization blocks around pendingRevalidations. It seems ok to me to remove them, and this is what findbugs was apparently complaining about.

For AuthFLE, I have fixed synchronization blocks in a different way, by simply replacing the objects we were synchronizing on. In the case of acksqueue, I have replaced the data structure we were using from LinkedBlockQueue to HashSet. It made sense to me to make the change given the way were using acksqueue and fixes the warning.   , bq.  It makes more sense to fix them separately.

that's fine, except that the patch queue is failing until those jiras are committed (eta?). If we want to go that route let me know and I'll temporarily change the "allow this many fb errors" count on the patch queue. Then when those other jiras are addressed we can change the value back to 0., It is ok with me to fix the warnings in QCM to get hudson to work. I'm uploading a new patch., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., the patch looks good except for two issues i see:

1) ackset is not consistently synchronized. my impression is that this could be a ConcurrentHashMap and then the single synchronized block can be removed.
2) challengeMap is not consistently synchronized, so it is hard to understand if that synchronized block is correct.

, Flavio can you address these concerns? Thanks., Thanks for your comments, Ben.

1- I have made ackset a "ConcurrentHashMap";
2- The blocks synchronized on challengeMap were to guarantee that challengeMap and challengeMutex are accessed atomically. I have changed the monitor object to "Messenger.this" to avoid confusion, but let me know what you think. I have also made HashMaps concurrent, since there could be multiple threads accessing., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
