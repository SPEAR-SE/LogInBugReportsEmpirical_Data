[It might also make sense to more aggressively delete invalid snapshots (in the mode of ZOOKEEPER-3082). If its straightforward to identify and purge such files then we won't have to worry about deleting valid snapshots in order to preserve invalid snapshots., [~jiangjiafu]

good issue.yep!
the data-loss situation can only happen when the retained count of snapshots were all invalid(very unfortunatelyï¼Œlittle probability) and at that time,zk server took any new snapshots.
the specific source codes about the *restore* can be found in:
