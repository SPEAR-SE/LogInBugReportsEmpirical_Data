[The problem was building the package version of zkpython - ant didn't realise it wasn't Java. I've added a package project to build.xml in zkpython which allows the package target to build correctly., Patch addressing Hudson build failure on contrib., packaging still failed if src/c wasn't compiled. I fixed this and also removed tabs from build.xml

Note: non-java code is not compiled as part of package, only the source is distributed (and build(.xml) setup to allow users to easily build).
, I just committed this. Thanks henry and pat... we'll have to re submit all the PA's so trigger hudson., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #321 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/321/])
