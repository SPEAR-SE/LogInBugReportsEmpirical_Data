[Hi [~mcandre], If it is fixed in 3.5.1-alpha, then you should just use that version. Does it make sense?, Thanks, I might try that. Though I'd prefer to use a stable release
version, if that makes sense.

, It does make sense to prefer a stable release, so perhaps you should be using releases from the 3.4 branch instead, unless you really need the features in 3.5., Are any 3.x release versions fixed for this issue? The latest download
appears to be 3.4.6, which is still affected.

, Ok, I misunderstood what you said above about the versions prior to 3.5.0-alpha. Looking at your log lines, the client isn't really completing the connection establishment. "CONNECTING" here means that it is still trying  to connect:

{noformat}
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTING) 0] create /dog moon
{noformat}

and you should be seeing something like this instead:

{noformat}
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0]
{noformat}

Is there an issue with docker when trying to connect to localhost:2181?, Is this still and issue? If not we should close it.]
