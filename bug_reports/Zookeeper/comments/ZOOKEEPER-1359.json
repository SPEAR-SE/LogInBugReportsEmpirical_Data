[One suggestion could be 
{noformat}
 commandMap.put("create", "[-s] [-e] path [data] [acl]");
{noformat}

thanks, Moving it out to 3.4.4.

@Kavita, 
 Want to take a crack at a patch?, ok, Moving it out since its not a blocker., The latest revision of org/apache/zookeeper/cli/CreateCommand.java already has the following line: 
super("create", "[-s] [-e] path [data] [acl]")

So it's already fixed, isn't it?

, Good point Edward. I tested with trunk and it was fine. Must have been fixed at some point. Marking as a dup., Does anyone know what the first release this was fixed was?, Apparently it was fixed here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-271. According to the info in the jira, it will be available in 3.5.0 (trunk currently).]
