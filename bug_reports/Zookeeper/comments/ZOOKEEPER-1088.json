[Ah this appears to be just a really poorly-documented feature. If no flag is passed, it will completely delete the node. If both flags are passed, it will swallow the command. Deciding whether to clean that up or just close this., camille, 
 Should we fix the documentation of atleast the command output for better reporting?, Yes. We should probably also make setquota accept both -n and -b when called from the client instead of barfing. Very frustrating. ]
