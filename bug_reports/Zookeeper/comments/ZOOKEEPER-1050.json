[Patch attached that:

* fixes line endings on windows

This message is automatically generated., Hi Will, thanks. Note that the patch needs to be created relative to "trunk" directory: i.e. http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/zookeeper/trunk/  that's why qabot failed.

Also, some of the changes in your patch have already been fixed in trunk. 

What's your interest, to fix for future releases or 3.3.5/3.4.3 as well?

If the former you'll just need to create a diff of current trunk. see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/HowToContribute

If the latter it's likely you'd have to create separate patches for each fix release - 3.5.0, 3.3.5, 3.4.3.
, i don't really need any version fixed, this was just an attempt to fix a minor issue i saw.  feel free to close this unless someone else really wants a patch for some other branch.  

Note: i do think that the use of Class-Path in zooInspector's jar file is a bit irritating which is why i took it out in my patch.  For those of use getting zookeeper via maven or some other repo it makes life harder for no real benefit since a glob (lib/*.jar) in the shell script does the same thing and is much easier to change by an end user if necessary., I'd like to fix this, would you mind contributing a patch against trunk?
