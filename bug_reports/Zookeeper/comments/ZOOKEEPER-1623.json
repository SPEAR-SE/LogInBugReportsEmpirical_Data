[Adding ZOOKEEPER-1510 as related since this might be due to confusion about the meaning of the SASL-related log messages., This modification stores in a member variable of ZooKeeperSaslClient during construction whether the user intends to use Sasl authentication or not, and then uses it instead of checking the configuration again., This is the first patch that I submit and the first time that I input anything in JIRA, so I might have done silly things as sending the previous comment without intention.
My interpretation of the text in the TODO that is in the current ZooKeeperSaslClient.java, is that this modification should be done. And it solves the problem of the excessive logging.
I didn't think that a test case was really required for this, but since it is in the procedure, one is suggested in the patch.
Can anybody please tell me if the change is correct?, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., the patch does work in my machine. The main difference in the error log is below.
It seems that the modification has the side effect of creating more socket descriptors and this ends up causing a "Too many open files" error in testQuorumSystemChange of ReconfigTest.
I have no idea how to fix that. I guess I will have to remove the patch so Jenkins doesn't keep complaining about it.
