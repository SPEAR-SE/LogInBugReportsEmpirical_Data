[here's a recent case: https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-jdk7/696/, Alex can you take a look? This test was introduced in ZOOKEEPER-107 " Allow dynamic changes to server cluster membership (Alex Shraer via breed)", Seems like this is whats killing it. Have you seen this before ?

, I'm not sure, is that really the issue? What does junit mean when it says "crashed"? Did the jvm itself crash?, Is there still a problem ? I don't see error emails about this test since April 20, [~shralex] - looks like it failed again just yesterday: https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-jdk8/85/, This test is failing intermittently on precommit build as well.

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/2384/
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/2387/, The issue reported here is the same as what's described in ZOOKEEPER-2080, so resolve as Duplicated.]
