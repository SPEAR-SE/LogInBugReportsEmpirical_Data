[this patch includes a test that shows the problem. I'm not certain how to fix it though.

Also, it seems like access to authInfo should be synchronized - since multiple threads are potentially
accessing it at the same time (client & sendthread for example), Ben can you take a look at this? The basic problem is that the authinfo is sent to
the server during primeconnection, if the client adds auth after this, but before the
connection is fully established, the authinfo is not transmitted to the server until
the next reconnect. 

We should verify the c client as well., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
