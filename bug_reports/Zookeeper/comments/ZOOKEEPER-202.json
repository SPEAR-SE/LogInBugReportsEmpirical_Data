[i had seen this problem with one of our users earlier and the problem had boiled down to some ptoblem at the leader wherein it got some error while processing the disconnect and didnt send out the disconnect to all the followers.. I think I had fixed it on Source forge. If possible you should take a look at the leaders log to see if you can find something,., Unfortunately, the leader logs were not available. We could perhaps take a look at the bugs fixed on sourceforge then, to see if there is one that maps to this problem. , What version of zk is the client/server running?, Servers are running 1.2.0-130, built on 04/14/2008., Mahadev, Is this the one you're talking about:  1982992   concurrency issue in the zookeeper leader code?

, 1.2.0-130??? That's not a zk version number, any idea which version of zk this corresponds to? (sourceforge has 2.x.x version numbers for example), I think it's 2.1.0 from sourceforge. That release was done on 4/29/2008. (It might have been built earlier.)

The latest sourceforge release 2.2.1 has the fix., This issue has already been fixed in a previous version., @flavio 
yes thats the bug
just adding a link here in case someone needs a reference to it...
