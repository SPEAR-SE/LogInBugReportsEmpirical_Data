[Another Bug: in send_auth_info, the check is not correct

 while (auth->next != NULL) {  //--BUG: in cases where there is only one auth in the list, this will never send that auth, as its next will be NULL
        rc = send_info_packet(zh, auth);
        auth = auth->next;
    }

FIX IS:
 do  {
        rc = send_info_packet(zh, auth);
        auth = auth->next;
    } while (auth != NULL); //this will make sure that even if there is one auth ,that will get sent.

, another bug
{noformat}
    303 static void mark_active_auth(zhandle_t *zh) {
    304     auth_list_head_t auth_h = zh->auth_h;
    305     auth_info *element;
    306     if (auth_h.auth == NULL) {
    307         return;
    308     }
    309     element = auth_h.auth;
    310     while (element->next != NULL) {
    311         element->state = 1;
    312         element = element->next;
    313     }
    314 }
    315
{no format}

Here as well we are skipping the first node in the list and in case of N nodes , we will skip processing the last one. \\
It should be changed to
{no format}
310 while (element != NULL) {
{no format}, Not sure if this is a bug or behavior:

When we get a auth response, every time we process any auth_response, we call all the auth completions (might be registered by different add_auth_info calls). Is that intended? Or should we be calling only the one that the request came from? I guess we dont know for which request the response corresponds to? If the requests are processed in FIFO and response are got in order then may be we can figure out which add_auth info request the response corresponds to.

We never remove entries from the auth_list, is that intended?

Also the logging is misleading. 
{noformat}
   1193     if (rc) {
   1194         LOG_ERROR(("Authentication scheme %s failed. Connection closed.",
   1195                    zh->auth_h.auth->scheme));
   1196     }
   1197     else {
   1198         LOG_INFO(("Authentication scheme %s succeeded", zh->auth_h.auth->scheme));
   1199     }


If there are multiple auth_info in the auth_list , we always print success/failure for ONLY the first one. So if i had two auths for scehmes, ABCD and EFGH and my auth scheme EFGH failed, the logs will still say ABCD failed.

 Are you going to open new jiras for the others issues? , I can.. what do you recommend. we can check in this 2 bug fixes and resolve this and i can open another tracker for outstanding issues., Opened following 2 trackers for the outstanding issues.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1126
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1127
, Added test case and fix for #1126, The attached patch is for issue: where the auth requests (first one) are not sent to server if the client has not yet connected to server (and state has not yet transitioned into ZOO_CONNECTING) , due to bug in send_auth_info. to write a test case for this, i had to fix ZOOKEEPER-1126 first, as without that fix, zoo_add_auth will always return ZKINVALIDSTATE.
I will update and close ZOOKEEPER-1126 (as its patch is also available in this).

This message is automatically generated., Mahadev, can you review the patch and check it in , if all looks good to you? All tests are passing now without any issues., thanks dheeraj,
 Will do  today/tommorrow., Dheeraj,
 Looks like you added, the new state of NOT_CONNECTED_STATE in the header definitions. That probably needs a little more work, since the java client will need to have similar changes. I'd say we get rid of the new state in this patch! Makes sense?
, If we get rid of the new state, then we will have to get rid of the tests as well. As we cant test it without having the new state, as zk_init will return INVALID state in that case.
This new state is not publicly exposed.
We already have a different state in java (NULL) . In C, we are using 0 for both CLOSED state and NOT_CONNECTED state. In java, NOT_CONNECTED state is null.
, Mahadev, what do you say? We would like to get this into 3.4 since it causes us a lot of grief with the auth in the C client. I think Dheeraj's point is good, and the Java and C clients are already divergent enough in this manner that this shouldn't be an issue., Adding java changes to the patch, +1 overall.
