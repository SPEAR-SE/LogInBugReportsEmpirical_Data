[Possibly a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-1594

Re-assigning to Marshall who wrote the test.
, Yes, I agree with Alex, this looks like a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-1594 which had fallen off my radar as I hadn't seen it fail for a long time. I'll set aside some time this week to look at that jira again.

Shall we close this one as a dup?, Sure thing so long as we're looking at the problem somewhere. Too many intermittently failing builds right now.]
