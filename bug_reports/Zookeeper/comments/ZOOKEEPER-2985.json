[Hi. Chris Thunes. We have met this bug in our product. But we didn't find out the cause then. We  deleted the ephemeral node that should have been expired and let the bug go.

May you tell me how to find out the detail cause? by debug log ? or something else?

thanks a lot.

Thanks for reporting this.

I think this is related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1208 which has intentionally introduced the closing state for events which have been expired, but `closeSession` has not been acknowledged by the quorum.

Will the ephemerals be removed eventually once the quorum established or they survive forever because of the race condition?, The ephemeral nodes do eventually get removed once the new ZK leader marks the session as expired and performs the associated session tear down.

One fix may be to have the server close the client connection, _without_ sending the Expired event, if it finds the session is in the closing state with an uncommitted closeSession entry. Alternatively, session re-validation could be blocked for "closing" sessions until their corresponding closeSession entry is committed.]
