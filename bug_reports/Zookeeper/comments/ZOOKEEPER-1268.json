[This patch (one for trunk, one for 34) introduces ROM as an experimental feature, most critically it's "off by default". afaict ROM was never documented beyond JIRA/wiki, so it's safe to say experimental imo. I added details to the admin guide to capture information on how to turn on or find out more.

I also made a small tweak to the test to allow it to run on slow hardware., +1, looks good to me., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
