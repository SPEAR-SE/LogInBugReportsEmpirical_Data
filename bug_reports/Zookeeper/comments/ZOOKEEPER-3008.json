    Same feedback as #495 
    
    1) check the callers and see if it's handled properly. Likely it will be logged there as well. Verify/report.
    2) No need to say exception in an exception. The text of LOG.error line seems like it would have been a good error string for the exception itself.
    3) as previously noted, add a test.
