[[~shralex], do you think you can have a look here? Is there any other jira for this same problem already?, This seems new. I can't see anything in the logs except for the fact that it failed. If I understand correctly this is the client-side reconfiguration, and the check tests whether we're in a special non-round-robin mode following a reconfig. Re-assigning to
[~marshall] who implemented client-side reconfiguration in C and the tests for this., I'm seeing this same failure on ubuntu 14.04, can someone take a look? [~shralex] or [~marshall]?
