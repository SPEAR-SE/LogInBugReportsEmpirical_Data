[+1 looks good., This patch definitely resolves the nasty issue I was seeing yesterday that generated the log I attached to #62 (when applied to r701567).

One problem I'm still noticing is that whenever I lose a follower, the leader and remaining follower start eating up the entire CPU. I've attached configs and stack traces.

Thanks FPJ!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #104 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/104/])
