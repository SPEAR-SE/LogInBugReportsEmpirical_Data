[Mihai thanks for the report. Would it be possible for you to run this with DEBUG logging turned on for the server and attach the server logs from after the test run?, Right now i'm leaving for a trip but as soon as i get a computer i'll do that. No later than 22'th March. , No problem. You did an awesome job documenting the issue, I was just wondering if you had it close to hand (would make it easier for reviewers to take a look). Thanks!, Zookeeper server log with DEBUG enabled when the issue appears.
, Pat,

I looked through the scenarios and don't see anything that stands our as likely to be due to multi.

Mihai,

If you do the deletes without multi, do you see the problem?

, OK.  THis is strange.  I made some changes at git://github.com/tdunning/play.git

These include:

- made the test run as a test instead of as main. (trivial change to all mvn test to work)

- changed the classpath logic to look in ../zookeeper-3.4.5 for a dev version of Zookeeper.  (trivial change for convenience)

- unrolled all of the multi's into a loop that calls each op separately.  (this is the money)

Around line 139, I have two versions of an unrolled delete.  One is this:

{code}
            zooKeeper.delete(op.getPath(), -1);
{code}

and the other is this:

{code}
            zooKeeper.multi(ImmutableList.of(op));
{code}

These should be equivalent. 

They are not.

So the problem has nothing really to do with the multi-ness and seems to have something to do with the
way that multi does one of the single deletions.

I don't have more time today, but hopefully this puts the ball a little further down the field.]
