This message is automatically generated., this patch subsumes zookeeper-1192-ver1.patch (both issues touched the same two files).
I added two new tests to Zab1_0Test.java that test exactly for the two error scenarios described above in the bug report.

This message is automatically generated., Could you please open a review request?, can we break this out from 1192? most of the work in this patch is in the tests anyway. i think it keeps this review simpler.

a couple of small comments:

1) you misspell follwer
2) you should comment testLeaderInConnectingFollwers the importance of the joins after the starts
3) in the Mock Threads, when you detect an error, set it to a string that describes the error so that you can print it on the assert
4) testLeaderInElectingFollwers can be simplified by not starting the leader and making sure the followers fail. this also removes the need for the sleep

, thanks, ben, I fixed these., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
