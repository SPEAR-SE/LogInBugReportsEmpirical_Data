[[~jiangjiafu] please change the title to be explicitly about the network ACL not shutdown on leader. Because in shutdown case, the follower should detect the connection being reset immediately after it, so it won't wait sync timeout before starting a new leader election.

In this case, the quorum is unavailable for syncLimit * tickTIme (+ leader election/activation time), not the session timeout.

In ZK, improper syncLimit, tickTIme, session timeout could cause undesired behavior, for example, if syncLimit * tickTime is larger than session timeout, then the client will expire due to one server is slow due to full GC or network issue. You need to make the session timeout relatively larger than the syncLimit * tickTime, so the global sessions won't expire due to network partition/ACL like the scenario you mentioned here.]
