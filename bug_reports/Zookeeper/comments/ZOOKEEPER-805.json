[Hi, I'm new to Zookeeper but stumbled upon this bug too. The solution is to add the -q1 parameter to nc.

The reason is that by default nc closes the connection as soon as the stdin closes. With -q1 you can override this behavior.

Hope this helps., Linking to ZOOKEEPER-737, which is similar to this, the diff being that 737 was found/fixed against the legacy "nc", while this issue seems related to the new (bsd ported) version of nc, Thanks for pointing out that option, I wasn't aware of it. I linked to ZOOKEEPER-737 which we fixed recently. The "old" version of nc had this same behavior, but we fixed it. I'm not sure what's diff about the old/new version of nc that's causing this.

btw, we should updated the "nc" related ZK docs to point out this option. Is this option available in all nc versions? we may need to note that in the docs as well., Pat,
   You think this should go into 3.3.2?
, Hi Mahadev, I don't think that's necessary given you can fallback to "traditional" nc, or you can use the -q option as suggested by akovi.

On my ubuntu system (lucid/maverick) I have two executables; nc.openbsd and nc.traditional. "nc" links to openbsd version by default.

Honestly I'm not sure why this is no longer working, given that we addressed the "nc closes input first" in ZOOKEEPER-737, sure, do you want to add some documentation to zookeeper admin guide to make it clearer on using -q and the issue with openbsd?
, Not a blocker, pushing to 3.3.3/3.4.0, not a blocker. Moving it out of 3.4 release., Possibly related to ZOOKEEPER-1197 ?, I verified that this has already been fixed. The 4 letter command works with both nc.traditional (v1.10-39) and nc.openbsd (Debian patchlevel 1.89-4ubuntu1).]
