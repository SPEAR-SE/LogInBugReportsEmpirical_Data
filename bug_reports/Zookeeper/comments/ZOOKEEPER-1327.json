This message is automatically generated., I just committed this. I had to change the patches for trunk and 3.4 because of some conflicts and ant docs was complaining. Unfortunately, I forgot to create a patch before doing ant docs, else would have posted the patch I committed. Neways, thanks for the patch!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1451 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1451/])
    ZOOKEEPER-1327. there are still remnants of hadoop urls. (Harsh J via mahadev)
