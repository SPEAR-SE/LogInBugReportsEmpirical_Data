[fixes timing issue with data watch obj test

also adds test which verifies multiple watches on a node work properly
, I'm thrown by:

 
+                // small chance that is hasn't been delivered yet, ignore
+                assertEquals(0, watchers[i].events.size());

Why would we ignore? If size > 0, it means that we got an event we weren't expecting right? The check looks correct, but the comment looks wrong. 

, fixed the doc, Committed revision 692452., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #76 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/76/]), 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
