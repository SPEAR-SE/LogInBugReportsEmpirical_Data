[Patch available for review., [~bhavanki] consider removing yourself as assignee and setting issue status to todo instead of in progress.
I've turned on flag in JIRA that the issue has a patch.

I'm guessing it may help ZooKeeper committers find issues which are pending to be done, and have patches. Now they may think issue is being actively worked on by someone., Thanks for the reminder. I've unassigned myself but can't seem to change the status.]
