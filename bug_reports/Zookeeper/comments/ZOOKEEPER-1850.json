[Apparently it is an issue with the DNS of my ISP?
It resolves anything that has subdomains to an IP address, so zookeeper_init just tries to connect there.
If I put just a hostname, with no subdomains, then the test case works. This is what the patch is doing.
I don't know if anybody else has seen this problem, but just in case ..., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I wonder if under some setups Â¨thisisanonexistinghost" would be resolved by virtue of wildcard configs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record). I wonder if it would be worthwhile to stub out DNS queries. Thoughts?, I think you are right, and actually this was how it was done until ZOOKEEPER-208. See [http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/zookeeper/branches/branch-3.4/src/c/tests/TestZookeeperInit.cc?revision=704657&view=markup] line 212.
It was changed in order to make it thread safe, but I think the mocked gethostbyname is thread-safe anyway. I will change it back., I meant the MockFailed_gethostbyname, which is an inline function in LibCMocks.h, Unfortunately the mocking thing is more complicated than I thought, and I don't think it is worthwhile.
As you say, trying to update the FQDN here so that it fails in all cases might not be feasible, so let's leave it like it is.
If the test fails like this for anybody else, they might find this JIRA record and know that it is not a problem in ZooKeeper., Closing issues after releasing 3.4.6.]
