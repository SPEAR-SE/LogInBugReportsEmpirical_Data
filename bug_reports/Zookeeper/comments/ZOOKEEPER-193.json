[fixes the example code to build with zk3, this updated patch cleans up the tutorial as well., +1, it looks good. Just a few minor comments:

1- I'm not sure why logical and symbols show up with "amp": 
               
                 if (path != null &amp;&amp; path.equals(znode))

    The same happens here:
                 
                 List&lt;String&gt; list = zk.getChildren(root, true);

   It is probably some problem with the character representation, and I guess this is due to downloading/uploading the patch via http, but interestingly this is the first time I see such a problem with our patches.

2-  We can remove the following commented lines:
   
                +        //else mutex = new Integer(-1);

                +            //System.out.println("Process: " + event.getType());
