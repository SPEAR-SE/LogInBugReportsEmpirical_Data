    ZOOKEEPER-1538. Improve space handling in zkServer.sh and zkEnv.sh. (Andrew Ferguson via mahadev) (Revision 1381900)

, This fix is incorrect. It assumes the shell is bash since it uses bash array construction, e.g.:

 96   LIBPATH=("${ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX}"/share/zookeeper/*.jar)

This does NOT work if /bin/sh points to /bin/dash as it does on Ubuntu. 

It fails as so:

zkEnv.sh: 96: zkEnv.sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "fi")                                                                                                                                                                                              


If I change the shebang at the top to use "/bin/bash" instead of "/bin/sh" it works as expected. I don't know the full details of why using a bash array was chosen as the solution but I don't think it is the right way to deal with spaces in these paths...

I will open a separate jira and assign to Andrew Ferguson., See ZOOKEEPER-1719., My Bad, this regression was actually caused by ZOOKEEPER-1663 not ZOOKEEPER-1538. Will update the jira.]
