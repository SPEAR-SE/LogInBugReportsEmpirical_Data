[A naive patch for ZOOKEEPER-2162.
This shutdowns server when leader's epoch < accepted epoch.
, Any thoughts?
A patch is attached as a draft proposal.
, Hi [~suda], Can you submit a JUnit test patch., Hi [~arshad.mohammad], thank you for the response.
I'll try it this week.
, Hi [~arshad.mohammad], sorry for being very late.

Attached {{ZOOKEEPER-2162-v2-repro-only.patch}}.

You can reproduce the bug with {{ant test-core-java  -Dtestcase=DataDirRemovalTest -Dtest.output=yes}}.

I'll try to fix the bug in a much more appropriate manner than former {{ZOOKEEPER-2162.patch}}., Thanks for the patch [~suda]. I actually don't know how this could be solved in a better way than doing exit(1). It's not a recoverable situation and avoiding the infinite loop (possibly filling up disc) is desirable..., Hi [~rgs], thank you for looking on this.

I attached {{ZOOKEEPER-2162-v3.patch}}.
This version throws {{UnrecoverableException}} rather than calling {{System.exit()}} directly, for ease of JUnit testing.

Could you please review the patch?
