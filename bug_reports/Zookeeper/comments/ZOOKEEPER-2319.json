[[~rgs] / [~fpj] / [~rakesh_r] is this something we can close out due to the recent improvements in thread handling? e.g. ZOOKEEPER-1907

It's listed as a critical bug so we should consider addressing for 3.4.9 (?)., Presently Listener thread will log WARNING message and exit on {{ava.nio.channels.UnresolvedAddressException}}, which is not a subclass of IOException. I also feel we could improve by catching this exception and continue listening., I think this not critical, changing this to {{major}} priority. Please feel free to change if anyone has different opinion., GitHub user maoling opened a pull request:

    I think we may want to consider making this an "error".

    @maoling I think a test case would be great because catching that exception does "change behavior". 
, This issue should be fixed ZOOKEEPER-1506 already. Patching the exception handling only treats the symptom, but not the root cause. Closing this as duplicate., I didn’t get security update from Apple for iPhone 6+ updated to iOS 11 and am unable to download it because of a bug. I am trying alternate methods ]
