The solution looks good to me. I can see FileTxnLog.getLogFiles has the logic to retain highest transaction log which is less than the leastZxidToBeRetain. 
Few comments
1) can we rename exclude to retainedTxnLogs or some thing similar. 
{code}
final Set<File> exclude = new HashSet<File>();
{code}
2) FileTxnSnapLog.getSnapshotLogs(long) javadoc does not have complete information.
can you update it to indicate that it also returns "one snapshot log which is highest but less than the given zxid", Thanks [~arshad.mohammad] for the review.  I've applied your suggestions and uploaded the latest patch.

Also, I noticed that on Hadoop QA, a test is failing (org.apache.zookeeper.test.QuorumTest) but I cannot reproduce this failure locally and it also seems unrelated.

This message is automatically generated., Latest patch LGTM +1(non-binding), Good catch, [~abhishekrai]. Thanks for the proposed patch with good unit testing.

I agree the following scenario will occur in learner side, where snapshotting has happened multiple times without accompanying log rollover, [refer source code|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/branch-3.4/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Learner.java#L439]. I think there is mismatch in the zookeeper documentation, it says "This snapshot supercedes all previous logs", [please refer zk doc|https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.9/zookeeperAdmin.html#Ongoing+Data+Directory+Cleanup]. But in this particular case the latest transactions after snapshotting is gong to the existing transaction log file, which is behind if we look at the naming(zxid part). I'm not sure whether this is intentionally implemented?. Again, iiuc, recovery will use a snapshot file + delta taken from the transaction log file name after snapshotted zxid, but in this case admins need to consider the log file just before, the snapshot file. Should we need to make the snapshot file and log file consistent to avoid any corner cases in future?

[~phunt], any thoughts?

{code}
2. Following files exist:
log.100 spans transactions from zxid=100 till zxid=140 (inclusive)
snapshot.110 - snapshot as of zxid=110
snapshot.120 - snapshot as of zxid=120
snapshot.130 - snapshot as of zxid=130
{code}

, Thanks for the references [~rakeshr].  The learner writes the snapshot in response to the NEWLEADER message received from the leader.  Based on my understanding, this is because the leader could be ahead of the learner - meaning that the learner is missing some transactions that the leader has.  So receiving a snapshot and committing it locally is a valid option for the learner to catch up and join the quorum.  However, going forward it will receive subsequent transactions, which as you mentioned get appended to the existing txn log file.  It seems a log rollover could have been done before snapshotting in the learner, but perhaps changing behaviors at this point is not worth it given the need to support old behavior too?, +1 overall.

PurgeTxnTest.java:224 Can we change  ArrayList<File> logsToPurge back to  List<File> logsToPurge?

PurgeTxnLog.java:138 Do we need to use the FileFilter here since we do "filtering" on line 142?

PurgeTxnLog.java:148 We do logging and System.out.println for the same String, do we need both?, Thanks for the review [~abrahamfine].  I've applied your comments and uploaded a new patch set, please take another look.

> PurgeTxnTest.java:224 Can we change ArrayList<File> logsToPurge back to List<File> logsToPurge?
I switched logsToPurge from a List<File> to an ArrayList<File> so I can simply use remove(0) to remove the first element in the list on line 239.  However, as you pointed out, this is probably not obvious given that all other lists around it are List<File>, so I've added a comment explaining the choice.

> PurgeTxnLog.java:138 Do we need to use the FileFilter here since we do "filtering" on line 142?
Both filtering are required.  The FileFilter used in lines 134-138 are useful for listing all snapshot and log files with zxid >= leastZxidToBeRetain.  The check on 142 is to skip deletion of the newest log file that comes before the oldest retained snapshot.  However, I agree that the logic would be simpler if all filtering logic is in one place, in MyFileFilter.accept().  I've moved it there now.

> PurgeTxnLog.java:148 We do logging and System.out.println for the same String, do we need both?

My goal here was to capture the output in the log file generated by the ant test run.  System.out.println wasn't useful in this context.  However, I needed to retain System.out.println cause PurgeTxnLog can also be invoked interactively from a console.  Is there a way to achieve both goals, logging and console output (preferably stdout) without any duplication., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I think I must be missing something as all of the lists are ArrayLists.  For example, this still passes:
{code:java}
        List<File> snapsToPurge = new ArrayList<File>();
        List<File> snaps = new ArrayList<File>();
        List<File> logs = new ArrayList<File>();
        List<File> snapsAboveRecentFiles = new ArrayList<File>();
        List<File> logsAboveRecentFiles = new ArrayList<File>();
        List<File> logsToPurge = new ArrayList<File>();

Agreed

I'm not sure, perhaps system.err?

Sorry I was confused about something, fixed the usage of logsToPurge as you suggested, thanks for persisting.

>> Is there a way to achieve both goals, logging and console output (preferably stdout) without any duplication.
> I'm not sure, perhaps system.err?

I tried System.err.println, but then this output comes at the end of the test log under "stderr" section.  It may have limited utility in debugging since it's not inline with other related logging.

This message is automatically generated., Thank you [~abhishekrai]. I could see there are few more corrections required in the [zookeeperAdmin.html#The+Log+Directory|https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.9/zookeeperAdmin.html#The+Log+Directory], right?. I'd suggest you to read the {{ZooKeeper transaction log and snapshot}} related sections in the ZK docs and do necessary changes. Appreciate your time & efforts.

{code}
The Log Directory:

A new log file is started each time a snapshot is begun. The log file's suffix is the first zxid written to that log
{code}

Could you please create a pull request for the proposed patch, that will be used for code reviews and commits.

Hi [~fpj], [~phunt], [~rgs]. As part of this jira we have came across a situation {{"where snapshotting has happened multiple times without accompanying log rollover"}}, this is contradicting with the ZooKeeper docs. I think, this would be a serious concern in the view of disaster recovery scripts. If someone has written a script blindly following that "A new log file is started each time a snapshot is begun". It would be really helpful if you could pitch in and give your thoughts on this problem. Thanks!, This JIRA sounds like a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-2420. 
[~abhishekrai]: Could you please take a look at ZOOKEEPER-2420 and confirm if it's solving the same problem as this JIRA? If so, we probably should remove this issue from release blockers as the consensus so far in ZOOKEEPER-2420 is that the issue is better to be fixed but we will be fine live with it for a while, given no real issues being reported from prod (with reasons stated in ZOOKEEPER-2420) so far., Good catch [~hanm]. Yes, both are addressing same problem. Thanks a lot [~EdRowe] for the good number of unit test cases in your patch and working on this major issue. 

After looking at ZOOKEEPER-2420 patch, it looks to me that the proposed fix in ZOOKEEPER-2574 jira is simple and with less code complexity. Just a suggestion from me, we could club these two patches together to make a good solution. (1) Merge the test cases and (2) FileSnap#findNRecentSnapshots() changes from ZOOKEEPER-2420 patch to this jira proposal patch. Does this makes sense to you?

Also, I'd like to re-iterate some of the discussions regarding ZK docs made earlier in this jira [comment1|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2574?focusedCommentId=15483048&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15483048], [comment2|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2574?focusedCommentId=15643171&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15643171]., Hi [~rakeshr]:
bq. we could club these two patches together to make a good solution.
Sounds good! Also, a late LGTM on the patch attached to this JIRA after incorporating tests from ZOOKEEPER-2420.

bq. I think, this would be a serious concern in the view of disaster recovery scripts. If someone has written a script blindly following that "A new log file is started each time a snapshot is begun".
Would the doc fix proposed in this patch address this concern? With the new doc it is clearly stated that the prior one transaction log should be retained / required., I am also changing priority of this from Blocker to Major per discussions in ZOOKEEPER-2420., How about keeping only one jira open and close the other one. That way, we will try to converge the discussions into one place. I'm OK to close any one of these two jira issues:-)

Could you please look at [my previous comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2574?focusedCommentId=15662873&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15662873] and do necessary src & test code merge from ZK-2420. Appreciate creating a pull request for the same. Thanks!, Yes, I've identified few occurrences in the doc. One more [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2574?focusedCommentId=15643171&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15643171] is open and has to be fixed. Probably, we could do more detailed reviews and all such cases has to be re-phrased as there was a behavioral change due to the [Learner snapshotting logic|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/branch-3.4/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Learner.java#L439]., GitHub user abhishekrai opened a pull request:

    It's not ideal but they both serve a purpose that the other cannot as far as I can tell.
    
    System.out.println is useful when this is invoked directly through CLI.  The old behavior was to provide just this.
    LOG.info is useful in that it's visible in the server log.  The old behavior did not log this info which makes debugging through server logs harder.

    Thanks @hanm!
, Document changes are done in generated html, docs/zookeeperAdmin.html. When the document is generated again these changes will be overridden. 
Changes should have been done in src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/zookeeperAdmin.xml.
May be we can raise new jira an port the changes, Good catch [~arshad.mohammad] - created ZOOKEEPER-2690 to track the work. Obviously I missed this during review. Mark it as minor priority because the doc change was cosmetic., -1 overall.  GitHub Pull Request  Build
