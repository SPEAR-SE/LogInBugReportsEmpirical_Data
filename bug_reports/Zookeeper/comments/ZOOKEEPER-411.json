[it turns out that the test was failing becasue the zookeeper server wasnt being shut down in the c tests. Loooks like fuser does not work as published on rhel 5. I wasted quite some time on trying to figure out why fuser wasnt working but didnt find an answer. So, I decided to just change the script to get the pid and for killing the server kill it with the pid already stored in the file from previous start.

- this patch changes the script to use pid instead of fuser. 

I tested it to see iit works on rhel 5 64 bit, ipv6 machine., you should remove the pid files., this patch also deletes the pid files once the process is killed., +1 looks good, Can you fix this in all locations in the source?

src/c/tests/zkServer.sh
36:fuser -skn tcp 22181/tcp

src/contrib/rest/src/test/zkServer.sh
36:fuser -skn tcp 22182/tcp

src/contrib/zkpython/src/test/zkServer.sh
36:#fuser -skn tcp 22182/tcp

src/recipes/lock/src/c/tests/zkServer.sh
32:fuser -skn tcp 22181/tcp

also remove this (now unnecessary)

build.xml
671:        <property name="fuser.bin" value="/sbin"/>
675:		<env key="PATH" path="${env.PATH};${c.src.dir};${fuser.bin};"/>

, this patch removes the use of fuser from all the scripts also from the build file...

pat can you review this? see if ant test passes on your machine., this patch removes usage of fuser in build.xml., +1, thanks Mahadev
