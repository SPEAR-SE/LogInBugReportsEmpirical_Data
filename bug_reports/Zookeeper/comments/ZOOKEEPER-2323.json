[As per my analysis following is the sequence of events which cause the problem
#  After two minutes from network disconnect, Client automatically switched to DIGEST-MD5 authentication mechanism
Code reference in {{org.apache.zookeeper.client.ZooKeeperSaslClient.createSaslClient(String, String)}}
{code}
if (subject.getPrincipals().isEmpty()) {
    // no principals: must not be GSSAPI: use DIGEST-MD5 mechanism instead.
    LOG.info("Client will use DIGEST-MD5 as SASL mechanism.");
    String[] mechs = {"DIGEST-MD5"};
    String username = (String)(subject.getPublicCredentials().toArray()[0]);
    String password = (String)(subject.getPrivateCredentials().toArray()[0]);
    // "zk-sasl-md5" is a hard-wired 'domain' parameter shared with zookeeper server code (see ServerCnxnFactory.java)
    saslClient = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechs, username, "zookeeper", "zk-sasl-md5", null, new ClientCallbackHandler(password));
    return saslClient;
}
{code}
{{subject.getPrincipals().isEmpty()}} is true because Kerberos ticket is already expired
#  Code {{(String)(subject.getPublicCredentials().toArray()\[0\]);}} throws {{java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException}} and finally null is returned instead of {{SaslClient}} object
# Because SaslClient is null Client enters into {{States.AUTH_FAILED}} state
Code reference in {{org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn.SendThread.run()}}
{code}
try {
      zooKeeperSaslClient.initialize(ClientCnxn.this);
  } catch (SaslException e) {
     LOG.error("SASL authentication with Zooeeper Quorum member failed: " + e);
      state = States.AUTH_FAILED;
      sendAuthEvent = true;
  }
{code}
{{zooKeeperSaslClient.initialize}} throws SaslException as SaslClient is null, # This issue gets fixed if re-throw LoginException instead of eating the exceptions while creating the {{javax.security.sasl.SaslClient}}. 
# We should do array size check before using the its elements

Point 1 alone will solve the problem. But is good to have point 2 as well., {noformat}

This message is automatically generated., Hi, [~arshad.mohammad]
     I just test with your patch , found that it can not fixed auth failed issue in below scenarios:
set TGT expire in 2 mins, session expire in 3 mins
1. Start zk client to connect kerberos zk cluster, and some operations can be done successfully
2. Disconnect the Client's network
3. TGT expired 
4. session expried
If, Between 3 and 4 step, we recovery network. 
But we will got exception :
{code}
java.security.PrivilegedActionException: javax.security.sasl.SaslException: GSS initiate failed [Caused by GSSException: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)]

Above exception result in client got authfailed state:

Zookeeper Client will go to AUTH_FAILED state.

Zookeeper Client will go to AUTH_FAILED state.
{code}
Finally, even TGT are renewed in the next cycle loop. This Client would alway got authfailed for every operation forever.



, Canceling patch until issues raised is resolved.,     From the code flow, I can see the ZooKeeperSaslClient throw exception in above scenarios is caused by below reason:
During network disconnection, relogin happened which clear the content of subject object , and after network recovery,  when client try to setup connection, it will check the TGT firstly, TGT will not be avaliable until next relogin operator happened.
So , I thinks when try to setup connection when network recovery , in this flow we can do relogin firstly if relogin happened during network disconnected. 
[~arshad.mohammad], Any thought?

, With below modify, the auth issue can be solved, pls refer to :

1) Modify Login.java： add one public relogin method for setupconnection
{noformat}
     /**
     * Re-login method, just for the client setup connection when network recovery.
     * Note: This method is just for Internal used. Be carefully when call it.
     * @throws LoginException
     */
    public void reLoginForSetupConnection()
            throws LoginException {
        if (!isKrbTicket) {
            return;
        }
        LoginContext login = getLogin();
        if (login  == null) {
            throw new LoginException("login must be done first");
        }
        LOG.info("Initiating logout for " + principal);
        synchronized (Login.class) {
            //clear up the kerberos state. But the tokens are not cleared! As per
            //the Java kerberos login module code, only the kerberos credentials
            //are cleared
            login.logout();
            //login and also update the subject field of this instance to
            //have the new credentials (pass it to the LoginContext constructor)
            login = new LoginContext(loginContextName, getSubject());
            LOG.info("Initiating re-login for " + principal);
            login.login();
            setLogin(login);
        }
    }
{noformat}

2) Modify ZooKeeperSaslClient.java : add relogin logic before do auth check.
{noformat}
    synchronized private SaslClient createSaslClient(final String servicePrincipal,
                                                     final String loginContext) throws LoginException {
        try {
            if (login == null) {
                if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
                    LOG.debug("JAAS loginContext is: " + loginContext);
                }
                // note that the login object is static: it's shared amongst all zookeeper-related connections.
                // createSaslClient() must be declared synchronized so that login is initialized only once.
                login = new Login(loginContext, new ClientCallbackHandler(null));
                login.startThreadIfNeeded();
            }
   +        if (login.getSubject().getPrincipals().isEmpty()) {
   +         LOG.info("Begin to reLogin once for this Connection Setup.");
   +         login.reLoginForSetupConnection();
   +        }
            Subject subject = login.getSubject();
            SaslClient saslClient;
            ....
{noformat}

If any idea , pls let me know, thanks., [~fpj], [~Jobo], [~arshad.mohammad]: punting for 3.4.9. , This defect got fixed with ZOOKEEPER-2139 fix.
After ZOOKEEPER-2139 fix Login object is created while connecting to each zookeeper server in the quorum, this way Zookeeper client gets chance to refresh the kerberos ticket while connecting to any of the zookeeper server. 
Verified in the 3.5.2-alpha release the issue is fixed.]
