[+1 - I had a hard time reviewing ZOOKEEPER-82 w/no tests to verify jmx, Added tests to verify jmx. A jmx server is started with a loopback connection to access
the beans. this verifies in much the same way as running client agains the agent. In the 
process I also noticed an issue with the way countdownwatcher was handled in the
reuse case (need to reset).

I'm testing a number of cases, in particular that the server bean is setup for standalone
and quorum, also client connections and data store bean registration.
