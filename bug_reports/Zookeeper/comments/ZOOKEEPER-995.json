[This patch contains a failing test for zkpython.  

It creates a new node using a connection chrooted to "/zookeeper". As you can see bellow the returned path also contains the chroot prefix. 

{code}
     [exec] FAIL: test_sync_create_with_chroot (__main__.CreationTest)
     [exec] ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     [exec] Traceback (most recent call last):
     [exec]   File "src/test/create_test.py", line 64, in test_sync_create_with_chroot
     [exec]     self.assertEqual(ret, "/test")
     [exec] AssertionError: '/zookeeper/test' != '/test'

{code}, This is indeed the same issue as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1027, which has a patch available., This is a dup of ZOOKEEPER-1027.]
