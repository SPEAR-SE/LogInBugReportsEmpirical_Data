[[~ongardie] hey, this is not a call in the {{ZooKeeper}} class, right? At least for the Java client, this is a call in the {{Op}} which is used with {{Multi}}. What client is it that you're using? Is it an issue with the C client that allows a check call outside multi?

It is not a bad idea to perform a check in the server, though., [~fpj] ah sorry, I should have mentioned that I did this from a Go client library that I'm writing., i agree that we should handle this gracefully :) we should fix this.]
