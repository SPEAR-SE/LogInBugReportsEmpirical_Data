[[~JanZerebecki] look at org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.DigestAuthenticationProvider.generateDigest(String).
In Digest Auth Mode, it uses *username:base64(SHA-1（username:password）)*,not MD5? Am I missing something?, [~maoling], how does what you said relate to the topic of this bug?, Perhaps: DIGEST-MD5 and MD5 are different things., too embarrassed am I.It seems that I don't get your idea.]
