[does it require the multi-threaded version of the lib? I'm not sure if it helps, but you could try the single-threaded lib. Sounds fun though!, Yes, it should be a fun project. Managed to compile memos on a standard Linux server successfully, but not yet on the RPi.
The RPi 2 has 4 cores so yes I would need the multi-threaded version of the library.
It has been a few decades since I last wrote 'C' code and I am not at all familiar with all the sophisticated build tool being used. Make I understood ;-), OK. I have just succeeded in moving forwards. I read the README document in the src/c directory and followed the instructions.
I got an error when running autoreconf and found that I needed to run 'sudo apt-get install libcppunit-dev' to get this step to work. Then for configure I needed to set the --without-syncapi option. After this make worked. I have also managed to get mesos to compile :-), I'm glad to hear [~stevef1uk].]
