[To elablorate on the problem:
Currently this is what happens:
- servers read the last logged zxid from the last log or snapshot and use that in the leader election
- it is quite possible that something in the logs (some transaction lower than the one reported in leader election) is corrupt and the server does not have sane data till the last reported zxid in leader election
- this could lead to leader election spinning in a loop if the one elected a leader cannot actually read the data till the reported transaction id.

The solution is to let the servers upload all the data before they start the leader election and then send the last logged zxid. This way the server can be sure that it has valid data til the last zxid it actually reports in the leader election.

, a preliminary patch. Does not include tests. Will still be adding tests and cleaning it up. 

this patch adds:

- a new class ZKDatabase that becomes a top level member of quorumpeer and passed around to all the zookeeper server's created for the life of a quorumPeer
- the zkdatabase includes all the api's needed to modify/use/load the zk database
making ZKDatabase as the top level member of quorumpeer allows it to be shared across different instances of zookeeper servers (leader/learner/observer) of an instance of quorumpeer.

I will be adding javadocs and cleaning up the patch shortly., after 3 failed attempts, hopefully jira would upload this file.

a cleaned up patch with comments/javadoc. I am still adding tests. Trying to fix some tests that are failing.
, FLELostMessage test won't work without ZOOKEEPER-629., this patch adds a test case for using memory based zkdatabase most of the time. The test checks to see that a server who has corrupted database cannot join the cluster. I am still thinking if we should just start with a empty database in such a case or just shutdown and let the admin figure it out. This way if the disk is corrupt, an admin can take care of it. For now, I have left the quorumpeer to exit if it finds its database is corrupt on and upto the admin to sanitize the database (by just deleting the database and starting all new on that node).

this patch includes :
- ZOOKEEPER-629

This message is automatically generated., looks really good. just a couple of comments:

1) i think zkDb should be private
2) you have get/setZkb() in QuorumPeer. you should make it consistent with ZooKeeper and use get/setZKDatabase, patch that addresses ben's comments. Also removed some unnecessary logging from the tests., +1 (assuming it passes test), +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
