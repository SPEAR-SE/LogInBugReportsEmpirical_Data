[Yes, the svn revision # is on the todo list for items left over from ZOOKEEPER-45, in particular I had to
comment out a line in the build.xml version-info target as follows:

            <!--PDH fixme - <arg value="${lastRevision}" />-->
            <arg value="1" />

I couldn't quite make heads/tails of why getting the svn version was different btw SF and ASF.

Andrew would you mind looking into this?
, The patch fixes the first problem by correcting the path on the directory whose revision number is retreived. The second problem was also caused by invalid paths used to produce the tar files., +1 looks good, dist builds and revision now included., Committed revision 672058, 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
