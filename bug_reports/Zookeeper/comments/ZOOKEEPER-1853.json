[I am sure you will thank me for this., Which version are you using? 3.4.* or out of trunk? There are differences in the cli implementation., Hi Flavio,
Using 3.4.5 atm.
Will Check versus trunk after august 10th !
Thank you for the investigation!

, Same issue when using set commands by the way., Allows spaces to be used for parameters in zkCli as long as they are in single or double quotes.  ie: create /node1 "This will now work"

I had this reviewed internally, but not from any official zookeeper person., Switch out the split on space for a regexp that will handle spaces within quotes.  Also added a bunch of unit tests to show it working., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

ZOOKEEPER-1853: zkCli.sh can't issue a CREATE command containing
spaces in the data (Ryan Lamore via rgs) (rgs: [http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1713303])

, Hi [~rgs], 

While testing 3.4.7 release I have seen that some space separated data works as below:

{code}
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 5] create /concepts "Hello world"
Created /concepts
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 6] get /concepts
Hello world
cZxid = 0x3
ctime = Mon Nov 16 09:17:37 BRST 2015
mZxid = 0x3
mtime = Mon Nov 16 09:17:37 BRST 2015
pZxid = 0x3
cversion = 0
dataVersion = 0
aclVersion = 0
ephemeralOwner = 0x0
dataLength = 11
numChildren = 0
{code}

OTOH, the json example on the description of this issue returns incomplete data on GET, as below:

{code}
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 7] create /contacts '{"country":"CA","name":"De La Salle"}'
Node already exists: /contacts
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 8] get /contacts
{"country":"CA","name":"De
cZxid = 0x2
ctime = Mon Nov 16 09:16:34 BRST 2015
mZxid = 0x2
mtime = Mon Nov 16 09:16:34 BRST 2015
pZxid = 0x2
cversion = 0
dataVersion = 0
aclVersion = 0
ephemeralOwner = 0x0
dataLength = 26
numChildren = 0
{code}

Is this the expected behaviour of GET? Should we open a new JIRA to address it? 

Best regards,
