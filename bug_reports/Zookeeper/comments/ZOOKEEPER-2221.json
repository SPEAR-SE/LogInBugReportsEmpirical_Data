This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the patch [~surendrasingh]! A few comments:

* the indentation seems off because of tabs, could you please use spaces for indentation to make it consistent with the rest of the file?
* could you document the new property (zookeeper.admin.address) in zookeeperAdmin.html?

Thanks!, Thanks [~surendrasingh] for the contribution. Few minor comments:

# Can we rename the property {{zookeeper.admin.address}} to {{zookeeper.admin.serverAddress}} to sync with other configurations in JettyAdminServer.java. I could see already we have a configuration for the port its name is {{zookeeper.admin.serverPort}}
# Also, please move the new configuration reading logic to default {{JettyAdminServer()}} constructor, Thanks [~rgs] and [~rakeshr] for looking in to this issue.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks, Surendra.  This looks good!

I think we'll need to update src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/zookeeperAdmin.xml so that the documentation is preserved during a rebuild.  I don't know if patches are supposed to update both the .xml and the .html.  Maybe one of the committers could clarify that.

+1 (non-binding) after that is addressed.  Thanks again!, Good catch [~cnauroth]. Yes, I agree with you, we need to update only {{src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/zookeeperAdmin.xml}} file so that it will get reflected in the guide after rebuild. It is not required to update the {{.html}} and {{.pdf}} files. I'm not really sure the reason of maintaining these files in the source repository.
, Thanks [~rakeshr] and [~cnauroth] for comments.

Attached new patch, Please review..., Surendra, would you please add a '.' after "Defaults to 0.0.0.0"?  Sorry to nit-pick on something so small, but this would make it consistent with the style for the other documented properties.

Otherwise, +1 (non-binding).  I applied the patch and ran {{ant docs}} and confirmed that it looked good in the new build of the site.

Thank you!, Thanks [~cnauroth] for reviewing.
