This message is automatically generated., yeah, that usually works (i think). , the failure looks pretty unrelated:

{code}
org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientPortBindTest.testBindByAddress

java.net.SocketException: No such device
	at java.net.NetworkInterface.isLoopback0(Native Method)
	at java.net.NetworkInterface.isLoopback(NetworkInterface.java:382)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientPortBindTest.testBindByAddress(ClientPortBindTest.java:61)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.JUnit4ZKTestRunner$LoggedInvokeMethod.evaluate(JUnit4ZKTestRunner.java:55)

{code}, Hudson reran the tests without me resubmitting the patch. It's failing a core test and a findbugs run, neither of which are related to this code. Should I just ignore? Also, I'm not sure if I have time to write tests, and my java fu is pretty rusty. Is that necessary before being accepted?, Yeah, we can just ignore it. I think this is find since it's cmdline parsing. So +1, I'll merge in a bit. Thanks ! , Great, looking forward to it!, [~wesc]: actually, the patch is wrong so -1. You are just missing -n which is mandatory, that's why it checks for 3 (datadir -n count) or 4 args (datadir snapdir -n count). , That being said, that parsing code should be cleaned up. , Oh no, you're right. I think we copied an incorrect example for our systems that omitted the -n, and I just didn't think about it when reading the code. I'll readjust., Thank you [~wesc] for the contribution. It would be great if you can add unit tests in {{org.apache.zookeeper.server.PurgeTxnTest}} class. Probably you can directly call  {{PurgeTxnLog#main(String [] args)}} in the tests by giving the {{args}} array. This will help to cover the parsing logic.

+Note:+ Please don't delete the old patch which you already attached in the jira because previous attachments would help as a reference for the reviewers. You can attach a new patch to the jira, our jenkins will automatically picks up the latest one and run the test., [~chowwesley], [~rakeshr]: are you still interesting in cleaning up that parsing code or should we close this is as invalid (given it isn't a bug per se)? Thanks!, I'm really sorry I haven't had time to get to this. I would just go ahead and close it as invalid and perhaps I'll be inspired to come back to this later., Submitting new patch with all review comment fixed., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~arshad.mohammad] for taking this ahead. Patch looks overall fine, just few comments:

# Please add one more validation to check the {{-n}} argument name. If user pass an argument other than "-n", then should fail. Since its not using command line parser, we could add a simple check like  "-n".equals(argOption)
# instead of {{minimum value is 3}}, can you rephrase it to {{greater than 3}}.
{code}
System.out.println("\tcount -- the number of old snaps/logs you want to keep, value should be greater than 3");
{code}, Thanks a lot  [~rakeshr] for your review comments
# handled
#  Here "greater than 3" means at least 4, but as per the existing functionality even 3 snap/logs can be retained.  So I think message "greater than 3" will be misleading. IMHO,  "greater than or equal to 3" will be more appropriate message. Changed the message to {code}System.out.println("\tcount -- the number of old snaps/logs you want to keep, value should be greater than or equal to 3");{code}

A few nits:

In:

{code}
+        String countOption = "";
+        if (args.length == 3) {
+            countOption = args[1];
+            num = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
+        } else {
+            snapDir = new File(args[1]);
+            countOption = args[2];
+            num = Integer.parseInt(args[3]);
+        }
{code}

you should catch NumberFormatException for each parseInt called (and show usage and exit).

Also, testPurgeTxnLogWithDataDir() and testPurgeTxnLogWithoutDataDir are almost the same except for String [] args and the assert calls. I think you can extract that into a helper method and call that from both tests (with the needed params).

Thanks!, Thanks [~rgs] for your comments.
# Handled  NumberFormatException
# Added file exist validation for snap and log directory
# Apart from args following things also are different
## comments
## snapshot creation directory
## assertion
I think if extracted to a method it will increase the code complexity, code will be less understandable. at least four places need to add if else. So not changing
is it ok?
