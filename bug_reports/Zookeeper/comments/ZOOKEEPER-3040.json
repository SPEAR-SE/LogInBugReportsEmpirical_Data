[Looks like the test code is assuming the follower is up to date, which without a sync call might not be the case. Hence flakey. Please also verify that the zk.close is synchronous.

{noformat}
        // close the session and newly created ephemeral node should be deleted
        zk.close();

        nodeAtFollower = followerZK.exists(nodePath, false);

        // Problem 2: Before fix, after session close the ephemeral node
        // was not getting deleted. But now after the fix after session close
        // ephemeral node is getting deleted.
        assertNull("After session close ephemeral node must be deleted",
                nodeAtFollower);

, When someone fixes this could you look through the rest of the tests for similar problem wrt assumption?, Looks like this came into the codebase via ZOOKEEPER-2355, I ran the test 2.000 times, all success, so unfortunately I could not reproduce the problem.

I checked the close() method, it is synchronized. 

I will add a sync call and run the test again a 1.000 times to verify it will pass., {quote}I ran the test 2.000 times, all success, so unfortunately I could not reproduce the problem.

A couple of flaky tests we saw and fixed can only be reproduced if we ran the entire test suite. Maybe this test is one of them if running in isolation yield a deterministic success yet jenkins still complains.., Thanks Michael, I will do some runs with the entire suite., I don't see this as part of any test suite. , I think what the entire test suites I meant was actually "test-core-java" :-), Yes, I was afraid you were gonna say that :)
Well, I won't run the whole test locally hundreds of time, I'll see if I can get some distributed testing working to verify the change., Last 7 build was successful. Closing, will reopen if test fails again.]
