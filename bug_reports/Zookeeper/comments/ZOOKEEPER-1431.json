[Here's two test cases reproducing the error.

Both use pykeeper (ease_install pykeeper) to set things up, but then use the zkpython bindings to do the actual testing.

zktest3.py leaks, zktest4.py does not.
, https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/contrib/zkpython/src/c/zookeeper.c#L487

Shouldn't arglist be decref'ed after the call?

That drops my tuple count from ~55k to ~5k after a zktest3.py run.

This message is automatically generated., Is this patch going to be applied soon? Are you waiting for justification on why it doesn't include new tests?, I would also like to know. Tests were not included because it's not easy to test for a memory leak., Patch looks good, I'll commit shortly., Just committed to 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Thanks Kapil and Andre!, Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1590 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1590/])
