[This is not a problem.
bq. \[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 14\] setAcl /newNode digest:user:pass:crdwa
This step is wrong. To authorize user:pass id you should set the acl as {{setAcl /newNode digest:user:smGaoVKd/cQkjm7b88GyorAUz20=:crdwa}}. So there is no plain password here., @Arshad Mohammad : Don't you think if the passed arguments are wrong so system should not accept., This should be problem only..hope we can discuss before making conclusion., [~rakeshsingh], That was my opinion and I can be very much wrong. Why you take those comments as conclusion. Those comments are the discussion only. It would have been conclusion if the issue was closed as not an issue. 
Lets listen some more opinion to really conclude it :-), You mean, API should check whether user passed plain password or encrypted password and if it is plain password then it should not accepted?
I don't think we should be doing this kind of validation here.]
