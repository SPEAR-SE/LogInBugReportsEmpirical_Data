    ZOOKEEPER-2581:Not handled NullPointerException while creating key manager and trustManager

    - when **zookeeper.ssl.keyStore.password**    is null,**keyStorePasswordProp** is **null** ,then **keyStorePassword.toCharArray()** is called,it will throw a NPE. we should handle this NPE gracefully
    - I just follow an example from [createSSLContext](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/common/X509Util.java#L87)
