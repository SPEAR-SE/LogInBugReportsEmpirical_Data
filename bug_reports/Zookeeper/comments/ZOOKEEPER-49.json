[Shane was correct. The fixupACL needs to be done after the setAclRequest is deserialized. It's a trivial change. I've included the fix and a test case for it in ZOOKEEPER-48., Ben this seems tied to ZOOKEEPER_48 - if so can you make it dependent on that jira., The patch for the dependent issue fixed this issue as well., 3.0.0 has been released, closing issues.]
