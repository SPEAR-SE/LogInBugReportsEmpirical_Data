I think there's a minor detail to sort out before merging it: it looks like the buffer is being freed before it's actually used to build the return value., This is what happens when you write a patch quickly :) Good catch, thanks!, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1 the patch looks good.
btw, henry
  I just noticed that the c code in zookeeper.c has inconsistent formatting. Usually we use 4 space indentation with no tabs (which I like as well :))... do we want to fix that sometime (in a different patch obviously) or you want ot keep it as it is?

, I vote for fixing it at some point.  It'd be nice to fix the style as well (parenthesis, etc), in addition to the spacing., Yes, it needs a good spring clean - both to address the memory allocation issues that Gustavo has highlighted, and the style / spacing. I'll open the JIRA., great ... ill go ahead and commit this patch for now. The new jira will take care of cleaning it up.

, I just committed this. thanks henry., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #632 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/632/])
