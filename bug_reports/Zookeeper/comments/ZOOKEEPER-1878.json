Thanks Rakesh!, Re-opening the issue to address the following in tests :

At the beginning of ZooKeeperServerMainTest#testWithoutAutoCreateDataLogDir, its setting system variable to false and not resetting the same at the end of the testcase exec. This would affect other test cases and hits “Missing data directory” Exception, if they are executing after this testcase., Hi [~michim], As per our discussion(offline) I had re-opened the issue. Kindly see the attached patch, where I'm resetting the flag to default value, so that others will not get affected. Thanks., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
