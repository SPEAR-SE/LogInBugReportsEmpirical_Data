 Can you please re upload the patch and grant license to Apache for inclusion? 

Thanks, I am taking this out of 3.4.1. If the patch becomes available before I cut a 3.4.1 Ill incorporate it., Peng,
 Could you please re upload the patch with a license grant?, Moving it out, not a critical bugfix., It has been a long time, is this still an issue? , Since I got no feedback, I'm moving this one to 3.5.0.]
