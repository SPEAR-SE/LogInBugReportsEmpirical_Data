[Patrick,

I dont see Quorum test failure in the console o/p of the build that you have mentioned.. 
Is 612 the build that you are talkin about?, you know, I must have looked at the wrong "consoletext" file (they are all named the same by default).

Regardless - in this case there is no report of why the build failed. Looking at the console again, I see that it
failed due to some problem during cppunit. We've seen similar though for other things like svn checkout failure,
and random build issues like running clover w/o the right libs, etc...

It wold be great at least if the hudson page could indicate that this failed due to cppunit failure., we need to configure our builds to generate cppunit test report so that hudson can parse and upload , https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-625  - created a new jira for changing build script to parse cppunit test reports.]
