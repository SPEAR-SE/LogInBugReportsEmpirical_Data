[Attaching relevant logs from two servers that are alive. As you can see, we keep cycling the leader election + timeout loop forever. zk2 is always the leader, and from that servers perspective each cycle of leader election takes 15 secs, while zk0 reports it around 30 sec. 

Again, (I think) the issue is that the vote that the candidate does not send the votes in parallel, but serially. So zk2 as a candidate cannot cast a self vote until the request to zk1 timesouts which takes more than 5 seconds. By that time, the follower zk0 already gives up on the leader, and starts a new round. So there is actually a leader elected every ~30 seconds, but the quorum cannot operate still. 

zk0:
