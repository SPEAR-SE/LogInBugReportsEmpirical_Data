[I've taken a look at other usages of LOG_DEBUG macro and it looks slightly different in the C client library.

{code}
src/c/src/zookeeper.c:    LOG_DEBUG(LOGCALLBACK(zh), "Sending request xid=%#x for path [%s] to %s",h.xid,path,
{code}

wheres in the recipe code:

{code}
src/recipes/queue/src/c/src/zoo_queue.c:        LOG_DEBUG(("Error! Called await twice."));
{code}

I suspect that the macro has been changed recently and the recipe hasn't been updated. 
I'll take a closer look how to fix it later today., Caused by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1400, This problem exist in 'lock' recipe too.

I'm going to create patch for both of them., GitHub user anmolnar opened a pull request:

    Ic - "ant .." is only exercising the java code. NM. Still committing this, although it would be good to followup separately on Abe's comment.
