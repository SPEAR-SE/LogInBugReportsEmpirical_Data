[In this patch, I'm trying merge my changes in with Patricks simplified docbook, and also check in the new structure (that is, the empty sections) for the new topics that this JIRA talks about., this patch has blank place holder sections for each of the missing pieces of content that this jira discusses. 

I also tried to merge in Patrick's docbook->sdoc changes.]
