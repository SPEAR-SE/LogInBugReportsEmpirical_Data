This message is automatically generated., Thanks Kfir. One last thing if you don't mind - when appending the client port to the server string, could you have ";" instead of ":" ? This would match the format of the server spec in the configuration files in 3.5.0. 
So I mean host:port1:port2;clientPort      
client string is ok as you have it - host:port

, do you have a JIRA username ? you could assign this JIRA to yourself, The change looks good to me, I committed it to trunk and 3.5 branch.

Thanks a lot, Kfir!
, Alex, please use the new patch.
The previous one is missing some needed brackets around the host string.
