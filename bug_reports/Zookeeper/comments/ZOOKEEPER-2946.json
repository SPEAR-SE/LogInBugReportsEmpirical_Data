[When the follower receives TRUNC from the leader, it is possible that there is no transaction log at the given zxid (it is possible the given zxid is captured by snapshot but not by the transaction log). It still needs to delete the transactions that are not committed and newer than the zxid sent by the leader. The patch tries to check if it is currently considering the file that is newer than the zxid and try to delete it before the while loop in the function truncate(long zxid) in the FileTxnLog.java.]
