[Could be this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-569?, I agree with Henry, that's what it looks like; at least I couldn't find any evidence on the logs of anything unusual., Henry/Flavio think this is related to ZOOKEEPER-569, let's get that one in and then see if it crops up again.
, Pushing to 3.4.0 per Flavio's comment., Maybe this issue can be closed? It looked like a duplicate of a bug that has been solved. I also couldn't find the logs of jenkins build 675 anymore., I haven't seen this in a while. I recently committed ZOOKEEPER-1160 which might also be related. Closing for now., Oh Sorry!, due to my IE problem, mistakenly the issue got assigned to me.
So reassigning back to previous state.]
