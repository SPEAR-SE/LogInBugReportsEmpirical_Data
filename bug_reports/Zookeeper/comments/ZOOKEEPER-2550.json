, Thanks Patrick.
I have checked ZOOKEEPER-1264. But the reason that the _FollowerResyncConcurrencyTest_ failed in this issue is not the same as ZOOKEEPER-1264. It appears both in 3.3.3 and 3.4+ .
As I mentioned in the issue's description, the reason happened is _FollowerResyncConcurrencyTest.java_ at line 92.

{code:title=FollowerResyncConcurrencyTest.java|borderStyle=solid}
        QuorumUtil qu = new QuorumUtil(1);
        qu.startAll();
        CountdownWatcher watcher1 = new CountdownWatcher();
        CountdownWatcher watcher2 = new CountdownWatcher();
        CountdownWatcher watcher3 = new CountdownWatcher();

        int index = 1;
        while(qu.getPeer(index).peer.leader == null)
            index++;

        Leader leader = qu.getPeer(index).peer.leader;

        assertNotNull(leader);
        /*
         * Reusing the index variable to select a follower to connect to
         */
        index = (index == 1) ? 2 : 1;
        qu.shutdown(index);
        final ZooKeeper zk3 = new DisconnectableZooKeeper("127.0.0.1:" + qu.getPeer(3).peer.getClientPort(), 1000,watcher3);
        watcher3.waitForConnected(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT);  // Failed here
        zk3.create("/mybar", null, ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode.EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL);
{code}

Hope I can describe the trace clearly:
(1) initialize 3 quorum peers and start all (peer 3 is the leader in my case)
(2) shutdown peer 1
(3) new a DisconnectableZooKeeper connect to peer 3' clientport with watcher3
(4) watcher3 wait for connected, but failed after CONNECTION_TIMEOUT

I'm confusing about the connect failed. After checked the log messages, I got the following logs that probably related:
