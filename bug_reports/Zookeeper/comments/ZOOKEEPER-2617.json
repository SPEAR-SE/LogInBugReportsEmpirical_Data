    Hi @fpj, could we have this PR merged? :) 
    
    Thanks!
    
    PS: It is target at branch-3.4, but would be cool if we could also apply it to branch-3.5 and master.

    Hi @rakeshadr, this is another possible candidate for 3.4.10 release, in my humble opinion. Fl√°vio gave his blessing and the branch doesn't conflict with branch-3.4. 
    
    PS: I didn't cherry-pick this into branch-3.5 and master so I don't know if it has any conflicts with those branches, but it would be nice to have it ported to them too. 
    
    Cheers!

    @eribeiro sure, I will consider this to 3.4.10. Thanks @tmancill for the contribution. Sorry for the delay in looking at this jira, could you please create separate PR for {{master}} branch as the current PR_87 is not applying to {{branch-3.5}} and {{master}}.

    I'm merging this to branch-3.4.
    Could you provide another PR for master/branch3.5 as this has minor conflicts and not applying properly. Thanks!

    As far as I can infer, the current Jenkins errors (below) is because `ant` was compiled on JDK8 and run on JDK7.
