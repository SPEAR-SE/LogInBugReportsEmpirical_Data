[Patch that clears active watcher sets when broadcasting a session event to all watchers., I don't believe the C-client makes the guarantee that "watcher callbacks are called exactly once."  Callbacks are called for different reasons, including:

- connection lost event
- connection reestablished event
- session lost event
- data changed event

Only the last two events make the guarantee about being called exactly once, but the first two connection events can be called numerous times until either one of the last two events happens.  I may be missing some events, but that's the general idea.  Bottom line is the callback can receive events of type ZOO_SESSION_EVENT multiple times.  I believe this was by design., That sounds like a good design. Perhaps it could be clarified in the documentation?

If this is correct behavior then the Python client needs to be fixed to not delete the watcher on session events. Will file a separate bug on that., Should this issue be closed then? (also sounds like 2 other issues should be opened which were detailed in the comments - docs and python), Closing, C client works as intended. Submitted a patch in ZOOKEEPER-888 to handle this properly in zkpython.]
