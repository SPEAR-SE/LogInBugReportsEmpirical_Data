[Also see: ZOOKEEPER-2503 for some background., Since the ServerID isn't present in the FOLLOWERINFO/OBSERVERINFO message until protocol version 0x10000, that minimum protocol version is now enforced by LearnerHandler.

I refactored a couple of functions out LearnerHandler.run(), added a protected constructor to LearnerHandler so I could talk to it without using an actual socket, and modified the mocks in LearnerHandlerTest a bit, all so that I could test the majority of the changes very directly.
