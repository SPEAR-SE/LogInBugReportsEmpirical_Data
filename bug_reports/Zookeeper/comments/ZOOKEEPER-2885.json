[file zookeeper-3.5.3-beta.tar.gz             ------------------> to know the real type of this file
tar -xvf zookeeper-3.5.3-beta.tar.gz     , From what I can tell, the file is *not* corrupted, but simply a non-gzipped tarball (despite the {{.tar.gz}} suffix). A workaround is to use {{tar -xvf}} instead of {{tar -xzvf}}. Ultimately, the file should be re-uploaded with compression turned on :-)

This affects [Kazoo Continuous Integration|https://github.com/python-zk/kazoo/issues/477], Thanks for reporting the issue. Hopefully this is not a blocker to anyone but we'll be more careful and rigorous when verifying the release artifacts for next releases. ]
