[This is not a problem.
Suppose you are at machine-1 and you set ACL crdwa for machine-2 then of course you have to log-in  from machine-2 to change the ACL
I think you are not machine-2 and trying to change the ACL. isn't it?, [~arshad.mohammad] i think you are not trying to understand the problem before making your conclusion or comment. And any comment should not be just shake of comment. Here the problem is with error message and that to the user we can't give the error code as error message., [~rakeshsingh], I thought you are taking about scenario based some critical issue, but yes, I was wrong you were talking message correction related trivial issue only. All the best for your message correction endeavor., [~arshad.mohammad] thanks..but i think you need to improve your english to understand the problem which will help to understand the problem at 1st level itself. Read this issue again.]
