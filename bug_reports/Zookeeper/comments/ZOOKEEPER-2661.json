[I'm not sure this is really a problem. Maybe something related to jvm startup? I can see 5 seconds between these two lines:

{noformat}
19:01:01.282 0 INFO org.example.zk.curator.ZookeeperTest - connecting
19:01:06.312 5030 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper - Client environment:zookeeper.version=3.4.6-1569965, built on 02/20/2014 09:09 GMT
{noformat}

I'm not sure this is a problem, though. In the steady state, it seems to be pretty ok., Yes, this problem is not serious. I'm just curious, during the 5 seconds, what the JVM did? Is it possible to speed up?

In addition, zkCli.sh and hbase shell which use zookeeper, also open slowã€‚, It seems that the call InetAddress.getLocalHost() at line 62 is slow.

code from class org.apache.zookeeper.Environment at line 56~65:
public static List<Entry> list() {
        ArrayList<Entry> l = new ArrayList<Entry>();
        put(l, "zookeeper.version", Version.getFullVersion());

        try {
            put(l, "host.name",//line 61
                InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName());//line 62
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            put(l, "host.name", "<NA>");
        }, I solve it by adding one line to /etc/hosts:
::1 YaohuideMacBook-Air.local
'YaohuideMacBook-Air.local' is my host name. Now the problem disappears. It only cost 86 ms to create Zookeeper the first time.
16:47:43.106 109 INFO org.example.zk.curator.ZookeeperTest - cost 86 ms
