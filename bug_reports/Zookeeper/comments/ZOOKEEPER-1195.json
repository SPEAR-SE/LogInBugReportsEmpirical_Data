This bug is to address the current lack of testing for Kerberos principal parsing., Proposal for a naming test, I started writing a test. The attached version is missing an auth_to_local rule to become independent from/not interfere with local default krb-config. Maybe its useful though., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Tom, 
 I tried your tests; they look good to me, but you need to submit this as a patch to the existing source tree. I can show you how to do this using Git if you want. Also I think it would be better to add these tests to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1196., Thomas Koch's cleanup fix (https://reviews.apache.org/r/2017/) incorporates this., Eugene, 
 Should we just incorporate ZOOKEEPER-1201 into 3.4? What do you think?, Hi Mahadev, 
+1!
-Eugene, Fixed via ZOOKEEPER-1201.]
