[This patch removes the unnecessary include of inttypes.h in addrvec.h.

But while I was testing the compilation of this on Linux/Windows, I felt the use of the STRUCT_INITIALIZER macro was a *really* bad idea if we want to guarantee cross-platform compilation on both Linux and Windows.

Using the C99 struct field initializer extension isn't supported on Windows. If we allow that extension to be used at all in the C code then we risk breaking compatibility. Because on Linux you could do the assignments out of order from the proper order for the structure. This would happily compile on Linux but fail on Windows.

The use of the STRUCT_INITIALIZER macro is only going to mask that problem rather than enforcing stricter code wherein the order of the fields in the assignment must match the order of the fields in the structure., +1

Thanks for the patch, Marshall. I'll wait for the pre-commit build to pass and check this in.
