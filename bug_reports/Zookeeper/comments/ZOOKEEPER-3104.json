Given that this is a critical bug in 3.4 and 3.5 why have you committed to trunk only?, [~andorm] I think [~breed] is planning to port this to other branch as well. Ben, it should be trivial to port this from 3.6 to 3.5, let me know if it needs more effort to port to 3.4, I can send out another patch to 3.4 if it takes more effort (mostly for testing I think).]
