[Also this change causes you to be unable to connect to the localhost if you do a config like
server.1=111.222.333.44:2888:3888;2181

you can only connect to 111.222.333.44 instead of 127.0.0.1 or whatever., [~fournc], [~breed] & [~shralex] is this still an issue?, I tried this:  clientPort is being read, but if you specified both clientPort and the port in the new format (after ;) they must be the same.
Same for clientPortAddress. 

But seems like Camille is right in her comment that if you specified the clientPort with the new format you won't be able to connect to it using localhost. I'm not sure if this is a problem but I'm guessing that it may be because previously if you just specified clientPort, the IP was taken as localhost implicitly. Whereas now if you say "a:b:c;d", a is taken as the ip for d. To achieve the same as before you can write "a:b:c;localhost:d".

While trying this I found a corner case missing in zkServer.sh -- if the specification uses the new format but still appears in the static configuration file (backward compatibility), zkServer.sh won't find the port (for example if you say ./bin/zkServer.sh status it will complain). Attached is a small patch for this., Opened a separate Jira for the zkServer.sh change, I opened a separate Jira for the zkServer.sh change. I suggest to close this one, since I verified that clientPort keyword is working., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I'm not sure I can remember anything about 2012 at this point. Seems strange that this is something fixed by a change to a shell script though, is that the way the config is always parsed now?, Hi Camille,

There are two issues pointed out in this JIRA. 1) (in the description) clientPort no longer gets read and 2) (in your first comment) and a client can't use localhost:... 

I tried but can't reproduce issue 1, seems like clientPort is being read. Thats why I suggested to close the JIRA.
For issue 2, I think you're right, and I think this follows from how the ip address is inferred if you don't explicitly specify it.
Previously it was assumed to be 'localhost' whereas now its assumed to be the ip from the server spec line. I'm not sure if this is a problem.

I moved the patch to zkServer.sh to a separate JIRA - ZOOKEEPER-1785 since it solves a different problem
, isn't the problem that we aren't using the wildcard address if the client address isn't specified? this patch should fix it., thanks Ben. I made a slight change to the patch., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
