This message is automatically generated., Perhaps we should just drop accessive? Questionable idea (mine) anyway, we could refactor the code instead. I ran into similar issues when creating maven support for building ZK itself. From what I can tell on the accessive site the author has not intention of publishing on a maven repo..., This is also a possibility. I've attached a patch that removes accessive.jar.

    , The accessive.jar is still in SVN under src/java/libtest/accessive.jar. Please remove it, if it's not needed anymore.
I've also contacted the author of accessive and mavenized the project with him. It should be available soon, if you still need it., Just removed the jars. Thanks Thomas for pointing out., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1337 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1337/])
    ZOOKEEPER-1086. zookeeper test jar has non mavenised dependency.
