[Part of this is fixed in: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2325
Uploaded patch contains the change to retain snapRetainCount number of *valid* snapshots instead of basing the choice just on recency, Thanks for reporting this with all details!

bq. When restoring, zookeeper doesn't find any valid snapshot logs to restore from. So it tries to reload its state from txn logs starting at zxid 0.

With ZOOKEEPER-2325 this should not happen. If there is no valid snapshot but with some tnx log files, ZK process will abort. 

Regarding retain valid snapshots vs recent snapshots, from operational point of view it might be good to retain a larger number of snapshots than the default value (3), because during recover process ZK will scan for up to 100 snapshots and skip invalid ones until it hits a valid snapshot. Because the way purge works, a valid txn log file appertains to the first valid snapshot should also persistent so ZK can recover from the first valid snapshot and tx log. 

The current approach of retaining most recent snapshots also have the benefit from a forensic point of view - if something disastrous happened that required administrator intervention, we might be interested to understand what happened and retain most recent snapshots can provide more contexts. If we are only retaining valid snapshots, we would not know what have happened.

My recommendation for similar case is:
* Retain a larger number of snapshots. The chances all of the snapshots are invalid is rare.
* Apply fix in ZOOKEEPER-2325: in case all snapshots are invalid, prevent restoring from txn logs which leads to bad state.
* Apply fix in ZOOKEEPER-261: to prevent a bad state populated to entire quorum.
