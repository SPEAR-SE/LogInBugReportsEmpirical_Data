    Any idea why precommit job generates java doc warnings? Seems not related to the patch.

    And that issue it's referencing is [ancient](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1355). 
    
    That really is weird.

    Also, I'd like to test `Autotools` on OS X, because I believe it has the same problem (unconditionally adds `libm` and `librt`), but I can't get past `autoconf -if` since I don't have `cppunit.m4`. I'm looking high and low for it: it's not in `/usr/local/` nor `/opt`, the brew CppUnit didn't come with it, and none of the Autotools directories has it. I found [ZOOKEEPER-1454](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1454), and it showed me how to specify where `cppunit.m4` is, but that's not much use if I don't have it.
    
    Do you know, does anyone have this building on OS X?

    I have cppunit.m4 under this path: /usr/local/Cellar/cppunit/1.13.2/share/aclocal. It was brew installed. Also I am able to build C client on mac. I can't remember how I did it, but checkout this link which might help: http://wiki.wsmoak.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=browse&diff=1&id=ZooKeeperBuild
