[I fixed three types of issues:

1) fixed the recursivedelete method to handle a file/dir being removed out from under us

2) re-ordered the recursivedelete in the finally clauses to be after shutting thread(s) down

3) verified (fixed in one case) that we shutdown the LeaderThread at the end of every test., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
