[Hi [~mjeelani]

Thanks for reporting this. Do you think it's related to ZOOKEEPER-2989?, [~andorm] It's the same issue as ZOOKEEPER-2989, but we changed the code to pass IPv6 literal [%s]:%s, also we changed the logging and the LocalPeerBean to show this IPv6 literal as well, which makes it easier to check when using Ipv6. 

And we added detailed tests for this change, will send out for review to see if it's better or not., Pull request submitted - appreciate review and feedback - https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/548, -1 overall.  GitHub Pull Request  Build
