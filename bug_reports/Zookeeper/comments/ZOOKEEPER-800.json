[penciling in for 3.3.2, Talked with Mahadev. I'm taking this bug (but don't know how to change assignee in Jira). 

--Michi, I modified zoo_add_auth() in branch-3.3. It returns ZINVALIDSTATE if the connection is in ZOO_CLOSED_STATE state. 

--Michi, +1 I just committed this. thanks michi., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #976 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/976/])
    ZOOKEEPER-800. zoo_add_auth returns ZOK if zookeeper handle is in ZOO_CLOSED_STATE (michi mutsuzaki via mahadev konar)
, I think this is a race condition. I just raised another ticket for this.
  2940     // [ZOOKEEPER-800] zoo_add_auth should return ZINVALIDSTATE if
   2941     // the connection is closed.
   2942     if (zoo_state(zh) == 0) {
   2943         return ZINVALIDSTATE;
   2944     }

When we initialize we assign zk->state=0 and here we check if its 0 return ZKINVALIDSTATE.
So in my case: where i am trying to addAuth right after zookeeper_init(), it sometime returns me ZKINVALIDSTATE (as the state might have not changed to CONNECTING), where as i would expect it to queue the request for me (as is done in the java client)

The problem might be that we are using 0 for both CLOSED and UNINITIALIZED state.
