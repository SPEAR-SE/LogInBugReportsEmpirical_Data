This message is automatically generated., Would you like to get this fixed for the 3.4.7 (assuming there'll be one) or for 3.5.0? If for 3.5.0, do you think it's a worth-while effort  enabling those tests for parallel runs? Having a faster test suite is always nice :-), I think we should fix this for both 3.5.0 and 3.4.7. It looks the buildbot uses automake-1.11, so I need to fix the patch to handle that.

Yes, it would be great to make these tests run in parallel. I'm guessing it's mostly about making sure the server ports don't conflict., ... and it would be even better if we can make java tests run in parallel :), I can't access the test results here any longer, so I don't know if the test failure was due to this patch or not. Otherwise, the change looks good. The comments about parallel tests sound good, but that's a separate jira (possibly an umbrella one), no?

Let me know if you still need this committed., Unfortunately this patch does not work with the automake version used by the buildbot. We can work on running tests in parallel in a separate JIRA., automake version got upgraded, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, I recently discovered that this change requires build environments to have version 1.12 or greater for automake.  I'd like to update the documentation, so I attached a patch on ZOOKEEPER-1707.  [~michim], would you be able to review it?  Thanks!]
