[If you are talkin about warning,  I think we can safely ignore it.

if you are talking about the test-contrib target:
test-contrib is a dummy target that I 've created as test-patch script expects an ant target called test-contrib which would run contrib test. 
, Ok, I raised this issue because I thought that it was causing the other tests not to run, but now I realized that it is causing no problem. Thanks for the update, Giridharan., Not a real issue.]
