[this patch fixes the issue and includes test for setting data on "/". 
, Wow, this sucks. :-) Good catch.

Re a 3.1.2, since this is deterministic, and the first anyone has noticed, I think we should be
safe saying prior to 3.2.1 "don't set data on / znode" and leave it at that. It's pretty
atypical anyway and should be easy to work around - set "/root" (whatever) instead.
