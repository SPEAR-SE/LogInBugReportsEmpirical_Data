The test case 

junit] Tests run: 2, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 107.528 sec
    [junit] Test org.apache.zookeeper.test.NioNettySuiteHammerTest FAILED

also fails., This patch ignores the following assertions for now:

- the count of fds in ClienTest
- the count of nodes in ClientBase

These changes will be reverted back in ZOOKEEPER-871 before 3.4 is released. This is just a patch to get the patch process running so that review is done on time.
, this looks good, however can you make conditional, where the detail is logged at ERROR level if the original assert failed, and at info level otw? you can use LOG.log(priority, msg... ) where priority is a conditional value. then we can more easily identify errors

also, I'd suggest opening another jira for this same release to revert this change at some point. (so we don't forget), updated patch with comments incorporated., +1 looks ok. pushed to trunk., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #936 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/936/])
    ZOOKEEPER-870. Zookeeper trunk build broken.
