{noformat}, martin,
 can you please provide this as a patch? Please take a look at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/HowToContribute for some help on how to go through the process on contributing.

This would a good fix for 3.4.0 release., This is the last change proposed by Martin Serrano. Since I touched the file I also reduced the numbers of system.exit() calls in the main method to make checkstyle a bit happier.,

This message is automatically generated., this change points out the importance of both having code reviews and having tests that verify the "fix".

1) separate out the exit refactoring into a separate jira, it doesn't belong here.

bq. // it would be nicer to use System.exit only if exitCode != 0

remove this comment, the exit is here to guarantee that we actually exit

also fix the exit code for "Exception" back to 1.

2) notice that the conditional is never hit, since ftxn is never set to non-null.

3) add a test for this if possible. Time to add Mockito?
, Fixed in ZOOKEEPER-1459]
