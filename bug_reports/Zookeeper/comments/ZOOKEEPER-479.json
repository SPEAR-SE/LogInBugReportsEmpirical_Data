This message is automatically generated., This patch will probably keep failing until we have ZOOKEEPER-481 in. Also, I'm adding support to get the weight of servers to QuorumVerifiers, which we'll need in ZOOKEEPER-491., +1 looks good., Made a small modification to the test in the patch, and uploading a 3.2 version., I just committed this. thanks flavio !!
