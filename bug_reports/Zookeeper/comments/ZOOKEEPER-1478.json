This message is automatically generated., Good catch, Alex. I was wondering why we are trying to create znodes instead of trying to simply check if it is connected. Is it because we can have a race and the output of waitForConnected is not reliable? Check the latest patch I have uploaded to see the approach I'm thinking about.

Other than this issue, the patch you submitted looks good., Hi Flavio, this looks good, although I don't know the details of ZK-790 to which this test is related, so not sure what it is supposed to do exactly. One thing a bit odd is the line 

QuorumBase.waitForServerUp(
                        "127.0.0.1:" + qu.getPeer(2).clientPort,
                        CONNECTION_TIMEOUT));

above your changes. Server 2 might not have been even shut down (it should be "index" ?) and in any case your new line waitForConnected seems to be sufficient even without the above line. right ? 

, I had a look at ZOOKEEPER-790 and if I checked it right, and this change to run 30 times create was introduced in ZOOKEEPER-1103. 

We are just trying to check if the client is able to reconnect to the ensemble after a leader demotion, so I think the way I'm proposing is cleaner. I'll be uploading shortly a small change that will guarantee that the race I was referring to doesn't happen by waiting until we actually observe that the client has disconnected.

About the waitForServerUp statement, it doesn't look strictly necessary by the way we create the zookeeper object. It sounds ok to remove., Change to wait until client actually observes the disconnection., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
