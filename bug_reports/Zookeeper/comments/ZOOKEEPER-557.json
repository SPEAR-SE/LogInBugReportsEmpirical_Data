[Here is a sample pom.xml 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project>
<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
<groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
<artifactId>zookeeper</artifactId>
<version>3.2.1</version>
</project>

When you release zookeeper you could upload the jar and this pom to the public maven repository. For instance, the hadoop avro project seems to be uploaded on the public repo. You could contact the hadoop avro team to know how do they upload their last release (avro 1.2.0), How to upload a jar to the Apache directory ?

looks like all the building blocks are in place now for this to happen in the 3.3.0 release. Thanks!]
