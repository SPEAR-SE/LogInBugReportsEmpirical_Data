[Hi Stepan,

ZOOKEEPER-1100 is also talking about the "java.lang.Error" on ClientCnxn.SendThread, which makes ZooKeeper client hangs forever. (Affected versions also same 3.3.3 in both the issues)

Can we duplicate this issue to ZOOKEEPER-1100? Any objections?

-Rakesh, Yes, looks like it is a duplicate of ZOOKEEPER-1100, thanks.]
