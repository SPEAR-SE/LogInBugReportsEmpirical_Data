This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~arshad.mohammad]. Two things though:

* nit: typo in Niether

* also, is this compatible with dynamic configs? Once the dynamic config code rewrites the config, it will omit clientPort from zoo.cfg (and maybe secure port too?). Won't this validation cause that server to fail to start in subsequent restarts?, Thanks [~rgs] for reviewing the patch.
# corrected the spelling mistake, submitted new patch ZOOKEEPER-2263-03.patch. 
# The validation is done after both normal configuration and dynamic configuration files are parsed. So the chage is perfectly compatible with dynamic configuration, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
