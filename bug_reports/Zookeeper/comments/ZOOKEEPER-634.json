[Sorry, some of the data included is invalid.  I'll repost when confirmed, if necessary. :-/, Epilogue: I spoke too soon, I guess I had been staring at the data for too long.

Some parts of the Stat struct were getting repointed or overwritten by the time the values were shuttled into the Ruby glue.  Aside from the variation between 32b and 64b, the variations were repeatable (always the same changes, always the same wrong data), so I thought I saw something that wasn't there.

Properly duping the struct before passing to the Ruby thread resolved it., Please consider contributing your ruby binding, we'd love to include it in the release along with python, perl, etc...]
