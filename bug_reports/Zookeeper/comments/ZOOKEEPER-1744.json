[Suggested patch, against the current trunk., Looks like this never got submitted. Submitting for Nick, lmk if this is incorrect., Isn't this a dupe of another patch ZOOKEEPER-1785? [~shralex], I could be wrong but I didn't think so, this is related to using clientport vs clientportaddress. It's an issue in 3.4. Alex's patch is for 3.5, dynamic reconfig changes related iiuc., right - I also don't think these are duplicate. My changes are extending the way clientPort is being identified, whereas here the patch
is identifying the hostname to be used with this port., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
