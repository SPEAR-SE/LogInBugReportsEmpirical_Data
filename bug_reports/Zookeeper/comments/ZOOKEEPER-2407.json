This message is automatically generated., Hi [~haitao-tony] - the reason the patch is failing in hadoopqabot is that you need to add the "--no-prefix" option when using git to generate the patch. Please see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/HowToContribute for an example. Please resumit. Thank you., Hi [~haitao-tony]
