[This patch fixes the issues. 

Note to committer -- remove the rest/lib directory in it's entirety, not longer necessary (moved to ivy).

JIRA is still messed up due to the security break, in the mean time:
"I grant permission to Apache for my patch", +1 the patch looks good.
, Committed to 3.3 branch and trunk.]
