    ZOOKEEPER-2786: Flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientTest.testNonExistingOpCode

    On branch 3.5, testNonExistingOpCode appears to always take 30 seconds to execute (far too long): https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper_branch35_jdk7/967/testReport/org.apache.zookeeper.test/ClientTest/testNonExistingOpCode/history/
    
    The reason for this is a call to `zk.testableWaitForShutdown(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT)` while waiting for the client to disconnect after it sent a request with a bad opcode to the server. The call to `testableWaitForShutdown` never actually asserts anything and effectively just hangs for CONNECTION_TIMEOUT (30 seconds) and returns because the client reconnects to the server. 
    
    This patch replaces `zk.testableWaitForShutdown(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT)` with `watcher.waitForDisconnected(5000)` which is a better way to detect if we have been disconnected.

    ZOOKEEPER-2786: Flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientTest.testNonExistingOpCode

    On branch 3.4 we attempt to check that an invalid opcode in a request causes the server to disconnect the client with:
    
    ```
            try {
                zk.exists("/m1", false);
                fail("The connection should have been closed");
            } catch (KeeperException.ConnectionLossException expected) {
            }
    ```
    
    This can run into a race with the reconnection logic in `ClientCnxn.java`https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/branch-3.4/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ClientCnxn.java#L1052 We should use a watcher instead to track disconnects.

    ZOOKEEPER-2786: Flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientTest.testNonExistingOpCode

    As @hanm noticed and mentioned on the JIRA this flaky test can still fail. The reason is that we can reconnect before calling `watcher.waitForDisconnected(5000);` We need to make sure that we only process a single event from the watcher. Using a `synchronized (watcher)` provides that guarantee here.

    ZOOKEEPER-2786 Flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientTest.testNonExistingOpCode

    This is the third time this failure has popped up. This time it seemed to only impact tests run using NettyServerCnxnFactory (so it only impacts 3.5 and master) and I was able to get it to pop up with sufficient frequency when running the tests locally. 
    
    The issue is caused by improper handling of netty's futures. When we call `channel.write(wrappedBuffer(sendBuffer));` the write is completed asynchronously. The close call `channel.close();` is also asynchronous. So we can run into the case where the close occurs before a write.
    
    This patch changes our close call to be a callback for the completion of an empty write. This way we are guaranteed that the channel has "drained" before a close. 
    
    My primary concern with this patch is the channel being used while it is closing (between the write of an empty buffer and the execution of the close callback). I have added a `closingChannel` boolean to track that, which I believe is sufficient. Let me know if anyone finds a situation where that is not the case.
