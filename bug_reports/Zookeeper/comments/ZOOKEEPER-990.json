[Xiawei, 
 Can you be a little more specific on what was the load on the machines (the number of clients/number of writes) and what was the environment you were running the servers on? The kind of information stated in the jira is not very helpful in debugging the issue.

thanks, Sounds like it might be some sort of leak, given it only starts happening after a few hours of this load profile. A few things to look at:

1) what client type were you running? (c/java?). How many sessions and what does the environment look like.

2) are the timeouts correlated to a particular server, or any server in the cluster? Perhaps the server that's overloaded in ZOOKEEPER-989 ?

3) review the troubleshooting guide
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Troubleshooting
In particular rule out gc/swap (server and client side). Have you tuned the server gc at all? (jvm default is non-incremental)

4) use the 4 letter words to identify what the latency (and total number of znodes - is this increasing?) is on the servers : 
http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkCommands
zktop is very useful for this https://github.com/phunt/zktop

if the max latency is under your timeout the clients should not be seeing timeouts...

5) use visualvm or similar (jconsole?) to monitor one/more of the servers where clients are seeing timeouts, do you see anything unusual wrt gc/heap/etc...

6) attach logs from a server/client at the time where you see the issues. that will give us more insight.
