[updated the jute tocsv methods to handle passed nulls. Also updated toxml at the same time

new test for jute tostring test on a zk specific object that has null buffer.
, the patch looks good except a nit.. 

{code}
  /** Cannot create a new instance of Utils */
     private Utils() {
+        super();
     }

{code}

why do we need to call super()? isnt it default object()?, The compiler/eclipse/findbugs complains about empty block. I would have removed it entirely (the constructor) however the intent was to not allow Utils to be constructed (private constructor). So I just added the super() call to remove the warning.
, +1, I just committed this. Thanks pat., Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #211 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/211/])
    .  tostring on jute generated objects can cause NPE. (pat via mahadev)
