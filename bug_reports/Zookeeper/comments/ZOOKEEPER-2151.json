[[~jaredc]: we've seen this issue in prod many many times. Are you using 3.5.0rc1 or a recent version out of master? Also, and more importantly, do you have local sessions enabled?

And, finally, do you have any special settings for the CommitProcessor? I.e., any of the ones introduced by ZOOKEEPER-1505?, Raul Gutierrez Segales:

- We are currently running trunk@1547702, which I think is a bit earlier than 3.5.0rc1.
- We do not have local sessions enabled.
- We are not using any special settings in CommitProcessor., Interesting! So one thought that we had is that, this lockup, could be related to upgrade-to-global session code path. But, given that you don't have local sessions enabled maybe that isn't the case.

How often does this gets reproduced for you? Maybe you could try setting zookeeper.commitProcessor.numWorkerThreads to 1? Just a thought., Oh - chatted with [~thawan] and this could actually be https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1863., Wow, that looks like this issue.  Thanks so much for pointing it out.  We aren't running with that patch.  I will dig into the heap dump tomorrow and verify the symptoms and resolve this tomorrow if things match up.]
