[I don't understand the issue. openLedger is not supposed to return entries. Do you mean that you get no exception when you try to read from the ledger?, Flavio,
openLedger() would return correctly without any exception. 

Then When I try to read entries from that ledger, it would return 0 entries. , We don't check if the password is correct upon opening a ledger. Instead, we detect a mismatch when verifying the MAC, and we throw an exception then (PendingReadOp.readEntryComplete()).]
