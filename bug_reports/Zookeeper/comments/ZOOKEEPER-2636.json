    ZOOKEEPER-2636: Fix C client build break.

    JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2636
    
    Fix build break by reverting the changes made to JRecord.genCCode in ZOOKEEPER-2686, which prematurely closed the file writers that prevents zookeeper.jute.h and zookeeper.jute.c files from complete generation.
