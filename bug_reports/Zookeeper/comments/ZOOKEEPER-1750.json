This patch doesn't apply to branch-3.4. Rakesh, could you generate a separate patch for branch-3.4?, Thanks [~michi009] for the interest.
Hi, I think there is potential problem in the test case assertion which I done in the patch.
{code}
                String cnxnStr = serverCnxn.toString();
                serverCnxn.close();
                Assert.assertEquals("Connection mismatches!", cnxnStr,
                        serverCnxn.toString());
{code}

NIOServerCnxn#toString is using 'sock.socket().getRemoteSocketAddress()' and  this api is returning 'null' randomly. I think we should change it like:

{code}
                try {
                    serverCnxn.toString();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    Assert.fail("Shouldn't throw exception while getting connection details");
                }
{code}

I could see its committed in trunk version. Could you please help to change this, otw it may leads random failures. Whats the approach to do the necessary changes?, Updated patch for 3.4 version. Please have a look at it., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Hi Rakesh,

Please submit the patch to this jira. I'll review it and check it in.

By the way, does anybody know how to specify the target branch for the pre-commit build?
