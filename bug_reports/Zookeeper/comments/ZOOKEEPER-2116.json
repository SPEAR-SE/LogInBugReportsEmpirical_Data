[Furthermore, zkCli.sh doesn't even document these command line options; {code}zkCli.sh -h{code} is treated as {code}zkCli.sh{code}, Here no code issue, By default zkCli.sh will connect to localhost:2181.

{code}
connectToZK(cl.getOption("server"));
{code}

{code}
  public MyCommandOptions() {
          options.put("server", "localhost:2181");
          options.put("timeout", "30000");
        }
{code}

If you want to connect on some other port you need to pass it with "-server" option.

{code}
./zkCli.sh -server IP:Port
{code}, Thanks. We need to get this info updated in the official documentation. Because currently it says as follows (refer to the link from my initial comment:

```
Connecting to ZooKeeper
Once ZooKeeper is running, you have several options for connection to it:

Java: Use
bin/zkCli.sh 127.0.0.1:2181
This lets you perform simple, file-like operations.
```

There is no info about "-server" argument there. And the example provided doesn't work with other server:port values., [~csbubbles] This is fixed in new version, Please check link, [~csbubbles] This is fixed in new version, Please check link, http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/zookeeperStarted.html, Closing, because it is already fixed, Please feel free to reopen If any doubt. , Is ZK 3.6.0 already released? I got lost in your schedule, to be honest, it looks like 3.5.0 has been in alpha like about a year already..., [~surendrasingh] which jira fixes this issue?, Its fixed very long back ...May here we need to change the fixed version..

It fixed as part of ZOOKEEPER-437. Pls check the check-in history for revision 783162
