        "description": "We have deployed zookeeper version 3.5.0.1515976, with 3 zk servers in the quorum.\nThe problem we are facing is that one zookeeper server in the quorum falls apart, and never becomes part of the cluster until we restart zookeeper server on that node.\n\nOur interpretation from zookeeper logs on all nodes is as follows: \n(For simplicity assume S1=> zk server1, S2 => zk server2, S3 => zk server 3)\nInitially S3 is the leader while S1 and S2 are followers.\n\nS2 hits 46 sec latency while fsyncing write ahead log and results in loss of connection with S3.\n S3 in turn prints following error message:\n\nUnexpected exception causing shutdown while sock still open\njava.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out\nStack trace\n******* GOODBYE /169.254.1.2:47647(S2) ********\n\nS2 in this case closes connection with S3(leader) and shuts down follower with following log messages:\nClosing connection to leader, exception during packet send\njava.net.SocketException: Socket close\nFollower@194] - shutdown called\njava.lang.Exception: shutdown Follower\n\nAfter this point S3 could never reestablish connection with S2 and leader election mechanism keeps failing. S3 now keeps printing following message repeatedly:\nCannot open channel to 2 at election address /169.254.1.2:3888\njava.net.ConnectException: Connection refused.\n\nWhile S3 is in this state, S2 repeatedly keeps printing following message:\nINFO [NIOServerCxnFactory.AcceptThread:/0.0.0.0:2181:NIOServerCnxnFactory$AcceptThread@296] - Accepted socket connection from /127.0.0.1:60667\nException causing close of session 0x0: ZooKeeperServer not running\nClosed socket connection for client /127.0.0.1:60667 (no session established for client)\n\nLeader election never completes successfully and causing S2 to fall apart from the quorum.\nS2 was out of quorum for almost 1 week.\n\nWhile debugging this issue, we found out that both election and peer connection ports on S2  can't be telneted from any of the node (S1, S2, S3). Network connectivity is not the issue. Later, we restarted the ZK server S2 (service zookeeper-server restart) -- now we could telnet to both the ports and S2 joined the ensemble after a leader election attempt.\nAny idea what might be forcing S2 to get into a situation where it won't accept any connections on the leader election and peer connection ports?",
