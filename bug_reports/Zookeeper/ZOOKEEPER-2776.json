        "description": "We found a bug of zookeeper election when used in our environment. It could be simply reproduced in 3 nodes cluster with default settings.\n# Assume zookeeper services down on all nodes and node 3 has bigger zxid than node1. this makes node 3 a potential leader.\n# Make node 2 down (or drop all incoming packages by firewall).\n# Start zookeeper services on node 1 and node 3.\n\nZookeeper cluster cannot be successfully established in such a case. The following logs could be found and verified:\n# Notifications to node 2 always times out.\n# node 3 is always leading but always failed because (Timeout while waiting for epoch from quorum). It rarely get Follower during the period.\n# node 1 is always following but always failed to connect Leader. it gives up after tried for 5 times and then another round election started again and again.\n# the time node 3 decided to be a leader is 1s after node 1 giving up contacting it.\n# node 3 always receive Notification packages 5s after node 1.\n\nThen we analyzed source code of zookeeper-3.4.6 and found:\n# In election, Zookeeper send leader election message sequentially and has connection timeout 5s by default. This makes a 5s recv delay for nodes after (by id) the down node. Those nodes will get the same election notification 5s after those nodes which have smaller id than the down node. \n\nIn the case mentioned above, node 3 realized the situation and jumped into LEADING status 5s after node 1 decided to follow it. For follower node 1, it tried to connect leader 5 attempts with 1s interval (hard-coded). This means all followers give up connecting leader after 4s. At the time when follower gave up, the node 3 has not even become the leader.\n\n-- So, Is there any solution to configure or bypass this problem?",
