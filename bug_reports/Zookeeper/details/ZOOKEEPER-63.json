So its a side benefit that it acts as a band aid until someone fixes all the possible race conditions and potential socket hangs.\n\nLet me put it another way. Given that the client is closing; is it really correct to leave it potentially hanging around forever just because it cannot be sure if the disconnect packet was received and properly processed by the server? If the socket is dead before the call to close(), is it really correct to block until a connection can be re-established, just so it can be properly closed - when the code will effectively close the hung socket without sending a disconnect packet anyway :) ? \n\nThe server has to detect and timeout failed sessions; whether it receives an explicit disconnect packet or not (as a process could just hang). So do we really need to be super strict on the client side, forcing clients to block when trying to shut down if they can't do so cleanly within some time period?\n\nI totally agree that we should fix the race condition though :). I just wanted a work around to avoid my ZK test cases hanging forever due to the race condition :) ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-07-24T10:00:51.046+0000","updated":"2008-07-24T10:00:51.046+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399322/comment/12616643","id":"12616643","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree with your comments, in addition the patch should address:\n\n1) there is still the stated race condition\n2) what is causing the underlying hang? this should not be happening and needs to be addressed directly, may even be related to item 1\n\n3) if the timeout is reached a warning should be issued in the log","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-07-24T20:34:23.236+0000","updated":"2008-07-24T20:34:23.236+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12399322/comment/12619041","id":"12619041","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"-1 The submitRequest logic should not be duplicated.
