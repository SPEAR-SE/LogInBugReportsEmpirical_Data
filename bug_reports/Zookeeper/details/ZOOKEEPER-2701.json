Still trying to work out the exact circumstances that cause the issue to occur, but I suspect it's something like:\r\n # a NIC intermittently drops out & recovers quickly on a follower.\r\n # #1 is enough to cause socket writes to fail in such a way that Linux packet retransmission + exponential backoff foo kicks.\r\n # the follower attempts to rejoin the cluster, but is unable to due to some combination of the above failing write(s) and rejecting new inbound connections from other members of the quorum because \"There is already a connection for server X\".\r\n # roughly 15-16 minutes later, Linux detects the connection is dead after exhausting packet retransmission retries & forces the connections closed.\r\n # #4 allows new inbound connections, socket writes start succeeding, the follower rejoins the quorum and everything is great again.\r\n\r\nThis prevents the follower from rejoining the quorum, which obviously isn't great. Given that, this is a little worse than a \"Minor\" issue when it happens IMO – if you're unlucky this could happen across multiple machines at the same time & easily lead to quorum loss.\r\n\r\nI may not have the exact details down, but it's _something_ like that. This issue has been occurring regularly across multiple clusters we've got running in EC2.\r\n\r\nIf it's useful to anybody playing along at home: we're experimenting with [tcp_retries2|https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt] to work around the issue at a system level. The default behavior in our setup (which from a quick google seems to be pretty standard) is to retry 15 times with up to a 2 minute delay between retries for a total of 15-16 minutes – seems safe to be a bit more aggressive given our ZK hosts are all in the same EC2 region. I've seen some suggestions of folks going with 3 retries, but we're being a bit more conservative & going with 5 for now, which should let us detect dead connections within a few seconds.\r\n\r\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomaslee","name":"thomaslee","key":"thomaslee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT+8"},"created":"2018-06-26T16:44:35.945+0000","updated":"2018-06-26T16:44:35.945+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13044456/comment/16544897","id":"16544897","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jiangjiafu","name":"jiangjiafu","key":"jiangjiafu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jiangjiafu&avatarId=31525","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jiangjiafu&avatarId=31525","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jiangjiafu&avatarId=31525","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jiangjiafu&avatarId=31525"},"displayName":"Jiafu Jiang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Hong_Kong"},"body":"I remove the following code:\r\n            try {                // OK to wait until socket disconnects while reading.                sock.setSoTimeout(0);\r\n            } catch (IOException e) {\r\n                LOG.error(\"Error while accessing socket for \" + sid, e);\r\n                closeSocket(sock);\r\n                running = false;\r\n            }\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd I find it works fine in my test environment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jiangjiafu","name":"jiangjiafu","key":"jiangjiafu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jiangjiafu&avatarId=31525","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jiangjiafu&avatarId=31525","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jiangjiafu&avatarId=31525","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jiangjiafu&avatarId=31525"},"displayName":"Jiafu Jiang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Hong_Kong"},"created":"2018-07-16T07:33:25.347+0000","updated":"2018-07-16T07:33:25.347+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13044456/comment/16544911","id":"16544911","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomaslee","name":"thomaslee","key":"thomaslee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT+8"},"body":"I can't speak to whether that solution is correct (suspect it's likely more complicated than simply removing the code that modifies the read timeout for all sorts of reasons), but I can imagine how the read timeout firing may address some of the symptoms by forcing the socket closed & short-circuiting the OS-level retransmission guff.\r\n\r\nWhatever the outcome, thanks for posting this bug!
