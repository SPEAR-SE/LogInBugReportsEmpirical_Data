In addition to the issues already mentioned, I found another problem introduced by ZOOKEEPER-827.\n# configure.ac now uses the {{AC_CANONICAL_HOST}} macro to determine if it's running on Solaris.\n# Makefile.am uses that OS detection to add the extra compiler and linker flags required on Solaris.\n# In zk_log.c, cast the pid to {{long}} for use by the {{snprintf}} format string.\n# In zookeeper.c, set the socket {{send}} flags to 0, because neither {{MSG_NOSIGNAL}} nor {{SO_NOSIGPIPE}} is defined.  This part isn't entirely correct, because it means an application on Solaris could fall victim to {{SIGPIPE}} generated from within the ZooKeeper library.  I believe the only full solution for Solaris is to conditionally compile in some extra code to do our own signal handling.  (See links below for examples of how other projects have done this.)  Before I go down the path of adding signal handling code, I'd like to gauge if there is general community interest in this approach.\n\nhttps://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/862\n\nhttps://github.com/kroki/XProbes/blob/1447f3d93b6dbf273919af15e59f35cca58fcc23/src/libxprobes.c#L156\n\nThere is an earlier patch attached here to deal with a naming conflict on the {{htonll}} function.

POSIX dicates that the width of {{pid_t}} is no more than {{long}}.\n\nhttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009696699/basedefs/sys/types.h.html\n{quote}\n...the widths of ..., pid_t, ... are no greater than the width of type long.\n{quote}\n\nI checked the BSD and Linux source.  It looks like BSD can use either {{int}} or {{long}} depending on options.  I see Linux using 32-bit signed as well.  For the 32-bit case, this code would store the 32-bit value in a 64-bit field just for printing.\n\nbq. dropped for Apple?\n\nThe patch keeps using {{SO_NOSIGPIPE}} on Apple, but the diff makes it difficult to read.  Here is what it looks like after applying the patch:\n\n{code}\n#ifdef _WIN32\ntypedef SOCKET socket_t;\ntypedef int sendsize_t;\n#define SEND_FLAGS  0\n#else\n#ifdef __APPLE__\n#define SEND_FLAGS SO_NOSIGPIPE\n#endif\n#ifdef __linux__\n#define SEND_FLAGS MSG_NOSIGNAL\n#endif\n#ifndef SEND_FLAGS\n#define SEND_FLAGS 0\n#endif\ntypedef int socket_t;\ntypedef ssize_t sendsize_t;\n#endif\n{code}\n\nI'm attaching a v002 patch.  This fixes some additional compilation problems I found in the tests.  We need to use the same extra compiler and linker flags for the cppunit tests.  The {{$(shell)}} construct in makefiles is a GNU-ism, so I needed to do that differently on Solaris.  The {{realloc}} stub declaration needed to be wrapped like the others to avoid a symbol redefinition error.  I'm not sure why this one wasn't triggering on Linux.  I'm guessing there is some subtle difference in the Solaris standard headers that this file includes so that it walks back to an earlier {{realloc}} declaration.\n\nI'll provide a branch-3.4 patch too later.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-01T19:35:19.709+0000","updated":"2015-05-01T19:35:19.709+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12508402/comment/14523837","id":"14523837","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here is the branch-3.4 patch.
