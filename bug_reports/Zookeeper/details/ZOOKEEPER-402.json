The c library as it is supports NULL. So you can do a create of a node with NULL and read it back. This will work. But the problem arises when you do a create with the java client with data as NULL and read it from the c client. The other way round works fine. The problem being that the java code serializes the NULL buffer as -1 and the c code does it with serializing as 0 and does not handle -1 on deserialization or serialization. We should fix the c recordio to handle this.
