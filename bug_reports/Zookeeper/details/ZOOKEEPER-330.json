This contradicts the information here:\n\nhttp://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.1.0/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_InstallingSingleMode\n\nand it also just would be nice, I think, for the standard zkServer.sh (which uses QuorumPeerMain) and standard config file to work fully for standalone installations out of the box.\n\nMy revisions in the attached patch allow ZooKeeperMain to take a single config file as an alternate set of arguments, in which case it works like QuorumPeerMain.  This seems to resolve both my original issue, support the addition of a command-line tickTime argument as per your patch, and allow the src/c/tests/zkServer.sh script to work as-is.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdarroch","name":"cdarroch","key":"cdarroch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Darroch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-02-26T20:16:49.862+0000","updated":"2009-02-26T20:16:49.862+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12415522/comment/12677250","id":"12677250","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 for the aptch .... good changes chris...
