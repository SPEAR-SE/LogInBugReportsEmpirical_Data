As a result, some old-looking but required txn log files can be deleted, resulting in data corruption or loss.\n\nFor example, consider the following:\n\n1. Configuration:\nautopurge.snapRetainCount=3\n\n2. Following files exist:\nlog.100 spans transactions from zxid=100 till zxid=140 (inclusive)\nsnapshot.110 - snapshot as of zxid=110\nsnapshot.120 - snapshot as of zxid=120\nsnapshot.130 - snapshot as of zxid=130\n\nAbove scenario is possible when snapshotting has happened multiple times but without accompanying log rollover, which is possible if the server was running as a learner.\n\n3. PurgeTxnLog retains all snapshots but deletes log.100 because its zxid is older than the zxid of the oldest snapshot (110).  This results in loss of transactions in the range 131-140.\n\nBefore the fix for ZOOKEEPER-1797, this was avoided by the call to FileTxnSnapLog.getSnapshotLogs() which finds and retains the newest txn log file with starting zxid < oldest retained snapshot's highest zxid.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12827921","id":"12827921","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-2574.2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abhishekrai","name":"abhishekrai","key":"abhishekrai","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Abhishek

Thanks for the proposed patch with good unit testing.\n\nI agree the following scenario will occur in learner side, where snapshotting has happened multiple times without accompanying log rollover, [refer source code|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/branch-3.4/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Learner.java#L439]. I think there is mismatch in the zookeeper documentation, it says \"This snapshot supercedes all previous logs\", [please refer zk doc|https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.9/zookeeperAdmin.html#Ongoing+Data+Directory+Cleanup]. But in this particular case the latest transactions after snapshotting is gong to the existing transaction log file, which is behind if we look at the naming(zxid part). I'm not sure whether this is intentionally implemented?. Again, iiuc, recovery will use a snapshot file + delta taken from the transaction log file name after snapshotted zxid, but in this case admins need to consider the log file just before, the snapshot file. Should we need to make the snapshot file and log file consistent to avoid any corner cases in future?\n\n[~phunt], any thoughts?\n\n{code}\n2.

The learner writes the snapshot in response to the NEWLEADER message received from the leader.  Based on my understanding, this is because the leader could be ahead of the learner - meaning that the learner is missing some transactions that the leader has.  So receiving a snapshot and committing it locally is a valid option for the learner to catch up and join the quorum.  However, going forward it will receive subsequent transactions, which as you mentioned get appended to the existing txn log file.  It seems a log rollover could have been done before snapshotting in the learner, but perhaps changing behaviors at this point is not worth it given the need to support old behavior too?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abhishekrai","name":"abhishekrai","key":"abhishekrai","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Abhishek Rai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-12T10:12:20.489+0000","updated":"2016-09-12T10:12:20.489+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13003962/comment/15486135","id":"15486135","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.

I've applied your comments and uploaded a new patch set, please take another look.\n\n> PurgeTxnTest.java:224 Can we change ArrayList<File> logsToPurge back to List<File> logsToPurge?\nI switched logsToPurge from a List<File> to an ArrayList<File> so I can simply use remove(0) to remove the first element in the list on line 239.  However, as you pointed out, this is probably not obvious given that all other lists around it are List<File>, so I've added a comment explaining the choice.\n\n> PurgeTxnLog.java:138 Do we need to use the FileFilter here since we do \"filtering\" on line 142?\nBoth filtering are required.  The FileFilter used in lines 134-138 are useful for listing all snapshot and log files with zxid >= leastZxidToBeRetain.  The check on 142 is to skip deletion of the newest log file that comes before the oldest retained snapshot.  However, I agree that the logic would be simpler if all filtering logic is in one place, in MyFileFilter.accept().  I've moved it there now.\n\n> PurgeTxnLog.java:148 We do logging and System.out.println for the same String, do we need both?\n\nMy goal here was to capture the output in the log file generated by the ant test run.  System.out.println wasn't useful in this context.  However, I needed to retain System.out.println cause PurgeTxnLog can also be invoked interactively from a console.
