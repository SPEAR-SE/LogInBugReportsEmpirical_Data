In one config a server is an observer, in the next one it may be a follower. I haven't looked closely, but I think the intention was to talk with everyone you know to try to get the most up-to-date config information. Instead of reverting this to the previous code, consider adding a check (regardless of whether this is an observer/participant server) that won't attempt to create a connection if one is already there to the same server with the same election address (election addresses may change from one view to the next). \n\nThe code should handle observer id > 0, please file a JIRA if you find that there is a problem somewhere.\n\nThanks,\nAlex\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-01T23:46:03.906+0000","updated":"2013-11-01T23:46:03.906+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12677175/comment/13811782","id":"13811782","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Oh - fair enough.

In our internal deployment, we did a few hacks which essentially kill all observer-to-observer communication. Observers only observe the result of election algorithm. We also add random delay when observer try to reconnect, so that participants has a chance to synchronize with the leader and form the quorum before the observers take away the leader's bandwidth. \n\nMy understanding is that with our leader election algorithm, you need to broadcast your vote whenever your current vote change, so this will generate a lot of message during the initial phase of the algorithm. Also, N x N communication needed by LE is not going to scale for large deployment.  For me, I don't think promoting observer to participant is going to be a common case (only needed for DR purpose), it would be acceptable to have optional flag to disable that feature in order to reduce LE overhead with large number of observers.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thawan","name":"thawan","key":"thawan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thawan Kooburat","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-04T18:57:08.370+0000","updated":"2013-11-04T18:57:08.370+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12677175/comment/13813247","id":"13813247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sorry for the confusion, everyone, but it seems that for reconfiguration purposes its only important to send a notification (containing new config) to a server if its a participant either in the current or in the next configuration.

During the process I added two tests that involve observers and reconfigurations, and found a small NullPointer bug in QuorumPeer which is also fixed here. \n\nNote that a leader would still have to contact both old and new view to commit a reconfig when it comes up, so its important that new observer/participants know who the chosen leader is, and I think they will know because we start them with a configuration containing the previous one and themselves, so they will initiate a connection to previous config servers and get FLE responses with leader info.\n\nThe change made in ZK-107 quoted in this Jira had an issue that we're still only waiting for a quorum of the current view before terminating FLE, so all the extra messages may have just as well be lost or never sent... So either we wait for both old and new quorums in FLE or send just to old servers like before. \n\nAlso, notice that the configuration being sent is the committed one, not the proposed one. So if a server A is a participant in the new view (maybe it was an observer in the old view but it doesn't matter), then anyone able to convince it that its a participant has already adopted the new config (knows that it was committed) and so sees A as a participant and will send a message to A even if it just sends the notification to all participants of its current view.\n\nNot complete sure I have this right, so if you think that I'm wrong please let me know.

My reasoning is that FLE terminates once we have a quorum of the last committed config. So we could only \npossibly need votes from followers in the last committed config. Not from observers.

It looks like we should ensure that we at least have a quorum of new config before ending FLE and moving to the next stage where we actually need this quorum. \n\nHere are two scenarios where this seems important.\n\nSuppose we have A, B in old config and A, B, C, D, E in new one.\nSuppose A, B rebooted during reconfig and will now have to recover (commit or join the new config).\n\nCase 1 (the failing test): C, D, E committed the reconfig. If A and B don't establish connection to C, D, E before completing FLE they won't find out about the new config being committed and will continuously try and fail to complete the reconfig (they'll fail because they won't get a quorum of new config). Its sort of ok since C, D, E are up and running, and possibly C D E will eventually contact A and B, but perhaps we should avoid this scenario anyway. By ensuring that A,B talk with a quorum of new config during FLE we guarantee that they switch to new config and not try to establish a leader in old one. \n\nCase 2: if C, D, E hasn't committed the new config and are actually trying to connect to A and B, but A and B could complete FLE before hearing from C, D, E they may again end up giving up and returning to FLE because they have no quorum of new config. \n\nSo perhaps we should send the notifications to new config too and enforce having a quorum of new config before FLE is complete...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-17T07:54:12.457+0000","updated":"2014-04-17T07:54:12.457+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12677175/comment/13972903","id":"13972903","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"bq.  possibly C D E will eventually contact A and B\n\nQCM in C D E will keep trying to send notifications to A B, no?
