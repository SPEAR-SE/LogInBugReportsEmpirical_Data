I have a few comments, though:\n\n# The format seems to be broken, the try/catch block doesn't have the right indentation.\n# {{testCliCommandsNotEchoingUsage}} is not the best method to include this test. We aren't testing whether redo is echoing usage, but instead that it isn't throwing an NPE with negative values. One suggestion is to have a test case called {{testRedoNegativeCmdNumber}} in the same class and add the redo test there.\n# The test cases in the {{ZooKeeperTest}} class throw {{Exception}} so it is actually better that we do it to follow the pattern here. We should still fail in the case it throws an exception, but instead of swallowing it, I suggest we rethrow. \n# We might consider adding an implementation of {{RedoCommand}} that extends {{CliCommand}} to be able to check the output, like in {{testSortedLs()}}.\n\nHere is roughly how it should look like:\n\n{noformat}\n   @Test\n    public void testRedoNegativeCmdNumber() throws Exception {\n       try {\n           String cmd = \"redo -1\";\n           zkMain.executeLine(cmd);\n           // check that the output matches\n           ...\n       } (Exception e) {\n           fail(\"Failed to excute redo command with negative number\");\n           throw e;\n       }\n    }\n{noformat}  ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-08-01T19:55:06.863+0000","updated":"2016-08-01T19:55:06.863+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12987367/comment/15402714","id":"15402714","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Canceling to sort out comments and suggestions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-08-01T19:55:37.510+0000","updated":"2016-08-01T19:55:37.510+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12987367/comment/15551646","id":"15551646","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshsingh","name":"rakeshsingh","key":"rakeshsingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rakesh Kumar Singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Pls review","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshsingh","name":"rakeshsingh","key":"rakeshsingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rakesh Kumar Singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-10-06T11:11:08.417+0000","updated":"2016-10-06T11:11:08.417+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12987367/comment/15551689","id":"15551689","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
