I believe this is a valuable metric because it is useful to baseline performance of ZK and know when something is going wrong. \n\nAnother user (Arshad Mohammad) wrote up these notes. I am not a developer so i do not have ability to patch this. Filing this so hopefully someone with developer abilities can add this improvement. \n\n\"I find two reason whys AvgRequestLatency is almost all the time 0\n1) Ping requests are counted the most:\nAvgRequestLatency is calculated as\nAvgRequestLatency=totalLatency/count\n\nPing requests come very often and complete very fast, these request add\nnothing to totalLatency but add one to count.\n\n2) Wrong data type is chosen to store AvgRequestLatency:\nAvgRequestLatency is calculated and store as the long value instead of\ndouble vlaue.\nIn my opinion ZooKeeper code should be modified to improve this metrics\n\ni) Ping request should be ignored while recording the statistics or at\nleast should be configurable whether to ignore or not. If ping request is\nnot counted even other metrics will be more meaningful.\n\nii)  AvgRequestLatency should be of double type\"","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"AvgRequestLatency improvements","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=allenmchan","name":"allenmchan","key":"allenmchan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Allen Chan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=allenmchan","name":"allenmchan","key":"allenmchan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Allen Chan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2641/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i375bb:"}}
