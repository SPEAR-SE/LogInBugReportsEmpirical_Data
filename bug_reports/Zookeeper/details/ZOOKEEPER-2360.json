I looked at the binary release artifact and it doesn't include the commons collections jar.\n\nWe do have a test that uses CollectionsUtils, but no shipping code. I downloaded our 3.4 and 3.5 artifacts, this is all I see:\n\nphunt:~/Downloads/zd/5/zookeeper-3.5.1-alpha$ grep -R \"org.apache.commons.collections\"
