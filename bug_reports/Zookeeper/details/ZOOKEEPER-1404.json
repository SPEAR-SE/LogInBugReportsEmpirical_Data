Consider the following scenarios where the highest number identifies the leader.\n\nA server connect and creates a sequential-ephemeral node. It's the first one, so it elects itself the leader. Following that a couple of servers connect and each one will have the largest number, even if for very a brief period of time, so the leadership will start to \"hop\" from one server to the other until it stabilizes. This generates a couple of net messages and watch setup/delivery.\n \nFurthermore, a servers looses its connection and connects again, it will \"usurp\" the leadership even if only the connection of this specific is troublesome and transient. In a super stable server scenario, this will not be a problem (after the initial burst of leader elections), but the number of messages send and received (and watches setup) will be considerably higher. But on a faulty scenario, this will cause a lot of serious liveness problems.\n\nOn the other hand, a server with the lowest number would probably stay on-line for a longer period of time, and once elected it doesn't need to change. If the leader looses the connection, the second most oldest will take the place. There can be \"n\" new connections, but the leader will stay stable and well known for a longer period of time.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"created":"2012-12-14T20:23:02.509+0000","updated":"2012-12-14T20:23:02.509+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545168/comment/13532640","id":"13532640","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"body":"Therefore, I think the use of the smallest is correct, imo.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"created":"2012-12-14T20:31:41.816+0000","updated":"2012-12-14T20:31:41.816+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545168/comment/13532664","id":"13532664","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Edward, the intention wasn't \"highest\" but that client i watches the \"highest sequence number j such that j < i\", so highest which is still smaller than its own sequence number.
