I am not aware of this code path, but [~arshadmohammad] has been working with credentials on ZK so I think it's nice to let him take a look at the patch too. :) I would like to make a few comments though. \n\nThe \"is\" prefix is usually used to Java boolean methods. In the case a boolean parameter, {{immediateRetry}} seems more readable, imho.\n\n{code}\n        if (!hasSufficientTimeElapsed(isImmediateRetry)) {\n            return;\n        }\n{code}\n\ncan be rewritten as:\n\n{code}\n        if (!immediateRetry && !hasSufficientTimeElapsed()) {\n            return;\n        }\n{code}\n\nThat is, there's no need to propagate the {{immediateRetry}} boolean down {{hasSuficientTimeElapsed()}} if it is only needed at the {{reLogin}} level.\n\n{quote}\n// TODO: should we also exit the refresh thread?\n{quote}\n\nWell, see that there's an outer try-catch block that catches the LoginException and exit the thread. As far as I can see, this means that we would need to re-throw the last exception {{le}} at this exact same line.\n\nI see you trying to preserve the first LoginException, but I am asking myself if it was not better just to spit out the {{LOG.error}} as below:\n\n{code}\n                       catch (LoginException le) {\n                              LOG.error(\"Could not refresh TGT for principal: {}.\", principal, le);\n                                if (retry > 0) {\n                                    // sleep for 10 seconds.\n                                    try {\n                                        Thread.sleep(10 * 1000);\n                                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                                        LOG.error(\"Interrupted during login retry after LoginException:\", le);\n                                        throw le;\n                                    }\n                                } else {\n                                    throw le; \n                                }\n                                LOG.debug(\"Retrying login for principal:{}...\", principal);\n                                --retry;\n                       }\n{code}\n\nIt would be nice to provide some unit tests to exercise those scenarios. This probably would require some method extraction tough, so it is harder and more error prone, but maybe worth doing (idk).\n\nLast but not least, as we are using Java 7, then we can replace {{Thread.sleep(10 * 1000);}} by {{TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(10);}} (more clearer, no need to code comment anymore).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"created":"2016-07-08T03:40:20.070+0000","updated":"2016-07-08T03:44:28.869+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12987652/comment/15368091","id":"15368091","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"hasSufficient... also updates the latest time, so it still  needs to be called.\nI am not really familiar with the code enough to refactor, just trying to fix the immediate issue that we see where error is swallowed and the retry is broken, so it's impossible to debug.

The code is *very* entangled indeed. :(\n\n{quote}\nDoes ZK officially not support Java 6?\n{quote}\n\njava.util.concurrent.TimeUnit has been in JDK since Java 1.5\n\nWe are in the middle of cutting an alpha release (release 3.5.2-alpha candidate 1), among other things, so *it can take some time until a committer takes a closer look and apply your patch, ok?*\n\n_Btw, it would be great if you could spare some time to test the 3.5 branch. Any help is welcome._ ;)\n\nFinally, when I say you can \"up\" the immediateRetry what I was meaning was to replace this:\n\n{code}\n    private synchronized void reLogin(boolean immediateRetry)\n            throws LoginException {\n        (...)\n        if (!hasSufficientTimeElapsed(immediateRetry)) {\n            return;\n        }\n  (...)\n    private boolean hasSufficientTimeElapsed(boolean immediateRetry) {\n        long now = Time.currentElapsedTime();\n        // Ignore the min-time if we are retrying a failed login.\n        if (!immediateRetry && now - getLastLogin() < MIN_TIME_BEFORE_RELOGIN ) {\n            LOG.warn(\"Not attempting to re-login since the last re-login was \"\n                    + \"attempted less than {} seconds before.\",\n                    (MIN_TIME_BEFORE_RELOGIN / 1000));\n            return false;\n        }\n        // register most recent relogin attempt\n        setLastLogin(now);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n{code}\n\nWith this\n\n{code}\n     private synchronized void reLogin(boolean immediateRetry)\n            throws LoginException {\n        (...)\n        if (!immediateRetry && !hasSufficientTimeElapsed()) {\n            return;\n        }\n  (...)\n    private boolean hasSufficientTimeElapsed() {\n        long now = Time.currentElapsedTime();\n        // Ignore the min-time if we are retrying a failed login.\n        if (now - getLastLogin() < MIN_TIME_BEFORE_RELOGIN ) {\n            LOG.warn(\"Not attempting to re-login since the last re-login was \"\n                    + \"attempted less than {} seconds before.\",\n                    (MIN_TIME_BEFORE_RELOGIN / 1000));\n            return false;\n        }\n        // register most recent relogin attempt\n        setLastLogin(now);\n        return true;\n    }\n{code}\n\nThe main reason would be that {{immediateRetry}} doesn't need to be passed down to {{hasSufficientTimeElapsed}}.\n\nBut {{hasSufficientTimeElapsed}} can still be called, and it would only set the last login if the if condition inside the method was false (among other things, it requires that {{immediateRetry}} is false in your patch, so I guess it equates to my code change suggestion, right?). But I am okay with it as-is now, no problem. I have other questions with your patch, but I would need more context about this particular code piece to make an informed decision, so I will absent myself by now. :)\n\nCheers!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"created":"2016-07-08T21:15:23.584+0000","updated":"2016-07-08T21:15:23.584+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12987652/comment/15369430","id":"15369430","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"body":"Thanks [~sershe] for reporting and working on this issue\nFew comments on latest patch\n# I think we should not exit the refresh thread, let it keep trying, there may be cases where relogin succeeds after few retries, for example relogin fails becuase of KDC is down so relogin will succeed when KDC is up. \n# Same as [~eribeiro] said, use {{immediateRetry}} in {{reLogin}} method. no need to pass the {{immediateRetry}} to {{hasSufficientTimeElapsed}} method","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"created":"2016-07-10T05:51:48.682+0000","updated":"2016-07-10T05:51:48.682+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12987652/comment/15371255","id":"15371255","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"hasSufficientTimeElapsed method  also logs a message that would be logged misleadingly under the above approach.

I understand that this part of the code badly needs a re-write, but I'm not sure I like this current patch as is. I do see the issue reported, though.\n\nHere are a couple of comments:\n# I know that {{immediateRetry}} has been mentioned a few times in this jira, but it isn't clear to me why we need it. Is it necessary for correctness or is it just convenience? If it is convenience, then I'd rather not have it because the whole {{retry}}/{{initialRetry}} logic isn't really contributing to the code being cleaner.\n# I wanted to check that my understanding is correct. The latest patch seems to exit the while loop upon the second login exception and {{immediateRetry}} is false during the first execution iteration but not the second. Shouldn't we keep retrying but making sure that it is sleeping in each iteration rather than run in a tight loop?\n\nAnother point unrelated to your changes but in the same scope. Instead of throwing {{le}} upon an InterruptedException in that loop, we should restore the interrupt status as suggested here:\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jtp05236/\n\nThere are a couple of instances around that code, so if you don't want to do it in this patch, please I'd appreciate if you could create a new jira for it.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-07-26T09:33:43.399+0000","updated":"2016-07-26T09:33:43.399+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12987652/comment/15409911","id":"15409911","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"body":"# immediateRetry  is not required if relogin is tried at least after MIN_TIME_BEFORE_RELOGIN, but here we are trying to relogin immediately after the first relogin failure\n# bq.Shouldn't we keep retrying but making sure that it is sleeping in each iteration rather than run in a tight loop?\nThis would help in maintaining the cleaner code.
