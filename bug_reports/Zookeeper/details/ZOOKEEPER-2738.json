The acceptor thread was checking the max connections, but adding the connection to the ipMap (used to check maxCnxnCount) was done in the selector threads.  As a result, when many connections come in concurrently, the acceptor thread can potentially accept many connections before the selector threads have a chance to update the ipMap.\n    \n    This patch updates the ipMap from the acceptor thread immediately.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/vincentpoon/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2738\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/209.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #209\n    \n----\ncommit c4fdafbf94f8e6296a349eb10ff02f2d77a2ddb8\nAuthor: Vincent <vincent.poon@salesforce.com>\nDate:   2017-03-27T17:19:37Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2738 maxClientCnxns not limiting concurrent connections properly\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-03-27T17:25:46.699+0000","updated":"2017-03-27T17:25:46.699+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13059094/comment/15943716","id":"15943716","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
