In particular to verify that Netty sockets will sometimes switch to reading before all of the outgoing bytes are written, which they will. I thought it was interesting though that they also configure a \"writeSpinCount\" that lets them try to flush all bytes a configurable number of times before going back to the selector to do other IO.
