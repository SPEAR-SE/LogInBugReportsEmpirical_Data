The machine powers off before the snapshot is synced to disc and after some txn's have been logged (depending on the OS, this can happen!).\n4. The observer comes back a second time and replays its most recent snapshot (epoch <= N) as well as the txn logs (epoch N+1). \n5. A diff sync is requested from the leader and the observer broadcasts availability.\n\nIn this scenario, any commits from epoch N that the observer did not receive before it died the first time will never be exposed to the observer and no part of the ensemble will complain. \n\nThis situation is not unique to observers and can happen to any learner. As a simple fix, fsync-ing the snapshots received from the leader will avoid the case of missing snapshots causing data loss.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Interrupted snapshot sync causes data loss","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nixon","name":"nixon","key":"nixon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brian Nixon","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nixon","name":"nixon","key":"nixon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brian Nixon","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13093873/comment/16122076","id":"16122076","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"GitHub user enixon opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/333\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2872: Interrupted snapshot sync causes data loss\n\n    \n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/enixon/zookeeper snap-sync\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/333.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #333\n    \n----\ncommit 39bd1a3eb9171a014845fff97648341cbfb40a11\nAuthor: Brian Nixon <nixon@fb.com>\nDate:   2017-08-01T20:25:51Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2872: Interrupted snapshot sync causes data loss\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-08-10T18:41:21.972+0000","updated":"2017-08-10T18:41:21.972+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13093873/comment/16122093","id":"16122093","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
