Thank you for picking up this patch.  I think the approach of propagating the exceptions looks like the right direction.  Here are a few comments.\n\n{code}\n            try {\n                acceptThread.join();\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                LOG.error(\"Error joining old acceptThread when reconfiguring client port \" + e.getMessage());\n            }\n{code}\n\nThis wasn't introduced by your patch, but it's generally a bad practice to catch an {{InterruptedException}} and neither propagate it nor re-raise the interrupted status.  Other layers of code might be expecting to react to thread interruption.  Since we're touching this code, do you think we should add a call to {{Thread.currentThread().interrupt()}}?\n\n{code}\n            LOG.error(\"Error reconfiguring client port to \" + addr + \" \" + e.getMessage());\n{code}\n\nThis is also not a problem introduced by your patch, but can we pass along the {{e}} as the second argument to log the full stack trace for better diagnosis?\n\n{code}\n       try {\n           LOG.info(\"binding to port \" + addr);\n           parentChannel = bootstrap.bind(addr);\n           localAddress = addr;\n       } catch (Exception e) {\n           LOG.error(\"Error while reconfiguring\", e);\n           throw new IOException(e.getMessage());\n       } finally {\n           oldChannel.close();\n       }\n{code}\n\nIf there is an exception thrown from the try body, and then {{oldChannel.close()}} also throws an exception, then the caller will receive the second exception.  Generally, the first exception is probably more interesting for root cause information, so I think it's preferrable to catch and log the exception in the finally block, or if you prefer, only throw from the finally block if the whole try block was successful.\n\n{code}\n            try { \n                self.processReconfig(newQV, designatedLeader, zk.getZxid(), true);\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                return false;\n            }\n{code}\n\nDoes this exception need to be logged at this layer, or do all exceptions already get logged somewhere within the {{QuorumPeer#processReconfig}} call?\n\nI think the test works for covering this change, but I see some incorrect indentation.  Would you please clean that up?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-21T17:02:00.150+0000","updated":"2016-05-21T17:02:00.150+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12938854/comment/15295141","id":"15295141","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the patch. A few comments:\n- In case the new port is taken, perhaps its better to leave the old port in effect ?

At that point, the operation is committed for all practical purposes (quorum already accepted), there is no way to abort it. What can we do without redesigning ZK ? my suggestion is to keep logging an error and not propagate it up (because you can't do anything about it anyway) but of course to close the port, which is what the bug was opened for and what the patch does. The alternative is perhaps to bring down that server because its state can't reflect a committed operation, but I think its an overkill :)\n\n- Why I said that the new \"return false\" in Leader.java isn't exercised by the test: because the test scenario is trying to change a follower's port, so processReconfig fails to change it at the follower, the leader will execute processReconfig just fine, since all it does is update the config in memory.\n\n- returning false in Leader.java is wrong. My comments can probably be better there, but false has a different meaning - it indicates that there are not enough acks.

I'm less ok with the server that is supposed to change the port failing to do it and keep operating regularly.

What can we do without redesigning ZK ?\n\nThinking out loud, so I'm probably missing something, but can we do something like bind to the new port during the proposal, but still keep the old port listening too?  Then, during commit, we'd transition the accept thread to the new already-bound port and close the old one.  The effect I'm trying to achieve is moving the bind failure to proposal time, so it won't get ack'd as successful, and therefore the quorum won't accept it.\n\nOf course, this is a much heavier change and maybe strays towards \"redesigning ZK\".\n\nbq. so either we log and proceed or we exit the server.\n\nThinking about the operational model, I could see \"exit the server\" easily escalating to \"exit the ensemble.\"  If the admin accidentally reconfigs to a commonly bound port, such as 8080 for an HTTP server, then there is a strong possibility that all servers in the ensemble would hit the bind failure and exit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-24T00:06:23.724+0000","updated":"2016-05-24T00:06:23.724+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12938854/comment/15297431","id":"15297431","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"If we pursued something like this, then we'd open up another edge case to worry about: a port getting bound on a subset of servers, but not accepted by the quorum, so then the bound port is left lingering on that subset of servers.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-24T00:32:53.302+0000","updated":"2016-05-24T00:32:53.302+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12938854/comment/15297685","id":"15297685","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think its actually worse - consider a reconfig changing just one client port, of one of the servers.

Since we're touching this code, do you think we should add a call to {{Thread.currentThread().interrupt()}}?\n\n{code}\n    public void reconfigure(InetSocketAddress addr) {\n       Channel oldChannel = parentChannel;\n       try {\n           LOG.info(\"binding to port \" + addr);\n           parentChannel = bootstrap.bind(addr);\n           localAddress = addr;\n       } catch (Exception e) {\n           LOG.error(\"Error while reconfiguring\", e);\n       } finally {\n           oldChannel.close();\n       }\n    }\n{code}\n\nI don't see a checked exception raised in that code block.

The Netty bind and close calls are asynchronous, so when this method returns, it's not guaranteed that the bind and close have completed.\n\nIf the bind is asynchronous, then the server will simply not accept client connection requests until it completes.
