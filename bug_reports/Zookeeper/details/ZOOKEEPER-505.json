I was wondering why all the unit tests are passing inspite of having found so many different problems with LedgerManagementProcessor. \n\nThere is a big try-catch block sitting in the test case that catches all exception, prints their stack trace, and exits, thereby allowing the test to pass. In general, unit tests shouldnt catch exceptions unless it is something you are expecting that will happen.\n\nAnother problem is that the same ControlObject is used for synchronization throughout. Since we already have the problem of callbacks being called multiple times (ZOOKEEPER-502), notify() on the control object is called too many times, resulting in the unit test not waiting for certain callbacks.\n\nThus the test never waits for the asyncOpenLedger() to finish, and hence still succeeds. I believe asyncOpenLedger() has never worked right.
