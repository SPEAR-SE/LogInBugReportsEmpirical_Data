For instance, a lot of people still care about the size of a released artifact and a few kilobytes actually matters to them. Also, all kinds of tools are build among these assumptions. Take your usual Java IDE - you can point it at a jar containing class files and it will happily use them. Or you tell it this other jar contains source files, and it will link them.
