It sounds like the behavior would result in truncation down to one byte of effective server ID, and from personal experience, I can say that if two servers are running with the same Server ID in an ensemble it can have weird results. We had a configuration issue in one of our ensembles at one point where two servers had been misconfigured to use the same ServerId, which the Leader happily allows, and which we think resulted in duplicate session IDs getting handed out to two different sessions, and then to strange side-effects down the line. We actually have a fix in our Zookeeper fork to make LearnerHandler block any server from being allowed in if the Learner is trying to claim a Server ID that's already in use by another Learner, to prevent this configuration problem from sneaking in again.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dbenediktson","name":"dbenediktson","key":"dbenediktson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dan Benediktson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-08-05T21:20:11.829+0000","updated":"2016-08-05T21:20:11.829+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12995259/comment/15410195","id":"15410195","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the feedback [~dbenediktson] - any chance you could contribute that patch back?
