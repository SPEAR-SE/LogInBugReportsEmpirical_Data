In my case, this was seen when the leader died (i.e., during leader election). However, I think this can happen when a peer disconnects from another peer.

I was going through\nQuorumCnxManager.java for 3.2.2. It clearly leaks a SendWorker thread\nfor every other connection.\n\nAfter receiving a connection from a peer, it creates a new thread and\ninserts its reference in senderWorkerMap.\n\n            SendWorker sw = new SendWorker(s, sid);\n            RecvWorker rw = new RecvWorker(s, sid);\n            sw.setRecv(rw);\n\n            SendWorker vsw = senderWorkerMap.get(sid);\n            senderWorkerMap.put(sid, sw);\n\nThen it kills the old thread for the peer (created from earlier\nconnection)\n\n            if(vsw != null)\n                vsw.finish();\n\nHowever, the SendWorker.finish method removes an entry from\n            senderWorkerMap. This results in removing a reference for\n            recently created SendWorker thread.\n            senderWorkerMap.remove(sid);\n\n\nThus, it will end up removing both the entries. As a result, one thread\nwill be leaked for every other connection.\n\nIf you count the number of error messages in\nhbase-hadoop-zookeeper-sv4borg9.log, you will see that messages from\nRecvWorker is approximately twice of SendWorker. I think this proves\nthe point.\n\n$:/tmp/hadoop # grep \"RecvWorker\"  hbase-hadoop-zookeeper-sv4borg9.log | wc -l\n60\n$:/tmp/hadoop # grep \"SendWorker\"  hbase-hadoop-zookeeper-sv4borg9.log | wc -l\n32\n\n-Vishal","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-11-18T23:07:03.192+0000","updated":"2010-11-18T23:07:03.192+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475256/comment/12933718","id":"12933718","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"One problem here is that we had some discussions over IRC and the information is not reflected here. \n\nIf you have a look at the logs, you'll observe this:\n\n{noformat}\n\n2010-09-28 10:31:22,227 DEBUG org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager: Connection request /10.10.20.5:41861\n2010-09-28 10:31:22,227 DEBUG org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager: Connection request: 0\n2010-09-28 10:31:22,227 DEBUG org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager: Address of remote peer: 0\n2010-09-28 10:31:22,229 WARN org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager: Connection broken:\njava.io.IOException: Channel eof\n        at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager$RecvWorker.run(QuorumCnxManager.java:595)\n{noformat}\n\nIf I remember the discussion with J-D correctly, that node trying to connect is running Nagios.
