I'd like to focus on the bug in updateServerList(), so I think its a good idea to split the other issue into a separate jira.\n\nFor updateServerList() I was at first thinking to treat the case of currentHost being null similarly to the case where the currentHost is not in the new list of servers. But then I realized that this will create imbalance. Now I'm thinking maybe we should look on the server to which the client should have been connected as currentHost and run the algorithm from there. Or maybe if we consider the null case to be very rare we could ignore the imbalance that it can create :) I'm still looking into it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-05T20:53:57.877+0000","updated":"2013-04-05T20:53:57.877+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640884/comment/13624086","id":"13624086","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arren","name":"arren","key":"arren","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shevek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The trouble is that there's hidden state in flight. The question is, what is the state of the ZooKeeper client when the constructor returns.\n\nIf it is determined that it has a remote socket address, i.e. updateServerList should be callable as-written, and be safe, then ClientCnxn needs to SYNCHRONOUSLY, i.e. not via SendThread.start() record the \"intended\" target connection address.\n\nIf we follow the proposal to allow the address to be null in updateServerList, then either:\na) We nulls (treat it as always in the list), in which case the \"invisible\" state of the intended server address of the in-flight connect may still allow us to connect to a \"wrong\" server.\nb) We say a null is never in the list, in which case repeated fast calls to updateServerList could cause a denial of service of the ZooKeeper client.\n\nThe difficulty, I think, is that the state of the client when \"new ZooKeeper\" returns is defined by a race condition. The INTENT of the connection needs to be recorded in 'new ClientCnxn' before SendThread.start() goes asynchronous.\n\nA somewhat uglier hack might be to make StaticHostProvider cache the previously returned value and give the ClientCnxn a kicking if the cached value was removed from the list. While this would also work, I feel that it would contribute negatively to the overall complexity and coupledness of the code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arren","name":"arren","key":"arren","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shevek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-05T21:36:11.173+0000","updated":"2013-04-05T21:36:11.173+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640884/comment/13624089","id":"13624089","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arren","name":"arren","key":"arren","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shevek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"TL;DR: It should never be null.

Since ClientCnxnNIO is accessible to more than one thread at the point variables like sockKey are initialized, I suspect the code violates the JMM anyway.\n\nA much better solution would be to use more immutable variables, and discard and reconstruct objects rather than attempting to modify them. An ideal solution would be to use something like netty, which is designed to handle and abstract all these cases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arren","name":"arren","key":"arren","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shevek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-11T03:03:12.410+0000","updated":"2013-04-11T03:03:12.410+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640884/comment/13628640","id":"13628640","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I see.
