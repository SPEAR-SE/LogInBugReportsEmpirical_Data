The thread leak checker is complaining about the Login thread, which is created but never shut down.  It's started here:\nhttps://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/6ebd23b32d2cf606e01906bee4460bf79eb7f3fa/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/ZooKeeperSaslClient.java#L227 and you can verify via reading the code that it is never shut down.\n\nThis may be intentional, because the Login object is static, so it is probably supposed to stick around for the lifetime of the application.  This is not great for a test setup, where the idea is that a cluster and all associated clients are started/stopped for each test suite.  You wouldn't want either:\n1) a thread stick around doing nothing, or\n2) sticking around doing something (because it makes the first suite that happens to run behave differently than subsequents suites).\n\nin addition, this only happens with SASL clients, so we'd want to only turn off the leak checker if we are running under SASL (so we don't miss other leaked threads), which is a bit more complexity than I would like.\n\nI'd be happy with a function I could call to say \"I'm really done, close down  everything, even in the Login thread\" or some automatic way of doing it.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ZooKeeperSaslClient doesn't shut down Login thread","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gchanan","name":"gchanan","key":"gchanan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gregory Chanan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gchanan","name":"gchanan","key":"gchanan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gregory Chanan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2100/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i23ty7:"}}
