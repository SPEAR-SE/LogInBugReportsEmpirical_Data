If the server decides that the session is expired, then it responds by immediately closing the socket on its side.  If the client has written packets after the server has closed its end of the socket, then the TCP stack may choose to abort the connection with an RST.  When this happens, the client doesn't receive an orderly shutdown, and ultimately it fails to deliver a session expired event to the application.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12582508","id":"12582508","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-1702.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-09T20:27:12.780+0000","size":1513,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12582508/ZOOKEEPER-1702.1.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"327561","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ZooKeeper client may write operation packets before receiving successful response to connection request, can cause TCP RST","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646860/comment/13653144","id":"13653144","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The last several paragraphs here explain the general problem pretty well:\n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/articles/connection_release.html\n\nFor whatever reason, I'm having a much easier time reproducing the ultimate problem (the TCP RST) on Windows instead of Linux or OS X.

I hadn't considered the C client until now.  This is more of a general socket programming issue than a Java-specific issue, so in theory the bug could be there too.\n\nFrom a very quick glance at the C code, I couldn't find the bug there.  I'm basing that statement on the fact that {{zookeeper_interest}} only turns on write interest while connecting or after fully connected:\n\n{code}\n        /* we are interested in a write if we are connected and have something\n         * to send, or we are waiting for a connect to finish. */\n        if ((zh->to_send.head && (zh->state == ZOO_CONNECTED_STATE))\n        || zh->state == ZOO_CONNECTING_STATE) {\n            *interest |= ZOOKEEPER_WRITE;\n        }\n{code}\n\nAnd it only enters {{ZOO_CONNECTED_STATE}} after successful negotation of connection and checking session inside {{check_events}}:\n\n{code}\n                oldid = zh->client_id.client_id;\n                newid = zh->primer_storage.sessionId;\n                if (oldid != 0 && oldid != newid) {\n                    zh->state = ZOO_EXPIRED_SESSION_STATE;\n                    errno = ESTALE;\n                    return handle_socket_error_msg(zh,__LINE__,ZSESSIONEXPIRED,\n                            \"sessionId=%#llx has expired.\",oldid);\n                } else {\n                    zh->recv_timeout = zh->primer_storage.timeOut;\n                    zh->client_id.client_id = newid;\n                 \n                    memcpy(zh->client_id.passwd, &zh->primer_storage.passwd,\n                           sizeof(zh->client_id.passwd));\n                    zh->state = ZOO_CONNECTED_STATE;\n{code}\n\nTherefore, I don't think the C client has the bug.  At least that's my very naive take on it after a whole 10 minutes reading the code.  :-)\n\nOn the Java side, the logic was different in that it would immediately turn on both read and write interest in {{ClientCnxn#SendThread#primeConnection}}, and leave write interest on until the outgoing queue got drained.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-09T23:59:42.922+0000","updated":"2013-05-09T23:59:42.922+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646860/comment/13688406","id":"13688406","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm interested in getting this patch into a ZooKeeper release and upgrading to that release in Hadoop core to enable some functionality that's currently broken on Windows.
