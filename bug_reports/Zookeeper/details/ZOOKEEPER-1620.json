The reason it's preferable not to do it is to allow the system to do a graceful shutdown. The reason you shouldn't need to do that is that the shutdown call joins on the accept and selector threads, so it's not going to return until those threads exit.\n\nThe unit tests create and destroy the factories/threads/selectors in a pretty tight loop. I'm not sure how long it takes the system to close fd's associated with the selector, but maybe this is something like how closed sockets can linger. I might try to put a lengthier sleep after the factory.shutdown() call.\n\nThere have been known issues with file descriptor leaks when calling selector.close(), so we might check JDK versions we're each running.
