My original recommendation was to add another tests to check if the znode creation *fails* when a different IP address is set up in the ACL (say, \"192.0.0.1\"). The current test checks if the loopback address can create (a \"positive\" test), but *maybe* a negative test can be worth. I don't know.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"created":"2016-09-09T16:35:25.605+0000","updated":"2016-09-09T16:35:25.605+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13002416/comment/15499562","id":"15499562","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"body":"Thanks [~eribeiro] for the clarification.\nAdded negative scenario test in the new patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"created":"2016-09-17T19:38:26.872+0000","updated":"2016-09-17T19:38:26.872+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13002416/comment/15499587","id":"15499587","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
