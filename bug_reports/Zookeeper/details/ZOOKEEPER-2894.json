So, it's Ok with the case (a).\n\nWhen _zookeeper_close()_ is called in the (b) way, the following happens:\n1. +If there are requests waiting for responses in _zh.sent_requests_ queue+, they all are removed from this queue and each of them is \"completed\" with personal fake response having status ZCLOSING. Such fake responses are put into _zh.completions_to_process_ queue. It's Ok\n2. But then, _zh.completions_to_process_ queue is left unhandled. +Neither completion callbacks are called, nor dynamic memory allocated for fake responses is freed+\n3. Different structures within _zh_ are dismissed and finally _zh_ is freed\n\nThis is illustrated on the screenshot attached to this ticket: you may see that the next instruction to execute will be _free(zh)_ while _zh.completions_to_process_ queue is not empty (see the \"Variables\" tab to the right).\n\nAlternatively, the same situation but in the case (a) is handled properly -- i.e., all completion callback handlers are truly called with ZCLOSING and the memory is freed, both for subcases (a.1) when there is a failure like connection-timeout, connection-closed, etc., or (a.2) there is not failure. The reason is that any callback handler (completion or watcher) in the case (a) is called from the _process_completions()_ function which runs in the loop until _zh.completions_to_process_ queue gets empty. So, this function guarantees this queue to be completely processed even if new completions occur during reaction on previously queued completions.\n\n*Consequently:*\n1. At least there is definitely the +memory leak+ in the case (b) -- all the fake responses put into _zh.completions_to_process_ queue are lost after _free(zh)_\n2. And it looks like a great misbehavior not to call completions on sent requests in the case (b) while they are called with ZCLOSING in the case (a) -- so, I think it's not \"by design\" but a +completions leak+\n\n+To reproduce the case (b) do the following:+\n- open ZooKeeper session, connect to a server, receive and process connected-watch, etc.\n- then somewhere +from the main events loop+ call for example _zoo_acreate()_ with valid arguments -- it shall return ZOK\n- then, +immediately after it returned+, call _zookeeper_close()_\n- note that completion callback handler for _zoo_acreate()_ *will not be called*\n\n+To reproduce the case (a) do the following:+\n- the same as above, open ZooKeeper session, connect to a server, receive and process connected-watch, etc.\n- the same as above, somewhere from the main events loop call for example _zoo_acreate()_ with valid arguments -- it shall return ZOK\n- but now don't call _zookeeper_close()_ immediately -- wait for completion callback on the commenced request\n- when _zoo_acreate()_ completes, +from within its completion callback handler+, call another _zoo_acreate()_ and immediately after it returned call _zookeeper_close()_\n- note that completion callback handler for the second _zoo_acreate()_ *will be called with ZCLOSING, unlike the case (b) described above*\n\nTo fix this I propose calling to _process_completions()_ from _destroy(zhandle_t *zh)_ as it is done in _handle_error(zhandle_t *zh,int rc)_.\n\nThis is a proposed fix: https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/363\n\n[upd]\nThere are another tickets with about the same problem: ZOOKEEPER-1493, ZOOKEEPER-2073 (the \"same\" just according to their titles).\nHowever, as I can see, the corresponding patches were applied on the branch 3.4.10, but the effect still persists -- so, this ticket does not duplicate the mentioned two.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12886072","id":"12886072","filename":"zk-will-free-zh-and-lose-completions.png","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xoiss","name":"xoiss","key":"xoiss","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander A.
