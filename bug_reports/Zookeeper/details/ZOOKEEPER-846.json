Both this specific jira and HBASE-2966.\n\nDuring session close we set the \"closing\" flag, then later set the ZK state to CLOSED. zk client operations track outstanding\nrequests to the server on the \"outstandingqueue\". There's a timing window where we can clear the outstanding\nqueue (caused by the \"closing\" flag being set AND an error occurs on the socket) and exit the sendthread.  Subsequent \nto this if an operation runs before the ZK state is set to CLOSED it will queue additional packets to the outstandingqueue. \nThese packets will never be processed, and as a result the original operation will never complete.\n\nin queuepacket we need to check if closing is set before queueing a packet (we currently check the state only)\n\nI'm working on a test/fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-09-09T05:28:33.132+0000","updated":"2010-09-09T05:28:33.132+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471442/comment/12907541","id":"12907541","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thkoch","name":"thkoch","key":"thkoch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thkoch&avatarId=11540","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thkoch&avatarId=11540","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thkoch&avatarId=11540","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thkoch&avatarId=11540"},"displayName":"Thomas Koch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"ZOOKEEPER-126 and ZOOKEEPER-846 both have the same cause.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thkoch","name":"thkoch","key":"thkoch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thkoch&avatarId=11540","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thkoch&avatarId=11540","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thkoch&avatarId=11540","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thkoch&avatarId=11540"},"displayName":"Thomas Koch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-09-09T07:07:29.321+0000","updated":"2010-09-09T07:07:29.321+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471442/comment/12909014","id":"12909014","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This patch fixes the problem by adding a check for close in queuepacket.\n\nNote that this also moves the close=true into queuepacket (otw the closeSession would never be queued during a close.\n\nI spend > 1 day trying to craft a test for this, unfortunately due to the small size of the timing window I wasn't able to get a test that failed with this case.
