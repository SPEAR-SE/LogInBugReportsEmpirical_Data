It can also be solved with a check to verify that the followers have the same history as the leader. Since synchronisation is the only time in which a different history could be joining in, a check of the last transaction should be enough. The check could be done comparing the entire transaction information or with a checksum. This information (transaction info or checksum) could be sent from the follower to the leader anytime before the decision of whether to synchronise using DIFF, TRUNC or SNAP, and the leader could then send an SNAP if the checksum was wrong (and log a big WARN message).\nThis also covers the problem of an operator wrongly starting one of the members of the ensemble with a data dir coming from another ensemble.\nHowever, this does mean a small change in the protocol, which can be done keeping backwards compatibility. The leader reports that it is able to optionally receive this information, and the follower sends that information only if the leader supports it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-10-03T03:36:54.140+0000","updated":"2013-10-03T03:36:54.140+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12671758/comment/13784814","id":"13784814","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thawan","name":"thawan","key":"thawan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thawan Kooburat","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Similar to what Flavio already said, here is what I see. \n\nBetween step 4 and 5, you actually lose majority of the machine at once, so the quorum move forward without committed txns from (1,7c) to (1,a9)\n\nAt step 6, A should get a TRUNC to (1,7b) and start getting DIFF with txn from (2,1) to  (2,4).

If there is a minority disconnected, and you wipe out the data of one of the servers in the live quorum, then ZooKeeper is not guaranteed to work because some committed transactions lost majority. You're violating fundamental assumptions of the replication protocol.

Here are my current thoughts then. In the A, B, C scenario  above, I would have expected that A truncates its history and adopts the state of  B, C, losing some transactions. But, according to you observations, A is not getting some of the new transactions of B, C, which does not correspond to my expectation, so that's the only thing I believe we would need to fix if anything.\n\nThe thing that throws me is that in any case your data is broken! I'm not exactly sure why it matters to have a consistent ensemble with a broken state. One point you made is that we could try to detect the problem so that A decides not to make further progress. Unfortunately, A can't determine whether the transactions it has and B, C don't have been committed or not. The txn log only contains accepted txns. A cannot distinguish this run from one in which A is the only one that has accepted these txns.\n\nGiven that we are discussing an invalid scenario, I'd like to propose that we lower the severity of this issue to major or critical. This means that it is not a blocker for 3.4.6, but we could still try to get this in if we can converge to a solution.

It is possible that the servers have a compatible history in terms of zxid numbers, but it is still a different history.

There is a new leader election and a new epoch.\n3 - A and B continue until transaction 6, epoch 2.\n4 - A is stopped. B is stopped and loses all data.\n5 - B and C are restarted and form an ensemble starting with zxid 3, epoch 1. They build a different story up to zxid 9, epoch 2.\n6 - A is restarted, joins the new ensemble, receives a DIFF (in epoch 2 from zxid 7 to 9) and continues working.\n7 - Transactions in A for epoch 2 from 4 to 6 are different from those in B and C, but they have the same zxid.\nCould that be it?\nIn my humble opinion, the fact that the algorithm doesn't guarantee correctness in those scenarios, doesn't mean that the working software shouldn't cover the case and have an acceptable behavior. In terms of academic demonstration of an algorithm it would be perfectly ok, in terms of having this component in a production environment it is not.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-10-09T06:03:33.003+0000","updated":"2013-10-09T06:03:33.003+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12671758/comment/13790069","id":"13790069","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"... of course that depends on the requirements of that production environment.

The idea would be to reserve some bits of the zxid for sanity check (e.g. 12 bits).\nThat means that the zxid will rollover more often, but the remaining space for zxid+epoch (51 bits) still should last for more than one hundred years. \nThis sanity check will be calculated by the leader when increasing the zxid and it can be e.g. a random number.\nWhen a Follower connects to a leader or a client connects to a server, the leader and the server will only check if they see this zxid in their transaction history. If it is not there, then there is a warning and an snap is sent to the follower or the client connection is closed.\nThere is no need to modify any protocol or storage with this, as far as I see.
