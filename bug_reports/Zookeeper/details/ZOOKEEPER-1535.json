Therefore when the user issue <ctrl+d> the flow jumps out of loop, but before ending execution it runs the code above, that seems redundant, imo. \n\nThe issue shows up because the \"cl\" object still points to the last executed command even though the \"line\" variable (that  populates the \"cl\" object) is already null. Looking at svn logs and studying the control flow, it looks like the this snippet  lost its usefulness during successive code modifications (last one that affected it: ZOOKEEPER-82), because its job is already done by executeLine() calls in the loop.\n\nMy suggestion would be to get rid of this code block, but I would like to hear what you think about it.

Type one or more commands (ls, history, etc) and then press CTRL+D. It should reexecute the last command I issued;\n3. After applying the patch, I re-execute steps 1-2, but it closes the connection and leaves the CLI without executing the latest command a second time. \n\nBesides, the two patches I've uploaded are different fixes of the same problem. I think the first version is the better, but I would like to hear what you think about it.\n\nThanks,\nEd","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"created":"2012-12-30T23:39:24.031+0000","updated":"2012-12-30T23:39:24.031+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603538/comment/13541205","id":"13541205","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"OK patch #1 looks ok to me.
