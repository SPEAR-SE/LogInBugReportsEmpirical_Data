The tests that I wrote verify that incorrect permissioning prevents the server from starting, as opposed to just verifying the behavior of the FileTxnLog (we do something similar with testWithoutAutoCreateDataLogDir).\n\nI guess it would be reasonable to say that the tests that I wrote are more like integration tests while the tests that you attached are true unit tests.
