Will the follower still sync with the leader?\n\nCan you explain how sync works?  I was going throught the code flow. I traced the sync call, but I could find the place that performs the data transfer between the leader and follwer.\n\nI will cleanup the patch. As per the test goes,  I am not sure what is the best way to check if a server has received a request with null owner. I was planning to add a test that will initiate all zk client requests. In SessionTrackerImpl.checkesession(), set a flag if it sees a null owner. At the end of the test, fail the test if the flag is set. Any suggestions?\n\n-Vishal","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-10-21T20:51:38.169+0000","updated":"2010-10-21T20:51:38.169+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12477893/comment/12923895","id":"12923895","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"sync doesn't cause any additional traffic over the atomic broadcast. it just makes sure that the all of the in-process transactions have be sent to the follower. when that error happens, the error will be sent back to the follower ordered after all of the completed transactions. so rather than being able to see the result of all requests initiated before the sync, the follower will see all requests completed before the sync. that is why i referred to it as a partial sync.\n\ni'm really having problems trying to reproduce this error. can you describe more how it happened? i would like to have an end-to-end test rather than the test of a particular implementation so that this error doesn't pop up if the implementation changes. looking at the code it seems like it should happen everytime the sync request is sent to a follower, but that doesn't seem to be the case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-10-22T16:15:47.699+0000","updated":"2010-10-22T16:15:47.699+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12477893/comment/12924200","id":"12924200","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Let the client connect to the follower.
