I apologize if my wording wasn't clear enough, but the issue that GCC 8 errors on is the fact that buf and addrstr are both size 128, but later on in the call to `sprintf(3)` we write `addrstr + ':' + port` into buf.  GCC 8 sees that buf & addrstr are both potentially 128 characters long, so the `sprintf(3)` could *potentially* overflow buf when it tacks on the colon & port.  Of course, we know that will never happen, but GCC 8 doesn't.  So by resizing the declaration of addrstr we safely avoid any confusion or doubt.\n","created":"2018-07-04T18:12:48.667+0000","updated":"2018-07-04T18:12:48.667+0000","started":"2018-07-04T18:12:48.666+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"119128","issueId":"13169921"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13169921/worklog/119135","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user nkalmar commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/559#discussion_r200190816\n  \n    --- Diff: src/c/src/zookeeper.c ---\n    @@ -4357,7 +4357,7 @@ int zoo_add_auth(zhandle_t *zh,const char* scheme,const char* cert,\n     static const char* format_endpoint_info(const struct sockaddr_storage* ep)\n     {\n         static char buf[128] = { 0 };\n    -    char addrstr[128] = { 0 };\n    +    char addrstr[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN] = { 0 };\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    OK, thanks for clearing that up.
