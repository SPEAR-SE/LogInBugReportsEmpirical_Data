It seems that if I configure an Observer node to be enabled for read-only mode, with syncEnabled = true, it properly syncs its transaction log with the quorum.  However, if I shut down the quorum participants, and the Observer automatically transitions to read-only mode, it does not load the saved transaction log, and thus rejects any client connection with a zxid > 0.  But If I restart the Observer node, it reloads it's persisted transaction log and serves read-only requests at the latest zxid.  Is this the correct behavior? Things run fine if instead of an observer, I do the same with a read-only participant.  In this case, it transitions without issue to a read-only server, and serves the current transaction log.\n\nIt seems to me this issue renders read-only observers completely useless.  What am I missing here?\n\nI'm seeing this with 3.4.8\n\nIt seems this was discovered and reported a long time ago here:\nhttp://grokbase.com/t/zookeeper/user/14c16b1d22/issue-with-zxid-during-observer-failover-to-read-only","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"read-only observer doesn't load transaction log when transitioning to read-only","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbrosenberg%40gmail.com","name":"jbrosenberg@gmail.com","key":"jbrosenberg@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Rosenberg","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbrosenberg%40gmail.com","name":"jbrosenberg@gmail.com","key":"jbrosenberg@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Rosenberg","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2389/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2un47:"}}
