I think the optimization of keeping the db across leader election (except when getting a SNAP or TRUNC) is worth doing, but that can be in a separate JIRA.\n\nQuorumPeer#getLastLoggedZxid is invoked in FLE#lookForLeader to set zxid of the initial vote. To get the zxid, we load the database in getLastLoggedZxid, and my understanding is that it must be loaded because it has been cleared with the shutdown when transitioning from LEADING/FOLLOWING to LOOKING. The change I'm proposing prevents a new leader from loading the database a second time when it starts executing Leader#lead(), more concretely when it calls loadData. \n\nDoes it make more sense now?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-02-12T22:11:26.423+0000","updated":"2013-02-12T22:11:26.423+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12631421/comment/13577294","id":"13577294","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thawan","name":"thawan","key":"thawan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thawan Kooburat","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ah sorry.
