The intention of the original code is to wait for the fd to become writable for a given amount of time, which I think is the right thing to do. This patch will make zookeeper_close() nonblocking; if the fd is not writable, it'll simply return ZOK without actually sending the request. That's not what we want to do.\n\nLet me know if I misunderstood your bug report. Otherwise, I'll close this ticket as invalid.\n\nThanks!\n--Michi","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michim","name":"michim","key":"michim","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michi Mutsuzaki","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-04-25T07:07:29.270+0000","updated":"2012-04-25T07:07:29.270+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12512170/comment/13261355","id":"13261355","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tangxiliu%40corp.netease.com","name":"tangxiliu@corp.netease.com","key":"tangxiliu@corp.netease.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tang Xi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"please do as you wish.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tangxiliu%40corp.netease.com","name":"tangxiliu@corp.netease.com","key":"tangxiliu@corp.netease.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tang Xi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-04-25T07:13:52.143+0000","updated":"2012-04-25T07:13:52.143+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-1110/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i05ynz:"}}
