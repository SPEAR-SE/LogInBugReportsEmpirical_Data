I was earlier thinking about taking a similar approach and making the close call less restrictive so as to work in the case of auth failed too, however going through the documentation a bit i see that auth_failed is considered similar to session expired (both are fatal events) and for session expire we do kill the event thread automatically, hence i went with a similar approach to kill the event thread in case of auth failed too, rather than leaving it to the user (by changing the close method and expecting the event thread to be shutdown when that is called post auth failed).

In zookeeperSaslClient's constructor we call createSaslClient which in case of anything apart from LoginException will swallow the exception and would initialize the saslClient object as null(which would cause initialize to throw sasl exception in the null check). It however looks hard to simulate an exception in the initialization part, since there are static methods involved and stubbing zookeepersaslclient itself doesn't look to be an option.\n","created":"2018-06-22T14:22:33.403+0000","updated":"2018-06-22T14:22:33.403+0000","started":"2018-06-22T14:22:33.402+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"114785","issueId":"13165377"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13165377/worklog/114800","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user anmolnar commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/541\n  \n    Got it.
