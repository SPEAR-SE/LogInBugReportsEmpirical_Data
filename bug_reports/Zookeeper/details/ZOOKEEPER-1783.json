When specifying config files the user doesn't specify the version and we treat this as version = 0. The version is then set to the zxid of the reconfig operations. So suppose that you have an ensemble that never reconfigured before. Its version is 0. And now you start a new server that wants to join, it also has version = 0. We need that new server to adopt the current config from the leader. But since both have version = 0 this doesn't happen. \n\nThe main fix is just a few lines to Leader.java + a new test (to check that now the version of an established ensemble is > 0) and similar change to C tests that were checking for version = 0. Everything else in the patch was needed because now some of the new reconfig-related code (writing dynamic files, potentially restarting leader election) is activated even if we don't invoke reconfig. Also in context that was never tested before like with read-only mode being enabled. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-12T23:56:52.908+0000","updated":"2013-10-12T23:56:52.908+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672660/comment/13793546","id":"13793546","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

This restriction means that in the NEWLEADER message we'd have to send a config with version 0 and then have  follower/observer/learner/leader  make a check (when UPTODATE arrives) that detects version = 0 and replaces it with the version from the NEWLEADER version. It seemed that this would require more changes in more places, this is why I chose to do it like in the patch  -- basically use the fact that lastProposedQV is an uncommitted qv we're sending to everyone, and they already know how to handle it.\n\n\nChanges to QuorumPeer:\n\n1. Replicating the logic we have for restarting leader election to correctly work when read-only mode is enabled. \n\n                             roZkMgr.start();\n+                            reconfigFlagClear();\n+                            if (shuttingDownLE) {\n+                               shuttingDownLE = false;\n+                               startLeaderElection();\n+                            }\n\nThis is just duplicate of what we do for when read-only option is disabled. Without this, restarting leader election doesn't work correctly (it keeps spinning since shuttingDownLE = true. I noticed it because read-only test was failing with my changes to Leader.java. After this changed work, I changed FastLeaderElection not to restart in this case because the quorum verifier is identical besides the version. The change above is still needed though.\n\nThe other two changes are there because I was hitting NullPointerException from different tests that now had to invoke processReconfig (to write dynamic config files with new version) but didn't initialize dynamic config related parameters correctly. These changes are just performing sanity checks before using variables that may be null.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-14T17:44:14.936+0000","updated":"2013-10-14T17:44:14.936+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672660/comment/13794861","id":"13794861","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Added a long comment in Leader.java about why we're doing what we're doing there, removed some tabs, and changed the check \"version > 0\" to \"version == 0x100000000L\" in ReconfigTest.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-15T04:12:09.053+0000","updated":"2013-10-15T04:12:09.053+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672660/comment/13794925","id":"13794925","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
