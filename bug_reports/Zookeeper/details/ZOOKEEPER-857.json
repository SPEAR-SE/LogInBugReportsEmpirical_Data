cluster. if zk tells a client that its session is expired, the ephemerals that correspond to that session will already be cleaned up.\n\n- deletion of an ephemeral file due to loss of client connection will occur\nafter the client gets a connection loss\n\n- deletion of an ephemeral file will precede delivery of a session\nexpiration event to the owner\n</quote>\n\nSo session expirations means two things here : server view(ephemeral clean up) & client view(event delivery) , there are\nno guarantee how long it will take in between, correct?\n\nI guess the confusion rises from the documention which doesn't distinguish these two concepts, e.g. in the javadoc http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.3.1/api/index.html\n\nAn ephemeral node will be removed by the ZooKeeper automatically when the session associated with the creation of the node expires.\n\nIt is actually refering to the server view not the client
