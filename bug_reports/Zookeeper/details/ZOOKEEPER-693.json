More specifically, leader election instances were not being shut down correctly after the first test (testObserver), and it seems that they were interfering with the second test (testSingleObserver).  \n\nThe real issue is that I have been shutting down FLE separately from the QuorumPeer in tests, and QuorumPeerTestBase that ObserverTest is using has no way to access the underlying QuorumPeer instance. \n\nTo solve this problem, I simply added code to QuorumPeer:shutdown so that we make sure that we shutdown all leader election instances. I had to also add a new method to the Election interface, and implement an empty method in LeaderElection.\n\nSince it is ok to call shutdown multiple times, I'll leave the FLE tests untouched for this patch. I have run the tests a few times, and I didn't see any issue. I'll create a jira issue to remove the duplicate calls to shutdown.
