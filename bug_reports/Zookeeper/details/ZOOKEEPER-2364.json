I verified the docs build on both trunk and branch-3.5.  I also tried intentionally introducing a broken link, and the doc build failed as expected, so that proves the change doesn't relax the validation more than we want.  I will commit this later today.\n\nbq. With this patch we should remove releasenotes from the src/docs/... directory\n\nI will do {{svn rm src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/releasenotes.xml}} when I commit to trunk.
