Using them used for other things, like packaging, is fine, but now things are a bit confused. For example the docs say bin/zkServer.sh, not sbin. It's nice that the original docs and file locations matched regardless of checking out the source or using the release tarball. Really bin vs sbin vs libexec is a packaging specific detail (one that may be different depending on the packaging type), one I would not like to enforce on the release artifact. Also, we really need to fix how releases are packaged (I've done this as part of the maven changes). We currently have a single tar release archive which contains both the source and the generated binaries. Really we should have a source artifact and separate binary artifacts (for example the way avro does things), where the binary artifacts could be tar/jars/rpm/deb/etc..","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-26T21:04:33.319+0000","updated":"2011-09-26T21:04:33.319+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523411/comment/13115022","id":"13115022","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Does maven change come as part of 3.4.0 or 3.5.0?
