For project management reason, all the issues and related discussion are moved to ZOOKEEPER-2203. This JIRA is linked to ZOOKEEPER-2098.\n\n==============\n\nThis sequence leads the ensemble to a split-brain state:\n * Start server 1 (config=1:participant, 2:participant, 3:participant)\n * Start server 2 (config=1:participant, 2:participant, 3:participant)\n * 1 and 2 believe 2 is the leader\n * Start server 3 (config=1:observer, 2:observer, 3:participant)\n * 3 believes 3 is the leader, although 1 and 2 still believe 2 is the leader\n\nSuch a split-brain ensemble is very unstable.\nZnodes can be lost easily:\n * Create some znodes on 2\n * Restart 1 and 2\n * 1, 2 and 3 can think 3 is the leader\n * znodes created on 2 are lost, as 1 and 2 sync with 3\n\n\nI consider this behavior as a bug and that ZK should fail gracefully if a participant is listed as an observer in the config.\n\nIn current implementation, ZK cannot detect such an invalid config, as FastLeaderElection.sendNotification() sends notifications to only voting members and hence there is no message from observers(1 and 2) to the new voter (3).\nI think FastLeaderElection.sendNotification() should send notifications to all the members and FastLeaderElection.Messenger.WorkerReceiver.run() should verify acks.\n\nAny thoughts?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"QuorumCnxManager:

For example, if a server receives a configuration from another server (in FastLeaderElection.java) with the same configuration version,  the configuration itself must be identical.  The check should only be for non-initial configs (see ZOOKEEPER-1783), so probably (rqv.getVersion() > 0x100000000 and rqv.getVersion() == curQV.getVersion()). \nIf you still think its a good idea, would you like to propose a patch ?\n\nRegarding the config registry, I didn't have any specific system in mind, perhaps others can advise.
