The new patch should apply cleanly to 3.4.6.\n\nI had chosen ZOO_CONNECTING_STATE because I misunderstood what ZOO_NOTCONNECTED_STATE means. I thought we had used it to replace 0, and that both meant we had not begun connecting. I now think that 0 was used to mean either that we had not begun connecting or that we had closed permanently. So the ZOOKEEPER-800 fix had initially returned invalid state in either case, but I believe as of 3.4.6 it was behaving correctly.
