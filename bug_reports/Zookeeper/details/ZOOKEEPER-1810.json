Also perhaps it would be cleaner to have a config size field before the config field,so that we get rid of the assumption that config must be last in the message, which makes it more difficult to extend.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-07T00:15:46.401+0000","updated":"2013-11-07T00:15:46.401+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12677796/comment/13822531","id":"13822531","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"patch following the suggestions in the thread.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-11-14T15:47:20.910+0000","updated":"2013-11-14T15:47:20.910+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12677796/comment/13822538","id":"13822538","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
