A few things to look at:\n\n1) what client type were you running? (c/java?). How many sessions and what does the environment look like.\n\n2) are the timeouts correlated to a particular server, or any server in the cluster? Perhaps the server that's overloaded in ZOOKEEPER-989 ?\n\n3) review the troubleshooting guide\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Troubleshooting\nIn particular rule out gc/swap (server and client side). Have you tuned the server gc at all? (jvm default is non-incremental)\n\n4) use the 4 letter words to identify what the latency (and total number of znodes - is this increasing?) is on the servers : \nhttp://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkCommands\nzktop is very useful for this https://github.com/phunt/zktop\n\nif the max latency is under your timeout the clients should not be seeing timeouts...\n\n5) use visualvm or similar (jconsole?) to monitor one/more of the servers where clients are seeing timeouts, do you see anything unusual wrt gc/heap/etc...\n\n6) attach logs from a server/client at the time where you see the issues. that will give us more insight.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-02-14T17:04:33.169+0000","updated":"2011-02-14T17:04:33.169+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-990/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i05z2v:"}}
