The triple election test is just not completing. It goes through the first and the second rounds, but after the second leader dies, it doesn't elect the third. It needs some more investigation, I don't think removing the check as you suggest actually fixes it.

Are we still talking about the 3.4 branch or this is about trunk too? Here are a couple of comments:\n\n- On top of making sure that a quorum leaves leader election, we should also check that the leader ends up thinking that it is the leader. It is a simple sanity check and I don't see a reason for removing it if we are not talking about the test failures on Windows.\n- If you're still focusing on the 3.4, then the best path I can see is to apply ZOOKEEPER-1292 to branch 3.4. If it still doesn't work in trunk, as we have observed, then we need to work on a patch on top ZOOKEEPER-1292.
