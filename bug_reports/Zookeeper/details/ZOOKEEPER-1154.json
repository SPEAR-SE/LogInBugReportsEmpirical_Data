When A comes up, it will replay the log with that higher zxid. The change that was in that higher zxid will only be visible to the clients connecting to the participant A, but not to other participants.\n\nI was able to reproduce this problem by\n1. connect debugger to B and C and suspend them, so they don't write anything\n2. Issue an update to the leader A.\n3. After a few seconds, crash all servers (A,B,C)\n4. Start B and C, let the leader election take place\n5. Start A.\n6. You will find that the update done in step 2 is visible on A but not on B,C, hence the inconsistency.\n\nBelow is a more detailed analysis of what is happening in the code.\n\n\nInitial Condition\n1.\tLets say there are three nodes in the ensemble A,B,C with A being the leader\n2.\tThe current epoch is 7. \n3.\tFor simplicity of the example, lets say zxid is a two digit number, with epoch being the first digit.\n4.\tThe zxid is 73\n5.\tAll the nodes have seen the change 73 and have persistently logged it.\n\nStep 1\nRequest with zxid 74 is issued. The leader A writes it to the log but there is a crash of the entire ensemble and B,C never write the change 74 to their log.\n\nStep 3\nB,C restart, A is still down\nB,C form the quorum\nB is the new leader. Lets say  B minCommitLog is 71 and maxCommitLog is 73\nepoch is now 8, zxid is 80\nRequest with zxid 81 is successful. On B, minCommitLog is now 71, maxCommitLog is 81\n\nStep 4\nA starts up. It applies the change in request with zxid 74 to its in-memory data tree\nA contacts B to registerAsFollower and provides 74 as its ZxId\nSince 71<=74<=81, B decides to send A the diff. B will send to A the proposal 81.\n\n\nProblem:\nThe problem with the above sequence is that A's data tree has the update from request 74, which is not correct. Before getting the proposals 81, A should have received a trunc to 73. I don't see that in the code. If the maxCommitLog on B hadn't bumped to 81 but had stayed at 73, that case seems to be fine.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"504h","remainingEstimate":"504h","originalEstimateSeconds":1814400,"remainingEstimateSeconds":1814400},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12492846","id":"12492846","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-1154.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille

My premise was that, if there are any differences, I should \n\na. either be able to attribute it to use of TCP and choosing of server with highest zxid as the leader\nb. or I should be able to find a bug. This is how I identified this bug.\n\nSo my strategy to gaining confidence that the ZK protocol has no bugs, is to review the code (and convince a couple of other folks as well to do the same) and make sure it is equivalent to Paxos modulo above mentioned optimizations :)\n\nWe could make the protocol simpler but it would certainly be less efficient. Snapshots, when you have several GB of data are quite expensive. If we don't even fix it for the case of n=1, it would increase the probability of the snapshot transfers.\n\nI have the fix for the general case (n>1) coded and the test written (as Ben said, the test took longer than the fix itself :))\n\nWhile testing the fix, it looks like I hit another bug in truncate code path. The passed in zxid should be in the truncated log but it isn't. I should be able to send a patch out soon after I have figured that one out.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishal.k","name":"vishal.k","key":"vishal.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kathuria","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-08-17T21:03:21.494+0000","updated":"2011-08-17T21:03:21.494+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518902/comment/13086603","id":"13086603","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Hi Vishal, We've had discussions about Zab not being equivalent to Paxos in the mailing list of ZooKeeper, and we have a paper at DSN 2011 discussing how they differ.\n\nAbout the code, I didn't mean to imply that the bug was there because of poor readability.

I looked online and found the slide deck but couldn't find a link to the pdf. Could you please forward the link to me?\n\nI agree us not testing all the scenarios is a serious problem - it can let regressions slip through and them not getting caught for several years (as it happened with ZOOKEEPER-1156, which has been there in the code for 2 years).\n\nI fully understand your concern around simplicity. When I submit the patch, please let me know what you think. I found a way to do this without maintaining additional state/variables. The idea is that if the follower has a zxid that the leader doesn't have a matching committed proposal for, the leader asks the follower to truncate to the zxid for which the leader does have a committed proposal and starts sending diffs from that.\n\nMy new test is passing with the fix.

After seeing the errors in FollowerResyncConcurrencyTest in the jenkins test report, I suspected that and checked the code too. Since the changes in Learner.java are not necessary for the fix for this problem, I'll remove them from my patch. I need to do further investigation of the issue I suspected there and I will file a separate Jira if I find anything. \n\nWith the new patch (without Learner.java changes), I am not seeing the JVM crashes any more, although I see timeouts still. I'll submit the new patch as soon as I've figured out the  solution to the timeout issue and get a completely clean test run.\n\nThanks!
