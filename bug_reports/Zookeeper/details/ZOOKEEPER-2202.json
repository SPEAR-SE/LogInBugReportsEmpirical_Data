From the logging posted in the JIRA description, the exception thrown is {noformat}java.net.SocketTimeoutException{noformat}, which is a sub class of {noformat}java.io.IOException{noformat}, and connectOne is already catching java.io.IOException so everything should be just fine.\nCross check with the \"Cannot open channel to\" in logging I believe the exception get caught [here|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumCnxManager.java#L455].
