After talking to some folks here that are more networking experts than I am, it appears that the only way to truly fix this bug is to allow the client to initiate the close of the socket, not the server. Because a socket close event (especially in recent Linux kernels) may cause the kernel to give up on sending data even when the server has not finished/received acks, the only way to guarantee that a client has actually received all the data is to wait for the client to close the connection. We can add a timeout in the server to clean up 4lw clients that have not closed their connection, but we cannot rely on all of the data getting to the client without an explicit client close.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-10-03T20:06:51.377+0000","updated":"2011-10-03T20:06:51.377+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523872/comment/13121451","id":"13121451","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Camille, is setting the socket to linger an option here?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2011-10-05T20:38:26.494+0000","updated":"2011-10-05T20:38:26.494+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523872/comment/13121452","id":"13121452","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"socket linger has no effect on this bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-10-05T20:40:06.394+0000","updated":"2011-10-05T20:40:06.394+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523872/comment/13121488","id":"13121488","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Could you elaborate please?

My base setup: trunk zk checkout, Ubuntu 12.04, Oracle Java 6, no fancy zoo.cfg \n1. I wrote a new 4lw, \"long\", that prints 100k '.'s followed by a '!' (so you can see if it's truncated). See long_4lw.patch.\n2. Slow down your localhost connection: sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 1000ms \n(To undo this command: sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root) \n3. Start a zk server with ./bin/zkServer.sh start \n4. Send a long command: echo long | nc localhost 2181 (I've also been using FourLetterWordMain) \nThis should fill your terminal with dots, but shouldn't end with a !.
