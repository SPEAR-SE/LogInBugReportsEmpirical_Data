How I found this bug\nI found this bug using [Earthquake|http://osrg.github.io/earthquake/], our open-source dynamic model checker for real implementations of distributed systems.\n\nEarthquakes permutes C/Java function calls, Ethernet packets, and injected fault events in various orders so as to find implementation-level bugs of the distributed system.\n\nWhen Earthquake finds a bug, Earthquake automatically records [the event history|https://github.com/osrg/earthquake/blob/v0.1/example/zk-found-bug.ether/example-output/3.REPRODUCED/json] and helps the user to analyze which permutation of events triggers the bug.\n\nI analyzed Earthquake's event histories and found that the bug is triggered when an observer receives an UPTODATE *after* receiving a specific kind of FLE packet.\n\nh4. How to reproduce this bug\nYou can also easily reproduce the bug using Earthquake.\nI made a Docker container [osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-2212|https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-2212/] on Docker hub:\n{code}\n    host$ sudo modprobe openvswitch\n    host$ docker run --privileged -t -i

should not be controlling its configuration. The reason why the code processing new configurations in FLE exists is to allow a server to \"catch up\" with the right members of an ensemble. If its already connected to the leader (or leading) this is not necessary. Otherwise, for example in case of a configuration change, a server may get an FLE message with a future config version before the reconfiguration commit arrives, which may be problematic similarly to the scenario here with observers. \n\nSo my current thought is perhaps to do config changes in FLE only if the server itself is LOOKING.\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-06-11T06:21:27.225+0000","updated":"2015-06-11T06:21:27.225+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12836749/comment/14585513","id":"14585513","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=suda","name":"suda","key":"suda","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Akihiro Suda","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"body":"Hi [~shralex], Thank you for the suggestion.\n\nYour suggestion seems exactly right!\nThe attached patch that implements your suggestion seems to resolve the bug.\n\n\nFYI Just in case of other unknown race conditions, I tested this patch with Earthquake for 50 times, and fortunately it looks fine.\n{panel}\nhost$ sudo modprobe openvswitch\nhost$ docker run --privileged -t -i --rm -v $HOME:/mnt/host osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-2212\nguest$ pushd example/zk-found-bug.ether/zk_testbed/zookeeper\nguest$ git am /mnt/host/PATCH.patch\nguest$ popd\nguest$ ./000-prepare.sh\nguest$ (for f in $(seq 1 50);do ./100-run-experiment.sh; done) 2>&1 | tee /tmp/log\nguest$ grep REPRODUCED /tmp/log | wc -l\n0 <--- The bug is resolved\n{panel}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=suda","name":"suda","key":"suda","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Akihiro Suda","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"created":"2015-06-15T06:54:09.162+0000","updated":"2015-06-15T06:54:09.162+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12836749/comment/14585524","id":"14585524","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
