This is something that exists in 3.4 and in fact I remember that such server's votes were actually counted, which was a bug. I just exploited this for the purpose of adding new servers. Non-voting followers, just like followers, waste the leader's bandwidth. \n\nObservers get and send only part of the messages - no voting is going on, they just listen to commits, and when they come they update their in-memory database, from which they serve requests. So if you need 10 servers to withstand client requests, you don't need all of them to be voters - having 5 of them be observers is much more efficient in terms of not wasting the leader's bandwidth.\n\n> Why can't ZK do this for me?\n\nTo do this, we'd need to have observers receive a reconfig request and vote for it, which they never do otherwise.
