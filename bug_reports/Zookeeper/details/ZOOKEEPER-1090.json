So when you take snapshot.x, the file may contain data for x + 1. But I think this is ok (and this is how snpashot currently works) because during restore we will start applying transactions from x + 1. Some of them will fail (e.,g., create/delete) and we will increment only the zxid on failure.\n\n    I have not analyzed this completely yet.

The snapshot has applied lastZxid, which created a child znode. During recovery it will apply lastZxid, which will faill with NodeExists and we will increment the Cversion of the parent (after fix for ZOOKEEPER-1046). So creation of sequential znodes won't be be really sequential. This is probably acceptable, but should be clearly documented. If not, then from this bug, it looks to me that patch ZOOKEEPER-1046 was also not complete. We may need to conditionally update cversion.\n\n I think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots. It will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.I will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well.\n\nThanks.\n\n-Vishal\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-06-09T14:35:20.239+0000","updated":"2011-06-09T14:35:20.239+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12509718/comment/13049626","id":"13049626","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Vishal/Camille,\n Should this be a target for 3.4 release?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-06-15T06:00:35.743+0000","updated":"2011-06-15T06:00:35.743+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12509718/comment/13060177","id":"13060177","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Sorry for the delay.

Just a bit easier for you to write and others to read.\n\nbq. After going through the code again, I think the following hypothetical\nfailure scenario could be a problem: For some reason, modification to\ndata tree fails for transactions x to x-n on one of the peer. The\nlastProcessedZxid will still be set to x. If the peer restores after\nsnapshot, then it will not have transactions x-n to x in its data\ntree. Now, if the modification had failed due to transient errors (say\nout of memory), then we will not apply transactions x-n to x even if\nwe should have. The only other reason we could run into this scenario\n(apart from runtime failures) is if we had a bug in DataTree\nmodification code path. This looks like a rare corner case.\n\nHmm. So if we had a bug in DataTree, we could lose transactions, yes? Well, I think it's fair to say that in general, if we have bugs we might lose data. Probably worth keeping in mind but not losing sleep over at this time.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-07-27T00:33:54.308+0000","updated":"2011-07-27T00:33:54.308+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12509718/comment/13071740","id":"13071740","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"We could run into this if the JVM is running low on memory (runtime execption) while modifying the tree.
