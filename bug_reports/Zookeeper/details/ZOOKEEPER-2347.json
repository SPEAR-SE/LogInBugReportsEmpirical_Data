It looks much better, I have tested and the new test case does hang without the other changes, but there are a few small points I want to raise:\n\n# Do we really need a timeout of 90s? I'd rather have something like 30s or less.\n# Typo in {{LOG.error(\"Exception while waiting to proess req\", e);}}\n# Please add a description of the dependency cycle that we are testing for. For example, in step 7, you could say that we are testing that SyncRequestProcessor#shutdown holds a lock and waits on FinalRequestProcessor to complete a pending operation, which in turn also needs the ZooKeeperServer lock. This is to emphasize where the problem was and make it very clear.\n# Replace {{\"Waiting for FinalReqProcessor to be called\"}} with {{\"Waiting for FinalRequestProcessor to start processing request\"}} and {{\"Waiting for SyncReqProcessor#shutdown to be called\"}} with {{\"Waiting for SyncRequestProcessor to shut down\"}}.\n# There are a couple of exceptions that we catch but do nothing because we rely on the timeout. It is better to simply fail the test case directly if it is a failure rather than rely on a timeout. If you don't like the idea of calling {{fail()}} from an auxiliary class, then we need to at least propagate the exception so that we can catch and fail rather than wait.\n\nI also would feel more comfortable if we get another review here. I'm fairly confident, but given that we've missed this issue before, I'd rather have another +1 before we check in.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-01-05T12:02:13.206+0000","updated":"2016-01-05T12:02:13.206+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12922499/comment/15084965","id":"15084965","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~fpj] for the detailed comments.
