However, the C client has returned immediately after queuing the new auth data to be sent with a ZOK return code.\n\nIf the client then waits for their auth completion function to be called, they can wait forever, as no session event is ever delivered to that completion function.  All other completion functions are notified of session events by free_completions(), which is called by cleanup_bufs() in handle_error() in handle_socket_error_msg().\n\nIn actual fact, what can happen (about 50% of the time, for me) is that the next call by the IO thread to flush_send_queue() calls send() from within send_buffer(), and receives a SIGPIPE signal during this send() call.  Because the ZooKeeper C API is a library, it properly does not catch that signal.  If the user's code is not catching that signal either, they experience an abort caused by an untrapped signal.  If they are ignoring the signal -- which is common in context I'm working in, the Apache httpd server -- then flush_send_queue()'s error return code is EPIPE, which is logged by handle_socket_error_msg(), and all non-auth completion functions are notified of a session event.  However, if the caller is waiting for their auth completion function, they wait forever while the IO thread tries repeatedly to reconnect and is rejected by the server as having an expired session.\n\nSo, first of all, it would be useful to document in the C API portion of the programmer's guide that trapping or ignoring SIGPIPE is important, as this signal may be generated by the C API.\n\nNext, the two attached patches call the auth completion function, if any, in free_completions(), which fixes this problem for me.  The second attached patch includes auth lock/unlock function, as per
