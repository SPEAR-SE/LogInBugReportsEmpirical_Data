Both iterate over hashtable contents (in the latter case using copy_table()).\n\nHowever, from what I can see, the only function (besides the init/destroy functions used when creating a zhandle_t) called from the completion thread is deliverWatchers(), which simply iterates over a \"delivery\" list created from the hashtables by collectWatchers().  The activateWatcher() function contains comments which describe it being called by the completion thread, but in fact it is called by the IO thread in zookeeper_process().\n\nI believe all calls to collectWatchers(), activateWatcher(), and collect_keys() are made by the IO thread in zookeeper_interest(), zookeeper_process(), check_events(), send_set_watches(), and handle_error().  Note that queue_session_event() is aliased as PROCESS_SESSION_EVENT, but appears only in handle_error() and check_events().\n\nAlso note that handle_error() is called only in zookeeper_process() and handle_socket_error_msg(), which is used only by the IO thread, so far as I can see.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12400532","id":"12400532","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-318.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdarroch","name":"cdarroch","key":"cdarroch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Darroch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-02-19T17:44:43.423+0000","size":7065,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12400532/ZOOKEEPER-318.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"33136","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"remove locking in zk_hashtable.c or add locking in collect_keys()","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdarroch","name":"cdarroch","key":"cdarroch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Darroch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdarroch","name":"cdarroch","key":"cdarroch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Darroch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12414990/comment/12674354","id":"12674354","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdarroch","name":"cdarroch","key":"cdarroch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Darroch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The attached patch file removes locking, and also marks a number of functions static as per ZOOKEEPER-317.

A significant part of programming, I believe, is psychology.  A programmer who comes across a package laced with pthread_mutex_lock() statements immediately makes two pretty reasonable assumptions: the code is used in a multi-threaded context, and it's MT-safe.\n\nIn this case, both assumptions are incorrect; the code isn't used in an MT context and if it were to be, collect_keys() appears to be lacking the necessary locks and I suspect it would be MT-unsafe.  There could always be other subtle MT-related bugs which haven't been shaken out too, should one start using it in MT code.\n\nThus my own feeling is that it's better to simplify and remove these locks for a variety of reasons: it makes the code more self-documenting; easier to read, understand, and revise; and marginally faster.\n\nShould the hashtables need to be used in an MT context in the future, the existing code can always be recovered quickly from SVN.  If there's an explanatory note in the SVN log that mentions the collect_keys() issue, all the better; then whoever might need to do this work will be prompted to think that aspect through as well.\n\nThat's just my two cents, of course.  :-)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdarroch","name":"cdarroch","key":"cdarroch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Darroch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-02-26T21:33:27.589+0000","updated":"2009-02-26T21:33:27.589+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12414990/comment/12677592","id":"12677592","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"your 2 cents are well received :) .. \nill just explain where I come from.
