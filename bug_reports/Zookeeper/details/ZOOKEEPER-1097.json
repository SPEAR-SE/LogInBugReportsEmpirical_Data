You've reformatted one 'quota exceded' log message, but not the other. Would be good to be consistent. \n\n3. Should isQuotaSet be a public API? If so, it should have Javadoc. Either way, it's confusing for a method called is* to not return a boolean. Consider renaming it to, dunno, getMaxPrefixWithQuota ?\n\n4. The 'return null' else-clause of the if statement in isQuotaSet should be inside a { } pair, for consistency with the if clause. \n\n5. Just checking - the stop / start / stop / start  at the end of testQuota needs to have two rounds of restarts to be a correct test?\n\n6. Generally better to use assertEquals rather than assertTrue when you are comparing values, it can help debuggers give better information about the test failure and makes it easier to write correct tests.

In general, if you're making a method public for testing only, it's worth commenting on that. Guava has a nice @VisibleForTesting annotation that makes that explicit, but we don't depend on that right now.  (It's weird that our tests are in different packages to the classes they test...)\n\n* FWIW, I really did mean assertEquals, for the lines where you have things like:\n\nAssert.assertTrue(\"count is set\", qst.getCount() == 2);\n\n* Also turns out the messages in those asserts are inverted - they get shown when the assertion fails, so you'll see \"Assertion failed: count is set\" which is the precise opposite of what's gone wrong :) \n\n* ...aaaand while we're here, the indentation for the stopServer / startServer block seems to be tabs rather than spaces.
