Yeah, I guess it should be getView instead of getVotingView, or something similar. It is possible, however, that the sid is not there so the following code should deal with the case that electionAddr is null, perhaps by calling connectOne(sid) instead of connectOne(sid, electionAddr), but I'm not completely sure.\n\nYou may also want to look at ZK-1633. CnxManagerTest.java is where to look for test examples for this one.\n\nThere seems to be a related bug - observers may not be declared in the view and have a special id (although if they fall within this \"if\" like you describe they have positive id so they should be in getView).  See the code below the one you quote in how it deals with special ObserverId = -1. \n\nIt would be great if you can fix and test the bug you identified, dealing also with the case that electionAddr may be end up being null if the id is not in the view. I can then fix the remaining issue of special ObserverId.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-10T23:56:01.539+0000","updated":"2013-10-10T23:56:01.539+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12673328/comment/13841730","id":"13841730","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sebb%40apache.org","name":"sebb@apache.org","key":"sebb@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sebb","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"body":"Revert unwarranted change by 3rd party","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sebb%40apache.org","name":"sebb@apache.org","key":"sebb@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sebb","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"created":"2013-12-06T21:28:32.278+0000","updated":"2013-12-06T21:28:32.278+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12673328/comment/13968848","id":"13968848","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~rgs], can you please take this one ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-14T21:11:50.670+0000","updated":"2014-04-14T21:11:50.670+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12673328/comment/14067400","id":"14067400","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Added a test and verified that it fails without the fix.\n\nAlthough this should resolve the current JIRA I still don't know whether or not there is a problem with anonymous observers that connect with id  OBSERVER_ID = Long.MAX_VALUE.
