My use case is a bit strange (as explained before on this list) in that I try to grow the cluster dynamically by having an external program automatically restart Zookeeper servers in a controlled way whenever the list of participating ZK servers needs to change.  This used to work just fine in 3.3.3 (and before), so this represents a regression.\n\nThe scenario I see is this:\n\n1) Start up a 1-server ZK cluster (the server has ZK ID 0).\n2) A client connects to the server, and makes a bunch of znodes, in particular a znode called \"/membership\".\n3) Shut down the cluster.\n4) Bring up a 2-server ZK cluster, including the original server 0 with its existing data, and a new server with ZK ID 1.\n5) Node 0 has the highest zxid and is elected leader.\n6) A client connecting to server 1 tries to \"get /membership\" and gets back a -101 error code (no such znode).\n7) The same client then tries to \"create /membership\" and gets back a -110 error code (znode already exists).\n8) Clients connecting to server 0 can successfully \"get /membership\".\n\nI will attach a tarball with debug logs for both servers, annotating where steps #1 and #4 happen.  You can see that the election involves a proposal for zxid 110 from server 0, but immediately following the election server 1 has these lines:\n\n2011-12-05 17:18:48,308 9299 [QuorumPeer[myid=1]/127.0.0.1:2901] WARN org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Learner  - Got zxid 0x100000001 expected 0x1\n2011-12-05 17:18:48,313 9304 [SyncThread:1] INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.persistence.FileTxnLog  - Creating new log file: log.100000001\n\nPerhaps that's not relevant, but it struck me as odd.  At the end of server 1's log you can see a repeated cycle of getData->create->getData as the client tries to make sense of the inconsistent responses.\n\nThe other piece of information is that if I try to use the on-disk directories for either of the servers to start a new one-node ZK cluster, all the data are accessible.\n\nI haven't tried writing a program outside of my application to reproduce this, but I can do it very easily with some of my app's tests if anyone needs more information.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12506212","id":"12506212","filename":"logs.tgz","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=strib","name":"strib","key":"strib","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy

About the double occurrence of NEWLEADER, it happens because we insert NEWLEADER in outstandingRequests in Leader.lead() and queue a NEWLEADER message in LearnerHandler.run(). When we execute LearnerHandler.startForwarding() from LearnerHandler.run(), we queue the packets in outstandingRequests, including NEWLEADER. \n\nIt is not necessary to send it again in startForwarding(), but we do need it in outstandingRequests to collect acks. Since we have to add it to outstandingRequests, one simple way to avoid it is by performing a check like this in startForwarding:\n\n{noformat}\n                if(outstandingProposals.get(zxid).packet.getType() != NEWLEADER){\n                    handler.queuePacket(outstandingProposals.get(zxid).packet);\n                }\n\n{noformat}\n\nI have verified that by including this check, I can remove the double occurrence of NEWLEADER in Pat's patch and the test passes.

Flavio is right above that if we skip the adding of NEWLEADER in start forwarding we are good.
