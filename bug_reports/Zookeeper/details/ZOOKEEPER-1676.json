However,\ndigging into the code, I see that the client is making a non-blocking connect\ncall\nhttps://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c#L1596-1613\n,  and returning ZOK\nhttps://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c#L1684\n\nIf we assume that the server is not up, this will mean that the subsequent\nselect() call would return 0, since the fd is not ready, and future calls to\nzookeeper_interest will always return 0 and not the expected ZCONNECTIONLOSS.\nThus an upstream client will never be aware that the connection is lost.\n\nI don't think this is the expected behavior. I have temporarily patched the zk\nC client such that zookeeper_interest will return ZCONNECTIONLOSS if it's still\nunable to connect after session_timeout has been exceeded. \n\nI have included a patch for the client which fixes this for release 3.4.3 6b35e96 in this branch: https://github.com/yunong/zookeeper/tree/release-3.4.3-patched Here's the patch https://gist.github.com/yunong/efe869a0345867d54adf\n\nFor more information, please see this email thread. http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-dev/201211.mbox/%3C11A8E7C3-4DDE-45D8-ABEC-A8A4D32CF647@gmail.com%3E","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"320435","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"C client zookeeper_interest returning ZOK on Connection Loss","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yunong","name":"yunong","key":"yunong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yunong Xiao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yunong","name":"yunong","key":"yunong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yunong Xiao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"All","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639625/comment/13637482","id":"13637482","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michim","name":"michim","key":"michim","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michi Mutsuzaki","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Yunong,\n\nThank you for the patch.

What do you think?\n\nBtw, I used this code to test the behavior of the single-thread C client:\n\nhttps://github.com/fpj/zookeeper-book-example/blob/master/src/main/c/master.c  ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-05-22T13:55:11.851+0000","updated":"2016-05-22T13:55:11.851+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639625/comment/15295626","id":"15295626","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"body":"Link to documentation JIRA sub-task.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2016-05-22T16:45:51.105+0000","updated":"2016-05-22T16:45:51.105+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639625/comment/15295629","id":"15295629","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"body":"[~fpj] I think we can resolve this.
