Long story short, every time a child node is added or deleted by the writer, the reader's watcher is supposed to trigger so the reader can check if it's time to get to work or go back to bed. Bad things seem to happen while the reader is waiting on the watcher and the writer adds or deletes a node.\n\nIn versions prior to 3.3.2, my code that sets a watcher on the children of a node using the perl binding would either lock up when trying to retrieve the children or would segfault when a child node was added while waiting on the watch. In 3.3.2, it seems to just do the locking up.\n\nI'm seeing this: assertion botched (free()ed/realloc()ed-away memory was overwritten?): !(MallocCfg[MallocCfg_filldead] && MallocCfg[Mall\nocCfg_fillcheck]) || !cmp_pat_4bytes((unsigned char*)(p + 1), (((1 << ((bucket) >> 0)) + ((bucket >= 15 * 1) ? 4096 : 0)) -
