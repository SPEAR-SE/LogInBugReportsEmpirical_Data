The client sees the below sort of error messages:\n\n{noformat}\nException while trying to create SASL client: java.lang.NullPointerException\nSASL authentication with Zookeeper Quorum member failed: javax.security.sasl.SaslException: saslClient failed to initialize properly: it's null.\nError while calling watcher\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.ZooKeeperWatcher.connectionEvent(ZooKeeperWatcher.java:581)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.ZooKeeperWatcher.process(ZooKeeperWatcher.java:532)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.PendingWatcher.process(PendingWatcher.java:40)\n        at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$EventThread.processEvent(ClientCnxn.java:579)\n        at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$EventThread.run(ClientCnxn.java:554)\n{noformat}\n\nThe line at {{ZooKeeperWatcher.connectionEvent(ZooKeeperWatcher.java:581)}} points to the middle line below, where {{event.getState()}} is {{null}}:\n\n{noformat}\nprivate void connectionEvent(WatchedEvent event) {\n    switch(event.getState()) {\n       case SyncConnected:\n{noformat}\n\nHowever, the event's state is {{null}} because of a couple of other bugs, particularly an NPE that gets a mention in the log without a stacktrace. This first NPE causes an incorrect initialization of the event and results in the second NPE with the stacktrace.\n\nThe reason for the first NPE comes from this code in {{ZookeeperSaslClient}}:\n\n{noformat}\n            if (!initializedLogin) {\n                ...\n            }\n            Subject subject = login.getSubject();\n{noformat}\n\nBefore the patch for ZOOKEEPER-2139, both the {{login}} and {{initializedLogin}} were {{static}} fields of {{ZookeeperSaslClient}}. To support multiple ZK clients, the {{login}} field was changed from {{static}} to instance field, however the {{initializedLogin}} field was left as {{static}} field. Because of this, the subsequent attempts to connect to ZK think that the login doesn't need to be done and go ahead and blindly use the {{login}} variable which causes the NPE.\n\nAt the core, the fix is simply to change {{initializedLogin}} to instance variable, but we have made a few additional changes to improve the logging and handle state. I will attach a patch soon.
