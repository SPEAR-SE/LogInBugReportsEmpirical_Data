be a better connection between connect timeout, ping timeout, and session timeout. On the Java client it is sessionTimeout/hostsList.length. On the C client it's just the readTimeout. There is also an arbitrary delay when we find that all the hosts are down.\n\nWe should come up with a good consistent story for the connect timeout. Since we leave sessionTimeout/3 ms for recovery from a down server, it seems most reasonable to have something like sessionTimeout/(3*hostsList.length).","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"33262","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Connect timeouts not calculated properly","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-14/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0621j:"}}
