As it is a new leader election, we increment the logical clock of this peer, and according to the current implementation, this peer won't accept any vote from a peer with a lower LE turn (corresponds to the value of the logical clock of the voting peer). The attached patch corrects this problem by allowing a peer to go back to a previous epoch in the case a majority votes for a leader, and the peer also receives a vote from the leader. This feature allows a peer to correct a false suspicion of the current leader;\n\n2- If a peer  advances to a new turn before others, then it may end up voting for a peer that either does not have the highest server id or the the highest zxid. The attached patch fixes this problem by resetting the vote a peer when it updates its logical clock upon receiving a notification with a higher turn value.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12391538","id":"12391538","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-159.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio
