The snapshot is 3.4 GB on disk.  Because of its massive size we have been running into a number of issues. There are lots of problems that we hope to fix with tuning GC etc, but the big one right now that is blocking us making a lot of progress on the rest of them is that when we lose a quorum because the leader left, for what ever reason, it can take well over 5 mins for a new quorum to be established.  So we cannot tune the leader without risking downtime.\n\nWe traced down where the time was being spent and found that each server was clearing the database so it would be read back in again before leader election even started.  Then as part of the sync phase each server will write out a snapshot to checkpoint the progress it made as part of the sync.\n\nI will be putting up a patch shortly with some proposed changes in it.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Large databases take a long time to regain a quorum","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13038156/comment/15839860","id":"15839860","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"GitHub user revans2 opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/157\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2678: Discovery and Sync can take a very long time on large DB\n\n    This patch addresses recovery time when a leader is lost on a large DB.  \n    \n    It does this by not clearing the DB before leader election begins, and by avoiding taking a snapshot as part of the SYNC phase, specifically for a DIFF sync. It does this by buffering the proposals and commits just like the code currently does for proposals/commits sent after the NEWLEADER and before the UPTODATE messages. \n    \n    If a SNAP is sent we cannot avoid writing out the full snapshot because there is no other way to make sure the disk DB is in sync with what is in memory.  So any edits to the edit log before a background snapshot happened could possibly be applied on top of an incorrect snapshot.\n    \n    This same optimization should work for TRUNC too, but I opted not to do it for TRUNC because TRUNC is rare and TRUNC by its very nature already forces the DB to be reread after the edit logs are modified.  So it would still not be fast.\n    \n    In practice this makes it so instead of taking 5+ mins for the cluster to recover from losing a leader it now takes about 3 seconds.\n    \n    I am happy to port this to 3.5. if it looks good.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/revans2/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2678\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/157.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #157\n    \n----\ncommit 5aa25620e0189b28d7040305272be2fda28126fb\nAuthor: Robert (Bobby) Evans <evans@yahoo-inc.com>\nDate:   2017-01-19T19:50:32Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2678: Discovery and Sync can take a very long time on large DBs\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-01-26T15:26:04.826+0000","updated":"2017-01-26T15:26:04.826+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13038156/comment/15844164","id":"15844164","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user fpj commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/157#discussion_r98336253\n  \n    --- Diff: src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Learner.java ---\n    @@ -364,10 +367,12 @@ else if (qp.getType() == Leader.SNAP) {\n                 \n                 long lastQueued = 0;\n     \n    -            // in V1.0 we take a snapshot when we get the NEWLEADER message, but in pre V1.0\n    +            // in Zab V1.0 (ZK 3.4+) we might take a snapshot when we get the NEWLEADER message, but in pre V1.0\n                 // we take the snapshot at the UPDATE, since V1.0 also gets the UPDATE (after the NEWLEADER)\n                 // we need to make sure that we don't take the snapshot twice.\n    -            boolean snapshotTaken = false;\n    +            boolean isPreZAB1_0 = true;\n    +            //If we are not going to take the snapshot be sure the edits are not applied in memory\n    +            boolean writeToEditLog = !snapshotNeeded;\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    The changes here are using `edit` to refer to `txns`.
