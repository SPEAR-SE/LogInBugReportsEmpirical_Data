Let's keep it in if you think it is important. \n\nWhat is a problem, and I agree not worth fixing here, is that this is yet another example of class members not being hidden behind getters / setters that maintain correct invariants. Anyone can set listener to null, because it's a non-final public member, so every read of that variable in code that mustn't crash has to defensively check that it's not null, when we should be relying on the class to do this for us. \n\nAnyhow, this looks ok to me - +1, happy to commit.

I'm comfortable leaving this as a known issue in branch 3.3, since I think it crops up only in a uncommon scenario, and has a workaround.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=henryr","name":"henryr","key":"henryr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henry Robinson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-02T22:29:53.019+0000","updated":"2012-08-02T22:29:53.019+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599561/comment/13427988","id":"13427988","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1635 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1635/])\n    ZOOKEEPER-1514.
