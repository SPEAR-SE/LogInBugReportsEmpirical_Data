In this patch, I have fixed this problem, and also returned to what we had previously. With this current patch, when a peer joins and there is already a leader elected, the joining peer will only recognize the new leader as the leader once it receives a confirmation from a majority. The alternative is to set the leader once we receive a message from a peer claiming to be the leader (what we have on trunk now, although broken because we don't set the state of the peer), but there could be cases in which a peer believes to be leader, although it is not the leader any longer, and the joining peer would select this false leader to be its leader. Eventually, the false leader would timeout, and both processes would select the correct leader. This small fix gets rid of such problems, though.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12391482","id":"12391482","filename":"dead-follower.tar.gz","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stuhood","name":"stuhood","key":"stuhood","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stuhood&avatarId=10049"},"displayName":"Stu
