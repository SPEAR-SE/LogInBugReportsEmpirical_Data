Here's what I notice in branch-3.3:\n\n* {{Leader.java:240}} - the initial read timeout is set to {{syncLimit}} ticks, but the first thing we wait for is an ACK from the follower saying that it has got up-to-date, which should be subject to {{initLimit}}\n* I also saw that in {{Learner.java:220}}, the connection should be established with {{initLimit}} as the connection timeout (this is not fixed in branch-3.4). However, because there's a retry loop, there's no guarantee that we will connect in less than initLimit or syncLimit. So {{initLimit}} is not a hard limit at all; but it isn't already for other reasons. \n\nIn branch-3.4:\n\n* {{LearnerHandler.java:336}} sets the initial timeout to {{initLimit}}, but never sets it back again after the ACK.
