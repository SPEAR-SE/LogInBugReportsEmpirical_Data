Because we are terrible people, we embed Zookeeper into a JVM running a bunch of other code.  One server in a three-node cluster used up all of its memory (due to non-ZK code).  The JVM did not crash, it just stayed up, still listening on its Zookeeper ports.  The server kept sitting there spawning new threads to handle incoming connections, but it never closed those connections.  Incoming client connections (from C clients running elsewhere) timed out, and so they would try to re-connect to other servers -- that's fine.  The problem, from what I could tell, was that incoming server connections just seemed to freeze.  The two remaining Zookeeper servers in the cluster were unable to make any progress because they were trying to connect to the third server who never responded to them.  So even though there were two servers that were perfectly fine, they became stuck too and could never form a new majority, and so all of Zookeeper was down until we manually restarted the server that had run out of memory.\n\nClearly, there are things we need to do in our architecture to avoid this problem, but I was hoping to apply a quick fix to ZK in the meantime to help out -- the most important thing would be to properly close the connection if you're not able to service it.  It's also possible the problem I describe above actually isn't in ClientCnxn.java, but some other server connection file (NIOServerCnxn?)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=strib","name":"strib","key":"strib","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy Stribling","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-03-21T23:29:46.543+0000","updated":"2012-03-21T23:29:46.543+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12539729/comment/13235271","id":"13235271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"A server ran out of memory?

If interested, I attached an example called ThreadTest.java to ACCUMULO-1708 that shows an experiment trying to use a thread group.\n\nIf zookeeper client side threads always rethrew Errors, then this would ideal for my purposes.   Zookeeper code could still try to take some action in catch.   I suppose this might look like the following.\n\n\n{code:java}\ntry{\n    //...\n} catch (Throwable e)\n{\n   try{\n     //..\n     cleanup();\n     if(state.isAlive()){\n        eventThread.queueEvent(\n        new WatchedEvent(Event.EventType.None, Event.KeeperState.Disconnected, null) )\n     }\n     //....\n   }catch (Throwable e) {\n     //failure while trying to process failure\n     e.printStackTrace();\n   }finally{\n      throw e;\n   }\n}\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kturner","name":"kturner","key":"kturner","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Keith Turner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-09-12T22:36:03.639+0000","updated":"2013-09-12T22:36:03.639+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12539729/comment/13765979","id":"13765979","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kturner","name":"kturner","key":"kturner","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Keith Turner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"The finally in the java code in my prev comment should probably be the following.
