Then, theoretically A1 and A2 \nboth should receive 2 events about the child change of service B and C.\nHowever, the real result is, A1 received the 2 children changes of service B and C separately, A2 only received the children change of service B. Moreover, A2 got the children change of service B many many times when service B only changed once at that time (I add auto re-registration so A2 can receive the event more than once).\n\nTill now, it only happened once.
