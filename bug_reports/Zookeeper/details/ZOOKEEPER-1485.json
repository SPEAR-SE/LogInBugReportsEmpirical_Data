If he's right, and the only purpose of the C client xid is to to track equality of operations submitted to the server and the responses that come back, then it seems like the simplest, and most correct thing to do here is the following:\n\n1. In get_xid(), we should initialize xid to 0 rather than time(0). Starting at zero instead of the time since the epoch ensures we have as much runway as possible before we wrap.\n\n2. As Martin suggests, Inside get_xid, if we overflow INT32_MAX, then simply set it back to 0. I don't think there's any risk of collisions here since that gives us as the maximum amount of digits before wrapping.

In that jira, we want to avoid a duplicate execution of, e.g., when creating sequential znodes. I believe we will need to use the xid there as well to find the response for the request. The one problem I see is that a client that takes a really long time to reconnect might end up seeing a different response for its request if multiple requests can have the same xid. This is highly unlikely given that in practice it should take some time to wraparound and we might be able to play with zxids and such. I'd need to think again about that jira, though.\n\nI'm also thinking that closing the session might be a better alternative to avoid the wraparound issue altogether.

The client would be forced to create a new session (new ZK object) in order to communicate with the service.

I can see two potential fixes for the overall problem.\n\na) Expire the session upon receiving a negative XID. Modify the C client to make the XID a member of the zhandle struct to more closely mirror the Java client. Initialize the new XID struct member in zookeeper_init_internal.\n\nb) Modify both clients to wrap the XID around as described above.\n\nThese aren't mutually exclusive either, but I think only one should be needed. Option (a) would ensure XID uniqueness for all requests made by a single connection (not currently done because XIDs will be reused when they wrap all the way around to the starting value).

I was a bit hesitant to replace the atomic operation at first, but I'm not sure it's actually an issue. The locking happens once per client request, the lock is held for a very short period of time, and each request already performs other locking on the ZK handle (enter_critical(), lock_buffer_list()). The one difference here might be that this is a global lock not tied to a particular zhandle, which could cause performance issues with multiple threads making requests with different zhandles.\n\nI don't think you can correctly implement this using a plain CAS and atomic add. Any way you combine those operations, I think there's a chance the CAS won't trigger on the value you're checking against. Did you have a specific implementation in mind?

I was having another look at ZOOKEEPER-22, which is something I'd really like to see implemented eventually and I'm concerned that this approach of allowing the same xid to appear twice in a session could create problems. Not repeating xid values for a given session sounds like a cleaner abstraction compared to wrapping around like this.\n\nWhat if we fix by not making the xid static in the C client and getting a new handle?\n\nAlso, it is important that we added test cases specially when there is a change of behavior. Even if the change is trivial, we want to be able to test that future changes won't break it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-07-01T21:09:29.647+0000","updated":"2016-07-01T21:09:29.647+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12560384/comment/15365326","id":"15365326","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"body":"bq. I'm concerned that this approach of allowing the same xid to appear twice in a session could create problems.\nAnother potential problem I am thinking is if we allow repeatable xids then we would not easily figure out the system state (as we don't record how many times the id has been wrapped so far) from server logs which I am not sure is a real problem but a little bit concerning to me. I think the design of not allowing repeatable xid is better from the perspective of making the system behavior explicit and easier to understand.\n\nbq. What if we fix by not making the xid static in the C client and getting a new handle?\nI think this should work - I don't see a reason why xid can't be made as a member of zk handle in C as in Java client. So whenever overflow happens, we simply close the session on server side. Client has to then handle the session close, more work on client but sounds reasonable as client has to deal with session close event anyway.\n\nAlternatively, we could add another counter in client code that records how many times a wrap happen. This effectively make the real xid (xid + INT_MAX * counter) not repeatable on client side. The counter could be sneaked into the OpCode field (as we don't use all the bits so far) of the request header so the times to wrap has a paper trail on server side as well.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2016-07-06T23:21:02.782+0000","updated":"2016-07-06T23:21:02.782+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12560384/comment/15367709","id":"15367709","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"bq.
