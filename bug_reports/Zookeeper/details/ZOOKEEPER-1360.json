While I'll investigate whether the patch is 1294 is ultimately to blame, reading the test brought to light a number of issues that appear to be bugs or in need of improvement:\n\n* As part of QuorumTest, an ensemble is already established by the fixture setup code, but apparently unused by the test which uses QuorumUtil. \n* The test reads QuorumPeer.leader and QuorumPeer.follower without synchronization, which means that writes to those fields may not be published when we come to read them. \n* The return value of sem.tryAcquire is never checked.\n* The progress of the test is based on ad-hoc timings (25 * 500ms sleeps) and inscrutable numbers of iterations through the main loop (e.g. the semaphore blocking the final asserts is released only after the 20000th of 50000 callbacks)\n* The test as a whole takes ~30s to run\n\nThe first three are easy to fix (as part of fixing the second, I intend to hide all members of QuorumPeer behind getters and setters), the fourth and fifth need a slightly deeper understanding of what the test is trying to achieve.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"32596","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"QuorumTest.testNoLogBeforeLeaderEstablishment
