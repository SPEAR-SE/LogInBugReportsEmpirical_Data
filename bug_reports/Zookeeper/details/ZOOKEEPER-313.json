Run some transactions and then stop all clients. Make sure no other clients connect for the duration of the test.\n\nLet L1 be the current leader. Bring down L1. Let L2 be the leader chosen.  Let the third node be N3. Note that this will increase the txn id for N3's snapshot without any  transaction being logged. Now bring up L1 -- same will happen for L1. Now bring down L2.\n\nBoth N3 and L1 now have snapshots with a transaction id greater than the last logged transaction. Whoever is elected leader will try to restore its state from the filesystem and fail.\n\nOne easy workaround is obviously to change the FileTxnSnapLog not to save a snapshot if zxid > last logged zxid.
