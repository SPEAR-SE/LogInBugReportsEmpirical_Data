After a little debug, I find out that the build is broken because the zookeeper.jute.h and zookeeper.jute.c are not completely generated. \n\n* The culprit is the code change introduced in ZOOKEEPER-2628, where we wraps {code}JRecord.genCCode{code} with a try / catch / finally block and the file writers were prematurely closed in finally block which prevents remaining of the zookeeper.jute.h/c file being generated. \n\n* The fix to {code}JRecord.genCCode{code} in ZOOKEEPER-2628 was made because a find bug warning was directly associated with the code. Due to the subtlety of the file writer ownership, we did not capture the issue during code review. \n\n* The build break was not captured in pre-commit builds as well ([an example|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-github-pr-build/72//console]), where we get all tests passed including C client tests. I suspect we might have another bug with cached generated files that should be regenerated but we don't - need more investigation on this one.\n\n* The fix is simple by revert the change to this specific method. Findbug does not complain anymore because the previous warning that appertain to this code block was fixed at the call site of {code}JRecord.genCCode{code}. So by reverting the change we still have zero find bug warnings.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Fix C build break.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13023262/comment/15694257","id":"15694257","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"GitHub user hanm opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/115\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2636: Fix C client build break.\n\n    JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2636\n    \n    Fix build break by reverting the changes made to JRecord.genCCode in ZOOKEEPER-2686, which prematurely closed the file writers that prevents zookeeper.jute.h and zookeeper.jute.c files from complete generation.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/hanm/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2636\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/115.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #115\n    \n----\ncommit 8b2df1dca353946cd265c217e4010d3f080943ba\nAuthor: Michael Han <hanm@cloudera.com>\nDate:   2016-11-24T21:32:16Z\n\n    Fix C client build break caused by ZOOKEEPER-2628.\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-11-24T21:36:45.465+0000","updated":"2016-11-24T21:36:45.465+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13023262/comment/15694288","id":"15694288","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
