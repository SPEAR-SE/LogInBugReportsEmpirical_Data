Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hello [~arshad.mohammad].\n\nAs you noted, a system property will override the default value in the log4j.properties file.  If you're launching ZooKeeper through its scripts (zkServer.sh/zkCli.sh), then libExec/zkEnv.sh will set the {{ZOO_LOG4J_PROP}} to {{INFO}} level:\n\n{code}\n    ZOO_LOG4J_PROP=\"INFO,CONSOLE\"\n{code}\n\nBecause of that, editing the value in log4j.properties directly won't change the logging level.  Instead, we can control it by changing the {{ZOO_LOG4J_PROP}} environment variable, either by setting it in your environment before launching the script or by editing libexec/zkEnv.sh.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in addition to the loggers, there are separate properties controlling thresholds on the appenders too.  I see from the description that you want {{DEBUG}} level, but the default thresholds are {{INFO}}:\n\n{code}\nzookeeper.console.threshold=INFO\nzookeeper.log.threshold=INFO\nlog4j.appender.CONSOLE.Threshold=${zookeeper.console.threshold}\nlog4j.appender.ROLLINGFILE.Threshold=${zookeeper.log.threshold}\n{code}\n\nThese settings don't map directly to their own environment variables like {{ZOO_LOG4J_PROP}}.  Instead, you can use {{SERVER_JVMFLAGS}} and {{CLIENT_JVMFLAGS}} to override them.\n\nPutting all of that together, you can get {{DEBUG}} logging on both the server and client side by making the following changes in libexec/zkEnv.sh:\n\n{code}\nif [ \"x${ZOO_LOG4J_PROP}\" = \"x\" ]\nthen\n    ZOO_LOG4J_PROP=\"DEBUG,CONSOLE\"\nfi\n{code}\n\n{code}\n# default heap for zookeeper server\nZK_SERVER_HEAP=\"${ZK_SERVER_HEAP:-1000}\"\nexport SERVER_JVMFLAGS=\"-Xmx${ZK_SERVER_HEAP}m -Dzookeeper.console.threshold=DEBUG $SERVER_JVMFLAGS\"\n\n# default heap for zookeeper client\nZK_CLIENT_HEAP=\"${ZK_CLIENT_HEAP:-256}\"\nexport CLIENT_JVMFLAGS=\"-Xmx${ZK_CLIENT_HEAP}m -Dzookeeper.console.threshold=DEBUG $CLIENT_JVMFLAGS\"\n{code}\n\nAlternatively, you can set these environment variables before launching the scripts, or you could write a completely different log4j.properties file if you prefer a different setup that doesn't rely on these environment variables.\n\nI just tested this on a fresh trunk distro build, and it worked.  ZOOKEEPER-980 originally introduced these settings, inspired by similar scripts in Hadoop.  It appears this is all working by design, so I'm going to resolve the issue as Not a Problem.  If you still think there is a bug, please feel free to reopen it and add more details in the comments.\n\nThanks!\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-26T18:30:04.049+0000","updated":"2015-04-26T18:30:04.049+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12822285/comment/14513840","id":"14513840","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"body":"Thanks [~cnauroth] for looking into the issue.\nIt is good that we have option for customizing the logging behaviour through various ways.\n\nBut I think that default behaviour should come from log4j.properties because this is the place where any user by default will go for changing the log.\nIf ZOO_LOG4J_PROP values is not set then{color:red} we should not set any default value{color}, which is being set in zkEnv.sh, also we should not pass as system property.\nSame thing should be done for other such variables like ZOO_LOG_DIR","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"created":"2015-04-27T09:56:18.906+0000","updated":"2015-04-27T09:56:18.906+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12822285/comment/14514522","id":"14514522","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thank you, Arshad.  I know existing deployments are dependent on the current setup with these environment variables and system properties, so I'm inclined to leave it mostly intact.  However, I also think needing to set 2 separate properties to achieve debug logging is a bit cumbersome.\n\nMaybe one thing we could safely do here is to set the thresholding to {{ALL}}.  (Patch attached.)  With that in place, you could set just {{ZOO_LOG4J_PROP}} to achieve debug logging.  ZOOKEEPER-980 states that the goal was consistency with Hadoop's logging configuration, and Hadoop sets thresholding to {{ALL}}.\n\nThis could still be seen as a backwards-incompatible change if admins were dependent on the existing thresholding.  Maybe this change still can go into trunk though.  I'm not familiar with ZooKeeper's versioning and compatibility guidelines, so I'll need to defer to established contributors to make that call.\n\nBTW, if your goal is just to get the debug logging on with a small simple log4j.properties change, then maybe the simplest thing is just to change the root logger setting completely so that it bypasses the environment variables and system properties:\n\n{code}\n#log4j.rootLogger=${zookeeper.root.logger}\nlog4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, CONSOLE\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-27T17:46:35.300+0000","updated":"2015-04-27T17:46:35.300+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12822285/comment/14514692","id":"14514692","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
