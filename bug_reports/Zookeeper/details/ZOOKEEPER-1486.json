Actually, the leave() function tries to delete a nonexistent node => a KeeperException is thrown, which is caught silently => the process terminates without waiting for the barrier. \n\n2) It seems that the very idea of leaving the barrier by deleting ephemeral nodes is problematic. Consider the following scenario: there are two clients: C1 and C2. \n - C1 enters the barrier, creates a znode /b1/C1, checks that it's alone and starts waiting for the second client to come. \n - C2 enters the barrier and creates a znode /b1/C2 - the notification to C1 is sent but still not delivered.\n - C2 observes that there are enough children to /b1, enters the barrier, executes its own operations and invokes leave() procedure.\n - during the leave() procedure C2 removes its znode /b1/C2 and exits.\n - when the notification about C2's arrival finally arrives to C1, C1 checks the children of /b1 and doesn't find C2's znode: C1 is stuck. \nThe solution to this data race would be to create special znodes for leaving the barrier, similarly to the way they are created for entering the barrier. \n\nThanks,\nDima","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"12761","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"A couple of bugs in the tutorial code","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dimap","name":"dimap","key":"dimap","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dmitri Perelman","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dimap","name":"dimap","key":"dimap","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dmitri Perelman","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12560401/comment/13419625","id":"13419625","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The problem above appears in the barrier java example (http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperTutorial.html#sc_barriers).\nThe pseudocode (http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/recipes.html#sc_recipes_eventHandles) \ncreates a special \"ready\" node to deal with the issue, but this doesn't appear in the java example for some reason.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-20T22:11:33.041+0000","updated":"2012-07-20T22:11:33.041+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-1486/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i02ji7:"}}
