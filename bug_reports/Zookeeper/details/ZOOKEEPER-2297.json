There are two points that are bothering me here:\n\n# If we are to change configuration, even when the branch is not yet stable like 3.5, we need to bring the issue up on the user list to collect feedback. We can't expect users to be aware of discussions in jiras like this one and it affects them.\n# I don't like the configuration change. We could use the secure client port parameter to determine whether the user is trying to configure secure communication or even create a boolean parameter to make it more explicit, like having {{zookeeper.client.secure}} on the server side as well. The bottom line is that I'd rather infer from a configuration parameter that the user is trying to make it secure rather than force the user to set such a cumbersome variable.\n\nAlso, this is focusing on SSL, but this change affects SASL as well, yes?\n\nMy suggestion is to work on those points and for the second, to produce a new patch that fixes the configuration.

If we are to change configuration, even when the branch is not yet stable like 3.5, we need to bring the issue up on the user list to collect feedback.

As part of this we will add this to the {{Server}} configurations.\nFollowing quotes taken from ZooKeeper SSL User Guide page.\n{code}\nTo configure the ZooKeeper server to use the custom provider for authentication, choose a scheme name and set the property zookeeper.authProvider.[scheme] to the fully-qualified class name of the custom implementation.
