If we allow that extension to be used at all in the C code then we risk breaking compatibility. Because on Linux you could do the assignments out of order from the proper order for the structure. This would happily compile on Linux but fail on Windows.\n\nThe use of the STRUCT_INITIALIZER macro is only going to mask that problem rather than enforcing stricter code wherein the order of the fields in the assignment must match the order of the fields in the structure.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=marshall","name":"marshall","key":"marshall","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marshall McMullen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2012-11-30T05:02:56.150+0000","updated":"2012-11-30T05:02:56.150+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617900/comment/13507102","id":"13507102","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michim","name":"michim","key":"michim","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michi Mutsuzaki","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1\n\nThanks for the patch, Marshall.
