Does anything happen between 22:04:39 and 22:05:20? Session expiration requires consensus over the quorum so to perform a session expiration operation, a proposal has to be sent out by leader to the quorum and wait until leader receives ACKs from a quorum of servers. If during this process leader election happens, then client might be able to renew the session at the same (or a different server), which is what the client log shows here.\n\nFor the available server log posted here, in particular:\n* {{ org.apache.zookeeper.server.PrepRequestProcessor\tProcessed session termination for sessionid }} does not mean session is expired. It only implies that the request passed one of the processor stage.\n* Similarly, {{ org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.CommitProcessor\tProcessing request:: sessionid:0x25cd1e82c110001 type:closeSession }} does not mean session close is performed. At this stage the commit processor only queued the closing request which will be processed later once the leader receives enough ACKs from a quorum. So if leader dies, then this will not be committed.\n\nIt should be easy to find hard evidence regarding whether or not the session close transaction was finally committed by quorum or not. When DEBUG is enabled, there should be lots of information related to what proposals got committed in different servers. That is also the reason I was asking if the server log is completed or not.\n\nIt will be a bug however if we find out that the close session was committed across quorum yet client was still able to renew the session.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2017-08-05T23:27:26.972+0000","updated":"2017-08-05T23:27:26.972+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13092638/comment/16116361","id":"16116361","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maoling","name":"maoling","key":"maoling","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maoling&avatarId=32024","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maoling&avatarId=32024","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maoling&avatarId=32024","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maoling&avatarId=32024"},"displayName":"maoling","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"These session expiration logs don't exactly represent this session(isClosing is true) has been removed\nmore logs,client and server configuration,ZK's usage scenarios for your kafka cluster would make sure this problem further   \nFor this possible incompleted logs, let's me tell this story:\n  22:05:18.590 the clinet did a request(may be a transaction request) that was sent to the leader,but a leader has broken down(LE happened) between 22:04:39 and 22:05:20, so client had not heard from server in 4485ms \n  22:05:19.326 the clinet reconnected to server who was a follower,activated this session(renew with the same sessionId) and this session moved from leader to one follower\nHaha,I'm kidding seriously!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maoling","name":"maoling","key":"maoling","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maoling&avatarId=32024","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maoling&avatarId=32024","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maoling&avatarId=32024","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maoling&avatarId=32024"},"displayName":"maoling","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-08-07T09:57:12.395+0000","updated":"2017-08-07T09:57:12.395+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13092638/comment/16117570","id":"16117570","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=junrao","name":"junrao","key":"junrao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jun Rao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~hanm], thanks for the reply.

So the session expiring proposal never went through quorum thus the session 25cd1e82c110001 was not expired. A more convincing proof regarding the results of session expiration would be to search all the log for something like \"Committing request:: sessionid:0x25cd1e82c110001\" - if we have a hit then that means the session expiring request reached a consensus and got committed. \n\nRegarding the follow up question, if the session was not expired, then it is possible at least in one case that we will see the \"logging in ZK server about deleting an ephemeral in that session.\". That case is when a server receives session expiration request, it persists the session close request locally to tnx log file, and then got cut off from rest of quorum. When this server restarts, it will load its data tree from persistent log files, then replay session close request which leads to delete ephemerals. Later when this server joins the quorum its state will be synced with leader, which does not have the close session transaction (otherwise the session would be expired already at quorum level), so leader will tell this server to truncate its log by dropping the session close request, and the server will do so by truncate and reloading logs, which eventually bring its data tree on par with rest of quorum.

That Kafka broker went down around Aug 2, 23:16:11. The expectation is that its ZK session will be closed and the registered ephemeral node will be removed.\n\nThe expectation will be correct if this Kafka broker really died. But if it was a transient interruption, i.e. network issues between that Kafka broker and ZooKeeper, then the session will be renewed and ephemeral nodes appertain to that session will be intact. From the original log posted, the session {{0x25cd1e82c110001}} was renewed (though the timestamp of the log does not match {{Aug 2, 23:16:11}} so probably we are not talking about same event. In any case, do we have any evidence that indicates the broker in question really died?\n\nbq. the following entry doesn't necessarily mean that the ephemeral node is actually removed since it could be restored.\n\nCorrect, I think this log does not imply the final quorum state W.R.T. the ephemeral nodes, because the logging here was done before a consensus regarding the ephemeral removal proposal was reached. When a server thinks a client is dead and initiates the session closing, it will start removing the ephemerals from its data tree while waiting for the votes of the ephemeral removal proposal, so the ephemeral nodes removal here does not have transactional semantic because it does not consider the proposal results.\n\nbq. Is there any logging indicating the restore?\n\nWhen log level is set to DEBUG, {{FinalRequestPrecessor}} will log all requests it processes, including the ephemeral nodes recreate (which is just normal ephemeral node create since it has no notion of a state). You can probably search {{type:create}} in logs.\n\nThe restore will only happen when a server restarts, or rejoin quorum, and finds out it has out dated state with rest of quorum. Otherwise, the ephemeral nodes will either be removed already at quorum level, or not removed at all (on this specific server) :). In both cases (restarts/rejoin quorum), the server will recover the expected state from rest of quorum by replaying transactions logs.
