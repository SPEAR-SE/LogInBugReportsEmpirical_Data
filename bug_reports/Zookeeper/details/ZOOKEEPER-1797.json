It aims to find bugs in distributed system related to hardware faults and non-determinism.\nFor more information please refer to the github.\nhttps://github.com/osrg/earthquake\n\nAs a result, znode loss could be reproduced successfully. I'd like to share the test case with zookeeper community because it is useful for checking degrading which can be caused during development.\nThe test case can be found in the below branch of our zookeeper repository:\nhttps://github.com/osrg/zookeeper/tree/zookeeper-1797\n\nUseful information for using the test case and reproducing the bug can be found in the below file:\nhttps://github.com/osrg/zookeeper/tree/zookeeper-1797/earthquake/zookeeper-1797/README.txt\n\nBecause of immaturity of earthquake, the test code isn't user friendly. But the test case itself is useful and earthquake can be used for testing zookeeper and find other bugs potentially, so I'd like to hear your comments.\n\nRegards,\nFukuda\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Yasuhito+Fukuda","name":"Yasuhito Fukuda","key":"yasuhito fukuda","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yasuhito Fukuda","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"created":"2015-04-14T08:14:25.541+0000","updated":"2015-04-14T08:14:25.541+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674567/comment/14493766","id":"14493766","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Yasuhito+Fukuda","name":"Yasuhito Fukuda","key":"yasuhito fukuda","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yasuhito Fukuda","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"body":"In addition, You can try earthquake in just one-line command, too: `docker run -i -t --rm osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-1797`\n\n{noformat}\n# docker run -i -t --rm osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-1797\n[INFO] Reproducing ZOOKEEPER-1797 (PurgeTxnLog may delete data logs during roll)\n[INFO] Cleaning..\n[INFO] Starting earthquake (ca91befb0556bddbf8229ef9b6650ec94cf79471)\n[INFO] Starting ZooKeeper  (4d08af6da87eac3b565d599b0d24683e2e734827)\n[INFO] Starting createZnode.sh (see /createZnode.log)\n[INFO] Restarting ZooKeeper\n[INFO] Checking Znodes (see /validateZnode.log)\n[INFO] Done\nUnexpected exception when visiting znode!: error_count=5\n[IMPORTANT] SUCCESS: earthquake reproduced the bug.\n[INFO] For more information, please refer to https://github.com/osrg/earthquake and https://github.com/osrg/zookeeper/blob/zookeeper-1797/earthquake/zookeeper-1797/README.txt\n[INFO] Exiting..\n[INFO] If you want to drop to shell after the test, please run `docker run -i -t osrg/earthquake-zookeeper-1797 /bin/bash`, then run `/init.py` in the container.\n{noformat}\n\n\nRegards,\nFukuda","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Yasuhito+Fukuda","name":"Yasuhito Fukuda","key":"yasuhito fukuda","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yasuhito Fukuda","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"created":"2015-04-14T08:15:44.628+0000","updated":"2015-04-14T08:15:44.628+0000"}],"maxResults":18,"total":18,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-1797/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1p2an:"}}
