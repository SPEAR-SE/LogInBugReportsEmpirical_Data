The result is uninitialized data in auth->auth.buff in free_auth_info(), and potential crashes.\n\nThe attached patch adds a test which attempts to duplicate this error; it works for me but may not always on all systems as it depends on the uninitialized data being non-zero; there's not really a simple way I can see to trigger this in the current test framework.
