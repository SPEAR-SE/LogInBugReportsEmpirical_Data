`Follower.processPacket` processes `Leader.PING` message\r\n # Leader is network partitioned\r\n # `Learner.ping` makes attempt to write to the leader socket\r\n # If write socket buffer is full (due to other ping/sync calls) `Learner.ping` blocks\r\n # As leader is partitioned - `Learner.ping` blocks forever due to lack of write timeout\r\n # `QuorumPeer` is the only thread reading from the leader socket, effectively meaning that the whole server is stuck and can't recover without manual process restart.\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\nThread dump from the affected server is in
