I had committed it to trunk, but we reverted because of a conflict with a much larger patch, which was about to get in (ZOOKEEPER-107). My suggestion is that you have a look at what has been done in ZOOKEEPER-1324 and confirm that it is the same issue. If it is, we should close this jira as duplicate. Also, please feel free to comment to ZOOKEEPER-1324, feedback is always appreciated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-04-22T12:16:26.027+0000","updated":"2013-04-22T12:17:04.256+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12643906/comment/13637975","id":"13637975","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
