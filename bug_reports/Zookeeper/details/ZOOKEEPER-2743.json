When closing a Netty connection, depend on timing the connection bean registered when the connection was provisioned might not get unregistered, leading to leaked Java beans. \n\nThe race happens at the time when the client is in the process of finalizing the session. As part of session finalization, a connection bean will be registered [1]. But right before the registering bean, the connection might gets closed, in cases for example the server that the client is connecting to is shutdown. As part of connection close, the bean will be un-registered, as expected [2], however the problem is when we execute at [2], the connection bean might not finish registering at [1], so the unregister of bean is a NOP. What's worse, as part of connection close, we remove this connection from connection factory [3], so future connection close call will get short circuited and directly return; in other words the bean unregister code in connection close call will only get executed once. Depends on luck, the bean might not get unregistered, as previously illustrated.\n\n\n[1] https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/ZooKeeperServer.java#L700\n[2] https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NettyServerCnxn.java#L114\n[3] \nhttps://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NettyServerCnxn.java#L96","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Netty connection leaks JMX connection bean upon connection close in certain race conditions.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13060932/comment/15952406","id":"15952406","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"GitHub user hanm opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/211\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2743: Netty connection leaks JMX connection bean.\n\n    See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2743 for details on the symptom and diagnostic.\n    \n    There are many ways of fixing this. For example we can enforce certain ordering of the close operations to eliminate the race condition however that would incur non trivial performance penalty as a result of synchronization. I think the solution in this patch is simple and effective as it observes that the bean unregister call is idempotent and the call itself is trivial so we just always unregister connection upon close the connection, to ensure the bean is unregistered regardless of the races.\n    \n    I've also stress tested this solution on internal Jenkins which indicates no failures of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2707 for the past two days.\n    \n    A side note is NIO connection in theory would suffer the same problem however I am unable to reproduce the same racing with existing unit test. So I just leave NIO as it is, for now.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/hanm/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2743\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/211.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #211\n    \n----\ncommit 7dd916c4c7c8d4e0e83cb5780175058a5626de19\nAuthor: Michael Han <hanm@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-04-01T20:37:48Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2743: Netty connection leaks JMX connection bean upon connection close in certain race conditions.\n    Always unregister connection upon close to prevent connection bean leak under certain race conditions.\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-04-01T20:59:28.039+0000","updated":"2017-04-01T20:59:28.039+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13060932/comment/15952424","id":"15952424","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
