You trade having disconnect on ZooKeeper with making ClientCnxn public, which also pollutes the public API. Perhaps ZooKeeperStub should go into src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/ZooKeeperStub. That way you get package visibility for ClientCnxn, but you still keep ZooKeeperStub out of the main tree.\n\nBoth are just nits, and I support committing the change if you don't want to fix
