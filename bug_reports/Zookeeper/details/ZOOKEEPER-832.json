Connect to a standalone server using the Java client.\n2.) Stop the server.\n3.) Delete the contents of the data directory (i.e. the persisted session data).\n4.) Start the server.\n\nThe client now automatically tries to reconnect but the server refuses the connection because the session id is invalid. The client and server are now in an infinite loop of attempted and rejected connections. While this situation represents a catastrophic failure and the current behavior is not incorrect, it appears that there is no way to detect this situation on the client and therefore no way to recover.\n\nThe suggested improvement is to send an event to the default watcher indicating that the current state is \"session invalid\", similar to how the \"session expired\" state is handled.\n\nServer log output (repeats indefinitely):\n2010-08-05 11:48:08,283 - INFO  [NIOServerCxn.Factory:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181:NIOServerCnxn$Factory@250] - Accepted socket connection from

Otherwise just sync and continue.\n- First question: Could the sync be solved by issuing a sync from the follower to the leader?\n- Second question: Is there a reliable way to detect the very sick situation always? Because there might be one possibility if we use the check in ZOOKEEPER-1777.\n- Then we have to take the decision of what to do if the really sick situation is detected. Session information should be reset. The client should be informed somehow. And the general contract of how ZooKeeper works has been broken, so depending on how ZooKeeper is used in some systems it may even make sense to halt the system and report a fatal failure, and others will be happy with a warning and keep working (which would be my case).\n\nNot easy to solve at all.

It keeps the current behaviour for learners and closes the connection for leader, standalone and read-only servers. The test case is also very simple. The patch applies to both trunk and branch 3.4.\nIn my opinion this is clearly a bug fix, specially when we put read-only mode into the picture, which was not there when we issue was created. The steps to reproduce would be these:\n- A server goes to read-only mode and it hasn't had the time to receive the last transaction from a client.\n- The client connects to that server.\n- There is an full-speed endless loop of connection retries (filling up the logs, and using CPU and network resources).\nI hope that it can be considered for 3.4.6.

Closing the session means that the application will receive a CONNECTION LOST event, and that means that it can not make any assumptions about the state of the server when it connects again. That sounds right.\nThe strictest solution possible would be to send a new error code to the client, and forward this new error condition to the application through the API, so that the client takes whatever action is required in this case (assuming there is any extra action to take in this case). But for a case that occurs only in extraordinary situations, impacting the protocol and the API seems overkill to me.\nSo I actually still think that the patch contains the best option that I can think of.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-11-13T15:52:33.210+0000","updated":"2013-11-13T15:52:33.210+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470931/comment/13823483","id":"13823483","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"There are 10 people watching this issue, surely there must be opinions.\nI am sure e.g. [~randgalt] must be able to tell if this is ok from the client point of view or not.\nPlease, speak up.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-11-15T08:44:31.301+0000","updated":"2013-11-15T08:44:31.301+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470931/comment/13823502","id":"13823502","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"bq. still I think that closing the session is a better behaviour than the infinite loop\n\nI'm not arguing whether it is better or worse.

Perhaps other issues can be addressed in follow up? Unquestionably the continuous and perpetual client retries is a bug, they will never succeed, and a fleet of clients in such state can impact network services.\n\nIf we otherwise recreate application znode state in the reinitialized cluster, why should applications be prevented from riding over a loss of transient ZK state, if the use case supports it? For example if the ZK client would error out with a session expired status under these conditions, HBase would create a new ZooKeeper client object, attempt a reconnect using it, and might succeed.

In the proposed patch (if I remember correctly) the client tries to connect to a different server of the cluster until it either succeeds or finds the leader (or stand-alone server). If it finds the leader and there zxid is still higher it just restarts the connection. With an stand-alone server it will just immediately reconnect and end the loop of connection retries.\nThe caveat is that something very wrong has happened (e.g. server lost all its data) and the client should be notified of this problem an not just reset the connection and continue. But on the other hand, every time that a client reconnects this client cannot make any assumptions at all about what might have happened with the data in that interval, so in my view this shouldn't be that bad. In any case it is better than an endless loop (again in my opinion).\nI think this is a good enough solution for now. If this issue is considered a blocker, I would propose to go for that. If there are any positive comments on that line, I will update the patch.\nI tried to introduce a more elaborated solution back then, but I believe this would need for me to provide a better explanation of why it would be good to follow that path.\nRegards to all,\n/German ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-05-27T04:10:32.290+0000","updated":"2015-05-27T04:10:32.290+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470931/comment/14560394","id":"14560394","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Actually there seems to be no need to update anything.\nThe patch still works for trunk, branch-3.5 and branch 3.4.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-05-27T04:39:02.659+0000","updated":"2015-05-27T04:39:02.659+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470931/comment/14560408","id":"14560408","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hmm, given this introduces some risk (i.e.: in a catastrophic failure scenario we'd be expiring sessions, which would allow them to reconnect, which might mean they'll see invalid data) should this new behavior be opt-in/gated by a property?\n\nAnother way to handle would be a purely client-side solution (not sure if this was already proposed, haven't checked all the backlog) like Kazoo does it: https://github.com/python-zk/kazoo/blob/master/kazoo/client.py#L129.

There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the C code. It seems this is a synchronization issue. The thread that listens for connections starts before the ZkDatabase is loaded, so it reads a low zxid and kills the session. This was not noticeable before, because the client looped until the zxid in the server was high enough and then connected. I think that the cleanest thing is to put a Latch and wait for the ZkDatabase to load before accepting connections.\nI will update the patch with this fix (the Latch to wait for the ZkDatabase to load) on top of the previous patch and that should pass the tests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-05-28T21:23:32.221+0000","updated":"2015-05-28T21:23:32.221+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470931/comment/14564189","id":"14564189","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hdeng","name":"hdeng","key":"hdeng","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hongchao Deng","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I mean expire the session on client side.

I could see few gaps like, say there are three servers A,B,C. C is Leader. Assume I've a client which has connectionstring only to A(For example zkcli.sh shell). Again the client will indefinitely retry, right. IMHO we could do few improvements to handle this situation. Can we modify the algorithm like,\n #* case-1) If connected server is 'standlone', then add error log and close session\n #* case-2) Else the connected server is 'leader', then add error log and close session\n #* case-3) Else the connected server is 'follower/observer', then forward the request to the Leader to reopen the session. Invoke Leader.REVALIDATE with lastZxidSeen {{getLearner().validateSession(cnxn, sessionId, sessionTimeout, lastZxidSeen);}}. On the other side , [LearnerHandler.java#L553|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/LearnerHandler.java#L553] can do the validation logic and close the session.\n{code}\n                    if (qp.getZxid() > leader.zk.getLastProcessedZxid()) {\n                        leader.zk.closeSession(id);\n                        valid = false;\n                        //  add error logs\n                    } else{\n{code}\n# Please add test case to see the behavior in quorum.\n# Please remove unused imports from the test class.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-07-27T12:22:56.986+0000","updated":"2015-07-27T12:22:56.986+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470931/comment/14708509","id":"14708509","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~rakeshr]: would you have some cycles to wrap this up given that Germán won't be working on it?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-23T19:56:20.433+0000","updated":"2015-08-23T19:56:20.433+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470931/comment/14708814","id":"14708814","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"OK, will take this ahead.
