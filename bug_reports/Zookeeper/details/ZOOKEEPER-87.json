Otherwise, since ping handling seems to be done in a different thread, a follower could be locked at some point that has to do with the transaction but reply to pings and it would not be accepting any proposals.

A limit on the number of pending proposals could still allow for a follower to be behind in terms of time.\n- It seems to map the behavior described already for syncLimit: \"Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to sync with ZooKeeper.

The implementation is a class that has 4 methods:\n- start() : Invoked from LearnerHandler thread.\n- updateProposal() : Invoked from the thread that sends packets. If process has started, and there is no proposal, it starts monitoring that proposal. If there is a proposal already, it updates the \"next proposal\" to monitor.\n- updateAck() : Invoked from the thread that receives packets. If the ACK corresponds to the current proposal, then it removes the current proposal and if there is a \"next proposal\" it starts using that one.\n- check() : Invoked from the Leader thread. It returns true if everything is ok, false if there is a timeout.\n\nIt has the following states:\n- NOT_STARTED: It doesn't do anything. Check will always return true. It can only transition to WAITING_FOR_PROPOSAL.\n- WAITING_FOR_PROPOSAL: It expects a new proposal. Check will always return true. As soon as one proposal arrives it will start monitoring it and transition to MONITORING_PROPOSAL. \n- MONITORING_PROPOSAL: It waits for the ACK of the proposal under monitoring. Check will return true unless there is a timeout for the current proposal. It continuously update the \"next proposal\" with incoming proposals. If the ACK for the current proposal arrives, it will either update the proposal with the \"next proposal\" or transition to WAITING_FOR_PROPOSAL if there is no \"next proposal\".\n\nThe monitoring is started when the synchronization phase ends (and the timeout in the socket is updated to syncLimit*tickTime). The processing required in each of the calls to the four functions is minimal, so there should be no disturbance of performance at all. \nSince proposals are executed in order, with this checking the longest time between a proposal and its ACK will be if there is a proposal that comes immediately after the one that is being monitored, and its ACK arrives immediately before the ACK for the \"next proposal\" after that. That would mean (2 * syncLimit) * tickTime, and then since we check the timeout every 1/2 tickTime, that needs to be added so it is (2'5 * syncLimit) * tickTime. In usual operation, ACKs will take more or less the same for every proposal and the timeout will jump more or less as soon as any of the ACKs takes longer than (syncLimit * tickTime).\n\nOr at least that is how I intend it to work :-).\n\n... and I don't mind to turn this upside down for anything else that covers the requirement, so I hope that we won't have a problem in converging on a patch ... we'll see.\n\nSorry about deleting the patches. It made me unconfortable to leave there something that didn't work. But I will keep in mind that way of working from now on.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-09-23T06:43:25.509+0000","updated":"2013-09-23T06:43:25.509+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12400857/comment/13774386","id":"13774386","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germán Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"I made (at least) two mistakes above:\n- If there are no proposals (idle ZooKeeper), then this thing is not idle (\"doing nothing\" as in NOT_STARTED) it is in WAITING_FOR_PROPOSAL, returning always true for check and ready to be updated with a new proposal.\n- \"since we check the timeout every 1/2 tickTime\", means half a ticktime needs to be added, not half a \"syncLimit * tickTime\".
