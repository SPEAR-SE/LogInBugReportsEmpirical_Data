In general, I'd try to avoid using nc for that reason -- it is difficult to do it in a portable way.\n\nIt would be really nice to come up with a POSIX compliant way of opening TCP socket from inside a script. Unfortunately, my browsing through the Opengroup spec didn't unearth much. As it stands, I'd say that we've got the following options:\n  1. As Bill pointed out we can use bash, since the script requires bash already\n  2. GNU awk also has support for opening a TCP connection\n  3. ZK itself\n\nPersonally, I'd vote for including a very simple wrapper class into a ZK jar that would do what is expected to query a server. That also would take care of the less than ideal hack that is there to get clientPort data from the config.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rvs","name":"rvs","key":"rvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rvs&avatarId=13930","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rvs&avatarId=13930","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rvs&avatarId=13930","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rvs&avatarId=13930"},"displayName":"Roman Shaposhnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-12-23T00:47:04.700+0000","updated":"2011-12-23T00:47:04.700+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12509714/comment/13175212","id":"13175212","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'd hate to re-implement something so basic.\n\nBtw, when we do fix this we shouldn't be using \"stat\", rather we should use \"srvr\" (saves d/ling all the connections - srvr is a summary, stat contains details on all the connections)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-12-23T01:05:03.613+0000","updated":"2011-12-23T01:05:03.613+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12509714/comment/13175218","id":"13175218","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rvs","name":"rvs","key":"rvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rvs&avatarId=13930","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rvs&avatarId=13930","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rvs&avatarId=13930","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rvs&avatarId=13930"},"displayName":"Roman Shaposhnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"After additional investigation it turns out that '-q' is a Ubuntu specific patch on top of netcat-openbsd: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/netcat-openbsd/netcat-openbsd_1.89-3ubuntu2.diff.gz\n\nIt seems to be dealing with the situation where the channel is half-closed (by the client) and the server still performs\na write (q corresponds to a qflag):\n\n{noformat}\n    else if (pfd[1].revents & POLLHUP) {\n    shutdown_wr:\n        /* if the user asked to exit on EOF, do it */\n        if (qflag == 0) { \n                 shutdown(nfd, SHUT_WR);\n                 close(wfd);\n                 exit(0);\n        }       \n        /* if user asked to die after a while, arrange for it */\n        if (qflag > 0) {\n                 signal(SIGALRM, quit);\n                 alarm(qflag);\n        }       \n        pfd[1].fd = -1;\n        pfd[1].events = 0;\n    }       \n{noformat}\n\nThat matches line #235 in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/zookeeper/trunk/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/test/ClientBase.java?view=markup\n\nIf my analysis is correct, then the only way to really fix this problem is to provide a Java wrapper inside of ZK itself.
