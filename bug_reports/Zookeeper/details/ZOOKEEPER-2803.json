The interrupt may be triggered by the repeated starting and shutting down of quorum peers in {{testWorkerThreads}}. Branch 3.5 uses {{FileDescriptor#sync}} which is not interruptible and does not appear to have the same problem.-\n\n-I was able to find another JIRA ticket describing a similar issue here:' https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4963-\n\n-There is also interesting discussion in ZOOKEEPER-1835 (where the change was made for 3.5) although these discussions appear to be Windows centric (we noticed the issue on Linux)-https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1835\n\n-The failure appears to have popped up on \"ZOOKEEPER-2297 PreCommit Build #3241\" but jenkins cleared out the logs (I only still have the test report from the mailing list).-\n\n-In addition, {{testWorkerThreads}} appears to be failing every few months on Solaris on Apache Jenkins (for 3.4 ZooKeeper_branch34_solaris - Build # 1430  and 3.5 ZooKeeper_branch35_solaris - Build # 387), but at the time I wrote this Jenkins had cleaned out the logs from the latest failed run so I have no way of determining if the cause is the same.-","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Flaky
