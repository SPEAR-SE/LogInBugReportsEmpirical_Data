Flavio, are you OK with that too?\n\nI'm leaving some additional notes here too in case it's useful for anyone in the future.  The latest patch got me curious about what exactly was going on here.  I adapted this to a code snippet that iterates through all interfaces and addresses and prints whether they are considered loopback.  Here is a Scala REPL session for that on the Mac:\n\n{code}\ndef printAddresses() = {\n  val ifaces = java.net.NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces\n  while (ifaces.hasMoreElements) {\n    val iface = ifaces.nextElement\n    val addrs = iface.getInetAddresses\n    while (addrs.hasMoreElements) {\n      val addr = addrs.nextElement\n      printf(\"iface=[%s], iface.isLoopback=[%s], addr=[%s], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[%s]%n\",\n          iface, iface.isLoopback, addr, addr.isLoopbackAddress)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nscala> printAddresses\nprintAddresses\niface=[name:awdl0 (awdl0)], iface.isLoopback=[false], addr=[/fe80:0:0:0:e836:36ff:fe8f:2795%6], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:vboxnet0 (vboxnet0)], iface.isLoopback=[false], addr=[/192.168.56.1], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:en0 (en0)], iface.isLoopback=[false], addr=[/fe80:0:0:0:3e15:c2ff:fed1:8136%4], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:en0 (en0)], iface.isLoopback=[false], addr=[/10.22.2.86], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:lo0 (lo0)], iface.isLoopback=[true], addr=[/fe80:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%1], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:lo0 (lo0)], iface.isLoopback=[true], addr=[/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[true]\niface=[name:lo0 (lo0)], iface.isLoopback=[true], addr=[/127.0.0.1], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[true]\n{code}\n\nNotice that for /fe80:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%1, the interface is considered loopback, but the address is not considered loopback.  That seems wrong.  I assume it has something to do with the JDK bugs linked above.\n\nThis is different from my CentOS VM, where all addresses associated with the loopback interface are also considered loopback:\n\n{code}\nscala> printAddresses\niface=[name:enp0s8 (enp0s8)], iface.isLoopback=[false], addr=[/fe80:0:0:0:a00:27ff:fe06:287a%enp0s8], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:enp0s8 (enp0s8)], iface.isLoopback=[false], addr=[/192.168.56.105], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:enp0s3 (enp0s3)], iface.isLoopback=[false], addr=[/fe80:0:0:0:a00:27ff:fea9:db31%enp0s3], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:enp0s3 (enp0s3)], iface.isLoopback=[false], addr=[/10.0.2.15], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[false]\niface=[name:lo (lo)], iface.isLoopback=[true], addr=[/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%lo], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[true]\niface=[name:lo (lo)], iface.isLoopback=[true], addr=[/127.0.0.1], addr.isLoopbackAddress=[true]\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-07-27T21:09:55.539+0000","updated":"2016-07-27T21:09:55.539+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12529020/comment/15396590","id":"15396590","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Yeah, it is good for me, +1.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-07-27T22:57:45.865+0000","updated":"2016-07-27T22:57:45.865+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12529020/comment/15399626","id":"15399626","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"body":"Pre-commit build https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/3309/console failed with error message \"ZOOKEEPER-ZOOKEEPER-1256 is not \"Patch Available\".
