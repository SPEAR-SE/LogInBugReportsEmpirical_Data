ZOK, ZOK\n2. ZOK, ZNODEEXISTS,\n3. ZNODEEXISTS, ZRUNTIMEINCONSISTENCY,\n\nWhen I added more debug log. The cause is that PrepRequestProcessor rollback outstandingChanges of the second multi-op incorrectly causing sequential node name generation to be incorrect. Below is the sequential node name generated by PrepRequestProcessor\n\n1. create /a-0001\n2. create /a-0003\n3. create /a-0001\n\nThe bug is getPendingChanges() method. In failed to copied ChangeRecord for the parent node (\"/\").  So rollbackPendingChanges() cannot restore the right previous change record of the parent node when aborting the second multi-op\n\nThe impact of this bug is that sequential node creation on the same parent node may fail until the previous one is committed. I am not sure if there is other implication or not.
