The observer don't need to wait for a request to be persisted on disk before applying to the db right?\n\nCorrect, but the test tries to make sure that the change has been persisted to disk, which contradicts the fact that persistent is not strictly necessary. I think the goal of the test case was to test functionality rather than checking that it is strictly enforce. I was thinking of having some way to have SyncRequestProcessor indicate that a request has gone through, but I thought that the approach I proposed in the patch was simpler.\n\nbq. Currently, the test is failing because of timing issue but this shouldn't affect the correctness of the system.\n\nAgreed, but we shouldn't have a release with tests failing. We need to either fix the test or the code base.\n\nbq.  So we just add some delay in the test or some mechanism to make sure that request get flushed before we do the verify step instead.\n\nIn general, I don't like the idea of adding delays. They are difficult to calibrate and prone to false positives.\n\n bq. So we don't have to pay for the cost of extra latency on running system.\n\nI'm not convinced that the performance penalty would be that bad. If the system is not saturated, then the latency is under control and it should be a few milliseconds.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-10-21T09:45:56.972+0000","updated":"2013-10-21T09:45:56.972+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674681/comment/13801321","id":"13801321","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thawan","name":"thawan","key":"thawan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thawan Kooburat","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"If you are ok with approach that fixing just the test itself (may be checking with the sync processor that all request is flushed) I will come up with a diff. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thawan","name":"thawan","key":"thawan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thawan Kooburat","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-21T23:41:56.721+0000","updated":"2013-10-21T23:41:56.721+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674681/comment/13801706","id":"13801706","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"It'd be great if you could generate a fix for the test, [~thawan].

So the zkdb that we loaded after shutting down the observer never have txn that its znodes to \"data2\".   I also modified the test to leave the data files around and try to load it manually after the test fail.
