[~hanm] I don't understand why need to protect the entire state of QuorumPeer. I looked through the code. In my view, the QuorumPeer contains two important state,  QV and FLE. The FLE will be restarted when the QV changed whatever the server state is, namely  reconfig op. If the QuorumPeer is LEADER or FOLLOWER, QuorumPeer state will be updated in function QuorumPeer::processReconfig. But if QuorumPeer is LOOKING, shuttingDownLE may be changed to true and QV updated, and then a new FLE object is created in main loop of QuorumPeer.  So I think  the shuttingDownLE is only used by FLE to inform QuorumPeer to create a new FLE object under the condition of self.getServerState() == LOOKING. And it is  sufficient to add volatile alone.  Please point our my errors, thank you very much.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gaoshu","name":"gaoshu","key":"gaoshu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10438","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10438","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10438","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10438"},"displayName":"gaoshu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2017-08-25T10:50:08.736+0000","updated":"2017-08-30T10:32:37.198+0000"}],"maxResults":10,"total":10,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2488/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i31hgv:"}}
