This message happens to be critical for this two process scenario; \n2- The code to shut down a peer is not working well with the unit tests. For this particular unit test, we need to be able to shut down a peer completely to check the situation the test tries to reproduce. However, it seems that in some runs timing causes the other peers to believe it is still alive, and end up electing it.

More concretely, it does the following:\n\n1- It synchronizes QuorumCnxManager::connectOne so that there are no competing connections to the same server;\n2- It doesn't remove an existing connection in QuorumCnxManager::receiveConnection when winning the challenge;\n3- it eliminates the second definition of \"ss\" in QuorumCnxManager::Listener. This was a pretty silly bug (my fault of course);\n4- It adds a deadline to semapahores in FLENewEpochTest so that it doesn't wait indefinitely;\n5- If thread 0 finishes before thread 1, then thread 1 initiates a new round after waiting for 1s. This is what happens in a real deployment as a follower gives up on its elected leader if the elected leader takes too long to acknowledge its leadership. As we don't run the follower/leader part of the code in this test, moving to the next round doesn't happen automatically.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2009-04-03T13:34:16.137+0000","updated":"2009-04-03T13:34:16.137+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421950/comment/12695456","id":"12695456","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
