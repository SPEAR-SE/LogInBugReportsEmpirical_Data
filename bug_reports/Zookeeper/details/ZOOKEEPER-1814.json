The 60 seconds you're referring to is the worst case. Making the top interval configurable is not a bug, so it should go into 3.5.0. If you want to bump the test case timeout value because it causes failures, then please do it in a different jira. In any case, it is odd that the test even hits the 60s limit. I think it is premature to blame the 60s limit for the test failure.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-11-15T10:53:27.919+0000","updated":"2013-11-15T10:53:27.919+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12679371/comment/13845186","id":"13845186","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=danipeon","name":"danipeon","key":"danipeon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel Peon","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"I attached a patch where the parameter maxNotificationInterval keeps its default value defined in FastLeaderElection source file, but also it is possible to configure the value of this parameter by using the configuration file.\n\nIt is possible to find in the patch: source code modifications; a new test case that proves the configuration of the parameter (it can be tested that the test case fails if the source code modifications are deleted); a modification in the QuorumPeerMain test case which failed from time to time due to the value of this parameter; and the modifications in the Administration's Guide indicating the configurable parameter.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=danipeon","name":"danipeon","key":"danipeon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel Peon","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-12-11T08:29:06.584+0000","updated":"2013-12-11T08:29:06.584+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12679371/comment/13845192","id":"13845192","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=danipeon","name":"danipeon","key":"danipeon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel Peon","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"I think I attached the file with a wrong name.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=danipeon","name":"danipeon","key":"danipeon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel Peon","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-12-11T08:56:30.774+0000","updated":"2013-12-11T08:56:30.774+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12679371/comment/13845223","id":"13845223","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Reducing the maximum time to a reasonable value (2-5 seconds) we are not sending a heavy traffic, but we can detect a shutdown in few seconds instead of 1 minute in the worst case.\n\nReason of configurable parameter:\n-------------------------------------------\nWe may have chosen a fixed value, but the reason of making maxFleNotificationInterval a configurable parameter is backward compatibility.
