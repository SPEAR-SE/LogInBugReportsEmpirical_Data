Therefore it is removed from the static file (leaving it there could result in having one port in the static file and another in the dynamic file). \n\nThe dynamic config info is replicated, and it is identical (ignoring delays) in all servers from the beginning. So all of the servers must among other things know the client ports of other servers. (Otherwise, suppose the leader would only know its own port and push out a config - the followers would have to edit it and merge with their port info, etc., which is probably not safe to do). \n\nFrom the config file you have in the last message, it would not be possible for the server to know the ports of other servers - only its own. So with 3.5.0 you have to include the ports when you list the servers. \n\ntickTime=2000\ninitLimit=10\nsyncLimit=5\ndataDir=./localhost:2182/data\n\nserver.1=localhost:3181:4181;2182\nserver.2=localhost:3182:4182;2183\nserver.3=localhost:3183:4183;2184\n\nYou could include the clientPort line - it doesn't hurt but it would be redundant and in any case, the server removes it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-24T05:51:36.870+0000","updated":"2014-07-24T05:51:36.870+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729306/comment/14072850","id":"14072850","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"See examples here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1AF8pIfQbN5cKxe0c4cQ4_DW6ZjBJqSkyANcTGUwkzjc/edit","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-24T05:51:59.018+0000","updated":"2014-07-24T05:51:59.018+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729306/comment/14072941","id":"14072941","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching a patch that includes a new test for this scenario.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-24T07:39:57.326+0000","updated":"2014-07-24T07:39:57.326+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729306/comment/14072964","id":"14072964","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I removed the old test checking config file backward compatibility -

Client port/adress are now part of the dynamic information that can be changed by reconfig.\n\nThat's fine. However I see a few issues we'll need to resolve:\n\n1) backward compatibility. We support n to n+1 backward compatibility (upgrading 3.4 to 3.5). This currently breaks that compatibility. What you are saying in your comment is fine, however the conversion from old, non-dynamic, (but valid) config to new, dynamic config is not working properly. There's even an existing jira for this same issue that a user faced - ZOOKEEPER-1950.\n\n2) The server is not properly validating the configuration. \n\nbq. with 3.5.0 you have to include the ports when you list the servers\n\nif that's the case (missing required parameter) the server needs to log an error and refuse to come up\n\n3) The server needs to output XX.bak# files when modifying the configuration files. Currently they are overwritten, in order to support this in a production environment we need .bak files to be created on each change, so that we have a history to look at if things go wrong, or if we need to revert if something goes wrong.\n\n4) afaict there is no documentation. existing documentation (zk admin guide, examples, etc...) are all based on the \"pre-reconfig\" requirements. If this were an optional feature it would be less important (people could just ignore it). However reconfig is effecting every single user due to the change in configuration requirements. The config file format has changed, this is a requirement to run the server.\n\nIt looks to me like 1 and 4 need to be addressed asap, otw folks won't really be able to try out a release. They will run into the same issue I did, the same issue that was reported in ZOOKEEPER-1950.\n\nPerhaps we can create some sub-tasks on this jira and work through the issues individually?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-24T16:23:20.633+0000","updated":"2014-07-24T16:23:20.633+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729306/comment/14073356","id":"14073356","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Alex pointed me at ZOOKEEPER-1660 which contains the doc changes.

I'd prefer the latter because of the additional code that will be needed to patch the dynamic config using to clientPort, disable reconfig, and creating a state where different servers have different configs with the same config version. I'd rather clearly state somewhere that users should add the ports to config file like I did in the doc. Having said that, I understand that users may not be reading the docs, so its up to you. We should warn the user that the reconfig is disabled only on the server where config file wasn't upgraded, so if he upgrades part of the config files but not all of them, things may go wrong.\n\ncomment 3 - since we can't write bak files atomically with changing the config file, I suggest to number them like bak3, bak4, etc, I think this is what you meant too. Writing it should probably be done in QuorumPeerConfig right before the dynamic config file is updated. \n\ncomment 4 - please see ZOOKEEPER-1660, which also talks about upgrading from 3.4.6\n\nThanks,\nAlex\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-24T18:11:54.125+0000","updated":"2014-07-24T18:11:54.125+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729306/comment/14073630","id":"14073630","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hdeng","name":"hdeng","key":"hdeng","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hongchao Deng","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"hey [~shralex].

This is how we can compare two configs and determine which one is older. Initially when you start up a cluster or a new server is joining its file doesn't have to include a version. In fact the user should NEVER specify a version. When a leader comes up, if the config wasn't set yet it sets it to its new zxid, and all config files are updated.
