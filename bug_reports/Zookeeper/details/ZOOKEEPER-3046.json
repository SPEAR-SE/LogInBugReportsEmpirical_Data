mins (600000 ms)? That was me who set it before. The story of this is: this test was timing out sometimes under normal ant limits (15 mins). When ant kills the test it won't capture the logs, so I've set junit timeout lower. But 10 mins is too low and causes too many build failures. So bumping up to 14min. The problem of slowness still exists\n","created":"2018-07-19T07:01:44.806+0000","updated":"2018-07-19T07:01:44.806+0000","started":"2018-07-19T07:01:44.805+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"124834","issueId":"13160172"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13160172/worklog/125113","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/576\n","created":"2018-07-19T16:59:33.459+0000","updated":"2018-07-19T16:59:33.459+0000","started":"2018-07-19T16:59:33.459+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"125113","issueId":"13160172"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13160172/worklog/125115","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user phunt commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/576\n  \n    Seems worth a try, +1.
