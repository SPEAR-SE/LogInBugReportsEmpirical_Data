And quorum was set up like below. \n\nA - Follower \nB - Leader \nC - Followerâ€‹ \n\nA  <==> B <==> C \n I____________I\n\nAnd 3 clients are connected to ensemble like below. \n\nC1 is connected A. Both C1 and A are in the same machine.\nC2 is connected B. Both C2 and B are in the same machine.\nC3 is connected C. Both C3 and C are in the same machine.\n\nTo remove the network link between B and C iptables utility is used. \n\ncommand used: \niptables -I INPUT -s Server_B_IP -j DROP \niptables -I INPUT -s Server_C_IP -j DROP \n\nAfter removing the link connections looks like below. \n\nA  <===> B             C \n I________I\n\nSimply there is no way to send any packets from zookeeper server  B to zookeeper server C and vice versa. But the connection exists between between B and C. And also there is no way to send any packets from  B to C3 and vice versa. But the connection exists between between B and C3. \n\nHere What I noticed is that the client connected to Zookeeper Server \"C\", could not connect to the ensemble, resulting a session expiration timeout. \n\nFor this experiment I used tickTime of 3000ms and client session expiration timeout of 45000ms. And tested with different combinations also.
