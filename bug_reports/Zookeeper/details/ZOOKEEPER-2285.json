In fact, this same test has been skipped for the past 70+ pre-commit builds, among which there are a couple of succeeded ones [1].\n- The failure of this pre-commit build (3302) is caused by build.xml:1605, according to Jenkins. It is not obvious to me what failed from the log though. Will dig deeper.\nhttps://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/build.xml#L1605\n\nRegarding the skipped test, it's QuorumTest::testSessionMove\nhttps://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/test/QuorumTest.java#L253\n\nThis test (along with some others in QuorumTest) is ignored in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-733, because \"session moved tests are currently ignored since they fail in netty. \". Then later, in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-907, all other ignored tests were activated, but not this one with no particular reason. I assume that just an overlook..\n\nAlso there is an existing JIRA about this skipped test, we should probably un-skip this test as it's legitimate.\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2285\n\n[1] Succeeded pre-commit build with testSessionMove test skipped:\nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/3308/\nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-ZOOKEEPER-Build/3290/\n{noformat}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2016-07-29T21:06:19.202+0000","updated":"2016-07-29T21:06:19.202+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2285/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2mdnb:"}}
