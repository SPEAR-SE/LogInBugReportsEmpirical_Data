When the packet length exceeds the max size an IOException is thrown.  This is caught and handled by the SendThread by cleaning up the current connection and enqueueing a Disconnected event.  The immediate caller of zookeeper sees this as a ConnectionLossException with a Disconnected event on the main Watcher.  This state transition is a bit misleading because under many circumstances as soon as the SyncConnected event is received retrying the same operation will succeed.  However, in this case it is likely that the zookeeper client will reconnect immediately and if the operation is retried the same jute max buffer limit exception will be thrown which will trigger another disconnect and reconnect.\n\nIt would be great if the exception was exposed to the caller of the zookeeper client some how so that a more appropriate action can be taken.  For instance, it might be appropriate to fail completely or to attempt to establish a new session.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"32626","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Expose/create KeeperException for \"Packet len <x> is out of range!\" error when jute max buffer size is exceeded","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dlord","name":"dlord","key":"dlord","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel Lord","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dlord","name":"dlord","key":"dlord","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel Lord","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12533383/comment/14134875","id":"14134875","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tobe","name":"tobe","key":"tobe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"chendihao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"[~dlord] Nice and we need this patch to troubleshoot the exceptions from ZooKeeper.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tobe","name":"tobe","key":"tobe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"chendihao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2014-09-16T03:06:37.829+0000","updated":"2014-09-16T03:06:37.829+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-1313/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i05y47:"}}
