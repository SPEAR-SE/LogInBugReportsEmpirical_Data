same.\nSame for clientPortAddress. \n\nBut seems like Camille is right in her comment that if you specified the clientPort with the new format you won't be able to connect to it using localhost. I'm not sure if this is a problem but I'm guessing that it may be because previously if you just specified clientPort, the IP was taken as localhost implicitly. Whereas now if you say \"a:b:c;d\", a is taken as the ip for d. To achieve the same as before you can write \"a:b:c;localhost:d\".\n\nWhile trying this I found a corner case missing in zkServer.sh -- if the specification uses the new format but still appears in the static configuration file (backward compatibility), zkServer.sh won't find the port (for example if you say ./bin/zkServer.sh status it will complain).
