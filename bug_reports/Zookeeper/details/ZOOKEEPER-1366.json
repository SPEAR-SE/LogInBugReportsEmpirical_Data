Zookeeper could easily know handle elapsed times as elapsed times rather than as differences between absolute times.  The absolute times are subject to adjustment when the clock is set while a timer is not subject to this problem.  In Java, System.currentTimeMillis() gives you absolute time while System.nanoTime() gives you time based on a timer from an arbitrary epoch.\n\nI have done this and have been running tests now for some tens of minutes with no failures.

But I feel like Henry's comment is most interesting:\n\n{quote}\nThe nice thing is that this is a small step towards a properly mockable time API in ZK, which would a) make tests much faster and b) make tests much more deterministic. There's a way to go still because of Thread.sleep and other complications, but this is a good first step.\n{quote}\n\nWe really aren't doing all that much towards that end by replacing one static method call with another. You still can't mock that in mockito. So the only question I have here is, if we're going to touch all those places anyway, should we just be creating an actual thin object that wraps \"time\" and use non-static methods on that object to make these calls, in order to allow more mocking of timing issues in the future? Or should we save that for another patch?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-01-23T00:27:19.620+0000","updated":"2012-01-23T00:27:19.620+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538929/comment/13191371","id":"13191371","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"See ZOOKEEPER-366 for a previous discussion/solution for this issue.

Developers and users then think ZK is seriously buggy.\n\nAs such, we view this internally as a required fix that we will be deploying as a patch on our current production version of ZK.

In Hadoop we make sure we pass around the same clock object when creating all the sub sequent objects (the constructs in MR next gen are more DI compliant). We could try doing that here but again I think its a bit of an effort (should be manual work). But as Henry/Camille mentioned we could do that in another jira. I think thats the right solution instead of creating another layer which hides the longs (as Pat suggested).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-01-27T19:11:03.100+0000","updated":"2012-01-27T19:11:03.100+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538929/comment/13203309","id":"13203309","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"agreed. i think also that you can still mock a static api if you provide a method and interface to allow the implementation to get the time from a user provided object. but again that is a different issue.\n\nfor now i would really really like to get this in asap. it's a shame that it missed the next release since this is a real problem that we have a fix for. even without the C client, the big problem is what happens at the server with the session timeouts and this patch fixes that problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-02-08T06:28:51.458+0000","updated":"2012-02-08T06:28:51.458+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538929/comment/13203348","id":"13203348","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tdunning","name":"tdunning","key":"tdunning","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Dunning","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"On the off topic of mocking, I was just able to mock System.nanoTime directly using jmockit.
