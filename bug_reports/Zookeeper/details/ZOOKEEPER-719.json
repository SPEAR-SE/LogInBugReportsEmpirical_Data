The most critical ones for me are the ones in the procedure to recover a ledger. I believe in the way I have currently implemented, it could cause problems if an instance of InterruptedException is raised when recovering a ledger, since the procedure could complete successfully. I need to investigate this further and either determine that it isn't a problem or find a better way. \n\nAny suggestion would be appreciated.

I see three options to set the throttling threshold:\n\n# Use a configuration file to set the parameter value. Unfortunately, there are a couple of issues to this option. First, we currently don't have a config file on the client side, and I'm not sure if one variable would justify setting it up. Second, I'm not convinced that it is a good idea to have config files on the client side. It is nice to instantiate a BookKeeper object without having to bother about config files (on the client side);\n# Add an input variable to BookKeeper constructors or to createLedger/openLedger calls. This one sounds like a bad option to me because I don't think it will be used often and it is not related to the corresponding operations; \n# Use set/get calls to change the threshold value. This is what I used with this patch.\n\nA fourth option is to have an environment variable, but this is similar to having a config file, so I'm not sure there is any great advantage.\n\nAny thoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2010-05-30T08:33:06.596+0000","updated":"2010-05-30T08:33:06.596+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459682/comment/12873580","id":"12873580","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Canceling patch until we decide how to control throttling on the client.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2010-05-31T08:18:40.516+0000","updated":"2010-05-31T08:18:40.516+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459682/comment/12878850","id":"12878850","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"i think using a system property is still the easiest, but i'm fine with the set/get if you want to do it. you just need to make it thread safe.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-06-15T04:09:48.021+0000","updated":"2010-06-15T04:09:48.021+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459682/comment/12883945","id":"12883945","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Submitting a new patch that uses a system property.\n\nIn LedgerHandle, I'm currently throwing NumberFormatException instead of catching it locally.
