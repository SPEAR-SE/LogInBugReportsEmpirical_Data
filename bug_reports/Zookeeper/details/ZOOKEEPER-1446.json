The code might look like the following (didn't actually compile this):\n\n//------\nstatic pthread_mutex_t kConnectedMutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;\nstatic pthread_cond_t kConnectedCondvar = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;\n\nint zookeeper_wait_until_connected(zhandle_t* zk, const struct timespec* timeout)\n{\n  struct timespec abstime;\n  clock_gettime(TIMER_ABSTIME, &abstime);\n  abstime->tv_sec += timeout->tv_sec;\n  abstime->tv_nsec += timeout->tv_nsec;\n\n  pthread_mutex_lock(&kConnectedMutex);\n  if (zoo_state(zk) == ZOO_CONNECTED_STATE) {\n    return 1;\n  }\n\n  pthread_cond_timedwait(&kConnectedCondvar, &kConnectedMutex, &abstime);\n  int state = zoo_state(zk);\n  return (state == ZOO_CONNECTED_STATE);\n}\n\nvoid zookeeper_session_callback(zhandle_t* zh, int type, int state, const char* path, void* arg)\n{\n  pthread_mutex_lock(&kConnectedMutex);\n  if (type == ZOO_SESSION_EVENT && state == ZOO_CONNECTED_STATE) {\n    pthread_cond_broadcast(&kConnectedCondvar);\n  }\n}\n//-----\n\nThat would work fine (assuming I didn't screw anything up), except that pthread_cond_timedwait can spuriously wakeup, making you not actually wait the desired timeout. The solution to this is to loop until the condition is met, which might look like the following:\n\n//---\n  int state = zoo_state(zk);\n  int result = 0;\n  while ((state == ZOO_CONNECTING_STATE || state == ZOO_ASSOCIATING_STATE) && result != ETIMEDOUT) {\n    result = pthread_cond_timedwait(&kConnectedCondvar, &kConnectedMutex, &abstime);\n    state = zoo_state(zk);\n  }\n//---\n\nThat would work fine, except the state might be valid and connecting, yet not ZOO_CONNECTING_STATE or ZOO_ASSOCIATING_STATE, it might be 0 or, as implemented recently courtesy of zookeeper-1108, 999. Checking for those states causes your code to rely upon an implementation detail of zookeeper, a problem highlighted by that implementation detail changing recently. Is there any way this behavior can become documented (via a ZOO_INITIALIZED_STATE or something like that), or is there any way this behavior can be supported by the library itself?\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12530265","id":"12530265","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-1446.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tyree731","name":"tyree731","key":"tyree731","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Tyree","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2012-05-30T20:30:29.844+0000","size":6554,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12530265/ZOOKEEPER-1446.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"32554","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"C API makes it difficult to implement a timed wait_until_connected method correctly","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tyree731","name":"tyree731","key":"tyree731","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Tyree","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tyree731","name":"tyree731","key":"tyree731","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Tyree","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12550731/comment/13286004","id":"13286004","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tyree731","name":"tyree731","key":"tyree731","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Tyree","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"An example patch.
