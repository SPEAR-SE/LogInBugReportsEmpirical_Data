The auth callback typically takes multiple seconds to fire. I instrumented the java, c binding, and python binding with a few log statements to find out where the slowness was occuring ( http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~hazmat/zookeeper/fast-auth-instrumented/revision/647). It looks like when the io thread polls, it doesn't register interest in the incoming packet, so the auth success message from the server and the auth callback are only processed when the poll timeouts. I tried modifying mt_adapter.c so the poll registers interest in both events, this causes a considerably more wakeups but it does address the issue of making add_auth fast.  I think the ideal solution would be some sort of additional auth handshake state on the handle, that zookeeper_interest could utilize to suggest both POLLIN|POLLOUT are wanted for subsequent calls to poll during the auth handshake handle state.\n\ni'm attaching a script that takes 13s or 1.6s for the auth callback depending on the session time out value (which in turn figures into the calculation of the poll timeout).\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12443895","id":"12443895","filename":"authtest.py","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kapilt","name":"kapilt","key":"kapilt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kapil

After digging into the C code it occured to me that the problem was down through add_auth() to send_info_packet(), which was putting the auth packet on the to_send queue but not waking up the IO thread via adaptor_send_queue() like send_ping() does.  The result was the auth packet didn't go out until the zoo_interest() timeout occured (which internally looks to be like 1/3rd the timeout specified in the zookeeper_init, but I don't 100% grok what zoo_interest is doing)  Attached is a very simple patch which remedies this problem, and does not have any other appreciable impact.
