If A and B reset their votes to themselves in the case where the heard-from vote set is empty, leader election will continue.\n\nI do not know if this affects running ZK clusters, as it is possible

All tests pass for me with this patch on my laptop. \n\nI have replaced one kludge with another here. QuorumPeer.electionAlg is set to null when electionType==0 until the election is actually run. This causes problems if you want to retrieve the electionAlg object via getElectionAlg() beforehand for tests. \n\nI've set it up so that makeLEStrategy always creates a new LeaderElection if electionType == 0, but also that createElectionAlgorithm sets electionAlg=new LeaderElection(this) instead of null, so that as long as startLeaderElection has been called, getElectionAlg() won't return null.\n\nI've checked to see if this will cause any obvious problems for the call sites of getElectionAlg and couldn't find anything that expected null. It seems more consistent to me this way. The question I have is over why LeaderElection needs re-instantiating each time when FLE does not.\n\nIf this sounds confusing, it's because the code really is! The interaction of createElectionAlgorithm, startLeaderElection and makeLEStrategy is hard to discern.
