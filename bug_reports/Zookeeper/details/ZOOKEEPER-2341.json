Thank you for the bug report.  We fixed this for the upcoming 3.5.2-alpha release.  This was tracked in issue ZOOKEEPER-2281.  However, we did not backport the fix to the 3.4 maintenance line.  I just reopened that issue so that we can consider it for ZooKeeper 3.4.8.  I'm going to resolve this one as a duplicate.  I recommend adding yourself as a watcher on ZOOKEEPER-2281 if you'd like further updates.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-09T22:24:04.500+0000","updated":"2015-12-09T22:24:04.500+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2341/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2ponj:"}}
