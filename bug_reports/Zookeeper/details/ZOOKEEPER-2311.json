And I was wrong originally. It's not a short read that is causing this. Instead the read is failing with a return code of -1 and errno is set to EBADF. The manpage for read(2) indicates this can only happen when:\n\n{code}\n       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.\n{code}\n\nBut we specifically opened it 2 lines of code above that and checked to ensure it wasn't -1. \n\nIn the core file I also see that the fd is valid:\n\n{code}\n#4  0x00007f9ff8e4070a in setup_random () at src/zookeeper.c:476\n476\tin src/zookeeper.c\n(gdb) print errno\n$3 = 9\n(gdb) print fd\n$4 = 140\n(gdb) print seed\n$5 = 32671\n{code}\n\nIt's odd that seed has something in it. That could mean we read _something_, but it could also be because this code never initialized seed to zero and it's got whatever garbage was on the stack.\n\nThe only other thing that's very curious here is that I think when this happens it coincides with a call to zookeeper_close. But this is a local stack variable so I can't fathom how that could cause this failure scenario.\n\nI'll keep digging.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=marshall","name":"marshall","key":"marshall","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marshall McMullen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2015-12-01T23:55:44.162+0000","updated":"2015-12-01T23:55:44.162+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12909770/comment/15043528","id":"15043528","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~marshall]: i'd like to apply the patch and follow-up the EBADF in a separate jira - makes sense?
