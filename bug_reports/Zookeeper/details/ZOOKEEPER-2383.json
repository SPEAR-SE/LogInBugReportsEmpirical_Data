According to git blame, the latest changes around the startup method in ZooKeeperServer are due to ZOOKEEPER-1907, which actually turned out to be quite problematic, so this could be another issue due to that patch, I'm not sure.\n\n[~fpj], sure I'm happy to investigate this. To understand the impact of ZOOKEEPER-1907, first I took the code before ZOOKEEPER-1907 commit version {{da3e7e0d4b66ac5a25d40ae2d0102b1b57994b62}}. I've debugged the code and able to re-produce the issue even without ZOOKEEPER-1907 changes.\n\nComing back to the issues reported in this jira, there are two issues. IIUC, both the cases are due to the race between server startup and processing a client connection request.
