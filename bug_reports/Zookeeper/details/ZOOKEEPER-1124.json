That or if there are explicit types not supported by an observer/follower, deal with those explicitly then assume the rest are valid and pass them along.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=marshall","name":"marshall","key":"marshall","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marshall McMullen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2011-07-13T17:22:17.722+0000","updated":"2011-07-13T17:22:17.722+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12513948/comment/13064727","id":"13064727","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The QuorumBase and associated tests are probably what you want, Marshall.
