This then causes to the FileTxnIterator.next() implementation to detect the end of the log file too early.\n\nI'll attach a small maven project with one junit test which can be used to reproduce the issue. Due to the blackbox nature of the test it will run for roughly 50 seconds unfortunately. \n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Start an ensemble of zookeeper servers with at least 3 participants\n- Create one entry and the remove one of the servers from the ensemble temporarily (e.g. zk-2)\n- Create another entry which is hence only reflected on zk-1 and zk-3\n- Take zk-1 out of the ensemble without shutting it down (that is important, I did that by interrupting the network connection to that node) and clean zk-3\n- Bring back zk-2 and zk-3 so that they form a quorum\n- Allow zk-1 to connect again\n- zk-1 will receive a TRUNC message from zk-2 since zk-1 is now a minority knowing about that second node creation event\n- Create a third node\n- Force zk-1 to become master somehow\n- That third node will be gone\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12533999","id":"12533999","filename":"TruncateTxLogCorruption.tgz","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=christianz","name":"christianz","key":"christianz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christian

I would have liked to have just closed and created the FTSL, however there were multiple objects holding references to this object, not just ZKDB. I looked at changing this however the impact was significant - it could also have repercussions on third parties embedding the zkserver. In the end I went for the reset approach.\n\n2) notice that the code fix is relatively small. The tests make up the bulk of the changes.\n\n3) I've tested this for all three branches successfully.\n\n4) I added a truncate test that verified that the append after truncate worked properly. This test failed prior to applying the fix.\n\n5) I also harvested the core test from Christian's original attachment (awesome!). This allowed me to verify and include tests that will verify this doesn't get broken again. I also verified that without applying the fix this test will fail.\n\n6) bonus is the addition of PortForwarder - this should allow us to easily expand testing which introduces network failures of various types.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-04T00:32:22.956+0000","updated":"2012-07-04T00:32:22.956+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12594918/comment/13408307","id":"13408307","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Can we stick this guy in reviewboard?

However in the port forwarder case it would originally try once and close the inbound connection if the outbound failed.
