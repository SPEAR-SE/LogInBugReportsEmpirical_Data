This is pretty standard practice. I suppose since 3.5 has always been tagged alpha it would not be unreasonable to make breaking changes in place in 3.5. However 3.5 has been alpha for a long time, and some have given up waiting and resorted to using it in production (!), so as a courtesy to them it seems reasonable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=apurtell","name":"apurtell","key":"apurtell","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=apurtell&avatarId=20553","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=apurtell&avatarId=20553","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=apurtell&avatarId=20553","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=apurtell&avatarId=20553"},"displayName":"Andrew

Breaking changes should be in a 3.6 version. That was the genesis of this issue to begin with. Regardless of the intent of the ZK team, 3.5.x has been in production in a large number of companies for years now.
