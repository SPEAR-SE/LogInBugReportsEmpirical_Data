As long as your working branch for pull request 184 has same doc as branch-3.5 this pull request should be able to merge (once after 184 merged) without any conflicts. That would make this pr easy to review, and avoid any potential merging problems later when 184 is merged. Other options: close this PR and add doc change to pr 184. Or wait until 184 gets merged then rebase and update this pr.\n    \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-04-30T23:00:22.067+0000","updated":"2017-04-30T23:00:22.067+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13062542/comment/15991580","id":"15991580","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user afine commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/245\n  \n    @hanm my plan was to wait until 184 gets merged and then rebase.
