They don't count for a quorum needed to commit an operation. This mode existed before 3.5 - when you connect any server to the ZK cluster, it just starts working as a follower. I used it for reconfiguration as the state for servers that are not part of the configuration. When a new server joins, it will initially become a non-voting follower, so it is not necessary to start it as observer, you can just as well start it as participant, because the conversion OBSERVER -> PARTICIPANT is automatic as you noticed.\n\nSo - just start it as participant and issue a reconfig to turn it into an observer.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-06T03:18:43.485+0000","updated":"2016-09-06T03:18:43.485+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13002775/comment/15467950","id":"15467950","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Marking this as 'not a problem' for now.
