establishment/teardown issues that I found while fixing this:\n\n1) better logging of session est/teardown, much of this was based on user feedback such as ZOOKEEPER-565 ZOOKEEPER-564\nMuch of this was cleaning up the log text and using common terminology for the messages themselves\n1.1) some of 1) required better error handling. A lot of the changed code was throwing general IOExceptions, rather than throwing\nmore specific exceptions allowing higher layer code to properly report the issue.\n2) while closing a client connection the connection close response was not always sent to the client\n3) in some cases the server would not close the connection (closeconn buffer was not being queued) properly. this would happen anyway when the client closed the connection, but the server should do the right thing regardless\n\n4) calling close more than once just returns after the first call\n5) added testableWaitForShutdown to ZooKeeper to allow tests to validate that the client has shutdown all threads\n(this is test only)\n\n6) reading a client sockets now reads the entire request in one shot if possible. previously we would re-poll the\nselector after reading the length header.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-02T23:58:19.164+0000","updated":"2009-11-02T23:58:19.164+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439021/comment/12772814","id":"12772814","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
