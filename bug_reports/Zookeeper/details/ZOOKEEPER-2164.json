I have a 3 node cluster and if the leader is \"2\" and is stopped, the election will fail and ultimately 1 and 3  respond with  \"This ZooKeeper instance is not currently serving requests\" from the stat command.  \r\n\r\nIf 2 is restarted, the cluster returns and 2 becomes the leader .     This appears to be the scenario documented above.  Sometimes 3 will fail to rejoin but if it is restarted it will rejoin the cluster successfully.\r\n\r\nEssentially the only electable leader is #2.  The nodes are built as docker containers and orchestrated using Kubernetes.  \r\n\r\nI am searching  for a work around or  configuration change that will enable the  cluster to be functional if the existing leader fails  are there are only 2 nodes (out of 3) available.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tuxthedog","name":"tuxthedog","key":"tuxthedog","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10442","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10442","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10442","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10442"},"displayName":"Laurie Turner","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-10-16T01:30:29.660+0000","updated":"2017-10-16T01:30:29.660+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2164/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2d7r3:"}}
