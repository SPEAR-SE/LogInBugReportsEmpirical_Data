Probably we could try moving the {{this.shutdown}} call outside synchronization block.\n\n*Deadlock sequence is:*\n\nQuorum Leader Thread:\n1=> {{leader.lead()}}\n2=> Say, leader losts quorum and call {{this.shutdown()}}. This shutdown call is made under {{synchronized (this)}} [Leader.java#L554|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Leader.java#L554]\n3=> Shutdown will trigger {{firstProcessor.shutdown();}} and reaches {{SyncRequestProcessor#shutdown()}} call.\n4=> Now, SyncRequestProcessor will add {{requestOfDeath}} and wait to {{this.join()}};\n\nSyncThread:\n1=> SyncRequestProcessor forwards the request to its next processor {{nextProcessor.processRequest(si);}}, which is AckRequestProcessor.\n2=> AckRequestProcessor, forwards the request the leader {{leader.processAck}}\n3=> Since {{leader.processAck}} is synchronized at method level and requires {{leader.this}} lock [Leader.java#L783|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Leader.java#L783]. Since {{leader.this}} is already acquired by [Leader.java#L554|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Leader.java#L554], thus results in deadlock.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-03-04T17:37:32.490+0000","updated":"2016-03-04T17:37:32.490+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12946892/comment/15181537","id":"15181537","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"body":"Moved shutdown() call out of synchronized block. \nUsed string variable shutdownMessage instead of boolean as it can server two purpose, shut-down flag and shut-down message holder","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"created":"2016-03-05T05:38:45.336+0000","updated":"2016-03-05T05:38:45.336+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12946892/comment/15181548","id":"15181548","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

In approximately 1 out of every 10 attempts, the assertion on {{LOOKING_STATE}} fails.  Instead, it goes to {{FOLLOWING_STATE}} after a successful leader election.  My theory is that there is still a brief window in which the dropped pings haven't taken effect yet, so 2 of 3 peers still appear to be alive, and thus  new leader election is still possible.  I have attached the output from one of my failed test runs in case it's helpful for you.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-06-20T23:55:56.038+0000","updated":"2016-06-20T23:55:56.038+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12946892/comment/15340732","id":"15340732","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
