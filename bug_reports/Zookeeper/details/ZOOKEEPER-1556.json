In our case, the leak was caused because the completion thread can end before the IO thread, just before the IO thread created a completion entry for the completion thread to process. We added a mutex guard to prevent the completion thread (do_completion()) from exiting its while-loop until the IO thread (do_io()) had exited its while loop; and also added an extra call to process_completions(zh) just after the while-loop in case it had one more to do.\n\nWe cleared the new mutex guard inside of adaptor_finish(), after the IO thread is ended. The reason is that the IO thread (and the completion thread) can finish their while-loops as soon as zh->close_requested is set to 1 in zookeeper_close(), including before free_completions() does its stuff... and since free_completions() can create one or more fake responses for the completion thread to process (for unanswered requests), it's possible for free_completions() to also add things to the completion queue and cause the memory leak. So keeping the completion thread inside its while-loop until adaptor_finish() is called seems to make sense.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Hadriel","name":"Hadriel","key":"hadriel","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hadriel Kaplan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2015-11-12T22:28:47.035+0000","updated":"2015-11-12T22:28:47.035+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12610125/comment/16216247","id":"16216247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=DavidLiu","name":"DavidLiu","key":"davidliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=davidliu&avatarId=25745","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=davidliu&avatarId=25745","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=davidliu&avatarId=25745","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=davidliu&avatarId=25745"},"displayName":"DavidLiu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Chongqing"},"body":"Use deallocate_String_vector(in generated/zookeeper.jute.h) to fix the memory leak","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=DavidLiu","name":"DavidLiu","key":"davidliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=davidliu&avatarId=25745","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=davidliu&avatarId=25745","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=davidliu&avatarId=25745","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=davidliu&avatarId=25745"},"displayName":"DavidLiu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Chongqing"},"created":"2017-10-24T03:36:11.600+0000","updated":"2017-10-24T04:39:16.118+0000"}],"maxResults":5,"total":5,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-1556/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i02j5j:"}}
