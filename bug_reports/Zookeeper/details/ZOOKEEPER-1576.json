Sorry for the delay, I have been reading [~fpj] and [~breed]'s ZooKeeper book during the last two days. ;) \n\nWell, I've addressed them as far as I could. Unfortunately, I couldn't remove the visibility operator (public) from updateListServer() because it breaks code elsewhere, but I tried to reduce the line sizes of the parts affected by the patch as much as I could while minimizing change. They still overflow the 80 lines, but by a small range this time. If you have further ideas, please let me know. :)\n\nBest regards,\nEdward","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"created":"2013-12-03T23:44:10.723+0000","updated":"2013-12-03T23:44:10.723+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12615140/comment/13838381","id":"13838381","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~eribeiro],\n\nthanks for updating the patch. For things like:\n\n{noformat}\n+    public StaticHostProvider(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses, long randomnessSeed) {\n{noformat}\n\nyou could move some params to the next line (and indent w/ 8 spaces from the start of the upper line - note that JIRA might indent it funnily), i.e.:\n\n{noformat}\n+    public StaticHostProvider(Collection<InetSocketAddress> serverAddresses,\n+                long randomnessSeed) {\n{noformat}\n\nSome more nits:\n\n{noformat}\n+               // the hostName is an literal IP address.
