issue). \n\nMy sense is that this is not particularly serious, given it's only output in debug mode, however I still think we should address it. We can either cut down the details on what's output (the toString of KerberosTicket is pretty verbose), or we can just indicate whether it's null or not, or we could keep what we have and introduce another \"kerberos verbose logging/debug\" type configuration parameter in order to get this detail. \n\nWe should also investigate what kerberos itself it outputting when you set \"debug=true\" in jaas.conf and setting of \"-Dsun.security.krb5.debug=true\" on the JVM. Perhaps that's sufficient information and we don't gain much from this debug output? In which case perhaps logging an identifier (which can be tracked back to the kerberos debug information) might be sufficient instead.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-03-26T19:10:08.021+0000","updated":"2016-03-26T19:10:08.021+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12953773/comment/15213159","id":"15213159","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"fwiw here's the toString of KerberosTicket\n\n{noformat}\n    public String toString() {\n        if (destroyed)\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"This ticket is no longer valid\");\n        StringBuffer caddrBuf = new StringBuffer();\n        if (clientAddresses != null) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < clientAddresses.length; i++) {\n                caddrBuf.append(\"clientAddresses[\" + i + \"] = \" +\n                                 clientAddresses[i].toString());\n            }\n        }\n        return (\"Ticket (hex) = \" + \"\\n\" +\n                 (new HexDumpEncoder()).encodeBuffer(asn1Encoding) + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Client Principal = \" + client.toString() + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Server Principal = \" + server.toString() + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Session Key = \" + sessionKey.toString() + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Forwardable Ticket \" + flags[FORWARDABLE_TICKET_FLAG] + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Forwarded Ticket \" + flags[FORWARDED_TICKET_FLAG] + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Proxiable Ticket \" + flags[PROXIABLE_TICKET_FLAG] + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Proxy Ticket \" + flags[PROXY_TICKET_FLAG] + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Postdated Ticket \" + flags[POSTDATED_TICKET_FLAG] + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Renewable Ticket \" + flags[RENEWABLE_TICKET_FLAG] + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Initial Ticket \" + flags[RENEWABLE_TICKET_FLAG] + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Auth Time = \" + String.valueOf(authTime) + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Start Time = \" + String.valueOf(startTime) + \"\\n\" +\n                \"End Time = \" + endTime.toString() + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Renew Till = \" + String.valueOf(renewTill) + \"\\n\" +\n                \"Client Addresses \" +\n                (clientAddresses == null ? \" Null \" : caddrBuf.toString() +\n                \"\\n\"));\n    }\n{noformat}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-03-26T19:11:12.040+0000","updated":"2016-03-26T19:11:12.040+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12953773/comment/15213191","id":"15213191","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am leaning towards removing the LOG.debug call, it's probably just a left over of when this feature was being added.
