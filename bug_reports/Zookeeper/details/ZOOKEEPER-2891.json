Due to this {{deserialize_MultiHeader(ia, \"multiheader\", &mhdr)}}, which is called repeatedly for each {{completion_list_t *entry = dequeue_completion(clist)}}, does not assign the _mhdr_ and keeps _mhdr.done == 0_ as it was originally initialized. Consequently the _while (!mhdr.done)_ does not ever end, and finally falls into the _assert(entry)_ with _entry == NULL_ when all sub-requests are \"completed\". ~// Normally on my platform assert raises SIGABRT.~\n\nI propose to instruct the _deserialize_multi()_ function to break the loop on _entry == NULL_ if it was called for an unsuccessfull overal status of the multi response, and in particular for the fake response having _ZCLOSING_ (-116) status. I have introduced the _rc0_ parameter for this.\n\n\n*Another issue* with this function is that even if the while-loop exited properly, this function returns _rc == 0_, and this return code +overrides+ the true status value with {{rc = deserialize_multi(xid, cptr, ia, rc)}} in the _deserialize_response()_ function. So, the _multi_ response callback +handler would be called with _rc == ZOK_ instead of _rc == ZCLOSING_+ which is strictly wrong.\n\nTo fix this I propose initializing _rc_ with the introduced _rc0_ instead of zero (which is _ZOK_ indeed).\n\nThis is a proposed fix: https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/360\n\n[upd]\nIt looks like about the same problem is described in ZOOKEEPER-1636\nHowever, the patch proposed in this ticket also remedies the second linked problem: reporting ZCLOSING status (as required) to the multi-request completion handler.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"SIGABRT from assert during fake completion on zookeeper_close.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xoiss","name":"xoiss","key":"xoiss","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander A.
