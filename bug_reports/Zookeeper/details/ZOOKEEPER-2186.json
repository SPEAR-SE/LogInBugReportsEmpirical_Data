This would require writing the full message length after the sid field in the message. Now the parsing code assumes that the remaining data is fully used for host address and port.

Till now old servers are not sending any PROTOCOL_VERSION but instead just send their sid. So I think I can safely write an upgradation steps from {{3.4.x}} version to {{3.4.y}} version, right?
