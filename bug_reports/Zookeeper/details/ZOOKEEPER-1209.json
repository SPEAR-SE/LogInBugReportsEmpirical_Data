Please let me know if we have any other better solution to apply.\n\n*Approach:*\nIMO better the LES f/w can handle these events ('Disconnected', 'SyncConnected' and 'Expiry' ZooKeeper events), rather than be silent. It will help the users be in a safe state instead of be in the same state (ELECTED/READY). \n\nProvide 'EventProcessor-Thread', one thread per LES. This service will execute the events with a time bounded delay. After choosing the first event, the processor will wait for the configured ‘eventDelayTimeout’ and again pick the latest event present in the queue (if exists). Finally the processor will execute the most recent event. This delay is given in order to avoid slight network fluctuations, wait for some grace period say ‘eventDelayTimeout’ default value could be ‘sessionTimeOut/2’.\n\nAll the watchevents (‘Disconnected’, ‘SyncConnected’, ‘Expiry’ events ) from the ZooKeeper server and will be given to this processor. It will have the following logic\n\n+Disconnected logic:+\nIntroduce new state NEUTRAL to represent the disconnection and the clients will see the node has disconnected from the ZooKeeper can be in a safe mode.\n1)If the LeaderElectionSupport state is not STOP, dispatch NEUTRAL event to the user. So the user application can act upon it. This will help to go to a safe state rather than in the ELECTED state.\n\n+SyncConnected logic:+\n1)Check if my ephemeral node ‘leaderOffer.getnodePath()’ is present in the ZooKeeper or not\n2)If Yes, go to determineElectionStatus(). This will decide the state ELECTED/READY.\n3)If No, makeOffer() and determineElectionStatus(). This will first create ephemeral node and go to leader determination phase.\n\n+Expiry logic:+\nThe serving cluster or standalone ZooKeeper has expired this session. This implies, user must create a new client connection (instantiate a new ZooKeeper instance) if you with to access the ensemble.\n\n1) On receival of Expiry, dispatch STOP event to the client. This will notifies the client and they can restart the LeaderElectionSupport with new ZooKeeper client session.\n\nThanks,\nRakesh","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2011-09-28T07:05:20.525+0000","updated":"2011-09-28T07:05:20.525+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525018/comment/13120838","id":"13120838","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.

The f/w has the logical classification of events (for ex: *_START, *_COMPLETE), but it is not ensuring the execution order of these logical events. This makes the usage of the recipe more complex and may result in erroneous client/user implementation.\n\n\n*Scenario:*\nConsider the scenario where the user node is determined as READY state, now the LES f/w first dispatches the READY_START event to the user node and then watcher will get added to the ELECTED node. Say just before dispatching the READY_COMPLETE event, ELECTED has become expired or stopped. So the 'NodeDeleted' event will be notified to the f/w and will go to the leader determination phase by dispatching the DETERMINE_START and DETERMINE_COMPLETE events. \n\nIn this case, there is high chance of dispatching the READY_COMPLETE during the leader determination time or even later.\n\n+Following shows the sample output of Ready node events:+\nSTART\nOFFER_START\nOFFER_COMPLETE\nDETERMINE_START\nDETERMINE_COMPLETE\nREADY_START\nDETERMINE_START\nDETERMINE_COMPLETE\nELECTED_START\nREADY_COMPLETE\nELECTED_COMPLETE\n\n\n\n+*Proposal*+\nThe patch which I have uploaded contains the *‘LES-EventProcessor’* service and this will help the recipe to ensure the ordered execution of the events.\n\n\n\nThanks,\nRakesh\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2011-10-12T10:14:55.431+0000","updated":"2011-10-12T10:14:55.431+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525018/comment/14083281","id":"14083281","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
