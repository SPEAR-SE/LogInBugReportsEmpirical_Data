When restoring from this snapshot without the tranlog, the state will include a node with no corresponding ACL in the ACL cache. This node will then be impossible to operate on as it will cause a MarshallingError.\n\nIf the tranlog is played over a server in this erroneous state, it does appear to correct itself. This bug means that to reliably restore from a snapshot, you must also have backed up the subsequent tranlog covering at least the transactions that were partially written to the snapshot.\n\nIssue first described here:\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-user/201507.mbox/%3C0LzCmv-1YtgSd0Dqb-014Qqf@mrelayeu.kundenserver.de%3E\n\nIt also appears possible for a snapshot to be missing a session yet contain an ephemeral node created by that session; fortunately ZooKeeperServer.loadData() should clean these ephemerals up.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Snapshot serialization race condition can lead to partial transaction and inoperable data node","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adammilnesmith","name":"adammilnesmith","key":"adammilnesmith","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Adam Milne-Smith","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adammilnesmith","name":"adammilnesmith","key":"adammilnesmith","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Adam Milne-Smith","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2234/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2hbw7:"}}
