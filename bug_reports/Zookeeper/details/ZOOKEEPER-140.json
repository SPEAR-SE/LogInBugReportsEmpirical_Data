In the former case, we are fine. In the latter case, peers will eventually try again once they receive a new message to send. It is true that in the worst case, the peers may be be forever trying to open a connection to each other, but the probability of that happening is low enough if there is enough timing variability.The alternative to avoid simultaneous attempts to establish a connection between pairs of peers is to impose a pre-defined order. Doing this is inefficient because peers often show up for leader election at different times, if they show up at all, and the peer responsible for starting a connection would have to keep retrying periodically forever.\n\nIn any case, it is not possible to guarantee termination for leader election in asynchronous systems, and QuorumCnxManager is part of the leader election code, so such anomalous runs are expected to happen. \n\nFor the second case, there is a second redundant synchronized block inside each of the calls (initiateConnection and  receiveConnection). These guards guarantee that information pertinent to connections is updated in a thread-safe manner. At least, that's what they should do.\n\nIt is probably a good idea to use ConcurrentHashMap for senderWorkerMap as you propose.\n\nFinally, I have opened another JIRA (141), to replace the random challenge with the server id, which is supposed to be unique. Although the probability of the challenges being the same is supposedly low, we can remove any doubt with such a change.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2008-09-16T12:05:23.411+0000","updated":"2008-09-16T12:05:23.411+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404291/comment/12631499","id":"12631499","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Flavio, could you update the server java code with a summary of this JIRA as a comment?
