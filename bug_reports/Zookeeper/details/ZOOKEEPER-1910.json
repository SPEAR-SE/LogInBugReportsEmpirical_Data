Now the difficulty here is server needs to decide when it can remove the watcher reference.\n{code}\nWatchManager.java\n\n    private final HashMap<String, HashSet<Watcher>> watchTable =\n        new HashMap<String, HashSet<Watcher>>();\n{code}\n\nFor example: \n\nIn my tests I have two watchers defined in the client side \"/node1\" - w1, w2. As we know in the server it will have only one 'watcher reference' for each client like, '/node1' vs zkClient1. Now if user call removeWatcher(\"/node1\", w1), presently it is removing the 'watcher reference' from the server. Here w2 is not taken into consideration at the server side and later the 'zkClient1' won't get any watch notifications.\n\nSimple way to fix is, server shouldn't remove the 'watcher reference' on RemoveWatch request, remove it only when expiring or triggering time. But this will have the overhead of unnecessarily holding the refernce even after all the watchers are removed successfully for a path.\n\nSecond approach is to have a counter at the server side and which will decr it after every RemoveWatch request from the client. When it reaches zero, now server can do the cleanup like,\n{code}\n    private final HashMap<String, HashMap<Watcher, Integer>> watchTable =\n        new HashMap<String, HashMap<Watcher, Integer>>();\n{code}\nHere I could see an over head of keeping one additional parameter and will increase the memory utilization.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2014-04-14T11:41:45.446+0000","updated":"2014-04-14T11:41:45.446+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12707895/comment/13968271","id":"13968271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Could someone help me to choose a better way to go ahead.

My, unpolished, thought is that the current removeWatches() API for the Java impl conflates two distinct actions:\n\na) removing the watch set on the Server\nb) unregister a given watcher or set of watchers\n\nSince 3.5.0 isn't out yet, are we still on time for changing our API? If so, how would you feel about having removeWatches *only* deal with the server-side part (i.e.: unregistering the watch from the data tree) and having something like unregisterWatcher() deal with the watchers known by the client?\n\nSo presumably you would have to remove your watch and unregister your watchers in separate steps. More calls, but better defined contracts. And, on top of this, you could always build convenience wrappers. Surely it means expanding the surface of our public API, but I think it might save us from confusing bugs given that as things are now we have weird corner cases.\n\nThoughts?\n\n0) https://github.com/python-zk/kazoo/pull/189","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-14T17:24:27.573+0000","updated":"2014-04-14T17:24:27.573+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12707895/comment/13969354","id":"13969354","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"{quote}\na) removing the watch set on the Server\nb) unregister a given watcher or set of watchers\n\nSince 3.5.0 isn't out yet, are we still on time for changing our API?

I think  'zk#unregister(watcher)' api name will confuse with the existing zk#register(watcher), which is actually meant for connection watchers. So I've tried to do some refinement, kindly see the below section for more details and would like to know the comments.\n\n# removeWatches - The difference with the earlier api is, \n(1)this won't remove the given watcher from the server set even if the watcher set is empty, but it will remove the reference from the zkclient. This api will invoke a call to server and maintain orderly execution as earlier. IMHO sending to server is required to handle packet in-flight cases.\n(2)null watcher is not allowed, client will validate and throw IllegalArgumentException.\n# removeAllWatches - This is new api which is meant for clearing all the watchers both client and server set. Will provide both sync & async api versions\n\n{code}\n    /**\n     * For the given znode path, removes the specified watcher of given\n     * watcherType.\n     * <p>\n     * Watcher shouldn't be null.

Anyway we can't completely avoid server call, so I think better to do a call to server with remove=false rather than having a logic to check watcher exists in server and remove it from the client. In another way if we see removeWatches() api, it is also doing the watcher check in the server right. Does this make sense to you ?\n\nActually I was thinking to remove the pre-valiadtion check before sending the packet, because we already have server side validation. If agrees, I'll remove this pre-validation when preparing another patch.\n{code}\n        // Validating the existence of watcher.\n        watchManager.containsWatcher(clientPath, watcher, watcherType);\n{code}\n\nbq.Also, about the naming, do you think that renaming removeWatches to removeWatchers would still be confusing?\nI feel removeWatches api name is OK.
