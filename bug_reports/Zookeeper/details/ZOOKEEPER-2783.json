It can usually do this in a few seconds, but last night it took almost 15 minutes to reconnect.\n\nThese are 5 servers in AWS, and we've tried tuning the timeouts, but the are exceeding any reasonable timeout and still failing.\n\nIn the attached logs, 5 is a follower, 3 is the leader.  5 loses connectivity at 11:21:34.  3 sees the disconnect at the same moment.\n\n5 tries to re-establish the quorum, but cannot do it until the connections to the other servers expire at 11:37:02.  After the connections are re-established, 5 connects immediately.\n\nAt 11:41:08, the operator restarted the server, and it reconnected normally.\n\nI suspect there is a problem with stale connections to the rest of the quorum - the other services on this box were fine (monitoring, puppet) and able to establish new connections with no problems.\n\nI posed this problem to the zookeeper-users list
