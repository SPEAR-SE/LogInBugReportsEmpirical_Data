There are two cases:\n\n* Session is expired by client by explicitly calling close which will set the client state to \"closed\" and any future requests will yield session expired exception. I think this is the only case that client might see a session expire event before the client's session really gets terminated on the quorum. It would be inconsistent if the current ZK client can reconnect to the new quorum and find out that the session state changed from expired to reestablished, but since the current ZK client is already closed, that is not possible. The last session event the current closed ZK client saw reflects the state of the session. Other clients will eventually see the removal of the ephemerals appertained to the closed session as well (and there is no middle state in between).\n\n* Session is expired because heart beats between client / server failed (e.g. network partition, server overloaded, client overloaded, and so on). In this case, client will get connection loss event. When client reconnects to the quorum, client will first try reestablish the session, which also requires consensus. Because ordering guarantees, when the quorum processes the request from this client the session is either already expired by the quorum, or the session is still valid. In either case, the client would either only see session expired event after reconnecting (by which time ephemerals are gone from other client's view as well), or the old state. It is still a consistent view across all clients.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2017-06-15T17:39:41.988+0000","updated":"2017-06-15T17:39:41.988+0000"}],"maxResults":5,"total":5,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2348/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2q32n:"}}
