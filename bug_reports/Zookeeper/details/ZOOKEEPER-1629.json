So why does it still\nhave /test2 in its data tree ? This is because earlier it managed to make a snapshot (39:17). Truncate doesn't touch the snapshot. After the truncate when we load the database, we first start from the snapshot, then apply the truncated log. So /test2 showing up is perfectly OK in this case. \n\nIf we want to keep the current structure of this test, we should disable snapshotting for its duration.

This is because earlier zk1 managed to make a snapshot (39:17). I think the explanation is this: truncate doesn't touch the snapshot. After the truncate when we load the database, we first start from the snapshot, then apply the truncated log. So /test2 is showing up, and we have an inconsistent state between the servers (only zk1 sees /test2). \n\nThe reason why I think this is not a ZooKeeper bug but a bug of this test is that the test explicitly erases the state of 2 out of 3 servers in order to cause truncate on the log of zk1. This situation is not something that was considered possible in ZooKeeper (for good reasons), and it doesn't work as can be seen from the log.\n\nI suggest to first figure out if this is something we can fix.
