Because if this doesn't get fixed, who knows what other issues exist?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bionicbeagle","name":"bionicbeagle","key":"bionicbeagle","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stefan Boberg","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-02-23T19:43:59.901+0000","updated":"2013-02-23T19:43:59.901+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502418/comment/14511654","id":"14511654","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevenschlansker","name":"stevenschlansker","key":"stevenschlansker","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steven Schlansker","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This causes serious issues with clustering software e.g. Mesos has a critical bug open over this:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-2186","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevenschlansker","name":"stevenschlansker","key":"stevenschlansker","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steven Schlansker","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-24T20:16:00.198+0000","updated":"2015-04-24T20:16:00.198+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502418/comment/14586458","id":"14586458","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevenschlansker","name":"stevenschlansker","key":"stevenschlansker","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steven Schlansker","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"We just had an hour long outage of our production Mesos cluster due to this bug.

By returning 0, I'm essentially keeping the same behavior and saying that it is OK to make progress. The case this patch is covering is focused on the one that it does try to acquire the lock, but the lock operation fails. Also, if you want to make this change here, then we will need to fix it in the 3.4 branch as well. With this patch, I'm just porting what we've done for the 3.4 branch so far. \n# I don't think it is ok to move the while loop out of the if block because we aren't initializing tmp_list. Even if we were, there isn't going to be any iteration of the while loop because there is no head.\n# It sounds ok to make this change, but I don't see much advantage or any correction of behavior. If we don't call the if block as you define it, then we'll have a_list.completion = NULL and a_list.next = NULL, so there will be no iteration of the subsequent while loop.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-12-10T09:25:37.842+0000","updated":"2015-12-10T09:25:37.842+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502418/comment/15050442","id":"15050442","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Waiting for feedback.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-12-10T09:32:27.806+0000","updated":"2015-12-10T09:32:27.806+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502418/comment/15051570","id":"15051570","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~fpj].  The patch mostly looks good to me, pending resolution of the feedback from Raul.  I ran some successful manual testing on both Linux and Windows.\n\nI just have a minor request.  There are some coding style differences in the branch-3.5 patch compared to what got committed to branch-3.4.  For example, indentation is different in {{unlock_buffer_list}}, and {{enter_critical}} uses a different brace style for a single-line if/else body.  Can we please match style as closely as possible between the 2 branches?  That will reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts if there are later backports to branch-3.4.\n\nThanks!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-10T20:11:43.090+0000","updated":"2015-12-10T20:11:43.090+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502418/comment/15051575","id":"15051575","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~fpj] - it makes sense.
