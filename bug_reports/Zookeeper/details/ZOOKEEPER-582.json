running the migration tool that we provide to upgrade from version 2 to version 3 of ZooKeeper. The tool migrates the data by writing a single snapshot file where the zxid is maintained (it does not write a log file). As a result of the scenario Ben mentioned (snap with no associated log file) this could cause this bug to occur. If you have run the migration tool, documented here:\nhttp://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.0.0/releasenotes.html#migration_data\nyou can verify whether or not you have this situation by looking at your ZooKeeper datadirectory\n\nHere's an example\n\n-rw-r--r--  1 root search 67108880 Nov 17 19:31 log.300022b61\n-rw-r--r--  1 root search 67108880 Nov 17 19:38 log.3000292d0\n-rw-r--r--  1 root search  3646608 Nov  5 12:13 snapshot.1db5df6e2d6\n-rw-r--r--  1 root search  3616579 Nov 17 19:31 snapshot.3000292c9\n-rw-r--r--  1 root search  3616708 Nov 17 19:38 snapshot.300038d32\n\nwhere the files are of the form <file>.<epoch><xid> \nepoch and xid both being 4 byte values represented as hex\n\nNotice that the snapshot.1db5df6e2d6 has epoch of 0x1db, while the other\nfiles have epoch of 0x3, this is the scenario described in the description of this\nJIRA.
