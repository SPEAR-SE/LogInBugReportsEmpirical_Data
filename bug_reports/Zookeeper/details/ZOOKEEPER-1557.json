It usually takes several iterations to see the failure (less than 20 usually).\n\nSeparating the two tests in SaslAuthFailTest into two files seems to fix the problem. I'm not sure why, though. I spent some time looking at SessionTrackerImpl.java. The server's SessionTrackerImpl thread seems to be unable to exit from the {{while(running)}} loop, even though the {{volatile boolean running}} becomes false. If I run {{jstack}} on the test JVM's process, it looks like there are actually two SessionTrackerImpl threads running, which seems wrong to me. This led me to the workaround of separating the two tests into different files, which is shown in the attached patch.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoontz","name":"ekoontz","key":"ekoontz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ekoontz&avatarId=11640","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ekoontz&avatarId=11640","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ekoontz&avatarId=11640","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ekoontz&avatarId=11640"},"displayName":"Eugene Koontz","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-06T08:43:14.154+0000","updated":"2012-10-06T08:43:14.154+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12610426/comment/13470958","id":"13470958","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.

Before June, the builds that failed were due to this test:\n\n{noformat}\norg.apache.zookeeper.server.TruncateCorruptionTest.testTransactionLogCorruption\n{noformat}\n\nI don't think we have observed this problem since the last comments from [~phunt], [~mahadev], and [~ekoontz] late last year, so I wonder if this is still an issue. I don't want to hold 3.4.6 because of this issue, so if there is no reason or interest in pursuing it further, I'd like to push it to 3.5.0 or simply resolve it for now. This issue is not blocking 3.4.6 quite yet, but I'm trying to get to a resolution for all issues marked for 3.4.6.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-09-03T11:09:25.993+0000","updated":"2013-09-03T11:09:25.993+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12610426/comment/13759580","id":"13759580","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Moving it to 3.5.0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-09-05T22:46:31.417+0000","updated":"2013-09-05T22:46:31.417+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12610426/comment/13782495","id":"13782495","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
