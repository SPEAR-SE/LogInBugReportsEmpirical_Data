This is not a new observation, although I can't remember if we discussed it in a jira or not. In general, I'm lukewarm about this change. It is certainly not an issue to avoid the server going into LEADING before it goes correctly into LOOKING, but I'm not entirely comfortable with manipulating the queues of notifications. Being able to have two servers concurrently thinking they are leading is a situation supported by our protocols, and such a modification would be an optimization to avoid the unnecessary LEADING step. \n\nRegarding application recovery time, we don't have a load balance scheme at this point, which could be quite useful, so bringing a new follower up does not guarantee that clients will move their sessions to the new follower.

Shouldn't the most recent notification (or just the\ncurrent state) be enough?  I understand this\nis a performance issue. However, I think it is a sizeable hole.\n\n- There could have been multiple leader\nelections while the node is down and the node could end up hopping\nacross leaders until it gets to the correct leader.\n\n- Suppose, we have a 3 node cluster. I have a simple client which\nconnects to A and creates a znode_A to indicate that A (and the\nclient) is online. The leader A disconnects from B and C and causes C\nto take leadership. Now, when A is trying to join the cluster, it can\nbe unnecessarily delayed due to this bug. If I have an application that\ntakes some action if znode_A is unavailable, then this bug can\nunnecessarily trigger that action. We are facing this problem in our application.\n\nI think it will be a small change to QCM.

Back to the TCP issue I was mentioning, we remove the message from the queue of messages to send, and send it with a write call to the socket. However, it is not guaranteed that the message will get through, since the destination might drop the connection while the message is in transit. The sender has no way to know if it really got through, unless we have an acknowledgment scheme on top of TCP, which sounds overkill. The way we found to avoid the case in one of the jiras I mentioned above was to resend the last message the peer dequeued for a given destination.

The other servers don't really know how far the leader has gone. \n\nAlso, the idea of maintaining the last vote intact is to keep the pair used to decide upon the current leader, and currently we don't use the zxid field to determine leadership if the notification says LEADING or FOLLOWING.

Peers that are either LEADING or FOLLOWING won't change their leader state based on new notifications. If a peer receives notifications from a quorum and one of the notifications says FOLLOWING/LEADING, then the peer cannot count on the sender of the notification to move to a new leader. The election will fail and the peer (perhaps along with others) will have to start over. \n\nAlso, in the case a peer gets disconnected and comes back, if there is a quorum following a leader when the peer comes back, it needs to be able to determine who the leader is even if its leader election round is higher than the others. In this case, it has to follow a leader based on FOLLOWING/LEADING notifications, without comparing the votes in the notifications.  \n\nFor these reasons, we have kept FOLLOWING/LEADING notifications in a separate data structure. It is true, though, that we could keep all of them in the same structure and simply filter based on the state field when processing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2011-03-26T14:50:54.565+0000","updated":"2011-03-26T14:50:54.565+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12495589/comment/13012161","id":"13012161","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks for the clarification.

I was looking through the code to see how we can write a test. What we can do is insert notifications in recvqueue for a peer, then call lookForLeader(), and monitor the state/proposdZxid/proposedLeader/ect. This will let us feed whatever notifications we want to FLE. The other peers should just ignore the notifications (or send notifications that we want them to send). \n\nHowever, for this we will have to make changes to FastLeaderElection so that one can overload its Messenger, modify recvqueue, set proposedLeader, propsedZxid, etc from the test. I think this will be a good change in general so that we can feed notifications to a peer and test for corner cases, but a bit time consuming. I am not sure how much that will help for this particular bug though.
