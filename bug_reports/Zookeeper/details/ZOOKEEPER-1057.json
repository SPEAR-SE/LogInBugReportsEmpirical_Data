I don't want to have to wait 5 minutes, even if i could make myself.\n\nthis is the message that follows the connection loss:\n2011-04-27 23:18:28,355:13485:ZOO_ERROR@handle_socket_error_msg@1530: Socket [127.0.0.1:5020] zk retcode=-7, errno=60(Operation timed out): connection timed out (exceeded timeout by 3ms)\n2011-04-27 23:18:28,355:13485:ZOO_ERROR@yield@213: yield:zookeeper_interest returned error: -7 - operation timeout\n\nWhile investigating, i decided to comment out close(zh->fd) in handle_error (zookeeper.c#1153)\nnow everything works (obviously i'm leaking an fd). Connection the the second host works immediately.\nthis is the behavior i'm looking for, though i clearly don't want to leak the fd, so i'm wondering why the fd re-use is causing this issue.\nclose() is not returning an error (i checked even though current code assumes success).\n\ni'm on osx 10.6.7\ni tried adding a setsockopt so_linger (though i didn't want that to be a solution), it didn't work.\n\nfull debug traces are included in issue here:
