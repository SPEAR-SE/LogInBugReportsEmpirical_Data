First, I went back to the documentation to see what we have to say about it and we are not very precise, so I think we need to also work on documentation for this issue because it changes semantics, right?\n\nThe patch you're proposing changes the behavior of data watches and exists watches, but not of children watches. It changes the structure of child watches loop, but functionally it is the same. \n\nFor data watches, you're getting rid of NodeCreated events because you feel that it should be NodeDataChanged. I actually can see us going either way, although I feel that a NodeCreated event can be informative even for a data watch. It is telling the application that the data has changed because the znode was recreated. You may want to know it in situations like master changes. Also, I'm not sure it makes sense to remove NodeCreated but not NodeDeleted. Deleting a znode is also a way of changing its data.\n\nFor exists watches, sending a NodeDataChanged gives some additional information to the application in the case it has been disconnected. Not only the znode already exists, but its data also changed in the meanwhile. But, the current code seems to always return NodeDataChanged because czxid and mzxid are set to the same value upon creation. We need to fix at least that by perhaps checking if mzxid == czxid.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-05-31T09:12:44.123+0000","updated":"2013-05-31T09:12:44.123+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12636988/comment/13676717","id":"13676717","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fanster.z","name":"fanster.z","key":"fanster.z","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jacky007","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"I get the definition in zookeeper.h\n{quote}\n/**\n * @name Watch Types\n * These constants indicate the event that caused the watch event.
