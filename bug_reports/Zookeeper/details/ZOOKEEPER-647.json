shutdown. Here is a summary of how the problem can occur:\n\n1- sendWorkerMap is updated during the execution of softHalt (cnx manager is being shut down);\n2- The sender worker that was not shut down during the execution of softHalt will later leave its main loop because the value of the attribute shutdown is true;\n3- Leaving the loop due to shutdown evaluating to true does not cause finish() to be called, which must happen to kill its recv worker sibling.\n\nI'm proposing a fix that is quite simple.
