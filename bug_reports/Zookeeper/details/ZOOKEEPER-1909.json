The way it was implemented though, implies that you need to check on the client side if a watch/watcher is set *before* you send your request to the server. If you don't, ZK will just swallow your request and won't return an error code if there isn't a watch set for that path.\n\nI noticed this whilst implementing removeWatches for Kazoo [1]. As mentioned, I guess it could be expected that clients should do the check on their side but I think that the correct thing would to have the server do the validation and return the error code accordingly as well.\n\n[~rakeshr], [~phunt]: thoughts?\n\n[1]

I hope this is a kind of notification is \"in flight\", say just before submitting the call to server, client recieves the watch notification. Now otherside server will not be able to see the watch anymore. isn't it ?\n\nThat's one possibility, yes.\n\nbq. In client side, we have two phase validation (1)before submitting the call to server and (2)after recieving the response from server. Also we know in server side it will ensure orderly exec. (2)After recieving the success response from server, again client will be checking whether I can remove the requested watcher. If yes, it continues with 'WatchRemoval' notification otherwise it throws 'NoWatcherException' to the user. \n\nYeah that is fine as well, but even if a client-side impl doesn't do that - the server should do the check.\n\nbq. Also, could you please tell me whether you have observed this case in tests ?\n\nOh, not in the Java tests - just when I was implementing this in Kazoo.
