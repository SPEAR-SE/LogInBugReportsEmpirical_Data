Specially, noting why they don't have to be synchronized would be useful (i.e.: they can only be called from the Leader and Learner classes and it all happens from one thread\n\n* in src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeerTestBase.java why is getQuorumPeer added? Can't see where it's used. Also, there's some whitespaces/tabs before the method...\n\n* i think waitUptoAFileWriteTime() is a bit racy and hackish and will break in the future. as much as i dislike sleep() calls in tests, in this case it's probably alright to loop a few times until getAcceptedEpoch() and getCurrentEpoch() converge\n\nOther than, it looks good. Thanks [~arshad.mohammad]!\n\ncc [~fpj] for further thoughts.
