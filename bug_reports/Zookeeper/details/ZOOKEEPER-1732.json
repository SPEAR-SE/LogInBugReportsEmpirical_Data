Our goal however shouldn't be to have every follower having the most recent notification from the leader. Our goal is to have a leader that has enough supporters so that we can make progress.

My proposal more concretely is to have the leader broadcasting its notification upon receiving a notification for a server that is LOOKING. If a follower receives a notification from the guy it is following and it notices that its vote is outdated, then it updates its vote accordingly.

It is a fair observation, although I tend to think that leader election is unreliable in nature, so I can really go either way. \n\nGiven that you are keen on implementing the changes to the recovery handshake, what if we try to outline the precise changes in both cases and try to determine which one to go with once we have that? He are some initial thoughts.\n\nFor option 3, we add LE information to the LearnerInfo message. The leader checks the version of the protocol and uses the new information in LearnerInfo in the case the protocol version is appropriate. In the case the leader instance information doesn't match, we have two choices:\n\n# The leader drops the connection to the follower and the follower goes back to LOOKING;\n# The leader sends to the follower the LE instance information and the follower updates its vote info.\n\nFor the second option, I believe we would need a new message, since LEADERINFO only contains a zxid. I'd rather avoid adding another message, though.\n\nIf we don't change the recovery handshake and use the other approach I outlined, then I believe all changes are concentrated in the FLE class, perhaps some in QuorumPeer as well, I'm not sure. We just need to call sendNotifications() upon receiving a notification while leading. For a follower, when receiving a notification from a LEADING server, it checks if its vote is still valid, updating otherwise. \n\n\nbq.

If the leader is being re-elected, then it means that the ensemble it is trying to join is not functional, since the leader is not present. \n\nTo do it, you might as well check the change of ZOOKEEPER-1514 in checkLeader. I think the if block you added is not necessary if you make the change in check leader. \n\nbq. taking into account my own votes or votes that put me as a leader when joining an ensemble.\n\nI don't think we are currently taking into account the vote of a LOOKING server when processing FOLLOWING/LEADING notifications. If you're talking about endVote, this is the vote corresponding to the leader it elected.\n\nbq. removing the check for the election round when joining an established ensemble.\n\nLet me give some insight here first. We need to have servers joining an established ensemble because a server may find that a quorum is already following some leader and if it follows the standard procedure of processing notifications, then there are some corner cases that can cause it to keep electing some other server that is also looking.\n\nThe danger of joining an established ensemble is the following. Say that a minority of followers support a leader L, and a majority M supports L'. L' has enough supporters and is able to commit txns. Now say that a server S in the ensemble of L' crashes and recovers. S talks to L and its minority now forming a majority (say there was one server missing to form a majority). L will tell all servers in its ensemble to truncate causing some txns to be lost. \n\nWe have a couple of mechanisms that prevent this incorrect truncation from happening. First, S needs to receive FOLLOWING/LEADING notifications from a quorum, not including itself. In this case, the incorrect truncation only happens if S receives a stale message, a message from a server S' that later on followed L'. We prevent this case by having maximum one outstanding notification in QuorumCnxManager in the queue of a peer. If S' has followed L', then its notification must reflect it and S won't receive such a stale message.\n\nOverall it sounds fine to only consider the server the followers are following.

I will remove that.\n2 - This is because the final election vote in the leader will have \"newEpoch - 1\". The winning vote will contain the epoch of the leader, but once the election finishes, the leader increments the epoch. So actually \"newEpoch\" is the epoch that won the election plus one. And the vote reported in the Fast Leader Election is the vote that won the election. If we set the vote to just \"newEpoch\", then we need to update the vote also in the Leader, and not only on Learners as it is currently done.

The indentation was already wrong in that part of the code. If I am not wrong, there are 8 spaces and a tab in the lines above and below the modification. I believe I have put 8 spaces and a tab also in the modified lines. In the editors that I use it looks ok. If you want me to try to fix the indentation around the change, it is ok with me. If you mean another change or you don't see 8 spaces and a tab there or I should use a different combination for these lines, please let me know.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germ치n Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-10-03T04:16:28.996+0000","updated":"2013-10-03T04:16:28.996+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12658778/comment/13784822","id":"13784822","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=abranzyck","name":"abranzyck","key":"abranzyck","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=abranzyck&avatarId=16792"},"displayName":"Germ치n Blanco","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Oooops!
