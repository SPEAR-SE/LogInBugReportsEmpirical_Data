I could not reproduce it. \n\nThis one is a flaky test for sure and we've seen it from time to time on our nightly builds, albeit not very frequently.\n\nIt's not unusual that you can't reproduce a flaky test like this locally because the failure scenarios are usually un-deterministic if's caused by concurrency issues like race conditions or depend on other facts such as interferences from other tests and the host load. My suggestions on reproducing a test is to:\n\n* Stress test it, in isolation or in batch with rest of unit tests. Easy to do if you write a script or using Jenkins. When you run it enough number of times you might get lucky to get a hit.\n* Introduce faults in the test artificially which increase the probability of hitting a failure. Examples including adding sleep calls here and there.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2017-08-24T17:05:13.050+0000","updated":"2017-08-24T17:05:13.050+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2877/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3ixuf:"}}
