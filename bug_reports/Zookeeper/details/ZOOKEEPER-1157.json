This is happening on trunk and I located the reason for some of the failures.\n\n1. The timeouts were due to logging at DEBUG level, instead of default INFO. Once I bumped the logging level back down to the default, the tests are passing on my \"fast\" machine.\n2. JVM crashes were mea culpa. They don't repro without my patch.\n3. There are some tests (eg Netty hammer tests) which are timing out on a \"slow\" machine (ie my laptop).
