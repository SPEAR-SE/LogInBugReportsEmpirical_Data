It is so far only reproducible in Apache Jenkins. I can add some loggings to capture more contexts when the failure happens on Apache Jenkins, but in that case the retry logic in create is still needed, unless we can prove it is not possible to get a ConnectionLossException after a session establishment.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-03-16T18:10:29.497+0000","updated":"2017-03-16T18:10:29.497+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13056127/comment/15928570","id":"15928570","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user skamille commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/191\n  \n    > ConnectionLossException can happen after a connection between ZooKeeper client and server has been established, right?

If we have the issue that our tests can connect to ZK, then randomly drop connections while in the midst of the testing, that feels like a problem we should figure out.
