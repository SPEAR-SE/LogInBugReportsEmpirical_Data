The value 5 was arbitrarily chosen, of course.\n# The call to leader.start() will invoke Leader.lead(), which will invoke getEpochToPropose() and will set the value of Leader.epoch to 5 (initial value of Leader.epoch is -1). The leader thread will block in getEpochToPropose() until a quorum runs getEpochToPropose().\n# The mock follower executes getEpochToPropose(1,6). Since the leader + this follower form a quorum, both are able to continue and complete the execution of getEpochToPropose(). Without the fix, the value of Leader.epoch won't be 7 as it should be after the call of getEpochToPropose() from the mock follower. \n\nThis is the flow I believe we have with the current test, and I think that multiple consecutive calls of getEpochToPropose() from the leader are not possible because the leader will block in the first call until it gets a quorum.

I have the succeeding test periodically failing because the 33556 port used by both tests for the leader quorum port is still in use. Adding the code above would wait until the leader shuts down in your test.\n\nActually, in addition to the above fix, I think we should change all the manually assigned ports in Zab1_0Test to be assigned using Portassignment.unique() like in other tests (I can do that if people agree that this should be done). If I understand correctly the static counter used in unique() to assign ports is initialized once per test file, so it would also prevent the problem I'm seeing here of two tests in the same file trying to use the same port. \n\nUnfortunately I'm only seeing this in my branch and not in trunk.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-01-09T19:51:26.085+0000","updated":"2012-01-09T19:51:26.085+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12536279/comment/13182895","id":"13182895","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Hi Alex, I'd like to suggest that we create a new jira for the issue you're raising, especially if it is happening in your branch, and not in trunk.
