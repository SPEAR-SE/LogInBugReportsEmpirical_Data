There is a test added in 1411 that was supposed to make sure that 1411 doesn't break backward compatibility \n\nsrc/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/server/util/DynamicConfigBCTest.java\n\nI suggest that after config.parse(confFile.toString()) in this file we add\n            \n            Assert.assertTrue(config.getClientPortAddress() != null \n            \t\t&& config.getClientPortAddress().getPort() == CLIENT_PORT_QP1);\n\nthis fails without your fix and passes with it.\n\nA related potential backward compatibility issue in 1411 is what to do when the user has an old-style config file like you describe and then a reconfiguration happens. In that case I create a dynamic config file automatically and will remove all relevant definitions from the cfg file (server, group, weight, clientPort and clientAddress). I'm not sure what's the right thing to do, but perhaps we shouldn't remove the clientPort and clientAddress from the cfg just in case they're not specified in the new format.
