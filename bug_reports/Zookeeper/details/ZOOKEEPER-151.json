This description eliminates the old way of configuring that works with the original leader election algorithm, though. Although the new way of configuring should also work with the original leader election, it would be misleading to configure another port and not use it. \n\nSince we have currently two implementations (there are two more, but we've been focusing on two), and they require different ways of configuring the servers, I wonder if we should support both. Also, if we have different ways of configuring, then to have both ways enabled, we would need to have both \"electionAlg\" and server specs to determine if the configuration is correct, thus creating a dependency between parameters. It is probably best to create another jira to discuss the configuration issue, and leave this one for documentation.\n\nFor now, I'm canceling this patch, and once we decide upon server configuration, I can come back to this issue and update the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2008-10-05T14:49:09.104+0000","updated":"2008-10-05T14:49:09.104+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12405580/comment/12640009","id":"12640009","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I updated the patch to the latest docs in svn and also fixed a few other problems with the quickstart -
