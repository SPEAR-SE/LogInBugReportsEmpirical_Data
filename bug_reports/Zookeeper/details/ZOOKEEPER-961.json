It's not that much overhead since it's the same String instance all the time. The idea is, to prepare for additional patches that make it possible to use the same ClientCnxn with different ZooKeeper client instances that have different chroots.\n\n\nThis addresses bug ZOOKEEPER-961.\n    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-961\n\n\nDiffs\n-----\n\n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ClientCnxn.java 78b2eb2 \n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ClientWatchManager.java d56374d \n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ZooKeeper.java e82eaa0 \n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/WatchManager.java PRE-CREATION \n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/WatchRegistration.java PRE-CREATION \n  src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/TestableZooKeeper.java f8344b6 \n  src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/test/WatcherTest.java 90ec513 \n\nDiff: https://reviews.apache.org/r/1809/diff\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\n\nThanks,\n\nThomas\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jiraposter%40reviews.apache.org","name":"jiraposter@reviews.apache.org","key":"jiraposter@reviews.apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"jiraposter@reviews.apache.org","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-09-12T18:17:09.323+0000","updated":"2011-09-12T18:17:09.323+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12493765/comment/13102890","id":"13102890","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

It's not that much overhead since it's the same String instance all the time. The idea is, to prepare for additional patches that make it possible to use the same ClientCnxn with different ZooKeeper client instances that have different chroots.\n\n\nThis addresses bug ZOOKEEPER-961.\n    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-961\n\n\nDiffs\n-----\n\n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ClientCnxn.java 78b2eb2 \n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ClientWatchManager.java d56374d \n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ZooKeeper.java e82eaa0 \n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/WatchManager.java PRE-CREATION \n  src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/WatchRegistration.java PRE-CREATION \n  src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/TestableZooKeeper.java f8344b6 \n  src/java/test/org/apache/zookeeper/test/WatcherTest.java 90ec513 \n\nDiff: https://reviews.apache.org/r/1809/diff\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\n\nThanks,\n\nThomas\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jiraposter%40reviews.apache.org","name":"jiraposter@reviews.apache.org","key":"jiraposter@reviews.apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"jiraposter@reviews.apache.org","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-09-14T22:18:14.359+0000","updated":"2011-09-14T22:18:14.359+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12493765/comment/13105266","id":"13105266","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in ZooKeeper-trunk #1304 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk/1304/])\n    ZOOKEEPER-961.
