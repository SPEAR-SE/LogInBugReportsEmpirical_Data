I believe the Java client already has tests for SASL authentication failure, which leads me to believe that the race will be hard to reproduce in the test--I haven't put much thought into it, though. (The C client doesn't have SASL support.)\n\nOne way to make this testable would be to have the server return the auth failed error code in the reply header, instead of just sending a null token. I wasn't sure of the implications of this for compatibility, though, so I left it as is. Do you have any thoughts on that?\n\nIf the patch you're working on is a superset of this change, I'd be happy to wait and review it. It would be nice to get this change in 3.4.x though.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mkizner","name":"mkizner","key":"mkizner","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Meyer Kizner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2016-11-28T19:10:25.838+0000","updated":"2016-11-28T19:10:25.838+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12922077/comment/15702915","id":"15702915","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"body":"bq. One way to make this testable would be to have the server return the auth failed error code in the reply header, instead of just sending a null token. \n\nI think this is what I am actually doing in ZOOKEEPER-1634 - client would now get typed keeper exception such as AuthFailed rather than getting a ConnectionLoss exception which is too generic for client such as Curator to handle as ConnectionLoss could be caused by many things. I added tests / updated existing ones so the tests verify that an expected type of KeeperException will be observed on client side, instead of the generic ConnectionLoss exception, which is the key benefit of the change proposed here (to have server gracefully ask client to close cnx instead of having server itself do it.).\n\nbq. The C client doesn't have SASL support.\nGood point - I forgot the context here is this JIRA instead of ZOOKEEPER-1634 where i do need C tests for regression :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2016-11-28T19:44:57.913+0000","updated":"2016-11-28T19:44:57.913+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-2346/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2pxfb:"}}
