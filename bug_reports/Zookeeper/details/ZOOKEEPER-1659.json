My guess is that we'd want to at least see the latest committed dynamic config, even better would be to know what it is at different servers so that we know if some server has a stale config. With regard to in-progress reconfigs, I'm not sure how this would work since they only take a few ms at most (as any other op). State transfer happens before the reconfig is invoked. Perhaps reconfig proposal and commit times can be recorded, but this seems lower priority. \n\nIt would be good to monitor the set of servers connected/synced to the leader and their roles (some of them will be paticipants/observers in the current config and others may be non-voting followers, that don't belong to the current config). This way an operator can know that server A is already in-sync with the leader and he can invoke reconfig to add A.\n\nIn general we probably want to add some minimal support first so that its no longer a blocker for 3.5.0, and then potentially add more info if needed.\n\nAlex\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-27T17:21:24.752+0000","updated":"2014-03-27T17:21:24.752+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12635739/comment/13949677","id":"13949677","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"body":"Hi guys,\n\nAlthough I am far from being a JMX expert, I have some interest on this issue, and had submitted a patch to add a 'dir' command available from both 4lw and JMX.

So I'd say that the server should remove itself from this list so that the list in the config znode and in the JMX are consistent.

However, the main general concern I have is that the other day I tried to implement a new quorum verifier and a lot of tests failed. It seems that there are parts of the code base, especially tests, that are hardcoding majorities, which I find a bit annoying. It would be great if we could keep the use of quorums independent of the actual implementation, and in this particular case rely on the QuorumVerifier interface.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-05-18T09:37:07.500+0000","updated":"2014-05-18T09:37:07.500+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12635739/comment/14001610","id":"14001610","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~shralex] and [~fpj]\n\nbq.removing a server may not lead to shutting it down - it may be an intermediate step for changing its role (there are cases where this is necessary when changing an observer to a follower - an observer can't vote so if its vote is needed to establish the new config we may need to first remove it so that its a non-voting follower).\n\nYeah this is good point, I missed it. Initially I was thinking to identify only the changed QPs and tried to unregister/re-register it. Now after seeing this scenario I've diff idea in my mind. How about un-register all the remote beans and re-register back according to the new QuorumVerifier#getAllMembers() ?. Here one concern is, all the remote QPs will be unregistered for a moment until its re-registration, irrespective of QuorumServer has configuration changes or not. With this approach, code will be simple rather than having complex logic for diff and identifying only those changed QPs.\n\nZK JMX hierarchy is:\n- jmxQuorumBean (himself registered as parent bean)\n** LocalPeerBean (self quorumpeer)\n** RemotePeerBean (for each remote qp in the config)\n\n\nbq. One thing this patch is not handling is quorum system changes. if I understand correctly if we switch from majority to hierarchical or the other way around, or change parameters of a hierarchical quorum system, this won't be reflected in JMX that only has the QuorumServers\nPresently Hierarchical system info is not exposed and not available in any of the existing jmx beans. I also feel, this can be exposed after 3.5.0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2014-05-19T11:50:54.022+0000","updated":"2014-05-19T11:50:54.022+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12635739/comment/14002464","id":"14002464","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Doing the diff (but simplifying the diff code a bit, perhaps as I suggested above) or unregistering/re-registering everything both sound fine to me, but I've never used JMX so not sure what's the implications of unregistering/re-registering something.
