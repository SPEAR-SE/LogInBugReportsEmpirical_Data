It adds a FollowerSyncRequest class to represent in-flight sync operations, and it cleans up a bit the logic on the leader side. Now, there are several  modifications related to debugging messages, which don't seem to be always related to the problem is this jira. This is fine, though. I just commented because they make the patch look a lot more complex than it really is.\n\nSomething I'd like to understand is the functionality of matchSyncs. Why do we need a boolean flag to decide whether to process or not? Is this to differentiate the processing of sync on a leader and on a follower? In any case, it is probably a good idea to insert a comment  explaining.\n\nThe comment that leads the code of SyncTest.java seems to be copied from elsewhere.
