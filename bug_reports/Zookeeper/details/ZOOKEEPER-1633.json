This is in QuorumCnxManager.java. This makes changes to the information passed during this initial connection very difficult. This patch will change the first field of the message to be a protocol version (a negative number that can't be a server id). The second field will be the server id. The third field is number of bytes in the remainder of the message. A 3.4 server will read the first field as before, but if this is a negative number it will read the second field to find the server id, and then remove the remainder of the message from the stream. This will not affect 3.4 since 3.4 and earlier servers send just the server id (so the code in the patch will not run unless there is a server > 3.4 trying to connect). This will, however, provide the necessary flexibility for future releases as well as an upgrade path from

If a 3.5.0 server tries to connect to a 3.4.5 server, then I believe it will be dropping the connection according to the log messages above. I forgot exactly how it goes, but I think the one with highest id is supposed to start the connection. If that's the case, then the two servers will never be able to establish a connection. \n\nAbout the protocol version, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have it in future versions too, it is a good practice and we should have done it before. It might be a good idea to create a jira for it if you don't want to this feature more generally. \n\nI was also wondering if we need a test here. Since this is just to enable migrations from 3.4.5 to 3.5.0, it is not necessary to guarantee no regression in future 3.5.0, but we might need to make sure that the 3.4 remains correct.

Shouldn't it be done more like modern protocols such as protobufs to introduce a mechanism of optional fields?  Strict versioning of protocols is very unpopular any more because of the brittleness introduced into protocols.\n\n2) it is possible that there is an irreconciliable conflict in version between correspondents.  In such cases, it is important to signal this clearly.  As such, it is good to add not only versioning information to the original request, but a very stable reply that indicates that there is an irreconciliable version mismatch.

In this specific patch I was trying to solve the following problem: currently the first thing a server\nwants to hear from another server connecting to it is a long, which is the id of the connecting server. Once the connection is \nestablished, and a leader is elected, they start sending protobufs. For ZK-107 an id was not enough - I also needed to send the leader election address and port (a string) of the connecting server, which may be new. We needed a way for an old 3.4 server\nto understand that the connecting server is sending id + string/protobuf and not just id, and at least remove the string/protobuf from the stream, even if it only ends up using the id from this message. This is why in the latter case we're sending a negative number followed by an id, followed by the length of the remaining message, and the 3.4 server can realize that this is not just \"id\", remove the remaining message from the stream, and move on.\n\nSo while I agree with you that it would be nicer if that first message is a protobuf and not just a long as in 3.4, I don't see how this would help us solve the backward compatibility issue that this current patch is trying to address. \n\nThanks,\nAlex\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-02T14:07:22.465+0000","updated":"2013-04-02T14:07:22.465+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12629968/comment/13638951","id":"13638951","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Revision number r1463399. http://svn.apache.org/r1463399","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-04-23T10:51:51.304+0000","updated":"2013-04-23T10:51:51.304+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12629968/comment/13792114","id":"13792114","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Seems like there is a small bug in the patch.
