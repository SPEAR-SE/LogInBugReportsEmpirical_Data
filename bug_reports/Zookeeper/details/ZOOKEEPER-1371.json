It's only for running a (few) tests & I assume we don't want to dump the log4j into classpath for people. Whole point of slf4j is to let the developer who uses zookeeper to chose their choice of logging implementation of the slf4j api. Also ivy will pull down the log4j binding impl. for test scope for developers. \n3) bumped log4j to version 1.2.17 (contrib/ivy declared dependency at version 1.2.15 which pulls in JMX SUN libraries which is not distributed in maven central. 1.2.16 was mentioned in root ivy file.

I don't see why we would want to encourage users/devs to particular create such tests? So maybe it should be removed?\n\n[~fournc]: Can you confirm with packager that it is okey to drop log4j jar file from distribution? I see no reason for why you want it included in distribution as it then will land in classpath for users and that complicates things when they want to choose their own slf4j implementation for logging. I think it would be enough to have it declared as a test dependency in ivy for the log4j»-specific test implementations we have. This should be enough for developers I guess, maybe leave it as a note in a «readme.developers» if they want to run the jmx log4j test, they should fetch dependencies with ivy to ensure to get slf4j-log4j12 bridge for running it.\n\nI guess it would make more sense to have the nolog4j goal to exclude the jmx log4j test instead, make it the default target for running tests and add a note in «readme.developers» to run «ant junit.run» to include tests which depends on log4j and then make CI to run the ant junit.run goal. \n\njmx log4j test is also an integration/system test as well, and most useful to be run by a CI.

Maybe we can address this in a separate jira to get this one checked in?\n\nAs for the testing, my personal preference is to *not* exclude the jmx log4j tests. Ideally running \"ant test\" should run the same set of tests it did before this patch. Either that or modify the test so that it doesn't depend on log4j.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michim","name":"michim","key":"michim","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michi Mutsuzaki","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-03T22:29:25.599+0000","updated":"2014-04-03T22:29:25.599+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12539547/comment/13965124","id":"13965124","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Rockj","name":"Rockj","key":"rockj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Roy Sindre Norangshol","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"[~michim] Can probably create an issue with docs that is related to this one yes, if your thinking about -> http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperAdmin.html#Debug+Log+Cleanup+%28log4j%29  etc. \n\nWhat generates the docs/? I assume there is a tool or something that generates all the html/pdfs. Would be best to ensure docs are updated with the release. \n\nRegarding the jmx log4j bean stuff, it should really be distributed as it's own artifact and then move the log4j specific implementation to this artifact together with the test. Because it doesn't really belong at all in the main project. Then users can contribute to other jmx logging artifacts for logback etc as well. \n\nSo I highly suggest to move it to its own artifact (jmx/log4j test we currently have), or at least move it to contrib and out of the main project.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Rockj","name":"Rockj","key":"rockj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Roy Sindre Norangshol","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-04-10T08:19:41.149+0000","updated":"2014-04-10T08:19:41.149+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12539547/comment/13965138","id":"13965138","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"bq.
