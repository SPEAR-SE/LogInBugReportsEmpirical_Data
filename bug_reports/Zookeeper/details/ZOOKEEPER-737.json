It's reproducible but tricky. If I run stat/dump from a remote server into a leader with a lot of connections/ephemerals, it reliably fails. It prints out some of the data and closes the connection suddenly. For example, the end of a dump command:\n14 expire at Mon Sep 12 14:14:04 EDT 2011:\n        0x1325208b8c90089\n        0x2325208b8c30099\n        0x4325208b8ca0113\n        0x1325208b8c900cd\n        0x2325208b8c3009d\n        0x5325211469900ae\n        0x2325208b8c30091\n        0x4325208b8ca00b7\n        0x1325208b8c90094\n        0x1325208b8c90090\n        0x5325211469900d7\n        0x5325211469900a4\n        0x2325208b8c3009e\n        0x2325208b8c3009c\n0 expire at Mon Sep 12 14:14:10 EDT 2011:Connection closed by foreign host.\n\nI tried a bit of debugging against the running server. Breakpoints anywhere inside the dump thread before the exit of closeSock() will cause the problem not to occur. But a breakpoint at the exit of closeSock() will still show the problem. \n\nThis is \"a lot\" of ephemerals/sessions in that we're talking about ~120 sessions and 88 ephemerals.

I have validated that the data is all flushed to the byte buffer, but it never gets to the client if there is network slowness and it can't all successfully arrive before the CommandThread gets to the call to close. This can happen even in nc noninteractive mode (as we have observed with several false weekend alerts).\n\nHowever, if we don't cancel the selector key, we'll potentially see a cancelled key exception or an EOF exception in our selector loops in non-interactive netcat, and that will preemptively close the socket.\n\nSo we need to keep the key from being cancelled by our processes to ensure the data gets completely sent, but we also need to ignore errors from selecting this key in the case of a 4lw. \n\nRight now, my solution is a total ugly hack that looks something like:\n\ncreate a boolean in NIOServerCnxn called \"ignoreClose\", initally set to false. In checkFourLetterWord, set this boolean to true. In the Factory run loop, if we get a CancelledKeyException, with a NIOServerCnxn attachment, and the boolean set to true, ignore the exception. In doIO, if we get an EOFException (possibly any exception) and this boolean is set to true, ignore the exception. This lets us ignore the effects of a cancelled/closed incoming connection from nc without losing data on the socket for times when a 4lw needs a lot of data to be sent or a distance to send it.\n\nThoughts on this? It has been a bit of a nightmare to figure out, and my googling seems to indicate that netty won't support nc at all ( https://issues.jboss.org/browse/NETTY-236 ).

We'd fix this problem on the new port, the old port would have the existing limitations.\n\n3.6.0 we would remove 4lw on client port entirely.\n\nThis is good for a number of reasons IMO -- one is that having 4lw on the client port is a bit of a security issue in some customers - as any client has access to this port and it cannot by definition be firewalled. Many admins would like to firewall this.\n\nIn the process we could:\n1) make the new port fully b/w compatible with the existing functionality\n2) enable long lived sessions rather than polling\n3) provide support for \"extended command syntax\" which would enhance 4lw features (for example to control the format of the output)\n4) etc...\n\nI realize this doesn't fix the existing, but it does provide for a reasonable way forward -- we'll pay off some debt.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-12T18:27:28.875+0000","updated":"2011-10-12T18:27:28.875+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461726/comment/13126025","id":"13126025","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"4) use netty to implement this (no nio)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-12T18:29:52.979+0000","updated":"2011-10-12T18:29:52.979+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461726/comment/13126179","id":"13126179","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fournc","name":"fournc","key":"fournc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Camille Fournier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I think that makes sense.
