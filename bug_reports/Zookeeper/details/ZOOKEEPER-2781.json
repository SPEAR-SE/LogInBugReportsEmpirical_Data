GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"GitHub user afine opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/251\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2781 Flaky test: testClientAuthAgainstNoAuthServerWithLowerSid\n\n    The flaky test appears to be caused by a race condition in QuorumCnxManager that could potentially prevent two servers from connecting to each other. I was able to reproduce the issue with a debugger and a little bit of patience. It would be great if someone can share a less contrived way to reproduce the same issue. Here is the basic order of execution required to reproduce the issue between two peers (using lines of code from before this patch).  Point of clarification, reaching a line means hitting but not yet executing that line (equivalent to setting a breakpoint on that line).\n    \n    1. peer1 enters `startConnection` and reaches QuorumCnxManager.java:365\n    2. peer0's Listener enters `handleConnection` reaches  QuorumCnxManager.java:506\n    2. peer0 enters `startConnection` and reaches QuorumCnxManager.java:353\n    3. peer1's Listener enters `handleConnection` and reaches QuorumCnxManager.java:483\n    3. peer1 executes QuorumCnxManager.java:365 and reaches QuorumCnxManager.java:374\n    4. peer0's Listener executes QuorumCnxManager.java:506 and starts a RecvWorker which stops at QuorumCnxManager.java:1027. The Listener reaches QuorumCnxManager.java:516.\n    5. peer1's Listener continues executing from QuorumCnxManager.java:483, which removes the SendWorker and RecvWorker for its connection to peer0, and reaches QuorumCnxManager.java:493\n    6. peer0's RecvWorker executes  QuorumCnxManager.java:1027, the socket had since been closed on peer1 and we throw an exception\n    ```\n        [junit] 2017-05-07 14:48:11,055 [myid:] - WARN  [RecvWorker:1:QuorumCnxManager$RecvWorker@1042] - Connection broken for id 1, my id = 0, error =\n        [junit] java.io.EOFException\n        [junit]     at java.io.DataInputStream.readInt(DataInputStream.java:392)\n        [junit]     at org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager$RecvWorker.run(QuorumCnxManager.java:1027)\n    ```\n    9. peer0 executes  QuorumCnxManager.java:353 reaching  QuorumCnxManager.java:377\n    10. peer1 executes connectOne at QuorumCnxManager.java:493 and continues until it reaches QuorumCnxManager.java:290 which completes the thread\n    11. peer0's listener continues executing from QuorumCnxManager.java:516. Calls `handleConnection ` again but returns at QuorumCnxManager.java:469 since peer1 never wrote its sid to the socket.\n    12. peer0 continues executing from QuorumCnxManager.java:377\n    13. peer1 continues executing from QuorumCnxManager.java:374\n    \n    \n    Both threads finish and no quorum has been formed. `testClientAuthAgainstNoAuthServerWithLowerSid` times out\n    \n    \n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/afine/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2781\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/251.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #251\n    \n----\ncommit 5f231641a9496aaf84a0b58d87f5fc365fa9b7e6\nAuthor: Abraham Fine <afine@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-05-12T20:23:55Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2781: Flaky test: testClientAuthAgainstNoAuthServerWithLowerSid\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-05-12T23:30:55.805+0000","updated":"2017-05-12T23:30:55.805+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13071407/comment/16008997","id":"16008997","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
