Some minor observations:\n\n1. We can use temporary files in {{testValidateInpuFile}}:\n\n{code}\ntestValidateFileInput() throws IOException {\n     File file = new File(testData, \"file.txt\");\n     file.createNewFile();\n{code}\n\ncan be rewritten as:\n{code}\ntestValidateFileInput() throws IOException {\n        File file = File.createTempFile(\"file-\", \"txt\", testData);\n        file.deleteOnExit();\n{code}\n\n2. We can add a unit test to check the readability of the file as:\n\n{code}\ntestUnreadableFileInput() throws IOException {\n        File file = File.createTempFile(\"file-\", \"txt\", testData);\n        file.setReadable(false, false);\n        file.deleteOnExit();\n{code}\n\n*IMHO*, I would write {{validateFileInput}} method by throwing exceptions and returning void if everything is okay. Therefore, in the unit tests I would structure them as:\n\n{code}\n   try {\n      validateFileInput(...)\n      fail(\"Should throw IOException\")\n   }\n   catch (IOException ie) {\n         assertEquals(\"File file-202.txt doesn't exists\", ie.getMessage());\n   }\n{code}\n\n*But I am definitely okay with the current way they are, so up to you. :)*","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eribeiro","name":"eribeiro","key":"eribeiro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=eribeiro&avatarId=16169"},"displayName":"Edward Ribeiro","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Sao_Paulo"},"created":"2015-09-29T15:44:07.266+0000","updated":"2015-09-29T15:44:07.266+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12901103/comment/14935597","id":"14935597","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arshad.mohammad","name":"arshad.mohammad","key":"arshad.mohammad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Mohammad Arshad","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Singapore"},"body":"Thanks once again [~eribeiro] for your suggestions.

We have tests that try to simulate broken data directories by restricting permissions, but Windows has logic that the owner/creator of the file/directory always has access, regardless of the NTFS ACL entries present on the file.  I've searched many times for a solution, but I've never found a good way to get these kinds of tests to work correctly on Windows.\n\nIn Hadoop, we still write these kinds of tests, but we use JUnit's {{assumeTrue}} to skip the tests on Windows.  That way, at least we get the coverage on Linux.  It looks like we could do something similar here with {{assumeTrue(!org.apache.zookeeper.Shell.WINDOWS);}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-29T18:46:50.076+0000","updated":"2015-09-29T18:46:50.076+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12901103/comment/14935640","id":"14935640","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
