First, we can't acquire a permit in pendingAddOp.initiate() because the call to asyncAddEntry and the call to initiate are decoupled (a separate thread executes initiate). To have the acquire call being effective in throttling the client application, we need to put it either before or after submitOrdered in asyncAddEntry. Given that there is only one checked exception, which is thrown by the acquire call itself, it is my impression that it is ok to place the call before, and placing it before is the same order the we followed for read operations in pendingReadOp.initiate().\n\nWhat do you think, Ivan?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2010-09-09T15:49:01.935+0000","updated":"2010-09-09T15:49:01.935+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470839/comment/12908724","id":"12908724","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ikelly","name":"ikelly","key":"ikelly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Kelly","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"submitOrdered can throw RejectedExecutionException (Im guessing rare to the order of \"if this happens the machine will die soon\") or NullPointerException (unlikely).
