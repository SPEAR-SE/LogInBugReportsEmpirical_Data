rotate the zookeeper.out file with the 'copytruncate' semantics (copy the file, truncate it to zero bytes) the next write results in a sparse file with the write at the offset of the last file. Effectively the log file is now full a null bytes and it is hard to read/use the file (and the rotated copies). \n\nEven worse, the result is zookeeper.out file only gets \"larger\" (though sparse) and after a while on a chatty system it takes significant CPU resources to compress the file (which is all nulls!)\n\nThe simple fix is to append to the file (>>) instead of a simple redirection (>)\n\nThis issue was found in a 3.3.5 production system, however code in trunk has the same
