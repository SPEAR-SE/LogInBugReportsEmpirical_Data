That mail thread contains more details.\n\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-dev/201510.mbox/%3CD23841D1.2E7C8%25cnauroth@hortonworks.com%3E\n\nThank you to [~randgalt] for reporting this and showing a test case that demonstrates the problem.  To summarize, the shutdown sequence in {{ZooKeeperServerMain#shutdown}} can close out client sockets before the request processing pipeline shutdown gets a chance to ack transactions back to those clients.  This can cause a client application to retry erroneously, resulting in an unexpected  {{NoNode}} or {{NodeExists}} error.\n\nI'm attaching a patch that fixes the shutdown sequence.  This appears to be a major contributing factor in the problem.  I adapted Jordan's example to a JUnit test.  Without my patch, this test fails within a few seconds of making repeated client calls.  After applying my patch, I can run the same repeated client calls for multiple minutes without failure.\n\nHowever, this fix is incomplete and therefore isn't ready to commit.  It's still possible for this test to fail, even though it happens much less frequently.  There must be some other contributing factor.  [~fpj] has a theory that the transaction batching and flushing logic in {{SyncRequestProcessor}} might not fully flush transactions if the request of death is queued under high load.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-10T22:34:11.903+0000","updated":"2015-10-10T22:34:11.903+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12904002/comment/14952089","id":"14952089","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=randgalt","name":"randgalt","key":"randgalt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=randgalt&avatarId=16746","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=randgalt&avatarId=16746","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=randgalt&avatarId=16746","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=randgalt&avatarId=16746"},"displayName":"Jordan Zimmerman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Panama"},"body":"FYI - Curator now has workaround methods.
