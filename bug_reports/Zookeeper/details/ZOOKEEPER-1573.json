Perhaps a better way would be to advance the txn log to make sure that the delete of the parent is there. The assumption for the current patch is that a delete will show up in the txn log at some point, which is fine if nothing has gone wrong. If it is difficult to advance the txn log, we could alternatively keep information about the missing parent to check later that the delete is there.\n\nBecause we don't want to hold 3.4.6 for much longer, if you people prefer, we could check this in and create a new jira to fix it in the way I'm proposing later on, assuming my proposal makes sense.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-02-08T14:06:03.949+0000","updated":"2014-02-08T14:06:03.949+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12614446/comment/13896791","id":"13896791","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rgs","name":"rgs","key":"rgs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rgs&avatarId=18469"},"displayName":"Raul Gutierrez Segales","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"fwiw, i like the idea of merging this and opening a new ticket to revisit the issue later on (potentially with a more robust approach).
