This test is unreliable because it expects the watcher to fire immediately after the state changes. This test adds a `CountDownLatch` to the watcher, to  better track when it has been fired. \n    \n    This flaky test can be reliably reproduced by adding a `Thread.sleep` right before `states.add(event.getState());`.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/afine/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2798\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/270.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #270\n    \n----\ncommit 2a4dcd2e7726a041d54f5c114eec0b035bf74989\nAuthor: Abraham Fine <afine@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-06-01T20:52:07Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2798: Fix flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ReadOnlyModeTest.testConnectionEvents\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-06-01T21:01:19.099+0000","updated":"2017-06-01T21:01:19.099+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13076619/comment/16033739","id":"16033739","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
