But before that it allows more requests to be processed even if the session is expired -\n\n            // Now that the session is ready we can start receiving packets\n            synchronized

closing\", e);\n            close();\n        }\n\nI wonder if the client somehow sneaked in the set watches, right after the server removed the connection through removeCnxn() API

If it looks good, I'll try doing the same on trunk.\n\nHere is what I think is causing this bug. Please correct me if I'm wrong -\n\nSay a client connects to a > 1 node ZK cluster and registers watch on some path. After that, if the client goes into a GC pause, the leader expires the session and proposes closing the session to the followers. Meanwhile, the client wakes up and tries to renew its session with one of the followers. Now, when the follower detects that the session is invalid, it sends a close session response to the client, and enables receive on the selector key for that connection. So it receives the setWatches request during the renew session. There is a race condition since the request processors on the follower merely \"pass-through\" the non-transactional setWatches request while the NIOServerCnxn has sent the close session request to the client. Due to the above, sometimes, the watches are set right after the NIOServerCnxn is removed from the ZooKeeperServer. Hence, the watches are left on the servers, for expired sessions, effectively causing a memory leak.  \n\nThe fix is to enable reads on the connection only if the session is found to be valid.\n\nFor testing, I wrote a test and added it as part of the DisconnectedWatcherTest. However, it uses the in-memory ZK ensemble class from curator, with a few modifications to test watches. In addition to this, have added a timeoutSession() API to TestableZooKeeper to simulate the client side GC pause. However, it involves suspending and resuming the event thread. \n\nI have 2 concerns about tests for this patch -\n1. Method used to simulate a client side GC pause\n2. Longer test duration, since the test runs multiple iterations to reproduce this corner case race condition\n\nFor 1, this is hacky, works, but it will be good to know other alternatives for writing this test.\nFor 2, since this is more of a system test, wonder what is the best way to include it in zookeeper. Also, the new helper classes are from curator. \n\nLastly, I left the DEBUG/TRACE logging, that I found useful to understand the server code, in the patch. Maybe, not all of it follows logging conventions.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nehanarkhede","name":"nehanarkhede","key":"nehanarkhede","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Neha Narkhede","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-02-15T20:29:26.226+0000","updated":"2012-02-15T20:29:26.226+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12540477/comment/13208774","id":"13208774","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

give more clarity, like\n{code}\nassertEquals(\"There must be NO watches!\", 0, watchCount);\n{code}\n- Formatting is not proper in MockSelectorThread.java. Normally, between methods there will be a newline.\n- This is a suggestion and FYI. I would like to use @RunWith(Parameterized.class), when there are situations to run the same test case with different input values. In the patch, we have testcases with sessiontimeout and without sessiontimeout flags. Please refer MultiTransactionTest to understand more on this pattern.
