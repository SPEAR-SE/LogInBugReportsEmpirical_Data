Due to factors like network delays, one client may perform an update before another client gets notified of the change. Consider the scenario of two clients, A and B. If client A sets the value of a znode /a from 0 to 1, then tells client B to read /a, client B may read the old value of 0, depending on which server it is connected to. If it is important that Client A and Client B read the same value, Client B should should call the sync() method from the ZooKeeper API method before it performs its read.\r\n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/maoling/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2913\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/608.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #608\n    \n----\ncommit 09c90dc0801b9dc1d4427be144e81819da230eea\nAuthor: maoling <maoling199210191@...>\nDate:   2018-08-24T10:21:04Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2913:testEphemeralNodeDeletion is flaky\n\n----\n","created":"2018-08-26T09:49:22.059+0000","updated":"2018-08-26T09:49:22.059+0000","started":"2018-08-26T09:49:22.058+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"138184","issueId":"13106446"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13106446/worklog/138406","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user tamaashu commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/608\n  \n    Good catch, I like your solution.\n","created":"2018-08-27T14:16:27.094+0000","updated":"2018-08-27T14:16:27.094+0000","started":"2018-08-27T14:16:27.092+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"138406","issueId":"13106446"}]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3ks73:"}}
