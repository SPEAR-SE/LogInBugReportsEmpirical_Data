addrvec_next() call handle_error() will push the client to the start of the list and terminate the connection.\n\nThen, the zoo_cycle_next_server() call in zookeeper_interest will be called in response to the connection failure, and the client will cycle back to the failed server.\n\nIn this way, a client who has a list of only 2 servers can get stuck on the one failed server.  This would only be an issue in an ensemble larger than 2 of course, because failing 1 out of 2 would lead to quorum loss anyway.\n\nThere are other harmonics possible if every other server in the list is failed, but this is simplest to reproduce in a 3 server ensemble where the client only knows about 2 servers, one of which then fails.  There are probably some elegant fixes here, but I think the simplest is to add a flag to track whether a server has been accessed before, and if it hasn't, don't call zoo_cycle_next_server() at the top of the zookeeper_interest() function.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12634340","id":"12634340","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-1856.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michim","name":"michim","key":"michim","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michi Mutsuzaki","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-13T03:40:37.554+0000","size":1174,"mimeType":"text/x-diff","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12634340/ZOOKEEPER-1856.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"366381","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"zookeeper C-client can fail to switch from a dead server in a 3+ server ensemble if the client only has a 2 server list.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dutch","name":"dutch","key":"dutch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dutch T.
