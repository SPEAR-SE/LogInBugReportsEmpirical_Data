In particular the dataDir now has a \"version-2\" subdirectory that stores all of the snaps/transactionallogs for version2 of the persistence layer.\n\nI also note that the documentation of this class is particularly poor. I'm working on ZOOKEEPER-229 and would like to point to the API docs for this class regarding usage but they api docs are nonexistent\n\nAlso - I think it's important for the user to be able to specify the number of \"backup\" snaps and logs that should be kept -- right now it seems we delete all but the current snaps/txlogs. Either by count or by date -- ie \"remove anything 5 days or older, with a minum of 3 most recents snaps (and accompanying txlogs)\" seems like a pretty common user case (assuming the operator is doing system backups every X days, etc...)\n\nin general this class needs some tlc - the formatting should also be cleaned up.\n\nAlso - the API docs for this and LogFormatter are not included in the build.xml \"javadoc\" target. These are user utilities so javadoc for these two classes should be included. I will fix this issue as part of ZOOKEEPER-229. I'm also updateing the forrest documention in 229 so don't worry about that either.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12398859","id":"12398859","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-252.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev
