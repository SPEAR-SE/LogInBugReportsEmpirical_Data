IMHO we should handle QuorumPeer and Standalone separately. One approach I'm thinking is, presently {{ZooKeeperServerListenerImpl}} is inside ZooKeeperServer.java we can move this to a separate java file. \n.\n- *Standalone* server can use this one, here instead of zks#shutdown() we should think of interrupting {{cnxnFactory}} and {{secureCnxnFactory}} and gracefully bring down the server.\n- *QuorumPeer* can do {{QuorumPeerListenerImpl extends ZooKeeperServerListenerImpl}} and stop respective observer/follower/leader service. This way  will make the server to LOOKING state and allows to continue with the internal leader-election. This is similar to a situation where QuorumPeer hits unexpected exception and giving another chance to join quorum. Please refer below switch case logic, which is similar to the finally block of each [QuorumPeer#L1055|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/QuorumPeer.java#L1055] server respectively.\n{code}\nQuorumPeer#stopService(){\n\tswitch (getPeerState()) {\n\t\tcase OBSERVING:\n                       // stopObserver();\n                       observer.shutdown();\n                       setObserver(null);  \n                       updateServerState();\n                       break;\n\t\tcase FOLLOWING:\n                       // stopFollower();\n                       follower.shutdown();\n                       setFollower(null);\n                       updateServerState();\n                       break;\n\t\tcase LEADING:\n                       // stopLeader();\n                        if (leader != null) {\n                            leader.shutdown(\"Forcing shutdown\");\n                            setLeader(null);\n                        }\n                        updateServerState();\n                       break;\n\t}\n}\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-08-18T11:53:46.959+0000","updated":"2015-08-18T11:53:46.959+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12856158/comment/14701168","id":"14701168","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~fpj] for the interest.

If the way we are shutting down servers and request processors needs adjustment, then lest's do it, but creating workarounds just makes it messier. For the standalone case, we are shutting down it in ZooKeeperServerMain, and I think the latest patch here is just trying to replicate how we shut down the server in ZooKeeperServerMain, which isn't good because it is duplicating code. We need to make this better before checking in and ideally not have two listener implementations.

Could anyone explain to me why we aren't simply relying on the finally blocks?\nWhen there is an uncaught exception thrown by any of the internal critical threads, QuourmPeer doesn't have any mechanism to know that internal error state. He still continue with the #readPacket(). For example,  [Follower.java#L88|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Follower.java#L88] will continue reading without knowing that error. To execute the finally blocks there should be a way to stop this reading logic. So as part of ZOOKEEPER-1907 design discussions, the point has come up to introduce a listening mechanism which will take action and gracefully bring down the QuourmPeer. This made another execution path that change the state of the server.\n\nbq. If we can do it, I'd much rather have this option implemented rather than multiple code paths that change the state of the server.\nI understand your point. How about introducing a polling mechanism at QuorumPeer. Presently ZooKeeperServerListener is taking the decision to shutdown the server, instead of this ZooKeeperServerListener will just mark the internal error state only. Later while polling QuorumPeer will see this error and exits the loop gracefully.\n\nThe idea is something like, ZooKeeper server will maintain an {{internalErrorState}}, which will be then used by the QuorumPeer while reading the packet. If QuorumPeer sees an error then will break and executes the finally block. On the other side, all the threads will use ZooKeeperServerListener. He will listen the unexpected errors and notify the QuourmPeer about that error by setting {{zk.setInternalErrorState(true)}} to true.\n\nQuourmPeer should have a logic like,\n{code}\n    while (self.isRunning() && !zk.hasInternalError()) {\n        readPacket(qp);\n        processPacket(qp);\n    }\n{code}\n\nSimilar polling mechanism has to be introduced at the standalone server [ZooKeeperServerMain.java#L149|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/ZooKeeperServerMain.java#L149] as well.\n\nI don't think we need to worry about the other internal exceptions which can occur before the ZK server enters into the #readPacket() state [Follower.java#L88|https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/quorum/Follower.java#L88]. I hope all these errors will come out and stops the server gracefully. Please correct me if I'm missing any other cases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-01-25T04:48:25.527+0000","updated":"2016-01-25T04:48:25.527+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12856158/comment/15115230","id":"15115230","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"[~rakesh_r] It sounds ok to add to the predicate a call to {{!zk.hasInternalError()}} as you propose, but why can't we simply make {{self.isRunning()}} return false in the case of an error by setting running to false?

It sounds like using {{QuorumPeer.isRunning()}} as is with follower, observer, learner, and leader isn't great because there are scenarios (like the one discussed here) in which we want to shutdown a participant/observer, but not the quorum peer. We may want to have a {{isRunning()}} for the follower, observer, learner, and leader classes that returns something like {{running && !zk.hasInternalError()}}. We may need to implement a {{isRunning()}} method for each one of those classes because they might eventually have different predicates to determine whether they are running or not. \n\nDoes it make sense?

Standalone mode puts the main thread straight into {{ServerCnxnFactory#join}}, which does not react to these internal errors and therefore does not shut down.  Ensemble mode puts the main thread into {{QuorumPeer#join}}, and {{QuorumPeer#run}} has a polling loop that is equipped to react to these internal errors.\n\nWhat if {{ZooKeeperServerMain}} was changed so that the main thread was put into a polling loop, similar to {{QuorumPeer}}?  Essentially, I think this means taking the current patch's {{HealthMonitor}} code and putting it inline with the main thread's execution of {{ZooKeeperServerMain#runFromConfig}} before it tries to join.

If there has been an error that made the server stop, then it isn't running, even if the state is {{RUNNING}}. There are a couple of options I see to fix this:\n\n# We add a new state {{ERROR}}, which means that the server is in this limbo state, it isn't shut down but came across an internal error that made it stop. If the server is in this state, then we proceed with the shutdown logic you mention above. We would make the server transition to this state when we hit an error, and if we do it, then I think we don't need the {{hasInternalError()}} call any longer.\n# We add a call like {{isStateRunning()}}, which is basically {{return state == State.RUNNING}}. If we do this, then we are essentially saying that {{isRunning()}} determines whether the server is running or not by checking the state and the internal error flag, while {{isStateRunning()}} simply determines whether the state of the server is {{State.RUNNING}}. We replace the {{if(!isRunning()}} in the code you mentioned above with {{if(!isStateRunning())}}.\n\nOption 1 sounds cleaner to me, but happy to hear opinions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-02-02T19:12:05.754+0000","updated":"2016-02-02T19:12:05.754+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12856158/comment/15129196","id":"15129196","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

If there is an internal error\n            // then will do a graceful shutdown.\n            while (zkServer.isStateRunning()) {\n                try {\n                    Thread.sleep(1000); // watch interval\n                } catch (InterruptedException ie) {\n                    LOG.info(\"Thread interrupted\");\n                }\n            }\n{code}\n\nIt's generally an anti-pattern to swallow {{InterruptedException}}, even though there is a lot of existing code in ZooKeeper and other codebases that does it.

After changing the state, it\n+     * notifies the server state change to a registered shutdown handler,\n+     * if any.\n+     * <p>\n+     * The following are the server state transitions:\n+     * <li>During startup the server will be in the INITIAL state.</li>\n+     * <li>After successfully starting, the server sets the state to\n+     * RUNNING.</li>\n+     * <li> The server transitions to the ERROR state if it hits an internal error.\n+     * {@link ZooKeeperServerListenerImpl} notifies any critical resource error\n+     * events, e.g., SyncRequestProcessor not being able to write a txn to disk.</li>\n+     * <li>During shutdown the server sets the state to SHUTDOWN, which\n+     * corresponds to the server not running.</li>\n+     *\n+     * @param state new server state.\n+     */\n{noformat}\n\nThe same for the javadoc of {{ZooKeeperServerShutdownHandler}}:\n\n{noformat}\n+/**\n+ * ZooKeeper server shutdown handler which will be used to handle ERROR or\n+ * SHUTDOWN server state transitions, which in turn releases the associated shutdown\n+ * latch.\n+ */\n{noformat}\n\nFinally, in {{waitForNewLeaderElection}}, would you mind setting the {{Thread.sleep}} to sleep for only 100ms each time? Not sure if we need to increase the counter, but I'd rather reduce the duration of each iteration.\n\nOtherwise, it looks very good, thanks for bearing with all the comments and working hard to get it in good shape.
