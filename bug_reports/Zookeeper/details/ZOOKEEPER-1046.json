In past runs, I've been able to closely inspect the state of the system with the command line client, and saw that the parent znode's cversion is smaller than the sequential number of existing children znode under that parent.  In one example:\n\n{noformat}\n[zk:<ip:port>(CONNECTED) 3] stat /zkrsm\ncZxid = 0x5\nctime = Mon Jan 17 18:28:19 PST 2011\nmZxid = 0x5\nmtime = Mon Jan 17 18:28:19 PST 2011\npZxid = 0x1d819\ncversion = 120710\ndataVersion = 0\naclVersion = 0\nephemeralOwner = 0x0\ndataLength = 0\nnumChildren = 2955\n{noformat}\n\nHowever, the znode /zkrsm/000000000000002d_record0000120804 existed on disk.\n\nIn a recent run, I was able to capture the Zookeeper logs, and I will attach them to this JIRA.  The logs are named as nodeX.<zxid_prefixes>.log, and each new log represents an application process restart.\n\nHere's the scenario:\n\n# There's a cluster with nodes 1,2,3 using zxid 0x3.\n# All three nodes restart, forming a cluster of zxid 0x4.\n# Node 3 restarts, leading to a cluster of 0x5.\n\nAt this point, it seems like node 1 is the leader of the 0x5 epoch.  In its log (node1.0x4-0x5.log) you can see the first (of many) instances of the following message:\n\n{noformat}\n2011-04-11 21:16:12,607 16649 [ProcessThread:-1] INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.PrepRequestProcessor  - Got user-level KeeperException when processing sessionid:0x512f466bd44e0002 type:create cxid:0x4da376ab zxid:0xfffffffffffffffe txntype:unknown reqpath:n/a Error Path:/zkrsm/00000000000000b2_record0001761440 Error:KeeperErrorCode = NodeExists for /zkrsm/00000000000000b2_record0001761440\n{noformat}\n\nThis then repeats forever as my application isn't expecting to ever get this error message on a sequential node create, and just continually retries.  The message even transfers over to node3.0x5-0x6.log once the 0x6 epoch comes into play.\n\nI don't see anything terribly fishy in the transition between the epochs; the correct snapshots seem to be getting transferred, etc.  Unfortunately I don't have a ZK snapshot/log that exhibits the problem when starting with a fresh system.\n\nSome oddities you might notice in these logs:\n* Between epochs 0x3 and 0x4, the zookeeper IDs of the nodes changed due to a bug in our application code.  (They are assigned randomly, but are supposed to be consistent across restarts.)\n* We manage node membership dynamically, and our application restarts the ZooKeeperServer classes whenever a new node wants to join (without restarting the entire application process).  This is why you'll see messages like the following in node1.0x4-0x5.log before a new election begins:\n{noformat}\n2011-04-11 21:16:00,762 4804 [QuorumPeer:/0.0.0.0:2888] INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Learner  - shutdown called\n{noformat}\n* There is in fact one of these dynamic membership changes in node1.0x4-0x5.log, just before the 0x4 epoch is formed.  I'm not sure how this would be related though, as no transactions are done during this period.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12483386","id":"12483386","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-1046_2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin

I believe what is happening is the following:\n\nYour code is creating and deleting large numbers of sequential nodes. At time T, it is in the process of deleting a bunch of nodes when ZK decides to take a snapshot of the state.\n\nWhen we take a snapshot, we spawn a separate thread and serialize the nodes of the tree in that thread. We get into your /zkrsm node in DataTree.serializeNode, get that node from the tree, synchronize on it, and write out the record of that node including its current cversion (used to generate sequential node information) and the list of children. However, we then release the sync on that node, and attempt to iterate through the children to serialize them out. In the meantime, the other thread is merrily deleting children of this node, increasing the cversion of /zkrsm all the while. So the list of children that we got while serializing the parent is defunct. When we try to serialize these now-deleted children, we see that they are null and continue on.\n\nNow, you finish this snapshot, delete some more nodes under /zkrsm, create some more sequential nodes under /zkrsm, and crash. When you start back up again, you read that snapshot and start playing through the log transactions after the snapshot zxid. Unfotunately, the first N transactions in your log after the snapshot zxid are deletions of nodes that didn't make it into the snapshot because you deleted them before they could be serialized to the snapshot. We will try to process the delete transaction and get a NoNodeException, but ignore it because we know that can happen due to what I wrote above. But what we don't do is increment the cversion of the parent node after this failed deletion. So our parent's cversion is less than the version it would be if you played just the transaction log through, or of the system before the crash. Now you want to continue creating sequential nodes where you left off, but your cversion is wrong so you try to create a node that already exists. Whoops.\n\nSo, now we just need to fix it. Should we be incrementing the cversion of the parent even on a NoNode exception during txn log replay? I suspect that is the right thing to do.

ZkDataBase.processTxn() will always set the flag to false. FileTxnSnapLog.processTransaction() will always set the flag to true. We will also need to add third argument to DataTree.processTxn().\n\nQuestions for Camille:\n- Why does this have to be in DataTree.deleteNode() and cannot be part of exception handling at the higher layer? Isn't this a special case for Txn exception handling rather than deleting the node from DT?\n- You mentioned that your test resulted in overwriting the nodes instead of causing NODEXIST.

Previously, DataTree.processTxn() did not return error if\ncreate/delete failed with nodeexist/nonode exception (the if condition\nwas a bit strange also). I think we should not do this. Per my\nunderstanding, such a failure can occur only when we are replaying the\ntransactions. It should not occur when the server is doing live\ntransactions (unless there is a bug). So processTxn should return\nerror even in this case to the caller. The caller should decided\nwhether to ignore these errors or not. In FileTxnSnapLog we handle the\nerror by incrementing cversion of the parent. In FinalRequestProcessor\nwe do not do anything special, but we do not ignore the error as well.\n\n2. We could increment cversion in DeleteNode itself (as I mentioned in\nmy previous comment). But I think changes in the attached patch is a\nbetter approach. I would like to confirm whether not incrementing\ncversion in DeleteNode() is going to introduce any synchronization\nissue (since the lock on the parent will be released and then\nreacquired). I don't think there is any problem here, but it will be\ngood if you can confirm this.\n\nI noticed that the same bug can occur while creating a node as\nwell. Patch handles create and delete.\n\nI was able to test this patch using the snapshots and logs that Jermey\nhad attached. I had to revert the logs to the state where this bug\nwould be seen the first time. I ended up doing: rm \\*.1d8\\* \\*.1d9\\*\n\nThen I can see that \"create -s /zkrsm/000000000000002d_record test\"\nsucceeds with this patch (and fails without).\n\nI have not thought about writing a test for this yet (sounds complex to me).\n\nThanks.\n-Vishal\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-05-06T16:08:13.623+0000","updated":"2011-05-06T16:08:13.623+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12504115/comment/13029992","id":"13029992","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Submitting path for trunk.
