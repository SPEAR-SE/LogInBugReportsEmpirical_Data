eventThread isn't shutdown after a connection \"session expired\" event coming (i.e. never receive EventOfDeath).\n\nWhen a session timeout occurs and the session is marked as expired, the connexion is fully closed (socket, SendThread...) expect for the eventThread.\nAs a result, if i create a new zookeeper object and connect through it, I got a zombi thread which will never be kill (as for the previous zookeeper object, the state is already close, calling close again don't do anything).\n\nSo everytime I will create a new zookeeper connection after a expired session, I will have a one more zombi EventThread.\n\nHow to reproduce :\n- Start a zookeeper client connection in debug mode\n- Pause the jvm enough time to the expired event occur\n- Watch for example with jvisualvm the list of threads, the sendThread is succesfully killed, but the EventThread go to wait state for a infinity of time\n- if you reopen a new zookeeper connection, and do again the previous steps, another
