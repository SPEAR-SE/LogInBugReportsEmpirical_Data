Because TLS is on a different port (secureClientPort) than the four letter words port (clientPort), we can then put clientPort behind a firewall which effectively makes only admin (or whoever that's trusted) can execute four letter words.\n\nThis however does not address the issues completely, because TLS is only supported since ZooKeeper 3.5.1 so it would not work for 3.4.x. Also even with TLS presence, it might still be possible that a ZooKeeper ensemble is attacked as long as the ensemble is open to the world: we don't have rate limiting built in, so if a set of rogue clients making connection requests, when in large scale, could possibly keep ensemble too busy to serve other requests. Although we do have IP based authentication scheme we don't have any rate limiters implemented to enforce accesses in such case.\n\nI believe the original design consideration for ZooKeeper was that ZooKeeper ensembles should only be accessible from a trusted computing environment instead of opening to the world. This design decision made perfect sense in the Hadoop context but might not be ideal given today's thread models (e.g., it is never safe to trust any network communication, attackers exist inside the corporate network, and so on.). As such, we may need to change the assumption on where ZooKeeper is going to be deployed and operated, but before that, to address this specific issue documented in the JIRA, we could do a combination of:\n\n* As Patrick suggested, add configurations options to turn off four letter words and / or specific commands.\n* Document explicitly the recommended security practice on deploy and operate ZooKeeper - basically admin should not leave the ZK wide open to the world.\n\nI think a patch contain both should be enough for resolving the current issue.\n\nIn long term, we need reevaluate the design decisions and security thread models and to bridge the gap between the current design and what ZooKeeper is actually used in prod today (e.g. adding rate limiter, enforced access control, not just for TLS but also for Kerberos, like what ZOOKEEPER-1634 is trying to solve.).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2017-02-14T05:27:07.269+0000","updated":"2017-02-14T05:27:07.269+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13042793/comment/15865958","id":"15865958","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I had another thought on how to handle this - rather than on/off we could limit the number of 4lw that would be allowed to run in parallel.

Can we restrict 4lw commands based on IP By default we can allow access to the IP on which server is running.\n[~arshad.mohammad] Thanks for feedback, this is one way of addressing the issue. I still prefer the current command white list approach because:\n* It has a smaller scope than the IP-restriction based approach. It is simpler, less cases to test, and easier to understand.\n* One case about IP based approach - what if the access point which IP is white listed gets compromised and admins are not aware of such case (so reconfigure the IP white list will not be done in time)? In that case, this exploit is still possible from the compromised and white listed access point. On the other side, the command white list approach does not have this issue, if the watcher monitoring commands listed in this issue are not white listed, there is no way to exploit. \n\nOverall I think the IP white list approach is a nice to have as it provides the option to use the entire sets of commands while mitigating the potential risk of being exploited - while the command white list approach is a must have based on my previous arguments.

Since we have plans to deprecate 4lws in branch-3.5, we could find alternative ways instead of using {{srvr, isro}} cmd internally. Probably, we could raise separate jira task and handle this case. \n[~hanm], could you create a PR for branch-3.4, if no objection from anyone about {{whitelist}} idea and that would help to unblock 3.4.10 releasing.\n \n{{case-2}}, I like [~phunt]'s idea of introducing configuration to limit the number of 4lw that would be allowed to run in parallel. For example, allows only 1-n number of 4lw cmds to run in parallel.

Then, check whether that the connected server is in {{rw}} mode and act upon.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2017-02-24T04:37:06.879+0000","updated":"2017-02-24T04:37:06.879+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13042793/comment/15884539","id":"15884539","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanm","name":"hanm","key":"hanm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hanm&avatarId=26946"},"displayName":"Michael Han","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"body":"Patch updated following proposal 1 for branch-3.5 (put isro and srvr in white list by default.).

disabled by default, for branch-3.4 only \"wchp\" and \"wchc\" are disabled by default - since 4lw is widely used and there is no alternatives in branch-3.4 so we just disable the exploitable ones.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/hanm/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2693-br-3.4\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these
