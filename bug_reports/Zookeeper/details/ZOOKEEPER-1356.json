This limits the ability to remove/change a server node from a zookeeper cluster, without having to restart every client. Also, two levels of IP caching, one in the JVM and one in the zookeeper client code seems unnecessar.\n\nIt would be ideal to provide a config option that would turn off this IP caching in the client and re-resolve the host names during the reconnect.
