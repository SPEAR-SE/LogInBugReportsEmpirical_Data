In 3.4, the leader syncs with the learner in LearnerHandler.run as follows (very abridged edition):\n1. Leader sends diff/snapshot/whatever\n2. Leader sends NEWLEADER\n2. Leader waits for ACK from learner\n3. Leader sends UPTODATE\n\nLearner.syncWithLeader then looks very roughly like:\n1. Learner receives diff/snapshot/whatever\n2. Learner receives NEWLEADER\n3. Learner sends ACK to leader\n4. Learner waits for UPTODATE\n5. Learner sends another ACK\n(2 and 3 are optional for backwards compatibility)\n\n\nHowever, in 3.3, LeaderHandler.run looks like:\n2. Leader sends diff/snapshot/whatever\n3. Leader sends UPTODATE\n4. Leader waits for ACK from learner\n\nLikewise, on the Learner side (at least from 3.3.3 onward, which committed ZOOKEEPER-962 and ZOOKEEPER-882):\n2. Learner receives diff/snapshot/whatever\n3. Learner waits for UPTODATE\n4. Learner sends ACK\n\n(There's still some NEWLEADER business in 3.3, but it doesn't seem important so I didn't bother to figure it out)\n\n\nSo, in 3.4, the learner ACKS _before_ the leader sends UPTODATE, and in 3.3 the learner ACKS _after_ the leader sends UPTODATE. The result is that when a 3.3 learner syncs with a 3.4 leader, the leader gets stuck waiting for an ACK and the learner gets stuck waiting for an UPTODATE.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skye","name":"skye","key":"skye","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Skye Wanderman-Milne","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-12-08T00:27:00.529+0000","updated":"2012-12-08T00:27:00.529+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12622951/comment/13529249","id":"13529249","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=skye","name":"skye","key":"skye","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Skye Wanderman-Milne","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here's a potential fix, but I don't grok Zab well enough to say whether this will create new problems. This patch, which should be applied to 3.4, has the leader send an UPTODATE _before_ waiting for an ACK if the follower is running the old Zab protocol. This means the follower receives an UPTODATE before the leader ZK server starts (i.e., before the leader gets ACKs from a quorum of followers), which smells fishy to me, but maybe it's a better problem to have than the current one. FWIW, this is how the old Zab protocol worked too.\n\nAnother option would be to patch 3.3 to speak Zab 1.0. This seems less useful though since you'd have to upgrade 3.3 before safely upgrading to 3.4.

Assuming that the 3.4 leader has enough 3.4 followers supporting it, any 3.3 follower that gets stuck will eventually be upgraded. Does it make sense? If so, what we are discussing here is not an issue unless you want to have a mix of 3.3 and 3.4 servers for some other reason that is not a rolling upgrade.

But in general and also in the context of 1495 I think it might be better simply not to allow a follower of an earlier version to connect to a leader of a later version, rather than to allow it to connect and then drop out of the \nquorum if there's something it doesn't understand. The reason is that at this point the follower might have already participated in commits with the 3.4 leader, and may be needed for safety (so it can't be a follower but we do count on its state for safety, which is weird to me). Moreover, its possible for example that the 3.4 leader has already processed a multi command (or some other new command like reconfiguration) by the time the 3.3 follower joins and then the follower will have to quit during catchup/state-transfer, so in general you don't guarantee availability in this case either. \n\n\nAlex\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-12-18T01:54:59.275+0000","updated":"2012-12-18T01:54:59.275+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12622951/comment/13534535","id":"13534535","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"actually in the case of reconfiguration 1495 is even a bit more problematic -- we have a new client-server command for reconfiguration, but we don't have a new server-to-server command, we just do setData and figure out that its actually a reconfiguration.

In the common rolling upgrade scenario ops typically upgrades the ensemble first, then the clients. So the case such as multi commands being run against 3.4 prior to the upgrade completing (ensemble), while something that can certainly happen, is up to the user and unlikely to happen if they follow our instructions. If they do so then they are outside the parameters of what we support. However in the common case all they want to do is upgrade the servers w/o service downtime. We should support this. We always have in the past, and we tell people that's a guarantee.\n\nRolling upgrade is important to allow upgrading the ensemble with high availability. The goal is to do it in a short period of time. The goal is not to mix clients using new features unsupported by the older servers.\n\nI agree with Alex, if we make a significant change such that it's not backward compatible we need to increment the major version number (and the protocol version).
