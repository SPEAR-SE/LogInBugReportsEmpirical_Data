We don't do anything similar to that in the C client code (that I'm aware of). Can someone explain how that is safe? If the client is connected to a server that does not have a fully sync'd copy of the database then the client may preemptively fail the multi-op whereas if it had forwarded the entire multi-op to the server it would have properly succeeded. \n\nIt's really important to understand that the original design we followed with a multi-op was to treat it as a transaction (write operation) rather than a read operation. As a transaction/write operation, it's my understanding of zab that we are required to forward the operation on to the leader rather than taking any action locally so that the leader can broadcast out the transaction to the entire ensemble for consideration. \n\nIf the client does any path validation locally that seems like a violation of the zab protocol as I understand it.\n\nSomeone feel free to correct me if I am misunderstanding things.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=marshall","name":"marshall","key":"marshall","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marshall McMullen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2013-12-17T05:02:31.893+0000","updated":"2013-12-17T05:02:31.893+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12541563/comment/13850153","id":"13850153","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~marshall] for the interest.\n\nAFAIK, the idea of path validation is to \"fail fast in the client side itself with user friendly error messages\". I think, this will not violate the zab protocol. Also, the path validation utility is used in all the other zookeeper.java client apis. \nSince the znode string path (user passed parameter) is not following the basic znode path principles, the operation will definitely fail in server side and will not goes to zab protocol logic. If we have this utility in place, this will do the validation in client side itself and give the proper error message. \n\nZookeeper java client has special path validation utility, which will do very basic validation of znode path string, like :\n- Path cannot be null\n- Path length must be > 0\n- Path must start with / character\n- Path must not end with / character \n- and many more..please see 'org.apache.zookeeper.common.PathUtils.java' for the understanding.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-12-17T06:09:09.289+0000","updated":"2013-12-17T06:09:09.289+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12541563/comment/13850156","id":"13850156","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=marshall","name":"marshall","key":"marshall","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marshall McMullen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"body":"Thanks [~rakeshr] that significantly clears things up.
