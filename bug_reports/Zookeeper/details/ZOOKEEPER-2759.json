It can be seen failing on Apache infra here: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-dev/201701.mbox/%3c374175863.2852.1485127554310.JavaMail.jenkins@crius%3e\n    \n    The problem can be \"reproduced\" by adding a `Thread.sleep(4000)` as the first line of the finally block   for `RecvWorker.run` in `QuorumCnxManager.java`.\n    \n    The issue is caused by a race condition between the removal of the relevant `sid` from `senderWorkerMap` for `peer0` and the 3 second delay from `assertEventuallyNotConnected`. \n    \n    Other tests in this class do not experience the same problem because `testNoAuthLearnerConnectToAuthRequiredServerWithHigherSid` is unique in that it is the only test using `assertEventuallyNotConnected` where the peer with the lower `sid` is not using SASL. This means that the peer with the lower `sid` will always create send and receive workers in `handleConnection` (as it will not throw an exception on `authServer.authenticate(sock, din)`) and may not destroy them in time for the test assertion.\n    \n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/afine/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2759\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/229.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #229\n    \n----\ncommit c567c494d116b6893e24e5b1b812a6ff24791614\nAuthor: Abraham Fine <afine@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-04-17T22:51:27Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2759: Flaky test:\n    org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManagerTest.testNoAuthLearnerConnectToAuthRequiredServerWithHigherSid\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-04-17T23:36:53.995+0000","updated":"2017-04-17T23:36:53.995+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13064524/comment/15971873","id":"15971873","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

I hope we have more contributors focus on improving the test.\n    \n    The proposed fix masks the real problem - it will always success no matter what - even if the connection was succeeded, since the halt will clean up the sender worker map of the peer 0.\n    \n    >>  a race condition between the removal of the relevant sid from senderWorkerMap for peer0 and the 3 second delay from assertEventuallyNotConnected.\n    I think there is a race, but my observation on it is slightly different. The race is between when peer 0 received (and finished) establish connection with peer 1, and the assert inside assertEventuallyNotConnected.\n    \n    >> may not destroy them in time for the test assertion.\n    Because of the race, once peer 0 has received the connection, its sender worker map will has sid 1 entry forever until the death of the peer 0 itself. \n    \n    I think instead of checking on peer 0, we can check peer 1. Its sender worker map should always be clean. We can't check peer 0 here because the current API does not encode the true state of the connection - it only encodes what happened (the connection from 1 to 0 was established on 0's side), but it does not encode the status of the connection (is the connection still alive or not - in this case peer 1 will close the socket later when it found out peer 0 has no auth. but on peer 0 side the sender work will have sid 1 inside until its death, what's done has been done.). The state of peer 1 wrt its sender map should also reflect state of peer 0  since there is only a single connection between 0 and 1.\n    \n    Something like this should serve the purpose:\n    assertEventuallyNotConnected(peer1, 0);\n    \n    Maybe add a sleep before it to make sure all the connection attempts were made (from 0  to 1 and from 1 to 0 two ways), but it's a best effort. 5 sec sounds enough.\n    \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-04-26T05:43:05.978+0000","updated":"2017-04-26T05:43:05.978+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13064524/comment/15985967","id":"15985967","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user afine commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/229\n  \n    @hanm thank you for the through review. you are right the original test is bogus.\n    \n    I wanted to write the test in a way that verifies behavior for both peers so I used mockito to spy on the sender worker maps.

org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManagerTest.testNoAuthLearnerConnectToAuthRequiredServerWithHigherSid\n\n    I noticed some inconsistent test results from `testNoAuthLearnerConnectToAuthRequiredServerWithHigherSid`. It can be seen failing on Apache infra here: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-dev/201701.mbox/%3c374175863.2852.1485127554310.JavaMail.jenkins@crius%3e\n    \n    The problem can be \"reproduced\" by adding a `Thread.sleep(4000)` as the first line of the finally block   for `RecvWorker.run` in `QuorumCnxManager.java`.\n    \n    The issue is caused by a race condition between the removal of the relevant `sid` from `senderWorkerMap` for `peer0` and the 3 second delay from `assertEventuallyNotConnected`. \n    \n    Other tests in this class do not experience the same problem because `testNoAuthLearnerConnectToAuthRequiredServerWithHigherSid` is unique in that it is the only test using `assertEventuallyNotConnected` where the peer with the lower `sid` is not using SASL. This means that the peer with the lower `sid` will always create send and receive workers in `handleConnection` (as it will not throw an exception on `authServer.authenticate(sock, din)`) and may not destroy them in time for the test assertion.\n    \n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/afine/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2759\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/229.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #229\n    \n----\ncommit c567c494d116b6893e24e5b1b812a6ff24791614\nAuthor: Abraham Fine <afine@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-04-17T22:51:27Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2759: Flaky test:\n    org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManagerTest.testNoAuthLearnerConnectToAuthRequiredServerWithHigherSid\n\ncommit 112a70ba14f5cbb94e301702b328acfff54b0b02\nAuthor: Abraham Fine <afine@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-04-27T03:56:01Z\n\n    fix tests with mockito\n\ncommit 55869fac9d0f99eb52156c889e1b5a76424047f6\nAuthor: Abraham Fine <afine@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-04-27T20:05:00Z\n\n    add some comments\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-04-28T02:08:39.387+0000","updated":"2017-04-28T02:08:39.387+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13064524/comment/15988102","id":"15988102","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
