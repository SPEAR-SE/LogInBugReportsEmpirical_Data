I think it's acceptable to take the examples in the Python manual as canonical, so I support reinstating that line. \n\nThe patch is simple, but I'm not sure how best to test it.  Perhaps forcing an exception pointer to NULL via a C module call, but then that would pollute the object's namespace. A test module that wasn't shipped, but built for testing?

Try as I might, I haven't yet got a gc collection to dispose of the exception object and therefore trigger potential segfaults when the zookeeper module raises.
