Any thoughts or better suggestion would be appreciated.\n\n*Proposal-1*\nThe main reason for the READY state transition is due to the multiple offer (ephemeral node) creation, so the successive starts can have validation logic by checking the existence of the ephemeral node which would be created during the previous startup. If exists, return by giving warning msg.\n\nThe same logic can be applied to the stop() api also. Here if the ephemeral node exists, it can allow the stop execution logic. Otherwise return by giving warn msg.\n\n*Proposal-2*\nDuring startup, after the successful creation of offer it can set the ‘running’ flag to true and all the further startup will be validated.\nDuring stop after the successful deletion of the offer it will reset the ‘running’ flag to false. If running==true, it can allow the stop otherwise just give warn message.\n\n*Note:* In the case if the LES is in FAILED state, then user has to explicitly stop() the LES and starts again. So the previous offer(ephemeral will be deleted).\n\nI feel the +first approach+ is better, because let’s say if the zookeeper session got expired, here the client node can create new zookeeper session and simply starts. \nBut in the +second approach+ user has to explicitly stop() and then start(). Also when stopping it will fail since the session got expired and goes to FAILED state transitions.\n\n\nThanks,\nRakesh\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2011-10-13T12:30:07.946+0000","updated":"2011-10-13T12:30:07.946+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12527001/comment/13126580","id":"13126580","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Attached the patch based on the *proposal-1* : provided start & stop validation logics by checking whether the offer (ephemeral node) exists or not.
