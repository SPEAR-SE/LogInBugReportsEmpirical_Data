It looks like the ZK Client won't be disconnected from Follower until session is closed and any ZooKeeper operation will fail with SessionMovedException before session is closed.\nAlso since ZK Leader already closed the socket connection/session to ZK Client at step 3, why it still reject the ZooKeeper operation from client with SessionMovedException. Will it be better to endorse the session/connection between ZK client and ZK Follower? This seems like a bug to me.
