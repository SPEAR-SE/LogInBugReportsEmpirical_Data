about system file descriptors (this is actually what the interface com.sun.management.UnixOperatingSystemMXBean does). When calling one of those methods in OSMXBean, it will identify which java vendor the system is using. \n\nIf it's Sun, it uses reflections to load the sun interface and it calls the methods as it does in the code today.\n\nHowever, if it's IBM java, the OSMXBean execute runtime system calls to get the information needed (number of open file descriptors or maximum allowed). Since i'm using system calls, the commands are Linux specific, so the class also checks the OS.\n\nI'm adding the patch soon, but I wanted to check beforehand if there are any concerns with that implementation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adalbas","name":"adalbas","key":"adalbas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Adalberto Medeiros","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-07-04T18:23:33.919+0000","updated":"2012-07-04T18:23:33.919+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12558607/comment/13426185","id":"13426185","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sounds reasonable to me Adalberto.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-31T22:39:07.805+0000","updated":"2012-07-31T22:39:07.805+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12558607/comment/13437822","id":"13437822","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=claudef","name":"claudef","key":"claudef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Claude Falbriard","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Dear colleagues, \nThe same error also happens under the IBM Java s390x platform: \nmvn assembly:assembly -DskipTests -Prelease\nhbase source build fails - error missing com.sunmanagement package \n                                         class UnixOperatingSystemMXBean\n\n package com.sun.management does not exist\ncannot find symbol\n[ERROR] symbol  : class UnixOperatingSystemMXBean\n[ERROR] location: class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ResourceChecker.ResourceAnalyzer\n\nA build from source is needed to fix the authentication run-time error\nwhich currently loads the LinuxPrincipal (defered) class in place of the newer UsernamePrincipal class.
