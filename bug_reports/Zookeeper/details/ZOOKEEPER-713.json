Machines in zookeeper cluster gone wild and all clients got disconnected.\nWe tried to restart whole zookeeper cluster but cluster got stuck in leader election phase.\n\nCalling stat command on any machine in the cluster resulted in 'ZooKeeperServer not running' message\nIn one of logs I noticed 'Invalid snapshot'  message which disturbed me a bit.\n\nWe did not manage to make cluster work again with data. We deleted all version-2 directories on all nodes and then cluster started up without problems.\nIs it possible that snapshot/log data got corrupted in a way which made cluster unable to start?\nFortunately we could rebuild data we store in zookeeper as we use it only for locks and most of nodes is ephemeral.\n\nI am attaching contents of version-2 directory from all nodes and server logs.\nSource problem occurred some time before 15. First cluster restart happened at 15:03.\nAt some point later we experimented with deleting version-2 directory so I would not look at following restart because they can be misleading due to our actions.\n\nI am also attaching zoo.cfg. Maybe something is wrong at this place. \nAs I know look into logs i see read timeout during initialization phase after 20secs (initLimit=10, tickTime=2000).\nMaybe all I have to do is increase one or other. which one? Are there any downsides of increasing tickTime.\n\nBest regards, Łukasz Osipiuk\n\nPS. due to attachment size limit I used split. to untar use \ncat nodeX-version-2.tgz-* |tar -xz\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12439176","id":"12439176","filename":"node1-version-2.tgz-aa","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=losipiuk","name":"losipiuk","key":"losipiuk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34047","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34047","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34047","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34047"},"displayName":"Lukasz

Could be this, could be virtualization, intermittent network problems? ... any sound possible.\n\n> One more question - Is it normal that zookeeper consumed 0.5G of memory handling such small snapshot?\n\nIf you look at that troubleshooting page you'll see a link to the latency overview http://bit.ly/4ekN8G Notice this used a heap size of 512m with 1.6.0_05 jvm. I was creating a large number of znodes and watches and it worked fine - with 20 client case I'm creating 200k znodes (20mb) and 1 million watches.\n\nI don't know what might be taking the memory in your case (not knowing the use cases, znode count, avg size, etc...) but you can get more insight using something like visualvm or jconsole. Try attaching to the running VM and take a look.\n\n> I will consider building newer java deb package myself but I would rather treat is a last resort. Do you really think newer java version could help?\n\nI wouldn't try that as a first option. It's something we noticed and wanted to mention in case it was easy to try.\n\nDo take a look at the troubleshooting page - adding some monitoring of the jvm might help to provide insight. Also monitoring of the parameters that ZooKeeper itself makes avail through the command port and JMX. Also some of the other issues there have been faced by more than one user and might be helpful.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-03-18T23:14:13.526+0000","updated":"2010-03-18T23:14:13.526+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459532/comment/12847251","id":"12847251","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"One other thing that I thought of.
