(you are using 3.2.2 where it's not fixed)\n\nZK provides very strong durability guarantees, and needs to wait for fsync to complete before it responds to a write request with \"success\". I've seen the fsync take significant amounts of time depending on IO load, kernel, filesyste, etc...\n\nEven though your client isn't doing work, pings are still sent in the b/g. These should not cause a forced disk sync, but they are forcing a sync due to this bug 568. As a result we need to wait for the disk sync to complete before replying to the ping, as you are loading the disk this is taking time. If it takes longer than 3.3 seconds (1/3 the timeout) the client will timeout. (10 sec will cause expiration)\n\nCan you retry this using zookeeper 3.3.1?\n\nBTW, You can monitor server latency using the following: http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkCommands\nspecifically the \"stat\" command.

My results are fairly similar (I don't have hard numbers for comparison though). I still experience disconnects and session timeouts even though {{dd}} transfers at only 5Mb per second.\n\nI have had improvements in stability with this test by adjusting the following:\n{noformat}\necho 5 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio\necho 5 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio\n{noformat}\n\nThese settings are sufficient to get stability on this simple test.\n\nI'll work on getting some more concrete comparisons of zookeeper-3.2.2 and zookeeper-3.3.1.\n\nThe output of the \"stat\" command seems reasonable (0/10/91) during {{dd}}. It seems to me that the zookeeper server runs fairly well for a period of time, and then hits a period of instability, and then recovers again. Are pings also counted for server latency?\n\nI suspect that IO scheduling / buffering may be partly responsible for the problem, and hence started testing the effect of {{dirty_ratio}} etc. At this stage I am presuming that {{dd}} manages to write a fair amount of data before the data is actually flushed to disk, and that when it is flushed all processes attempting to write to the device are stalled until the flush completes.\n\nWhat is unclear to me at this point, is what gets written to disk?

I think that the speed at which this queue is processed determines how likely it is that zookeeper will fail to respond to a ping.\n\nPlease also see responses to Patrick's questions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahardy","name":"ahardy","key":"ahardy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexandre Hardy","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-10-15T06:29:17.595+0000","updated":"2010-10-15T06:29:17.595+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475625/comment/12921251","id":"12921251","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahardy","name":"ahardy","key":"ahardy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexandre Hardy","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Hi Patrick,\n\n{quote}\n1) you are applying the load using dd to all three servers at the same time, is that correct? (not just to 1 server)\n{quote}\nCorrect. If {{dd}} is run on only one machine then the likelihood of disconnects is reduced. Unfortunately our typical scenario would involve load on all three machines.\n\n{quote}\n2) /dev/mapper indicates some sort of lvm setup, can you give more detail on that? (fyi http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=646340)\n{quote}\nYes, we have an lvm setup on a single spindle. The nimbula-test logical volume is 10G in size and (obviously) shares the same spindle as root and log (/var/log) partitions. \n\n{quote}\n3) you mentioned that this:\n\n    echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio\n    echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio\n\nresulting in \"stability in this test\", can you tell us what this was set to initially?\n\nCheckout this article: http://lwn.net/Articles/216853/\n{quote}\n\nThe initial value for {{/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio}} is 20, an the initial value for {{/proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio}} is 10. These machines have 1G of RAM, and thus are less susceptible\nto the problems mentioned in http://lwn.net/Articles/216853/ (as I see it). I have run a more complete benchmark with random IO instead of {{dd}} sequential IO testing session timeouts, and the effect of {{dirty_ratio}} settings. I will attach that separately. {{dirty_ratio}} seems to help with the {{dd}} test but has much less influence in the random IO test.\n\n{quote}\nI notice you are running a \"bigmem\" kernel. What's the total memory size? How large of a heap have to assigned to the ZK server? (jvm)\n{quote}\nWe have 1G on each machine in this test system and 100M heap size for each zookeeper server.\n\n{quote}\n4) Can you verify whether or not the JVM is swapping? Any chance that the server JVM is swapping, which is causing the server to pause, which then causes the clients to time out? This seems to me like it would fit the scenario - esp given that when you turn the \"dirty_ratio\" down you see stability increase (the time it would take to complete the flush would decrease, meaning that the server can respond before the client times out).\n{quote}\nI'm not entirely sure of all the JVM internals, but all swap space on the linux system was disabled. So no swapping based on the linux kernel would happen. I'm not sure if the JVM does any swapping of its own?\nI concur with your analysis. What puzzles me is why the system would even get into a state where the zookeeper server would have to wait so long for a disk flush? In the case of {{dd if=/dev/urandom}} the IO rate is quite low, and there should (I think) be more than enough IOPS available for zookeeper to flush data to disk in time. Even if the IO scheduling results in this scenario, it is still not clear to me why zookeeper would fail to respond to a ping. My only conclusion at this stage is that responding to a ping requires information to be flushed to disk. Is this correct?\n\nReferring to your private e-mail:\n{quote}\n> The weird thing here is that there should be no delay for these pings.\n{quote}\nThis would indicate to me that the ping response should not be dependent on any disk IO.\n\nThanks for all the effort in looking into this!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahardy","name":"ahardy","key":"ahardy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexandre Hardy","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-10-15T06:48:35.866+0000","updated":"2010-10-15T06:48:35.866+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475625/comment/12921253","id":"12921253","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahardy","name":"ahardy","key":"ahardy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexandre Hardy","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Here are some results with different settings of {{dirty_ratio}}, {{dirty_bytes}} (finer control), session timeouts, and io priorities (set with {{ionice}}). \n\nThe status field indicates success or failure, 0=success and anything else is failure.\nWhere failure means a zookeeper session disconnected (but did not necessarily expire).\n\nEach test ran for a maximum of 5 minutes.

On my setup with 6 second session timeout, the client doesn't get disconnected even with 100% disk utilization (using iostat) when there is no write traffic to ZooKeeper. When there is write traffic, the connection starts becoming flaky around 80~90% disk utilization.\n\nWe could make the disconnect timeout (2/3 of the session timeout) configurable. The client can keep sending ping to avoid session expiry even if the ping responses get blocked behind a slow write because the session timestamp gets updated as soon as the server receives the ping request. You could also have an additional mechanism for detecting server failures using a 4 letter word command, although this would put additional load to the server.\n\nI don't have bandwidth to do this for 3.5.0 though.

It's happening mostly at the beginning of an hour i.e at the 2nd or the 3rd second.\n2. Some of the client (mirror makers/brokers/consumers) connections get dropped stating that server is unresponsive for 4000ms.\n\n[06/04/2016:12:00:03 PDT] [INFO] [org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn main-SendThread(<zookeeperHost>:2181)]: Client session timed out, have not heard from server in 4000ms for sessionid 0x153c64c806416a8, closing socket connection and attempting reconnect\n\n3. It leads to EndOfStreamExceptions combined with CancelledKeyException in the Zookeeper logs.\n\nFrom the discussion in the thread above, we looked at the following things:\n1. We looked at the no. of established connections to each zookeeper at every second for few hours. This was done to identify whether there was a spike in the no. of new connections at the start of an hour which could cause the zookeeper queue to fill up and hence, not respond to pings.\n\nThere was no spike at the hour boundaries.\n\n2. We looked at the the disk usage for all the zookeepers to verify whether there was a I/O spike at the hour boundaries which could be causing the fsync to delay and hence, making the server unresponsive.\n\nNo such thing was observed. Data in/out rate remained normal throughout the hour.\n\n3. Looked at the logs of zookeeper to see whether there was anything different happening at the end of the previous hour or start of the current hour, which could explain the unresponsiveness. \n\nNo luck there as well.\n\n4. We are using a RollingFileAppender for zookeeper logs performs hourly rolling and the archive directory share the same disk with the dataDir. To verify whether this was the cause, we changed the rolling frequency to once per day and still observed EndOfStreamExceptions at the start of every hour.\n\n5. We looked at the GC dump using verbose:gc and the GC times are almost constant (~.13 seconds) throughout the day.\n\n6. We are observing this behavior only in one of our data centers in spite of more data flowing in and out of the unaffected data center\n\nWorries:\n\n1. 2 weeks back, we had 4 controller switches (Kafka) in a day for the associated Kafka cluster, all of them at the beginning of the hour. This pushed the cluster into an unhealthy state where significant no. of partitions went offline. Controller state is stored in zookeeper and we suspect this unresponsiveness to be the cause of the switch.\n\n2. Since it's happening consistently at the beginning of the hour, we want to narrow down to the cause and work on it as we are about to get even more clients deployed. If the suggestion is to expand the ensemble, we will be happy to do that but we need some figures for devOps to justify the expansion.\n\nKindly advice what else we should look at.\nDo tell me if you need any other info to understand the problem better.\n\nThanx","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vidhu5269","name":"vidhu5269","key":"vidhu5269","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rahul Yadav","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-06T20:21:26.959+0000","updated":"2016-04-06T20:21:26.959+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12475625/comment/15229050","id":"15229050","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vidhu5269","name":"vidhu5269","key":"vidhu5269","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rahul Yadav","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"One more input:\n\nFollowing are the JVM params for zookeeper:\n\n/usr/local/jre7/bin/java \n-cp \n/tools/stow/zookeeper-3_3_6-20120803T1430/zookeeper/bin/../build/classes:\n/tools/stow/zookeeper-3_3_6-20120803T1430/zookeeper/bin/../build/lib/*.jar:\n/tools/stow/zookeeper-3_3_6-20120803T1430/zookeeper/bin/../zookeeper-3.3.6.jar:\n/tools/stow/zookeeper-3_3_6-20120803T1430/zookeeper/bin/../lib/jline-0.9.94.jar:\n/tools/stow/zookeeper-3_3_6-20120803T1430/zookeeper/bin/../src/java/lib/*.jar:\n/tools/config/current:/usr/local/lib/java/apache-log4j-1.2.17/log4j-1.2.17.jar:\n/usr/local/lib/java/apache-log4j-extras-1.1/apache-log4j-extras-1.1.jar \n-DprocessName=zookeeper \n-DlogLevel=INFO \n-server \n-verbose:gc \n-Xms28672m \n-Xmx28672m \n-XX:MaxNewSize=256m \n-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC \n-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=70 \n-XX:+PrintGCDetails \n-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps \n-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution \n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote \n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false \n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=5690 \norg.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerMain /path/to/conf/zoo.cfg\n\n*zookeeper-3_3_6-20120803T1430* is a platinized package for the standard Zookeeper (3.3.6) package","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vidhu5269","name":"vidhu5269","key":"vidhu5269","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rahul Yadav","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-06T20:35:40.004+0000","updated":"2016-04-06T20:35:40.004+0000"}],"maxResults":34,"total":34,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/ZOOKEEPER-885/votes","votes":3,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i05zdb:"}}
