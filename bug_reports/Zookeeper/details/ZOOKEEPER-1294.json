Now I have shutdown the Follower server, but the Leader is still in the LEADING state.

Setting up the ensemble the way we want it in the first place saves about 10s on my machine. \n\nI also added an extra assertion, a comment and simplified building the server list. If you're happy with this, I'll go ahead and commit it. \n\nThanks,\nHenry","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=henryr","name":"henryr","key":"henryr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henry Robinson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-01-11T23:35:01.407+0000","updated":"2012-01-11T23:35:01.407+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12530842/comment/13184589","id":"13184589","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

The call to ping() with that lock held then takes the lock on the leader object. \n\nIn the failing test runs, at the same time the ProposalRequestProcessor has locked the leader object in order to make a proposal in Leader.propose(). This then calls sendPacket, which (tries to) lock on forwardingFollowers. \n\nThis is a classic deadlock - the threads try to take the same locks in a different order. Although there are a few options, I think actually the patch *shouldn't* be changing the set to forwardingFollowers, but should be using learners as before. This is because observers should be pinged as well, I think, so that they don't think they're dead. Instead, the code should explicitly test whether a learner is a PARTICIPANT as below:\n\n{code}\nsynchronized (learners) {\n                    for (LearnerHandler f : learners) {\n                        if (f.synced() && f.getLearnerType() == LearnerType.PARTICIPANT) {\n                            syncedCount++;\n                            syncedSet.add(f.getSid());\n                        }\n                        f.ping();\n                    }\n                }\n{code}\n\nSo only learners get added to the sync set, but everyone gets pinged. This seems to fix the problem with this test, at least, for me.
