A lot of initialization work is performed here and if any of the initialization routines fails, the code jumps to the \"abort\" label to perform various cleanup tasks [1]. The conceptual issue is that a bunch of the cleanup code tries to take locks on the zk structure that are only intialized in adaptor_init in line 1181 (at the very end of the zookeeper_init_internal method) [2]. So if we fail before reaching adaptor_init this causes trouble.\n\nOne specific instance of an invalid memory access that this causes is in free_completions [3]. Here, in line 1651 zoo_lock_auth will fail because it tries to grab an invalid mutex, after which the a_list struct is uninitialized (the linked list next pointer points to random memory) and subsequently the free routine segfaults.\n\nAn easy way to trigger this bug-path is to pass an invalid hostname, or do anything else that causes the zookeeper_init_internal method to fail before adaptor_init.\n\nIn my local checkout/codebase, I have added correct initialization for the a_list struct in the free_completions routine, which at least fixes the segfault for now. However this still leaves the issue that the cleanup code tries to grab a lot of invalid locks, which all fail. I think in order to fix this properly, one would need to do a larger refactoring of the code (add another adaptor_preinit routine to the adaptor interface maybe?) and I wasn't sure if that would be appreciated, so I didn't attach a patch for now. If someone wants me to try and clean this up, I would be happy to give it a try.\n\nPS: I think this bug was introduced in SVN #1719528, which - as it seems - tried to work around the uninitialized locks problem by adding an int return code to all the lock_xxx functions, allowing them to indicate a failure. The change introduce the invalid memory access since some (always required) init code is only run after the lock was obtained successfully.\n\nHowever, I think there is a much large issue with the change and I think it must be reverted. Trying to lock an uninitialized mutex is undefined behaviour on POSIX and may lead to deadlocks, etc.\n\n>> If mutex does not refer to an initialized mutex object, the behavior of pthread_mutex_lock(), pthread_mutex_trylock(), and pthread_mutex_unlock() is undefined.\n\nhttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html\n\n[1] https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c#L1078\n[2] https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c#L1181\n[3] https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/trunk/src/c/src/zookeeper.c#L1651\n\n------------------\n\nBACKTRACE\n\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n\n0x000000010004f6d5 in free_auth_completion (a_list=0x7fff5fbff048) at /deps/3rdparty/zookeeper/source/src/zookeeper.c:260\n260             tmp = tmp->next;\n\n#0  0x000000010004f6d5 in free_auth_completion (a_list=0x7fff5fbff048) at /deps/3rdparty/zookeeper/source/src/zookeeper.c:260\n#1  0x000000010004f500 in free_completions (zh=0x1003022f0, callCompletion=1, reason=-116) at /deps/3rdparty/zookeeper/source/src/zookeeper.c:1219\n#2  0x0000000100057bfd in cleanup_bufs (zh=0x1003022f0, callCompletion=1, rc=-116) at /deps/3rdparty/zookeeper/source/src/zookeeper.c:1227\n#3  0x000000010004ee42 in destroy (zh=0x1003022f0) at /deps/3rdparty/zookeeper/source/src/zookeeper.c:393\n#4  0x000000010004eaf3 in zookeeper_init (host=0x1006005b0 \"xxxinvalidhostname:2181\", watcher=0x100007670 <xxx::zk_watch_cb(_zhandle*, int, int, char const*, void*)>, \n    recv_timeout=10000, clientid=0x0, context=0x100600350, flags=0) at /deps/3rdparty/zookeeper/source/src/zookeeper.c:877","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Invalid Memory Access (SEGFAULT) and undefined behaviour in c client","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paulasmuth","name":"paulasmuth","key":"paulasmuth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Asmuth","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paulasmuth","name":"paulasmuth","key":"paulasmuth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Asmuth","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12976382/comment/15331113","id":"15331113","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phunt","name":"phunt","key":"phunt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Hunt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~cnauroth], [~fpj], [~rgs] can you take a look at this?
