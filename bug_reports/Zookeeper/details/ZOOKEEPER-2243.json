It would be great if the community can consider declaring Windows to be part of the official supported platform list.\n\nRegarding the build, it looks like there is just a single Windows Jenkins host that can serve as executor for the job, and it appears to be offline.  This likely needs follow up with INFRA.  I'll aim to check with INFRA tomorrow, unless someone else beats me to it today.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-11T16:50:15.299+0000","updated":"2015-08-11T16:50:15.299+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12854088/comment/14682161","id":"14682161","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thats really good news:)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-08-11T17:46:47.906+0000","updated":"2015-08-11T17:46:47.906+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12854088/comment/14694411","id":"14694411","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I filed INFRA-10116 to follow up on the outage with the host that was running the ZooKeeper Windows builds.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-12T23:36:57.907+0000","updated":"2015-08-12T23:36:57.907+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12854088/comment/14702183","id":"14702183","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Big thanks to [~ipv6guru] for resolving the Windows Jenkins host problem in INFRA-10116.

Transitioning one of those boxes from no to yes ought to require some thought and agreement about whether or not the community is capable of taking on the extra support burden.
