I think this could be a good chance to refactor standalone code. For example, look at the code:\n{code}\n    public boolean isDistributed() {\n        return quorumVerifier!=null && (!standaloneEnabled || quorumVerifier.getVotingMembers().size() > 1);\n    }\n{code}\nThis could be changed to simply returning the boolean.\n\nh2. Regarding standalone mode and dynamic config.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts and more is welcome to add:\n\n* Pre-assumption: \"standaloneEnabled\" and \"dynamicConfigFile\" is *mutually exclusive* in config file.\n* Backward-compatibility: A single line -- \"server.X=...\" in *static* config file is still standalone mode.\n\nh3. TODO\n1. check mutual exclusiveness of \"standaloneEnabled\" and \"dynamicConfigFile\".\n2. Make sure standalone wouldn't create dynamic file.\n3. Enforce the minimum number of servers is 2 for any dynamic ensemble.

Its possible that clientPort wasn't specified, myid wasn't set and yet it finds the port. \n- if there was no \";port\" in the server.x line, it will find port2 here \"sever.1=host:port1:port2\" since it deletes everything before \";\" but there's no \";\" here. We need to check that there's a \";\" and something after it before doing \"sed\".\n- clientPortAddress is not set correctly if I write \"server.1=host:port1:port2;host2:port3\"\n\nwe need to check this more by running with different possible config files.\n\nMaybe this should be a separate JIRA since this is not only related to standalone mode.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-18T16:41:25.636+0000","updated":"2014-08-18T16:41:25.636+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12732707/comment/14100829","id":"14100829","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"btw the way I debug this is just by running \"./bin/zkServer status\" and printing stuff - there's no need to start the server even.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-18T16:43:03.000+0000","updated":"2014-08-18T16:43:03.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12732707/comment/14100913","id":"14100913","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hdeng","name":"hdeng","key":"hdeng","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hongchao Deng","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I didn't have any problem running it..\nIn three cases:\n{code}\nclientPort=2181\n{code}\nor\n{code}\nserver.1=...;2181\n{code}\nor\n{code}\ndynamicConfigFile=./dyanmicFile\n...
