The call to `testableWaitForShutdown` never actually asserts anything and effectively just hangs for CONNECTION_TIMEOUT (30 seconds) and returns because the client reconnects to the server. \n    \n    This patch replaces `zk.testableWaitForShutdown(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT)` with `watcher.waitForDisconnected(5000)` which is a better way to detect if we have been disconnected.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/afine/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2786_br3.5\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/259.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #259\n    \n----\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-05-19T19:11:09.663+0000","updated":"2017-05-19T19:11:09.663+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073523/comment/16017880","id":"16017880","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"GitHub user afine opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/260\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2786: Flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientTest.testNonExistingOpCode\n\n    On branch 3.4 we attempt to check that an invalid opcode in a request causes the server to disconnect the client with:\n    \n    ```\n            try {\n                zk.exists(\"/m1\", false);\n                fail(\"The connection should have been closed\");\n            } catch (KeeperException.ConnectionLossException expected) {\n            }\n    ```\n    \n    This can run into a race with the reconnection logic in `ClientCnxn.java`https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/branch-3.4/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/ClientCnxn.java#L1052 We should use a watcher instead to track disconnects.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/afine/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2786\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/260.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #260\n    \n----\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-05-19T19:17:45.252+0000","updated":"2017-05-19T19:17:45.252+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073523/comment/16017918","id":"16017918","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientTest.testNonExistingOpCode\n\n    This is the third time this failure has popped up. This time it seemed to only impact tests run using NettyServerCnxnFactory (so it only impacts 3.5 and master) and I was able to get it to pop up with sufficient frequency when running the tests locally. \n    \n    The issue is caused by improper handling of netty's futures. When we call `channel.write(wrappedBuffer(sendBuffer));` the write is completed asynchronously. The close call `channel.close();` is also asynchronous. So we can run into the case where the close occurs before a write.\n    \n    This patch changes our close call to be a callback for the completion of an empty write. This way we are guaranteed that the channel has \"drained\" before a close. \n    \n    My primary concern with this patch is the channel being used while it is closing (between the write of an empty buffer and the execution of the close callback). I have added a `closingChannel` boolean to track that, which I believe is sufficient. Let me know if anyone finds a situation where that is not the case.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/afine/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2786_third_times_a_charm\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/327.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #327\n    \n----\ncommit 6e16b20cd2f768e9a027f1d9306ae8126188edb4\nAuthor: Abraham Fine <afine@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-08-03T20:02:06Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2786: Flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientTest.testNonExistingOpCode\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-08-03T20:11:18.740+0000","updated":"2017-08-03T20:11:18.740+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073523/comment/16113432","id":"16113432","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
