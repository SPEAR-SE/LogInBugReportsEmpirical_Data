These missing dependencies all appear to be transitive from dependencies brought in by ZOOKEEPER-2689 (which is why ant is able to run the tests). There were two possible ways to fix this, this patch explicitly lists the new transitive dependencies that are required by our test code. Another solution would be to remove `transitive=\"false\"` from `<ivy:cachepath pathid=\"junit.path.id\" conf=\"test\" transitive=\"false\"/>` in the eclipse target of our `build.xml`. This solution would introduce even more transitive dependencies to the .classpath.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/afine/zookeeper ZOOKEEPER-2696\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/178.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #178\n    \n----\ncommit bc8d6c35594f24fbb7ebf13066a746f5b7246cd1\nAuthor: Abraham Fine <abefine@cloudera.com>\nDate:   2017-02-15T00:03:35Z\n\n    ZOOKEEPER-2696: Eclipse ant ask no longer determines correct classpath after ZOOKEEPER-2689\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-02-15T00:11:14.390+0000","updated":"2017-02-15T00:11:14.390+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13043121/comment/15866982","id":"15866982","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user afine commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/178\n  \n    Hoping you can take a look @rakeshadr \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-02-15T00:17:12.714+0000","updated":"2017-02-15T00:17:12.714+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13043121/comment/15867641","id":"15867641","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user rakeshadr commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/178\n  \n    Thanks @afine  for reporting this. With newly added dependencies, the compilation error will be resolved. But, I could see while running unit test case in eclipse, it needed all the transitive dependent libraries in classpath. AFAIK, the below set of libraries needed during test run time. Could you please confirm? If yes, then we can think of removing `transitive=\"false\"` from build.xml in order to reduce the length of ivy.xml, right?\n    \n    -  antlr-2.7.7.jar\n    -  mina-core-2.0.7.jar\n    -  mavibot-1.0.0-M1.jar\n    -  ehcache-core-2.4.4.jar\n    -  commons-pool-1.6.jar\n    -  apacheds-core-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-core-api-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-core-avl-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-core-constants-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-core-shared-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-i18n-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptor-kerberos-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-admin-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-authn-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-authz-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-changelog-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-collective-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-event-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-exception-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-journal-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-normalization-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-operational-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-referral-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-schema-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-subtree-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-interceptors-trigger-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-jdbm1-2.0.0-M2.jar\n    -  apacheds-jdbm-partition-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-kerberos-codec-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-ldif-partition-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-mavibot-partition-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-protocol-kerberos-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-protocol-ldap-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-protocol-shared-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  apacheds-xdbm-partition-2.0.0-M15.jar\n    -  api-all-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-asn1-api-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-asn1-ber-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-i18n-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-client-api-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-codec-core-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-extras-aci-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-extras-codec-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-extras-codec-api-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-extras-sp-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-extras-trigger-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-extras-util-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-ldap-model-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  api-util-1.0.0-M20.jar\n    -  bcprov-jdk15-140.jar\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-02-15T10:57:27.768+0000","updated":"2017-02-15T10:57:27.768+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13043121/comment/15868738","id":"15868738","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user afine commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/178\n  \n    Hi @rakeshadr \n    \n    I was able to run the unit tests within eclipse or idea (I used WatcherTest as my example) using just the dependencies I added in the patch.  \n    \n    That being said I would be find removing `transitive=\"false\"`.
