Consequently, when closing a ledger, we have to shut down a QuorumEngine only if there is one. A poor way of implementing it is by having a for loop that iterates over all available QuorumEngines and shut them down. Given the assumptions of one ledger at a time and no QuorumEngine for LedgerRecoveryMonitor, this implementation works. However, as we move to a more flexible model in which multiple ledgers can be open and closed at arbitrary times, the for loop choice no longer works. \n\nThe attached patch fixes this problem by just shutting down the QuorumEngine instance corresponding to the ledger being closed, and it checks if a QuorumEngine exists before submitting a STOP operation. The patch also includes a test that opens four ledger, and then sequentially writes to the each ledger and closes it.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12406755","id":"12406755","filename":"ZOOKEEPER-387.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2009-04-29T08:34:08.592+0000","size":11793,"mimeType":"text/x-diff","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12406755/ZOOKEEPER-387.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"33102","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"closeLedger shouldn't shut down all QuorumEngines","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424141/comment/12704054","id":"12704054","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
