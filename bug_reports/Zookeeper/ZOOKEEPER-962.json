        "description": "From mailing list:\nIt seems like we rely on the LearnerHandler thread startup to capture all of the missing committed\ntransactions in the SNAP or DIFF, but I don't see anything (especially in the DIFF case) that\nis preventing us for committing more transactions before we actually start forwarding updates\nto the new follower.\n\nLet me explain using my example from ZOOKEEPER-919. Assume we have quorum already, so the\nleader can be processing transactions while my follower is starting up.\n\nI'm a follower at zxid N-5, the leader is at N. I send my FOLLOWERINFO packet to the leader\nwith that information. The leader gets the proposals from its committed log (time T1), then\nsyncs on the proposal list (LearnerHandler line 267. Why? It's a copy of the underlying proposal\nlist... this might be part of our problem). I check to see if the peerLastZxid is within my\nmax and min committed log and it is, so I'm going to send a diff. I set the zxidToSend to\nbe the maxCommittedLog at time T3 (we already know this is sketchy), and forward the proposals\nfrom my copied proposal list starting at the peerLastZxid+1 up to the last proposal transaction\n(as seen at time T1).\n\nAfter I have queued up all those diffs to send, I tell the leader to startFowarding updates\nto this follower (line 308). \n\nSo, let's say that at time T2 I actually swap out the leader to the thread that is handling\nthe various request processors, and see that I got enough votes to commit zxid N+1. I commit\nN+1 and so my maxCommittedLog at T3 is N+1, but this proposal is not in the list of proposals\nthat I got back at time T1, so I don't forward this diff to the client. Additionally, I processed\nthe commit and removed it from my leader's toBeApplied list. So when I call startForwarding\nfor this new follower, I don't see this transaction as a transaction to be forwarded. \n\nThere's one problem. Let's also imagine, however, that I commit N+1 at time T4. The maxCommittedLog\nvalue is consistent with the max of the diff packets I am going to send the follower. But,\nI still committed N+1 and removed it from the toBeApplied list before calling startFowarding\nwith this follower. How does the follower get this transaction? Does it?\n\nTo put it another way, here is the thread interaction, hopefully formatted so you can read\nit...\n\n\t\tLearnerHandlerThread\t\t\t\t\tRequestProcessorThread\nT1(LH):\tget list of proposals (COPY)\nT2(RPT):\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommit N+1, remove from toBeApplied\nT3(LH):\tget maxCommittedLog\nT4(LH):\tsend diffs from view at T1\nT5(LH):\tstartForwarding\n\n\nOr\nT1(LH):\tget list of proposals (COPY)\nT2(LH):\tget maxCommittedLog\nT3(RPT):\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommit N+1, remove from toBeApplied\nT4(LH):\tsend diffs from view at T1\nT5(LH):\tstartFowarding\n\n\nI'm trying to figure out what, if anything, keeps the requests from being committed, removed,\nand never seen by the follower before it fully starts up. \n\n",
