        "description": "On a cluster running 2.5, we have observed a decommissioning failure due to a file that had been under construction for 3 days.  It turned out that the file was abandoned and a lease recovery was carried out by the name node 3 days ago.\n\nThe block recovery failed because the name node threw a quota exception while serving {{commitBlockSynchronization()}}. After this failure, no further attempt for recovery was made, leaving the file in under-construction state forever.\n\nFurthermore, the nature of the recovery failure is very strange. Even though *snapshot was never used* in the cluster, it was trying to record the diff and that required incrementing {{nsquota}} by 1. The user happened to ran out of his {{nsquota}} at that time, so it failed and caused {{commitBlockSynchronization()}} to fail.  We do see quota discrepancies occasionally. Probably those were caused by something like this all along?\n\nFew observations:\n- Lease recovery did not complete, yet didn't get retried.\n- No snapshot was in use, but somehow it went through snapshot-related code path.\n- quota update during {{commitBlockSynchronization()}} should be done unconditionally.",
