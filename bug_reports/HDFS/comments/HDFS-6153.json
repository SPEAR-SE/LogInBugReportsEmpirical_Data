, This is an incompatible API change.  "fileId" and "childrenNum" cannot be added as required fields since it breaks API compatibility.  This change is already in some releases.  How do we fix it?, Thanks [~szetszwo] for pointing out.

bq. This change is already in some releases. How do we fix it?
2.5.X and 2.6.X are already released, so I'm thinking we should fix the document and commit it to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.7, branch-2.6, and branch-2.5., Actually, I think we should revert the patch since fileId and childrenNum are only in HdfsFileStatus but not FileStatus.  WebHDFS REST API should support general FileSystem API.  Otherwise, other projects like httpfs won't work., bq. Actually, I think we should revert the patch since fileId and childrenNum are only in HdfsFileStatus but not FileStatus. 
I'm okay to revert this patch. However, I'm thinking it would be better for users to document the fields as optional, such as symlink field. What do you think?, symlink is in FileStatus.  So it is fine.

fileId is not yet a public API; see HDFS-7878.  So we should not expose it in WebHDFS., Thank you [~szetszwo] for clarification. May I revert this patch from all the branches?, Please revert this form all the branches.  Thanks a lot!, Reverted this patch from trunk, branch-2, branch-2.7, branch-2.6, and branch-2.5.
(WebHDFS.apt.vm was moved to WebHDFS.md after branch-2.6, so I modified the markdown file when reverting this patch.), FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7600 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7600/])
