* hdfs dfs is meant to be specifically for HDFS.
* Adding tools to hadoop fs (which is what one should be using when talking to s3) is going to significantly slow it down for every single command.
* I don't think adding every single 3rd party file system to the default command path is a good precedent.
* Users who want permanent support of a 3rd party file system should be using shellprofile.d to enable such behavior., Hi [~aw]

	One suggestion from my side, if you agree. I think we can add one environment variable to give option to user for adding third party jars in command class path.

*For example*:  HADOOP_THIRD_PARTY_JARS
{code}
   dfs)
     CLASS=org.apache.hadoop.fs.FsShell
+    hadoop_debug "Adding third party jar in CLASSPATH"
+    hadoop_add_classpath "${HADOOP_THIRD_PARTY_JARS}"
{code}
, You can already do this via .hadooprc without the need of another env var., Closing this as won't fix.

Also, HADOOP_CLASSPATH is for users to add jars as well.  Forgot to mention that earlier.]
