[Patch which reworks the test to use a {{MiniDFSCluster}} instead of starting an NN manually. I manually verified that running the test on my box with a process bound to 50070 passes, whereas it failed before., Sorry to be a nit picker, but we should specify numDataNodes(0) so the test runs a little faster., Thanks for the review, Todd. Here's an updated patch which sets numDataNodes to 0. This sped up the run of this test case by 10 seconds., Updated patch rebased against trunk., Committed to trunk.
