This message was automatically generated., Since it involves {{System.exit()}}, I couldn't manage to add a testcase. Appreciate reviews. Thanks!, bq. Since it involves System.exit(), I couldn't manage to add a testcase.
In MiniDFSCluster tests, {{System.exit()}} is disabled. Check {{ExitUtil}}.

bq. Secondary namenode - RMI Thread prevents JVM from exiting after main() completes
By default, hadoop doesnt ship with jmx enabled. Title and description are little confusing when compared with the patch fix. It could be made simple like  'SecondaryNameNode not terminating properly on runtime exceptions'

Coming to patch, instead of adding one more try-catch block, can handle {{throwable}} instead of {{IOException}} in existing block itself?, [~vinayrpet] Thank you for the reviews. I'll do the suggested changes and try to add unit test case., Attached patch addressing the comments. I've tried adding unit test case., \\
