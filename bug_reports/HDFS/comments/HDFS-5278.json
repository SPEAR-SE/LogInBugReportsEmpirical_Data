This message is automatically generated., The patch looks great to me. One more comment: maybe we can do some artificial delay instead of copying large data in the test? , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the update, Haohui! Some comments:
# testWriteTimoutAtDataNode actually tests DFSInputStream's retry when DN's socket is closed because of timeout. The current patch removes this part of test. Also, maybe we can rename testWriteTimoutAtDataNode to "testReadRetryWithDNTimeout"?
# In testDFSClientRetriesOnBusyBlocks, I think we'd better keep the original number of clients unchanged (i.e., 50) to make sure that each client has to retry and possibly retries multiple times., \\
