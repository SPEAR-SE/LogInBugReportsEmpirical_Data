[Uploaded a patch for review.

[~jzhuge] FYI, [~joemcdonnell] Thanks for the contribution!

How did u test the patch?, +1 LGTM  I will commit once the testing done is clarified., [~jzhuge]
The test case that spurred the creation of this JIRA is an Impala test case for Impala's fallback code when a zero copy HDFS read fails. 
It does this by mixing zero copy reads with encryption zones, which is a known error case (see IMPALA-3679). That error causes libhdfs to call translateZCRException, which without this patch was failing and crashing Impala. 

I tested this patch by building libhdfs and running the same test case. It succeeds where it was previously crashing., Committed to trunk and branch-3.0. Thanks [~joemcdonnell] for reporting and fixing the issue!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13172 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13172/])
