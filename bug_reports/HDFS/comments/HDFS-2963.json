[The metasave output isn't wrong per se, just confusing.  It prints out:

{code}
Created file sav.txt on server hdfs://127.0.0.1:6000
{code}

But it really would be less confusing to print out:
{code}
Created file /r/log/sav.txt about hdfs://127.0.0.1:6000
{code}, I tweaked the output to be more informative. I didn't have it print the absolute path of the saved file, since the log dir is configured on the namenode. Also fixed up two typos nearby., looks good to me., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
