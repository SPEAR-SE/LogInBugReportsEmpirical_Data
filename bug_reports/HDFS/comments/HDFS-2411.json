[the jobtracker fails to connect to the namenode because the auth to local mappings are not being respected and the jt user if not mapped has no rights to write to hdfs., Patch uploaded. I think KerberosAuthenticationHandler should not initialize KerberosName. KerberosName will be initialized when UserGroupInformation is initialized, and that setting should be used everywhere., +1 patch looks good.
