[The create fails as expected, but it seems retries are taking too long.

{panel}, DFSClient retries 5 times with 60 second sleep to overwrite a file if it catches AlreadyBeingCreatedException, configured in NameNodeProxies.java:
{code}
      RetryPolicy createPolicy = RetryPolicies
          .retryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(5,
              HdfsConstants.LEASE_SOFTLIMIT_PERIOD, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

      Map<Class<? extends Exception>, RetryPolicy> remoteExceptionToPolicyMap 
                 = new HashMap<Class<? extends Exception>, RetryPolicy>();
      remoteExceptionToPolicyMap.put(AlreadyBeingCreatedException.class,
          createPolicy);
{code}
I'm thinking we need a new parameter to change {{HdfsConstants.LEASE_SOFTLIMIT_PERIOD}} to reduce the execution time., Attaching a patch to create a new parameter "dfs.client.retry.interval-ms.overwrite-open-file" to set the interval in overwriting an open file., The test ran in 10 seconds on my laptop with the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

, Is this still on target for 2.9.0 ? If not, can we we push this out to the next major release ?, Pushing it out from 2.9.0 due to lack of recent activity. Feel free to revert if required., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
