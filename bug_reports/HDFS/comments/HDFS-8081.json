This message is automatically generated., Hi Konst, the patch looks good.  Few nits:
*1.*
{quote}
// Part I. Analyze the state of the file with respect to the input data.
{quote}
{quote}
// Part II.
// Allocate a new block, add it to the INode and the BlocksMap. 
{quote}
Since in the patch we have two methods, could we remove the original comments since the new methods comment already cover them.

*2.*
{code}
if (targets == null && onRetryBlock[0] != null) {
{code}
For current code logic, if {{targest}} is null, then {{onRetryBlock\[0\] != null}}  should be true  (Since {{chooseTarget4NewBlock}} will never return null). 
Could you remove {{onRetryBlock\[0\] != null}}  or just assert it? Otherwise it has some misunderstanding: even {{targets == null}}, if {{onRetryBlock\[0\]}} is null, then we still call {{storeAllocatedBlock}}., Fixed the nits. Thanks Yi., This actually allows to simplify {{TestAddBlockRetry}} - do not need to mock {{chooseTargets()}} any more. This version simplifies the test. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
