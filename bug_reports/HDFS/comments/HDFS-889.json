[This same failure occurred again in a test build:

I think we should look carefully at this for this release., Is this just a test bug? i.e is the contract of BlockManager that its methods require the FSN lock to be held, and the test is at fault for not doing so? Or do we have other cases in the NN where we access these iterators w/o synchronization, >Is this just a test bug?
I don't know. We've only seen it in tests, but that doesn't mean that it hasn't happened out in the field?]
