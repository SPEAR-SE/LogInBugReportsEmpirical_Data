[In all of the failing test runs that I saw, the client would end up failing with an error like the following:

{noformat}
2012-12-14 16:30:36,818 WARN  hdfs.DFSClient (DFSOutputStream.java:run(562)) - DataStreamer Exception
java.io.IOException: Failed to add a datanode.  User may turn off this feature by setting dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.policy in configuration, where the current policy is DEFAULT.  (Nodes: current=[127.0.0.1:52552, 127.0.0.1:43557], original=[127.0.0.1:43557, 127.0.0.1:52552])

  at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSOutputStream$DataStreamer.run(DFSOutputStream.java:469)
{noformat}

This suggests that either an entire DN or one of the BPOfferServices of one of the DNs was not starting correctly, or had not started by the time the client was trying to access it. Unfortunately, TestWebHdfsWithMultipleNameNodes disables the DN logger, so it wasn't obvious what was causing that problem. Upon changing the test to not disable the logger and looping the test, I would occasionally see an error like the following:

{noformat}
java.lang.NullPointerException
  at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode.initStorage(DataNode.java:850)
  at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode.initBlockPool(DataNode.java:819)

  at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.run(BPServiceActor.java:660)
  at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)
{noformat}

This error would cause one of the BPOfferServices in one of the DNs to not come up. The reason for this is that concurrent, unsynchronized puts to the HashMap DataStorage#bpStorageMap results in undefined behavior, including previously-included entries no longer appearing to be in the map., Here's a patch which addresses the issue. I've been looping the test for an hour now with no failures, whereas before it used to fail pretty reliably within 10 minutes. I'll keep it looping over the weekend and see how it goes.

This patch also takes the liberty of re-enabling the DN log in TestWebHdfsWithMultipleNameNodes, so that we can better see the root cause of later failures., Nice find!

This message is automatically generated., I looped this test 5923 times for about 50 hours and it never failed. I'm going to conclude based on this that this patch fixes the issue.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
