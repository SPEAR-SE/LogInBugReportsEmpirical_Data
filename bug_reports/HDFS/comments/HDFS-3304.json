[It looks like the issues is that this directory structure is being created when building libhdfs.so:
{code}
~/hadoop1/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/target/usr/local/lib64
{code}

whereas we needed this one
{code}
~/hadoop1/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/target/usr/local/lib
{code}, Per HDFS-2696 the following command ({{mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pnative  -DskipTest -Pfuse}}) works for me. Does it work for you? If so looks like the compile target is broken, if not suspect it's a host-specific issue.

We should update BUILDING.txt to this effect.  Also, might be worth going straight to HDFS-3251 rather than fixing this., No, that command doesn't work for me.  The problem seems to be that automake defaults to creating ${TARGET}/usr/local/lib64 for me, and ${TARGET}/usr/local/lib for you.  This should be fixable by passing a --libdir switch with the desired directory to automake.

Makes sense to me!, Fixed by HADOOP-8368, Fixed by HADOOP-8368]
