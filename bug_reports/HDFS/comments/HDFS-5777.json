This message is automatically generated., Need to fix editsStored files for TestOfflineEditsViewer.  The other failed tests probably are not related., [~jingzhao], alternatively we can move the LayoutVersion for this change to -48 and move other features down. Given the CACHING and ADD_DATANODE_AND_STORAGE_UUIDS are not release yet in Apache, this should not be an issue., Thanks for the review Nicholas and Suresh! Update the patch to address your comments, i.e., the new patch moves the LayoutVersion for this change to -48 and move other features down., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
