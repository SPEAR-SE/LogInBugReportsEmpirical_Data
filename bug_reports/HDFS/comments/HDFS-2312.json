This message is automatically generated., This patch looks fine to me, Harsh. Perhaps you could even expand a little bit in the comment on what bookkeeping is done by FSNamesystem vs. FSDirectory? You can find some good info about the differences in [this comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2223?focusedCommentId=13079034&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13079034]., [~atm] - Done.

All my patch proposes to change is FSNamesystem's class javadoc. Tests are not required, hence, and the single test failure seems to be due to something else as my patch touches zero code., +1, the patch looks good to me.
