{noformat}, Talked to Cos.  TestFiHFlush has some known problem., @Nicholas - We need to add Fix Version information to this ticket so it will show up in the right place. JIRA isn't allowing me to do it. Can you update the ticket., My understanding is that "Fix version" needs to be updated after the fix, bit before., The attached patch solves the issue. Here's the reason for the intermittent failure we've been seen on and off:
  - test expects to find a pipeline in place when hflush is called. 
  - as we are hflush'ing something like 1/10th of a block size after each write op. pipeline might get disassembled after 10th hflush is happening (in cases of files <= block_size)
  - the cases above are exactly where we see intermittent failures (0[1-2]_a)

Thus, but fixing the assumption (i.e. we have to validate smthg on an existing pipeline) the test gets effectively fixed.

Review anyone?, Fixing a typo in an assert message, +1 patch looks good., I have just commtted this to 0.21 branch and up, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #643 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/643/])
    , Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-22-branch #35 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-22-branch/35/])
