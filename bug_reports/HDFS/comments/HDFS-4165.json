, How about updating TestQuota?  See HDFS-46 for a similar example., Thanks Suresh and Brandon for review.

@Eli 
Given the current constant value, the current sanity check can't fail

{code}
  public static final long QUOTA_DONT_SET = Long.MAX_VALUE;
  public static final long QUOTA_RESET = -1L;
{code}

HDFS-46 also reminds me that Long.MAX_VALUE is used both for QUOTA_DONT_SET and the default namespace quota of root directory, so you can't set quota to Long.MAX_VALUE for root directory using RPC, a better value for QUOTA_DONT_SET should be -2 instead.

, Hey guys, any reason this was not merged to branch-2? I was doing a diff on FSDirectory for unrelated reasons, and realized this wasn't pushed down., I think the change is simple and it is OK to merge to branch-2. , Thanks for the confirmation Binglin, I merged this down to branch-2.
