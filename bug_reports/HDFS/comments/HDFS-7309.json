[Here's a unit test to illustrate the problem , So, the intention when writing {{XMLUtils#mangleXmlString}} was that it would handle stuff that the normal XML parser didn't.  Basically XML says that there's just no way to have certain code points in your document, so it fails to provide a standard way to escape them.  One example is the first few code points like code point 0, 1, 2, etc.  There IS a standard way to escape things like <, >, %, etc. so we didn't handle those.  {{org.xml.sax.XMLReader}} already escapes those code points.

Since you're not using XMLParser, you don't get the benefit of this "built-in" escaping.
You could get it manually with this:

{code}
public static string XmlUnescape(string escaped) {
    XmlDocument d = new XmlDocument();
    var node = d.CreateElement("root");
    node.InnerXml = escaped;
    return node.InnerText;
}

public static string XmlEscape(string unescaped){
    XmlDocument d = new XmlDocument();
    var node = d.CreateElement("root");
    node.InnerText = unescaped;
    return node.InnerXml;
}
{code}

Or we could add this functionality to XMLUtils#mangleXmlString.  But we'd have to handle all the XML code points that need escaping (I think <, >, &, and maybe some of the quote signs).  Also it would need to be optional, to avoid double-escaping for callers who are using {{org.xml.sax.XMLReader}}., Implement entity refs in XMLUtils., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Wow! Thanks Colin! These changes look good to me. I ran the tests on my desktop and they both passed so I'm pretty sure Hadoop QA is lying here. I'm a +1 . I'll commit these soon if there are no objections.
I think more and more we are implementing StringEscapeUtils though , and it might be useful to figure out if we can simply move to commons-lang3 at some point. Do you know if there has ever been a discussion about that? I see a little bit on HADOOP-10783 but that JIRA has stalled., Thanks for the review, Ravi.

bq. I think more and more we are implementing StringEscapeUtils though , and it might be useful to figure out if we can simply move to commons-lang3 at some point. Do you know if there has ever been a discussion about that? I see a little bit on HADOOP-10783 but that JIRA has stalled.

So, the original reason why {{mangleXmlString}} exists is because there is no standard way of representing certain code points in XML.  If you look at: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/  it says, "XML 1.1 can represent certain control characters, but it cannot represent the null byte or unpaired Unicode surrogate codepoints, even after escaping. escapeXml11 will remove characters that do not fit in the following ranges..."  So we can't use this function since it simply removes a bunch of code points rather than trying to represent them.  There are also serious compatibility issues in upgrading commons-lang 2.6 to 3.0, so I think it may have to wait until Hadoop 3.0., Thanks Colin! I've committed the JIRA to branch-2.6, branch-2 and trunk., Just out of curiosity, would adding the lang3 library (in addition to lang, instead of upgrading it) also have compatibility issues?, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6408 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6408/])
