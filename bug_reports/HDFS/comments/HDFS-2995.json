[Could this be related to HDFS-2893?, Seems likely. Eli, I see you're watching this ticket - want to take a look?, Patch attached. Updates start/stop scripts to only try to start the 2NN on NNs with http-address configured., Verified with a tarball that a 2NN is not started/stopped when http-address is not set, and started/stopped when it is., +1, the patch looks good to me., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #1976 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/1976/])
    HDFS-2995. start-dfs.sh should only start the 2NN for namenodes with dfs.namenode.secondary.http-address configured. Contributed by Eli Collins (Revision 1308174)

     Result = FAILURE
