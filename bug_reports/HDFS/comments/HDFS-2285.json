[There are two problems here.
# BN briefly enters safemode on startup, but immediately exits it, because there are no blocks in the system yet. I made it entering manual safemode in case of BN, so it stays there forever. I also blocked leave safe-mode operation for BN.
# FSDirectory.ready has never been set to true for BN, and therefore some operations would loop inside waitForReady() forever. Fixed that too.

Added test case to verify that write operation is failing and read is not., I have not checked which of the problems exist in trunk. It would be good if somebody verified., test and test-patch pass

, I have just verified it on trunk. It looks to me that, issue exist in trunk as well.
Let me check for giving a patch for trunk.

Thanks
Uma, Uma any progress on this? We should be able to close this issue once we have a patch for trunk., Will post the patch soon. Sorry for the late, i was busy with other tasks.

, Thanks Konstantin for the Review!
I noticed it while uploading the patch. I kept the changes because that is some unused imports cleanup, and we can not file any separate jiras for unused imports cleanups alone.
Anyway thanks for updating it.

Thanks
