[I think https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5347 fixed this., Should there be a link to the documentation  on hadoop.apache.org?, Generally the documentation on hadoop.apache.org don't link to documentation posted in the JIRAs.

When the stable docs (currently at 2.2.0) upgrade to 2.3.0, then they'll include the user guide in HDFS-5347. , I see. closing as duplicate then. Thanks., Duplicate of HDFS-5347]
