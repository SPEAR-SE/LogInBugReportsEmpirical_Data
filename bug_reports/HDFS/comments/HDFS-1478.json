with the patch for this - log4j is setting interrupted state for threads. i think this bug and the comments suggest that there may be cases where InterruptedException is still being propagated from log4j (which is actually the more likely culprit for MAPREDUCE-2157. so it makes sense, as a precaution, to check for shutdown conditions inside interruptedexception handlers., we should also check shutdown conditions under almost all interruptedException handlers before terminating.
