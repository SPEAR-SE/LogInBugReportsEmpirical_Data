[proposed patch., Tested on a 400 node cluster with a bandwidth of 500K/sec. Verified that there are still occasional  timeouts BUT there is not the flood of thread quota exceeded warnings., +1 patch looks good.

[~nroberts], have you tested the patch internally?, > ... Verified that there are still occasional timeouts ...

Do you mean that the datanodes transfer the block slowly and exceeds 20 minutes timeout?  How large are the blocks?   It may make sense to set
- timeout = lambda * (block size) / (bandwith),

where lambda is a fixed multiplier for all blocks.  We may set lambda to 10 for the moment., Maybe our two comments passed in the mail. Yes I tested internally. It's been running on a 400 node cluster for 1 day. I ran with bandwidths of 500K, 6MB, 20MB. With 500K there were timeouts, but no thread quota exceeded failures., The blocks don't have to be very large. There is a quota of 5 threads per DN, at the default bandwidth of 1MB/sec, it can take (block size) / (1MB/5)  seconds to move a block (something like 640 seconds for a 128MB block). The bandwidth is dynamically settable and the block size is not constant either, so I went with the very simple approach that will cover the normal situations., > ...

I see.  Since the test result is satisfactory, I am fine with the current patch.  We may change the timeout to be dynamic or configurable later on.  Let me kick out a Jenkins build., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
