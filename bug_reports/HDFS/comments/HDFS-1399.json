[Change DataNode and NameNode to set service-level ACLs on their RPC server instance(s), instead of statically., Updated patch to address Todd's comments., I ran test-core and everything passed except for TestFileAppend4. I ran it again, and everything passed except for TestFileAppend4 and TestMissingBlocksAlert. I ran both of these on their own and they both passed. I think the TestFileAppend4 failure is related to HDFS-1306. Not sure what to conclude about the TestMissingBLocksAlert failure. Might be related to HDFS-1286.
