[[~esteban] are you going to upload the patch..? As I mentioned in HDFS-8311, if you are not planning, I will upload patch..thanks, It's unclear to me if this issue intends to address timeout logic in the DFS client.  If so, please be aware of HDFS-7608.  Thanks!, Hi [~cnauroth]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8311?focusedCommentId=14535519&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14535519, bq. It's unclear to me if this issue intends to address timeout logic in the DFS client. If so, please be aware of HDFS-7608. Thanks!

[~cnauroth], I think we can leave HDFS-8359 only for the DN side after reading HDFS-7608. Also I think is important address HDFS-7608 for the client.

bq. Esteban Gutierrez are you going to upload the patch..? As I mentioned in HDFS-8311, if you are not planning, I will upload patch..thanks
[~brahmareddy] correct I will upload a patch for this later, so I will assign the JIRA to me for now.]
