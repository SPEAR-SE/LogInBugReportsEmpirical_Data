[We do tend to avoid highly loaded DataNodes (via xceiver counts) which may almost do the same operation.

Resolving as not a problem., Oh well, didn't notice the 'read' issue too. We cover writes with that, not reads. Reopening., Basically a dupe., This is also related to hedged reads.  Even if we blacklist a datanode after a timeout / latency spike has happened, the damage is done.  Hedged reads can avoid the latency spike in the first place.]
