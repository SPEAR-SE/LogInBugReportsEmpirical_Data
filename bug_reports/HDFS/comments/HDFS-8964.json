This message was automatically generated., The overall idea looks good.  Rather than special-casing negative values for maxTxId, we can just pass in {{Long.MAX_VALUE}} in cases where we really don't want a limit.  Of course we also need to plug this into the relevant places in NameNode and JournalNode., Thanks Colin for taking a look. Updating the patch to better handle cases with no provided {{maxTxId}}.

I also found {{scanLog}} is identical to {{validateLog}} and removed it from two places.

{{FileJournalManager#getRemoteEditLogs}} and {{selectInputStreams}} are already updated to provide {{maxTxId}}. Where else do you think we are trying to read an active in-progress edit file?, \\

This message was automatically generated., Updating the patch with a test (which turns out to be the hardest part). Basically, we want to verify that NN doesn't try to read past the latest synced op when validating the edit log file. But the {{validateLog}} logic absorbs all exceptions.

So I had to verify the NameNode log for the error message that is expected without the change., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thank you, [~zhz].

JNStorage: {{import com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting;}} was added, but not used.

bq. I also found scanLog is identical to validateLog and removed it from two places.

They're not quite identical.  {{validateLog}} ends up repeatedly calling {{FSEditLogInputStream#readOp}}, whereas scanLog ends up repeatedly calling {{FSEditLogInputStream#scanNextOp}}.  In the past, {{scanNextOp}} did not validate checksums, whereas {{readOp}} did.  However, HDFS-8965 is changing {{FSEditLogInputStream#scanNextOp}} to validate checksums.  So I agree that it now makes sense to merge these two.

FileJournalManager#getRemoteEditLogs: this isn't going to work.
{code}
  public List<RemoteEditLog> getRemoteEditLogs(long firstTxId,
      boolean inProgressOk) throws IOException {
...
          elf.validateLog(firstTxId);
{code}
The problem is that by doing this, we set {{EditLogFile#lastTxId}} to {{firstTxid}}, and then all subsequent edits in the in-progress log are lost.  Instead of doing this, you should pass in the known highest txid from Journal.java (taking care to pass {{Long.MAX_VALUE}} if this is not known).

Same issue in {{FileJournalManager#addStreamsToCollectionFromFiles}}.

{code}
    /** 
     * Find out where the edit log ends.
     * This will update the lastTxId of the EditLogFile or
     * mark it as corrupt if it is.
     */
    public void validateLog() throws IOException {
      validateLog(Long.MAX_VALUE);
    }

    public void validateLog(long maxTxId) throws IOException {
{code} 
I would prefer not to have this kind of function overloading, since it tends to obscure what is going on.  In that vein, I think there are more places where we are calling validateLog without a maxTxid, where we should actually have a max txid, like {{Journal#getSegmentInfo}}.

{code}
      if (maxTxId > 0 && lastTxId > maxTxId) {
        break;
      }
{code}
Why is maxTxid == 0 special here?  If we want to have no limit, we can just pass in {{Long.MAX_VALUE}}.  0 is a bad value to overload to mean "there is no limit" because it means you have to special-case it.  I also don't think this function correctly handles the case where we don't expect any edits in the log currently.  In this case, it is quite valid for the caller to pass 0 as maxTxid, and we should always return an EditLogValidate with {{maxTxid == startTxId == 0}}.  The check should be at the start of the loop, not the end.

{code} 
     File[] files = new File(f1, "current").listFiles(new FilenameFilter() {
-        @Override
-        public boolean accept(File dir, String name) {
-          if (name.startsWith(NNStorage.getFinalizedEditsFileName(startErrorTxId, 
-                                  endErrorTxId))) {
-            return true;
-          }
-          return false;
+      @Override
+      public boolean accept(File dir, String name) {
+        if (name.startsWith(NNStorage.getFinalizedEditsFileName(startErrorTxId,
+            endErrorTxId))) {
+          return true;
         }
-      });
+        return false;
+      }
+    });
{code}
Let's not mess with the whitespace here.  I don't see anything wrong with the original whitespace, and it makes backports harder.  Similar with {{writeInt}}

The unit test looks good to me.  Can you also test that if we call {{EditLogFileInputStream#validateEditLOg(editLogFile, finalTxId - 1)}} we don't get the last edit log op, but if we call {{validateEditLOg(editLogFile, finalTxId)}}, we do?  It should be easy to do by keeping track of the last edit log transaction id in the loop where we're writing transactions (probably can get it out of FSNamesystem)., Thanks Colin for the review! Updating the patch to add {{lastSyncTxId}} to {{FileJournalManager}}. The idea is that FJM should be aware of the latest Tx ID synced to its files.

Please let me know if the structure looks OK. I'll beef up the test in the next rev., \\

This message was automatically generated., {{FileJournalManager}}: it seems like "lastReadableTxId" is a better name than "syncTxId".  After all, the last txid may or may not have been synced.  This also reflects the fact that this starts out as Long.MAX_VALUE, indicating that we can read all txids.

{{FsEditLogLoader#validateEditLog}}: {{maxTxId}} seems like a confusing name here.  It's not really the maximum, since if there is a transaction gap, we may end up reading a later txid (and returning the transaction!).  How about {{finalTxId}}, plus a JavaDoc indicating that we will stop reading after reading this or a higher txid.

Please remove the whitespace-only changes, including the one in {{testEditLogFailOverFromCorrupt}} (I mentioned this above)

Looks good aside from that.  Thanks, [~zhz]., Thanks Colin for reviewing the patch again. Updating the patch to address the comments. I like the name {{lastReadableTxId}}. W.r.t the other name, I changed it to {{maxTxIdToValidate}} because even {{finalTxId}} sounds like the variable is associated with the log file, instead of the validation. LMK how it looks., \\
