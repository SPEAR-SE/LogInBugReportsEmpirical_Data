[Can someone help to assign the jira to me? I will try  to work on a patch, thanks!, Added and assigned, thanks [~huaxiang]!, Thanks Andrew!, While trying to work on a patch, I went through the java code, https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/DFSInputStream.java#L1131 is not supposed to throw out the IOException, and the IOException will be handled in following future.get(). This seems not a valid issue, will look at my logs more and report back, thanks., Update after more log reading, so when the hedged read thread pool is exhausted, the hedged read does not work anymore.
Since the thread is not interrupted, it is easy to exhaust the thread pool in some error conditions.

Discussed with [~atm] and [~jzhuge], they will follow up with the new jira if it can be improved after research. I am closing this one as invalid. , The exception is handled, close it as invalid.]
