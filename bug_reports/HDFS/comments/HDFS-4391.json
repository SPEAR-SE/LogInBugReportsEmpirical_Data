[JUnit does not guarantee the order of tests execution. So it does not always fail. If {{testManyClosedSocketsInCache()}} is executed last the test passes. But if goes first the next test {{testKeepaliveTimeouts()}} fails with the assertion:
{code}

I can reproduce it in eclipse debugger just by moving {{testManyClosedSocketsInCache()}} ahead of other test cases in the code., The test order also changes when we move to JDK7., Yep, that's how I found it in the first place., Fix attached. When {{testKeepaliveTimeouts()}} runs after a file is read by another test, the cache gets populated and the initial assert fails.

Fix is to reset the cache for every test., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12573141/hdfs-4391-1.patch

This message is automatically generated., Test failure unrelated, it's HDFS-4586., +1, the patch looks good to me. The failed test is known to be failing on trunk, and is already tracked by HDFS-4586.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk.
