[* fix TestEditLogLoading in branch-1.

The fix is a simple regular expression tweak., +1 patch looks good., HDFS-3521 changed the error message but did not update the regular expression in TestEditLogLoading.

Tested the patch manually.  It worked fine., I have committed this.  Thanks, Colin!, Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
