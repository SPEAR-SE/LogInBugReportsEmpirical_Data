[Will be an umbrella for sub-tasks to incrementally integrate large internal patches.  In combination with other internal changes (forthcoming IPC optimizations, other object allocation reductions), heap growth has dramatically slowed., Thanks much for posting the JIRAs / patches Daryn.

Quick question: is 2.9 just a temporary target version? Ideally I'd like to apply those optimizations to 2.6., I chose 2.9 solely because branch-2 and trunk have drifted often quite a bit from 2.7 and earlier.  Given the sheer volume of internal optimizations I'm pushing out (I've barely started), I don't have the time to back-port but feel free to pitch in if you like!, Here's an illustration how the GC characteristics on a moderated sized and lightly loaded NN (by Y! standards) when we upgraded to 2.7 early this year.  These path changes and forthcoming IPC changes are the primary optimizations for returning to 2.6 behavior.  (Note we still had to increase heap sizes when upgrading to 2.7, as seen at tail of graph)]
