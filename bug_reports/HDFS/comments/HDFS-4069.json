[Temporarily resolution:
chmod +x /usr/sbin/s*.sh /usr/sbin/update-hadoop-env.sh, Hi,

Thanks for the notes and the temp-resolution bits.

Going forward, for packages please use Apache Bigtop at http://bigtop.apache.org. The Hadoop project no longer maintains nor supports its own former packages and is removing it in the future.

Resolving as Won't Fix.]
