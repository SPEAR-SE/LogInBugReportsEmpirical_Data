[Daryn, are you planning to work on this. I would like to get this fixed in 1.2.0. If you do not have time, can someone else work on it?, Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2., I'm attaching a patch.  This is pretty much just a rebase of what had been provided previously on HDFS-3553.  I've confirmed that the new tests are passing.  Unfortunately, I'm also in the same situation that Daryn mentioned earlier: I don't have a secure branch-1-based environment integrated with Oozie for full end-to-end testing.

[~daryn], do you think we can downgrade the priority?  This became a blocker from being a clone of HDFS-3553.  Meanwhile, there have been 1.x releases that include the bug, so perhaps this isn't really a release blocker., I'm fine with downgrading the priority.  Apparently nobody is using security + oozie + hftp on 1.x.

As for the patch, I think taking JspHelper.getUGI and JspHelper.getTokenUGI from trunk is almost sufficient.  Hftp and webhdfs filesystems might need some tweaking to the uris they construct., Is there anyone working on this to close?, I'm unassigning the issue since I'm no longer actively working on it., I'm going to WONTFIX this one, since it's been alive for almost 4 years, and HFTP has been deprecated (in 2.x) and removed (in 3.x) in favor of WebHDFS. Feel free to re-open if you intend to work on this.]
