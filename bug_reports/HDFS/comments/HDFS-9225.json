org.mockito.exceptions.misusing.WrongTypeOfReturnValue: 
BlockCollection$$EnhancerByMockitoWithCGLIB$$da353aed cannot be returned by isRunning()
isRunning() should return boolean
	at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.TestBlockManager.addBlockOnNodes(TestBlockManager.java:443)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.TestBlockManager.doTestSingleRackClusterIsSufficientlyReplicated(TestBlockManager.java:376)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.TestBlockManager.testBlocksAreNotUnderreplicatedInSingleRack(TestBlockManager.java:368)
{noformat}, The cause seems to be {{TestBlockManager#addBlockOnNodes}} mocking FSNamesytem while the thread launched by {{BlockManager#processMisReplicatedBlocks}} is accessing it. 

There are another problems to use {{BlockManager#processMisReplicatedBlocks}} in the test.
* It is asynchronous and there is no way to wait for it finishes.
* It is no-op if {{FSNamesystem#isRunning}} returns false.

The patch makes test checks the condition by itself instead of calling {{BlockManager#processMisReplicatedBlocks}}., \\
