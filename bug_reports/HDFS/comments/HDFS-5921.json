[Simple patch which fixes the issue. The code in question should have never been referencing the "params" variable at all, and the code which was attempting to replace the last character of the string in the case of the sticky bit will not in fact replace anything in the string. I tested this manually and it seems to work as intended., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

You probably want to use {{substr}} instead of {{slice}}, as {{substr}} usually performs better than {{slice}} in this use case. (http://jsperf.com/string-slice-vs-substr). Here is an example:

{code}
        var exec = ((ctx.current().permission % 10) & 1) == 1;
        res = res.substr(0, res.length - 1) + (exec ? 't' : 'T');
{code}, +1 pending Haohui's comment and Jenkins. I'd like to see this in 2.3.0 too, since it's a rather embarrassing bug., Here's an updated patch which does 's/slice/substr/g'., Looks good to me. +1, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
