[Hi [~James C], this may relate to HDFS-8707. Seems like HDFS-13338, but SASL libraries is installed in my environment:
{noformat}
rpm -aq|grep cyrus-sasl
cyrus-sasl-devel-2.1.23-13.el6_3.1.x86_64
cyrus-sasl-gssapi-2.1.23-13.el6_3.1.x86_64
cyrus-sasl-lib-2.1.23-13.el6_3.1.x86_64
cyrus-sasl-2.1.23-13.el6_3.1.x86_64
cyrus-sasl-plain-2.1.23-13.el6_3.1.x86_64
{noformat}

My guess this is something about the gcc version, will check it out next week., [~GeLiXin] I agree that it's a gcc version issue.  Here's the chunk of code that cmake is trying to build to determine if you have C++11 style thread local support.  

{code}
    #include <thread>
    int main(void) {
      thread_local int s;
      return 0;
    }
{code}

I've built the library without too many issues on various RHEL 6.x versions (and removed the bits that caused issues).  RHEL 4.4 most likely won't have a new enough stdlibc++ to support the some of the C++11 features this uses unless you're willing to build a toolchain from source., [~James C] Thanks for your quick response and test code.

This is indeed a GCC version issue as we guess, the hadoop-hdfs-native-client build success after I upgrade my GCC version to 4.8.5 from source code. 

As described in the [GNU website|https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx11], GCC 4.8.1 was the first feature-complete implementation of the 2011 C++ standard. I have attached a patch which upgraded the {{BUILDING.txt}} to explain this, [~James C] could you please help to review it? Thanks!, | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for finding the right version of GCC to document [~GeLiXin]!

For completeness could you also update the error message in native/libhdfspp/CMakeLists.txt where the check is done?  It says what versions of Clang work but should most likely say GCC needs to be >= 4.8.1 to help out others who run into this., [~James C] Thanks for reviewing this.

I have reverted my GCC to 4.4.7 and get these message below, I'm not sure if this is what you want.
Which would be the better one of the two choices?
1.We just leave these message in this jira for others to search
2.update the patch to add more information in {{BUILDING.txt}}

, [~GeLiXin] I just meant that the warning below could be a little more specific.  Instead of GCC it could say "GCC 4.8.1 or later".

That said I think the patch you have now looks good, +1.  Let me know if you want to extend this and I can check that out too., [~James C] Thanks for the explication, I think I get the point now :)
{quote}Let me know if you want to extend this and I can check that out too.

Yes, willing to make it more helpful. I have updated the patch to contain more information now., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
