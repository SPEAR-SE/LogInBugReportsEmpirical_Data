[here's a patch which doesn't fix the issue, but at least adds a timeout. Unless someone has a fix for the issue ready, I plan to commit this so the timeout stops causing tests lower down the build from failing., It would be good to figure out what commit broke this., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12502015/hdfs-2532-make-timeout.txt
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 6 new or modified tests.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    +1 release audit.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests:
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestDfsOverAvroRpc

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

This message is automatically generated., Binary search of commits points to r1179877 (HDFS-2181).  This test works if you update to r1179876 but hangs when you update to r1179877.  I can start to look at why., I got tired of test-patch builds failing, so I just added the timeout to this test case (hdfs-2532-make-timeout.txt). I'll leave this open to deal with the underlying issue -- but at least now our test results will be properly attributed., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1346 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1346/])
    HDFS-2532. Add timeout to TestDfsOverAvroRpc

This test is timing out on trunk, causing tests below it to
fail spuriously. This patch doesn't fix the issue -- just adds
a JUnit timeout so that the failure is properly attributed
to this test.

Without patch , it is timing out.
Not sure why it is timing out in Jenkins. Not referring the correct jars? or timeout is not enough?
it is taking 12secs locally, is it the case Jenkins taking more than 20secs, so it is timing out?, Verified that the fix works and makes sense. +1.
