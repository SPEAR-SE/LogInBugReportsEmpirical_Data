[Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0., There has been no movement on this for a while. We'll need to move it out of scope for 2.8.0 soon. Let me know if you disagree., Not much going on here for a long time, dropping from 2.8.0.

Not putting any target-version either anymore, let's target this depending on when there is patch activity., I believe this is a dup ofÂ HDFS-5122]
