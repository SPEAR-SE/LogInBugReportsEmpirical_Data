So the connector waited 5 mins., [~zhz] ,  When i was working with balancer last month i too faced this issue ,

Here is the TRACE where it took few hours and no blocks found .. I ended up in Restarting balancer to make it work..


At last i started balancer with -include option ( by pulling LIVE DNs ) and it helped .. Not sure including live nodes is the right solution ?? .. If it is the case i think problem is balancer taking decomm/decommed nodes as well ??

Attaching the discussion which i started sometime back ..
, Thanks [~senthilec566] for reporting the similar issue. Yes it's possible that decomm nodes were causing the infinite delay, in which case {{-include}} is a good workaround. I'll try that in our cluster.

But in general, I think we still should add the timeout logic. E.g. the RPC request could encounter issues on the network layer., Moving target version to 2.7.5 due to 2.7.4 release., Moving target version to 2.7.6 due to 2.7.5 release., Moving target version to 2.7.7 due to 2.7.6 release.]
