[since 'alredy running' check made in NameNodeConnector ctor. 

{code}
  // Check if there is another balancer running.
    // Exit if there is another one running.
    out = checkAndMarkRunningBalancer(); 
    if (out == null) {
      throw new IOException("Another balancer is running");
    }
{code}

simply it is throwing IOException and will not return correct status., Resolving this stale issue as Not A Problem.]
