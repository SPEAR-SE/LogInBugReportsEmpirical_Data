Please review., [~vinayrpet] and [~szetszwo] , can you please have a look at this jira and provide your feedback, Hi [~andreina], thanks for the patch,

Patch looks almost good.

Here are few minor comments,

1. Below lines from {{BlockPlacementPolicyWithNodeGroup#chooseFavouredNodes(..)}} could be just replaced with {{super.chooseFavouredNodes(..)}}
{code}+    for (int i = 0; i < favoredNodes.size() && results.size() < numOfReplicas;
+        i++) {
+      DatanodeDescriptor favoredNode = favoredNodes.get(i);
+      // Choose a single node which is local to favoredNode.
+      // 'results' is updated within chooseLocalNode
+      DatanodeStorageInfo target = null;
+      try {
+        target =
+            chooseLocalStorage(favoredNode, favoriteAndExcludedNodes,
+              blocksize, maxNodesPerRack, results, avoidStaleNodes,
+              storageTypes, false);
+      } catch (NotEnoughReplicasException e) {
+        // catch Exception and continue with other favored nodes
+        continue;
+      }
+      if (target == null) {
+        LOG.warn("Could not find a target for file " + src
+            + " with favored node " + favoredNode);
+        continue;
+      }
+      favoriteAndExcludedNodes.add(target.getDatanodeDescriptor());
+    }{code}

2. {{checkFavoredNodePartOfTarget(..)}} could be renamed to {{isNodeChosen(..)}}

3. {{clusterMapNodeGroup.getNodeGroup(favoredNode.getNetworkLocation())}} can be extracted to a variable {{scope}} for better readability

4. I think its better to update javadoc for {{BlockPlacementPolicyWithNodeGroup#chooseLocalStorage(..)}} by mentioning, fallback to nodegroup/rack will happen if flag {{fallbackToNodeGroupAndLocalRack}} is set., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for the review comments. 
Have updated the patch. Please review., \\

This message was automatically generated., Patch looks good.
checkstyle comments can be cleared by formatting  below line 
{code}    super.chooseFavouredNodes(src, numOfReplicas, favoredNodes,
      favoriteAndExcludedNodes, blocksize,
      maxNodesPerRack, results, avoidStaleNodes, storageTypes);{code}

Whitespaces line endigs also could be removed.

+1 once addresed., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for the review comments.
