[Todd, do you think we should do something to make it so that HDFS can be browsed while in SM? Or should we do something to disable the link?, I think HDFS should be browsable in safe-mode -- perhaps in such a way that we just log a warning that delegation tokens will be non-persistent., Via HDFS-2567, the file browser is also inaccessible when there are no DataNodes available., Why is a blocker?, I suppose blocker is too high, but it is a regression from previous versions., Would making just the directory listing available make sense (files still might be inconsistent)?
, This is no longer issue after HDFS-6252 is merged into branch-2.]
