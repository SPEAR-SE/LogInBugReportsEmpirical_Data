[Below is the offending code.  Thanks to [~avyakrita] for reporting the problem, and thanks to [~szetszwo] for finding the potential leak in the code.

There was some initial suspicion that this could be related to HDFS-3373, however the code is different on branch-1.  This is likely to be a different issue, though the symptoms are similar.

{code}
        } catch (IOException ex) {
          if (refetchToken > 0 && tokenRefetchNeeded(ex, targetAddr)) {
            refetchToken--;
            fetchBlockAt(target);
          } else {
            LOG.warn("Failed to connect to " + targetAddr
                + ", add to deadNodes and continue" + ex);
            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
              LOG.debug("Connection failure", ex);
            }
            // Put chosen node into dead list, continue
            addToDeadNodes(chosenNode);
          }
          if (s != null) {
            try {
              s.close();
            } catch (IOException iex) { }                        
          }
          s = null;
        }
{code}
