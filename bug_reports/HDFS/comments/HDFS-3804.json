This message is automatically generated., Precommit test failure is unrelated; opened issue HDFS-3806 to track., A simpler approach is probably to instantiate the hftp fs in a @Before and closeAll in a @After.  Then the 2nd half of the tests don't have to explicitly do the close., Isn't the problem that the 2nd half tests (testH[s]ftp*) don't want the effects of setUp at all, since it interferes with them picking non-default ports? Given that, it seems like they should be in a separate test case that doesn't have any common setup., The 2nd half of the tests need to ensure they get a new fs instance each time.  Getting a new fs instance for all tests isn't a bad thing though.  If one test changes the internal state of the fs (say changeWorkingDirectory, etc), it can contaminate the other tests.  It frustrates the poor dev trying to figure out why their simple tests don't work -- hint: whose comment do you think that is? :)

Something like this is what I think is needed.
{code}
@Before
public void setupFs() {
  hdfs = ...;
  hftpFs = ...;
}
@After
public void resetFsCache() {
  FileSystem.closeAll();
}
{code}, I understand what you're suggesting, and wasn't concerned about a new FS instance for each test. I agree that @Before/After is a better choice than @BeforeClass/AfterClass, since saving a millisecond isn't worth the fragility.

My point was just that, based on your code comment, it seemed like the filesystem created by setUp would interfere with the filesystems the 2nd half tests were creating. However, I went ahead and tried out the change, and it passed, so I guess that doesn't matter., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Precommit test failures are unrelated issues HDFS-3806 and HDFS-3812., Daryn (or someone else), would you please review the updated patch? I believe it addresses your comments., Unless the tests were conflicting, I'm a bit bothered about starting and stopping the mini-cluster for every test case when most of them don't even need the cluster running.  I think you can probably leave the cluster startup/shutdown in @BeforeClass/@AfterClass.

It's a shame that cluster.getNamesystem().clear() isn't exposed for testing...  If you feel ambitious, you could tag it with @VisibleForTesting and then call it in a @Before to wipe out the namenode.  If you try it, and it works, we should file another jira to change more tests since it might drastically cut the runtime of the test suite., How about this then:

# Use my original approach of moving the {{testH\[s\]ftp}} methods to a new test case. They don't need or want any of the mini-cluster or filesystem setup.
# Even though it's not a cause of failure currently, move just the filesystem setup to {{@Before}}, and if possible, expose and use {{cluster.getNamesystem().clear()}} to wipe the namenode.
# In both test cases, use {{@After}} to perform {{FileSystem.closeAll()}}.
, Could you please test this minimal patch?, Works for me, though I'd also make {{hdfs}} non-static., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
