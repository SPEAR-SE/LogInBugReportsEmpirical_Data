[this is a kind of stupid bug that's easy to repro:
- start a DN on an empty file system
- put one block on the DN
- delete the block

the scanner then gets in a loop, since this.isFirstBlockProcessed() returns false in the case that there are no blocks in the scanner. Putting a block back in the DN fixes it., When i am debugging HDFS-1765, i found that TestReplication also consuming 100% CPU usage.
The cause for that also the same.

Looks, If cluster doesn't contains any blocks can trigger this issue.

I feel the fix could be that, we need to check (blockInfoSet.size() > 0 && !(this.isFirstBlockProcessed())), instaed of just checking isFirstBlockProcessed()., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Todd, can you pls take a look on this issue once here.
In my eclipse, many times it is triggering(Especially for TestReplication) and getting very slow down.

Thanks
Uma, Hey Uma, sorry I missed the patch upload before. One nit:
{code}
-            || (!(this.isFirstBlockProcessed()))) {
+            || (blockInfoSet.size() > 0 && !(this.isFirstBlockProcessed()))) {
{code}
can you use {{!blockInfoSet.isEmpty()}} instead of checking {{size()}}? Should be faster for many collection types., Hi Todd,

Thanks for the review!
Updated the patch!
changed to (!blockInfoSet.isEmpty() && !(this.isFirstBlockProcessed()))) {
Also retained the isEmpty condition in isFirstBlockProcessed because previous(above) check was not there in synchronization. So, there is a chance that block can be removed when just entering into isFirstBlockProcessed.

Thanks
Uma, Todd, can you please take a look., +1 pending a hudson run... I'll trigger one now., Thanks a lot, Todd for the review.

Test failure is unrelated to this patch. Filed separate JIRA for it HDFS-2700, Committed to trunk and 23. Thanks, Uma!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #293 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/293/])
