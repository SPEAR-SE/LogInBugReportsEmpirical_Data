[Sample Java class which may eventually reproduce the problem. , Possible this is HDFS-1189 or HDFS-1377? Can you repro on 0.20.204 or later?, We're running on 0.20.203 with HDFS-1377 and HDFS-2053 backported - sorry, I should have mentioned that in the description.  Would HDFS-1189 apply, since the test case which (sometimes) reproduces this condition doesn't clear the quota?, We are seeing this in 1.0., One example:

{noformat} 
012-04-18 00:06:04,246 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNode:
Inconsistent diskspace for directory xxxxx. Cached: 7877252111770 Computed:

{noformat} 

The delta grows everyday., We (mostly Koji) have tracked it down to abandonBlock().  Branch-1 is missing HDFS-1487. , Since HDFS-1487 is closed, I will track the work in this jira., 0.23.3, 2.0 and trunk have the fix. It's only the branch-1., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1.  Looks like the correct port of HDFS-1487 to branch-1.  Committing to branch-1 and branch-1.0.  Thanks, Kihwal!, Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.0.3., Updating summary to reflect that this patch is the HDFS-1487 patch applied to branch-1.]
