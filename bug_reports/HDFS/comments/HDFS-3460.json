[A kerberos principal is the full name, not the short name. The Java Principal does not have an accessor to get the short principal. The patch tries to cast the Java Principal to AuthenticationToken and if successful it extracts the username which is the short principal.

I've tested this in a deployed setup with Kerberos and it works fine., The patch looks good to me. +1 pending Jenkins.

This message is automatically generated., the failure seems unrelated and a one off, I cannot reproduce it in my environment, if I see it again in Jenkins I'll open a JIRA as a flaky test to fix.

the patch does not have testcase that verifies the change, I've verified the change in a Kerberos deployment using a service principal., committed to trunk and branch-2, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #1056 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1056/])
