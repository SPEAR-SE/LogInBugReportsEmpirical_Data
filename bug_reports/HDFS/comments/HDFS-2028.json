[There is an open bug related to lots of port 50010 sockets hanging around in CLOSE_WAIT state: HDFS-1836 (bug exists in v20 only, was just fixed a couple weeks ago, in v20 branch; patch pending for v20.205).

Also, not sure of the port number, but also related to excessive open sockets: HDFS-1057 (comment [13036525|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-1057?focusedCommentId=13036525&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13036525]), fixed in trunk, 0.21, 0.20-append., Thanks for your reply, and sorry for my late reply. Because the past three days are the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival.
About HDFS-1836 I have tested the v0.20.3 and the problem continues. Because Iã€€saw the fixed version is 0.20.3 and 0.20.205.0. OK, I will test for the version 0.20.205.0. Thank you again!, I checkout version 0.20.205 from svn (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-0.20-security-205/) and built the new core jar.
After replacing the core jar, the problem still retains. When I load data into tables of hive via hiver cli or hive server, there are always some ESTABLISHED status socket connections.
, Hi Zhou,
 AFAIK, ESTABLISTED sockets will be from clients. When we are performing some operations, obviously there will be some ESTABLISHED sockets. Question here is, after completing the operations successfully also they are showing? If they are growing and not coming down also problem. Ideally established sockets will be cleaned after completeing the operation with server.

Thanks
Uma
