[The comment in the 2NN that the checkpoint thread should never end has been removed, presumably as it's no longer relevant.  The checkpoint thread is still a daemon thread, but since the main thread joins on the checkpoint thread, I don't see where it impacts anything.  The 2NN appears to now be consistent with the NN: in both, the main method launches a thread and then joins it.

Sounds like this JIRA was a causality of HDFS-4426.  Anyone against closing it?]
