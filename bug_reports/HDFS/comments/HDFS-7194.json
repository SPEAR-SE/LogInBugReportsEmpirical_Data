[Submitted patch 001. 

Hi [~szetszwo], the change I made for the first issue reported is in on top of HDFS-4257 code. I see that currently we don't do serialization of ReplaceDatanodeOnFailure.Policy, so it should be safe to change the "condition" filed to transient to remove the findbugs warnding. Would you please comment in case I missed anything? thanks a lot.

, We already have HDFS-7169 for ReplaceDatanodeOnFailure.

The another findbugs warnings was introduced by HDFS-7055.  It also introduced some javac warnings., Hi [~szetszwo], 

Thanks for the info. I was not aware of HDFS-7169. We can dedicate HDFS-7194 for the other issue reported here then. 

I'm uploading a revision to drop the change for the HDFS-7169 issue. It's going to be a really trivial change, would you please help reviewing?

Thanks a lot.
, Could you check with Colin?  I am not sure if he already has a plan fixing the findbugs and javac warnings., bq. Could you check with Colin? I am not sure if he already has a plan fixing the findbugs and javac warnings.

I think it's fine to fix the findbugs warning in this JIRA.

I am +1 on the patch pending jenkins., PS: I retitled this JIRA and changed the description a bit to reflect the fact it no longer has to deal with the findbugs warning we fixed in HDFS-7169., Many thanks [~cmccabe] and [~szetszwo].
