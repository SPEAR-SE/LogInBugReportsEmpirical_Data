[The patch removes NNHAStatusHeartbeat.State
and replaces the use of {{instanceof}} to determine the HA state with determining the actual value of the state.
In few cases when when NN deals with Replication Queues we should actually use the existing method HAState.shouldPopulateReplQueues().
This is not directly related to BackupNode, but helps to generalize the logic around it, because BackupState does not extend StandbyState, but has similar (standby) behavior in most cases., +1 patch looks good., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, HAServiceState has 3 states (active,standy,initializing) and NNHAStatusHeartbeat.State has 2 (active,standby). Previously we failed an assert when creating a NNHAStatusHeartbeat with the initializing state, now we permit it - intentional?, {{HAServiceState.INITIALIZING}} means that {{NameNode.state == null}}. Based on the initialization sequence this means RPC server has not started and therefore there cannot be any heartbeats. Do you have a use case for AssertError?]
