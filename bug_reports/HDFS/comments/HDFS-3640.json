[There is a subtle distinction here, between cases where *timeofday* should be used and cases where *monotonic* time should be used.  Both have their place in a distributed system.

If a timer is used to compute a delay period as in HDFS-3485, then it's important to use *monotonic* time.

If a clock is used to generate a time, or a unique identifier, or an opaque token that is written to a persistent store or sent over the wire to another node (even if in an "opaque" object), then it's important to use *timeofday*.]
