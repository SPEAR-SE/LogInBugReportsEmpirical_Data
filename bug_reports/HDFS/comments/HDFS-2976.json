This message is automatically generated., Thanks a lot for finding/filing this issue, Uma. I agree that this method appears to be totally unused, and the patch looks good to me.

It looks like {{tokenRefetchNeeded}} was added in HDFS-2246. Before we commit this patch, I'm going to ping the authors of HDFS-2246 to see if perhaps the fact that this method isn't called is indicative of another issue., I tried to get in touch with the authors of HDFS-2246 offline, but got no response. In light of that, +1., Thanks Aaron, will commit this patch., I just committed this patch, Thanks Aaron for the review!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1927 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1927/])

, I think something may have gone wrong with this commit. Instead of removing the method from DFSClient, it's now included twice. Because of this, trunk does not compile., Yes, Aaron, I noticed it and corrected in next commit.

, This patch was only committed to trunk and not branch-2.  It's about to cause merge conflicts for a few patches that are nearly ready to commit.  Since it's just a code cleanup, I see no harm in merging it down to branch-2.
