This message is automatically generated., Thanks for catching this [~walter.k.su] and submitting a patch. Not sure why Jenkins does not like the patch, it applies fine for me with 'git apply'. Could you try regenerating the patch simply with 'git diff'?

+1 for the change once we get a Jenkins run.

[~walter.k.su], you don't need to delete older patch revisions as they are often useful for reference. Instead you add a version number to patch revisions e.g. HDFS-7633.01.patch, HDFS-7633.02.patch etc., So I just pulled trunk and a commit from yesterday seems to have deleted the code in question. 

Walter, would you be able to check whether the same bug exists in the new BlockScanner?, HDFS-7430. Refactor the BlockScanner and bug code is deleted, HDFS-7430. Refactor the BlockScanner and bug code is deleted. , HDFS-7430 Refactor the BlockScanner so the bug code HDFS-7633 is deleted. , Thanks for looking at this, guys.  I agree that we should close it now since the new block scanner does not have this problem.  You will probably also find that you've now got a lot of spare memory on these nodes post HDFS-7430 :), Resolving this instead as not-a-problem-anymore.]
