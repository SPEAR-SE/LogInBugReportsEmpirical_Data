[Couple of fixes to get this test passing on Windows:

- File.setExecutable and File.setReadable don't work on Windows, so we use the local filesystem's setPermission routine which has been fixed to work on Windows.

- The Windows "List contents" permission is enforced differently from the POSIX directory "Execute" permission. Revoking the permission from the parent directory does not prevent child directories from being modified. Hence the test has been modified to manipulate permissions on the child directory (name1\current)., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
