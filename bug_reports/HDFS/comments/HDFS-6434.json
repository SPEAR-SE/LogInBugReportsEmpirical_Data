, LGTM overall, thanks for picking this one up Wellington.

Question, are symlink permissions meaningful? They don't do anything on local FSs. I think it's okay to pass it for consistency, but this change might not be necessary. Up to you.

Otherwise, we just fixup the checkstyle and can get this in. If you could edit the JIRA to add a release note (since this is an incompatible change) that'd also be appreciated., Hi [~andrew.wang], thanks for reviewing it. For the symlinks permissions, I had followed what 's described on [linux manpages for symlink|http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/symlink.7.html]:

{noformat}
On Linux, the permissions of a symbolic link are not used in any
       operations; the permissions are always 0777 (read, write, and execute
       for all user categories), and can't be changed.
{noformat}

I'm attaching a new patch with the 2 checkstyle issues fixed. As per the whitespace issue reported, I'm a bit confused, since it seems to be reporting white spaces for a file that is not included in this patch:

Is it possible this is some build process issue?, Hmm, so I dug in a little more to this issue, and noticed HADOOP-9155. It looks like the default permissions are supposed to be 0777 for dirs and 0666 for files, and WebHdfsFileSystem is unfortunately not using the new FsPermission methods that were introduced. The default umask of 0022 at {{CommonConfigurationKeys.FS_PERMISSIONS_UMASK_DEFAULT}} is what then brings it down to to 0755 or 0644.

So, is the right fix here to use the new FsPermission methods, i.e. getDirDefault and getFileDefault? I think we can just call this one a bug, given that the behavior in HADOOP-9155 is the expected one.
, Forgot to add, those whitespace issues are unrelated, separate issue that should be fixed now., Hi [~andrew.wang], thanks for the comments. Per the umask and FsPermissions methods suggestion, this has been discussed on [HDFS-10488|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-10488], where original proposal was to apply same behaviour to WebHDFS.

However, conclusions were that it should not apply any umask, but the default permissions for files and directories should be fixed as suggested here, Hi, any additional thoughts on my previous comments?, Sorry for the delay, been travelling recently. Thanks for the pointer to HDFS-10488, that reasoning makes sense to me. I'm +1, will commit shortly., Committed to trunk, thanks for the contribution Wellington!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10028 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10028/])
HDFS-6434. Default permission for creating file should be 644 for (wang: rev c0829f449337b78ac0b995e216f7324843e74dd2)
