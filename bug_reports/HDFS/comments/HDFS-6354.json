[The login using spnego principal and keytab happens in KerberosAuthenticationHandler#init, thus the login failure may be hidden in the http server. If we want to make NN startup to fail, does that mean we need to do some fake login in NameNode? [~daryn], could you provide some input here?, The affected version is 2.2.  I think 2.3 or 2.4 checks if filter init fails, if yes, takes down the NN.

However...  That's for JDK6.  JDK7 decided that keytab logins are lazy!  A LoginContext will _always_ return success regardless of whether the principal is in the keytab OR if the keytab even exists.  It's not until a gss session starts that an exception will be thrown for a missing principal or missing keytab.  I thought it was a bug.  It's by design.

So which hadoop and JDK version is involved?, Thanks for the quick reply, [~daryn]!
[~arpitgupta], could you please provide the hadoop and jdk version?, [~daryn]

I was manually just testing out i cannot recall what JDK version was being used at that time. This was tested on 2.4 , The multiple principal spnego support feature should indirectly uncover a misconfiguration since it has to read the keytab (which may throw) and then throws if no HTTP principals are found.  Perhaps we need to extend the auth handler to verify an explicit principal is in the keytab too.]
