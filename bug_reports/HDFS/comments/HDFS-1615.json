[>After closing an input stream on DFS, seeking slightly ahead of the last read will throw an NPE:

Isn't this a good thing? It exposes bugs at the layer above DFS. I'd prefer to keep this behaviour rather than fix it., It should throw IOE, not NPE :), Patch contains simple fix, and unit test that fails without the fix., +1 pending Hudson test results, Patch that makes closed inp-stream throw IOE instead. And a new test case for DFSInputStream (I could not find any existing one, so let me know if there is indeed one that covers general open/read/close stuff - I will update patch gladly.), Ooh! Darn I did not notice it got re-assigned, sorry 'bout that. Carry on Scott!, Ack, Scott, can you resubmit your file? I believe mine would end up conflicting the Hudson build. I'm unable to figure out how to delete it. Sorry again for not noticing the reassign man!, Ah ok, I deleted my patch. My patch was this anyway, for reference: https://github.com/QwertyManiac/hadoop-hdfs/commit/fc7ac93ed5428651b63c8a6315cf6815303b4222, No problem -- JIRA race condition.  Your error message string is better than mine.  I could not find any more specific testing around this either, but put the new test in an already existing class., Actually, I think it was my fault -- I thought it was unassigned when I assigned it to me.
