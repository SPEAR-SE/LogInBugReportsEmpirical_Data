[The code in question is here:

{code}
jboolean jRecursive = recursive;
  
if (invokeMethod(env, &jVal, &jExc, INSTANCE, jFS, HADOOP_FS,
"delete", "(Lorg/apache/hadoop/fs/Path;Z)Z", jPath, jRecursive) != 0)
{                                                                               
    errno = errnoFromException(jExc, env, "org.apache.hadoop.fs."
"FileSystem::delete");
   
    destroyLocalReference(env, jPath);
   
    return -1;
}                                                                                                                         
{code}

jRecursive must get either JNI_FALSE or JNI_TRUE., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
