[Attaching patch for trunk and branch2.
The reason for failure is due to test ordering.

testGetFileStatusOnNonExistantFileDir() tests to get a failure for a directory that does not exist.
But when testGetFileStatusOnDir() creates a directory of the same name that the testGetFileStatusOnNonExistantFileDir() uses and it never deletes the path.

So whenever testGetFileStatusOnDir() runs before testGetFileStatusOnNonExistantFileDir(), the test for non existing directory fails as it has already been created in a test that ran before it., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
