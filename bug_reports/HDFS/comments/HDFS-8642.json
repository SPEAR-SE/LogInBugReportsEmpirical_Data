This message was automatically generated., Hi [~rakeshr], thanks for improving this test.

We could still hit a failure during snapshot deletion. Should we just spin up a new MiniDFSCluster for each test case?, Thanks a lot [~arpitagarwal] for the reviews.

Yes, this will make tests more stable, but it will increase the unit testing time. I've tried another approach where it will create separate path for each test case and attached patch here. Does this sounds good to you?, \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~rakeshr], it's better to spin up and shut down a new mini cluster for each test case. Reusing the same cluster can hide test case ordering bugs which can be hard to track down. We had to fix a number of such issues in the past when porting to Java7 and Windows.

Long term we can reduce usage of MiniDFSCluster in tests., OK, I got it. Thanks[~arpitagarwal] for the explanation. Attached another patch where it does start/shutdown cluster for each test case., \\

The findbugs warning looks bogus. I will commit it shortly., Committed for 2.8.0.
