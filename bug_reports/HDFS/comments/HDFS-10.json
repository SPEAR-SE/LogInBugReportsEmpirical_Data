[I can't figure out what triggers this bug, but I've now seen it 3-4 times in the past 2-3 weeks.  I think it might have something to do with datanodes going down badly., Here's another one from trying to add a new node to my cluster:

2007-04-30 23:10:18,040 INFO org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: BLOCK* NameSystem.heartbeatCheck: lost heartbeat from x.y.z.237:50010
2007-04-30 23:10:18,040 INFO org.apache.hadoop.net.NetworkTopology: Removing a node: /default-rack/x.y.z.237:50010
2007-04-30 23:10:18,040 INFO org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: BLOCK* NameSystem.heartbeatCheck: lost heartbeat from x.y.z.237:50010
2007-04-30 23:10:18,040 INFO org.apache.hadoop.net.NetworkTopology: Removing a node: /default-rack/x.y.z.237:50010
2007-04-30 23:10:18,040 INFO org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: BLOCK* NameSystem.heartbeatCheck: lost heartbeat from x.y.z.237:50010, These things help ops determine HDFS activity. If you do not wish to see them ever, you may turn up the logging to a WARN or higher level. Its INFO by default.

Resolving as Won't Fix, as these things are useful and yet not too much info to be DEBUG-only.]
