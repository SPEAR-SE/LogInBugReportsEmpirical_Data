[No exception or other hints show that the hdfs folder which mounted to viewfs MUST exist and we cannot created by mkdir command. Is it necessary to make the mount viewfs folder be creatable? Or throw a exception when mkdir command under a viewfs path which is actually not exist?

Â , As InternalDirOfViewFs is readonly, The path of a mount path cannot be created if no deeper path is givern. I made a prospective in patch 000, mkdir function for ViewFileSystem is changed when resolving the path. I wonder if it is necessary to make this change and if this change is proper.

Try to change mkdir function in FileContext as well.]
