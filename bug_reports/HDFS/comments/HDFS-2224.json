[Hi,

  I am trying to build libhdfs from trunk and I am unable to build with the following command
mvn clean install package -DskipTests -Pdist -Dtar -Pnative -Pdocs

Could someone please let me know how to build native code. There isn't any build.xml to build with ant either

Thanks., mvn compile -Pnative runs the native build, please send mail to hdfs-dev@ with more info if that doesn't work for you., Thanks Eli, I was trying to compile on Mac and realised later that hdfs native does not support compiling native code on mac. I compiled the native code as mentioned above and ran the tests using test-libhdfs.sh, it seemed to fail and i have fixed the same with the patch above. But i never ran into the problem you have mentioned in the issue. Let me know on how to run the tests to get the error mentioned above I will try to work on this issue, stale]
