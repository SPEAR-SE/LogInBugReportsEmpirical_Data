[Hi [~bergenholtz],

{{fs -du}}, that is {{getContentSummary}} is a NameNode only operation. NameNode does have an account of all allocated blocks for a file. But, for the currently being-written files, NameNode doesn't have visibility on the amount of data being written to the last or the UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Block on various DataNodes. That is, NameNode most of the times lacks the byte level length accuracy for the files being written. NameNode eventually catches up on the block and file length when the file is closed or when client runs hflush or hsync on the write stream. Not just {{du}} command, but other length query commands/APIs like like {{ls}} or {{getFileStatus}}  also have the similar behavior. ]
