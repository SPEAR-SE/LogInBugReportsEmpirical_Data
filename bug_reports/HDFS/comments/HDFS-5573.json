[Add further information:
Suppose nn1 is active NN, nn2 is SNN, 
Add pool, add directives, list directives using CacheAdmin CLI  are all work.

Stop nn1(hadoop-daemon.sh stop  namenode), nn2 transite to active now,  then
start nn1(hadoop-daemon.sh start  namenode)

so I made name node failover manually, then:

All CacheAdmin CLI cannot work now.
