[Thanks for reporting this. Care to submit a fix changing the op values to the right one? I suspect these may be leftovers from the Hoop days.

bq. Not sure what the convention should be for specifying the user.name. Use hdfs? or a name that is obviously an example?

Since these are curl based examples that also likely assume no kerberos setup, why not $USER or $(whoami) instead of a hardcoded value?]
