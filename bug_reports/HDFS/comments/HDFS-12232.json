[I believe it can be worked around by enabling ipc client level retry, which is disabled by default in HA setup.  This allows the internal addr change logic to re-resolve and connect to the new server.  The fundamental fix is more involved as storing and handling of {{ConnectionID}} need to be changed.
E.g.
{code:xml}
<property>
  <name>dfs.client.retry.policy.spec</name>
  <value>2000,10</value>
</property>
{code}]
