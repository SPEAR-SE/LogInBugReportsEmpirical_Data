[This looks like it may be an Ivy issue:

[ivy:resolve] downloading https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common-test/0.23.0-SNAPSHOT/hadoop-common-test-0.23.0-20101226.201
217-25.jar ...
[ivy:resolve] ..
{noformat}
The common jar that's being pulled is from before the fix was committed and so the regression test is triggering the event.  , A new version of the commons jar has been pushed to Ivy.  This has resolved itself.  Closing the issue.

Of concern though is when the test fails in this way it does just fail, it locks up and stops any more tests from proceeding.  This is suboptimal, but since it's unlikely to be an issue again, it's probably not worth focusing on now.]
