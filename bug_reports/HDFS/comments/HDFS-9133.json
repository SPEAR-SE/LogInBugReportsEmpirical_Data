This message was automatically generated., Thanks Colin for the work.  The patch itself looks good, +1. 

I have two small comments not related to the patch, but for {{ExternalBlockReader}}:

*1.*
There is some mismatched between {{ExternalBlockReader}}  and other BlockReaders

{code}
ExternalBlockReader(ReplicaAccessor accessor, long visibleLength,
                      long startOffset) {
    this.accessor = accessor;
    this.visibleLength = visibleLength;
    this.pos = startOffset;
  }
{code}

{code}
return new ExternalBlockReader(accessor, length, startOffset);
{code}

{code}
/**
   * Number of bytes to read.  -1 indicates no limit.
   */
  private long length = -1;

/**
   * The offset within the block to start reading at.
   */
  private long startOffset;
{code}

For other block readers, the {{length}} means the number of bytes to read,  but in {{ExternalBlockReader}}, it means "visible length" which assumes it's the block replica length? Since from the calculation of {{skip}} and {{available}} in {{ExternalBlockReader}} , it indicates it assumes it's the block replica length.

For example, if client wants to read 5 bytes starting from pos 100,  then in {{ExternalBlockReader}}, the block replica is only 5 bytes, it's not correct.

*2.*
{code}
/**
   * Set the length of the replica which is visible to this client.  If bytes
   * are added later, they will not be visible to the ReplicaAccessor we are
   * building.  In order to see more of the replica, the client must re-open
   * this HDFS file.  The visible length provides an upper bound, but not a
   * lower one.  If the replica is deleted or truncated, fewer bytes may be
   * visible than specified here.
   */
  public abstract ReplicaAccessorBuilder setVisibleLength(long visibleLength);
{code}

Here it says the visible length is the upper bound, if so, how can we use it to calculate the {{available()}}., bq. Thanks Colin for the work. The patch itself looks good, +1.

Thanks

bq. For other block readers, the length means the number of bytes to read, but in ExternalBlockReader, it means "visible length" which assumes it's the block replica length? Since from the calculation of skip and available in ExternalBlockReader , it indicates it assumes it's the block replica length.

You are correct... we should not be treating this as the {{visibleLength}} of the block, since it's really the number of bytes in between the end of the block and the current offset within the block.  Let me file another jira to fix this., I filed HDFS-9147 to fix the naming and documentation of the ExternalBlockReader length field., LGTM. +1.
