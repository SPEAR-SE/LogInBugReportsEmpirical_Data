[Fixing this at the QJM side is pretty easy - just need to add a few more checks.

We should also re-evaluate the selectInputStreams() API when called in the middle of a segment. Perhaps it should return the full segment, and fast-forward into it to the correct transaction? That would have also helped this. But, either way, the extra sanity checks are valuable., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I suppose you restart hdfs on the standby NN, right?, Yep, the problem occurs if you restart the SBN and then try to transition it to active after you've loaded an fsimage that fell in the middle of a log segment., Todd,
I looked at the patch, which checked more condition, and throw Exceptions. I just want to advice:

even if we add more check and throw releated Exceptions, but if a new Administrator restart the SBN and face to these Exception message, he/she don't know how to do, just know SBN cannot start normally, or cannot transit to Active. 

so can you set an boolean Exception flag, which is false initially, then each check, just set this flag to true, don't throw Exception. then throw one Exception message finally after all check finished. and add an additional explanation in the Exception message, "please copy {namenode.name.dir}/* from Active NN to the Standby NN to solve this problem."


, Hi Fengdong. I think making the user experience of broken setups is a different task than this JIRA, which is just a bug fix. I don't want to scope creep this, since it's an important fix for data safety.

Additionally, always telling the admin to copy the data dir between nodes is dangerous -- once we're in an inconsistent state, an expert should really look at it to understand the correct recovery. Giving resolution advice in an error message is risky, since we're already in a bad state we may end up giving the wrong advice., Yes, Todd, I agree with you abosulotely.

to slove this problem finally, we should sync all transactions on the ative NN to the SBN during shut down HDFS, right?
so can we open another JIRA for it?, HDFS-5074 explains the way in which we end up with a mid-segment checkpoint and should also solve this issue -- it will return the 1-1000 segment from selectInputStreams and properly read it at startup. But, this fix is still good to add as an extra safety guard.]
