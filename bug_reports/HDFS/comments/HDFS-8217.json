This message was automatically generated., Handled checkstyle comments, Hi [~vinayrpet],

Just looked over the work.

My only nit, I see you are changing the style of the LOG.info from String concat to StringBuilder. 
It does change the overall style of other LOG.info statements and the two are equivalent after compilation so long as the String concat is not within a loop.

Other than that, looks good! Thanks!, Thanks [~zero45] for taking a look at the patch.
bq. My only nit, I see you are changing the style of the LOG.info from String concat to StringBuilder. 
Yes I agree that style is changed. But It depends on how you use while building big messages and *conditional* messages.
In the first patch (.01.patch) if you see, I followed the earlier approach, but since I used inline conditional statements I got checkstyle comment from [~hadoopqa].
And I thought StringBuilder would be better., I think it is fine to ignore AvoidInlineConditionalsCheck.
Automation tools should help improve code, but this one just forces you to write bunch of code for a simple LOG message.
+1 on your first version., Thanks [~shv] and [~zero45]
I will commit the first version., Removed the .02 patch to not to confuse further, Committed to trunk and branch-2, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7660 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7660/])
