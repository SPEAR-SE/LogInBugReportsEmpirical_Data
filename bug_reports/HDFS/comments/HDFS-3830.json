[by the way, this fixes a regression introduced by HDFS-2727, The patch LGTM.  Please comment on what testing you've done with this patch and what the impact of it is.  Can you reproduce the failure locally?  If so, note the frequency of failure and an example command that triggers failure., I tested the patch by running test_libhdfs_threaded.  Before doing so, I added the jars from share/hadoop/hdfs and share/hadoop/common to my CLASSPATH.  (I am working with the tarball layout here.)

Without this patch, the test fails intermittently.  The failure mode that I saw was an exception from one thread about the FileSystem being closed (because someone closed FileSystem shared by all threads, and it doesn't reference-count.), +1 pending jenkins, -1 overall.
