This message is automatically generated., patch looks pretty good. Let's see what Hudson thinks., oh.. I was looking at an old tab where Hudson hadn't commented yet :) Hudson says +1, so I agree. Let me loop the test that was failing for a few minutes, then we'll commit if it all looks good., After looping for 15 minutes I saw no failures, where I could get it to fail regularly without the patch.

Committed to trunk. Thanks, Suresh!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #685 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/685/])
