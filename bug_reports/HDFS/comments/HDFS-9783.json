[deadlock revealed by jstack, This issue has been already fixed in HDFS-9661 which is available in branch-2.7 ( 2.7.3)
And the stacktrace shown is not part of hadoop-2.6 code. {{FsDataSetImpl#moveBlockAcrossStorage(..)}} not present in 2.6 code.

So IMO this would be a duplicate., Resolving as duplicate.
Feel free to re-open if fix in HDFS-9661 doesnt work for you.]
