[We are seeing very similar behavior with HBase 0.98.12 on Hadoop 2.6.0, though in our case, the CORRUPT blocks are only reported when using the -openforwrite flag. It is indicating missing blocks for WALs being written to, and the same 83 B you see here. Further, when we shut hbase down, the report is healthy again. We did not see this behavior on HBase 0.98.12 and Hadoop 2.2.0

Here is our corrupt blocks report:

{noformat}, Looks like this is an issue caused by HDFS-8215. Before, we skip the whole check if the block is under construction and "showOpenFiles" is disabled:
{code}
    isOpen = blocks.isUnderConstruction();
    if (isOpen && !showOpenFiles) {
      // We collect these stats about open files to report with default options
      res.totalOpenFilesSize += fileLen;
      res.totalOpenFilesBlocks += blocks.locatedBlockCount();
      res.totalOpenFiles++;
      return;
    }
{code}

HDFS-8215 still includes this logic in {{collectFileSummary}} but not in {{collectBlocksSummary}}, where the UC blocks are reported as missing., There is another issue here, which I think exists before HDFS-8215. When "-OPENFORWRITE" is enabled, an UC block is still treated as missing/corrupted, since {{countNodes}} only checks the triplets inside of the BlockInfo and thus the liveReplicas is usually 0 for a UC block.

The fix can be to ignore the check if the block is the last one and it's UC. Theoretically the penultimate block can also be in the committed state and with 0 reported replica yet, but maybe we do not need to handle this part here., \\
