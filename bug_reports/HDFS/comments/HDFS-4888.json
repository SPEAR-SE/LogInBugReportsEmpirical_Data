[[~raviprak], could you give us more details?, Refactoring patch for trunk.

, Kousuke,
The code was unnecessarily complex IMHO. I was thinking something more along the lines of what this patch does. Opinions?, The change in behavior is:
1. Prints a "It was turned on manually" when the safemode was initially entered into manually. 
2. Prints the "The number of live datanodes %d has reached...." message when in extension mode. Previously only the "The reported blocks %d has reached the threshold" message was printed., The same patch applies to branch-2

This message is automatically generated., Ravi, I agree with you. I think it is important to print message properly in view of inspection or trouble shooting., Ravi, here are my review comments:

* {{//Automatic safemode}} : the resource-low case is also automatic. Perhaps you meant start-up safe mode?
* Removal of the {{datanodeThreshold > 0}} condition: by setting this threshold to 0, the check is disabled. So we still want this check in the original place and also added around the message, "needs additional x live datanodes".
* When printing out the extension period, {{reached + extension - now()}} can become negative if repl queue init takes more than the extension (30 seconds by default). Use of Linux THP makes this a lot faster, but it can still exceed 30 seconds for large name spaces. If that happens, the time-to-exit increases every time the message is printed. Rather than Math.abs(), it should say something like "soon"., Hi Kihwal! Thanks for reviewing the patch.
By automatic safemode I meant the NN will come out of safemode automatically. I've clarified that comment in this new patch.
I feel we should print out the datanodeThreshold and the current number of datanodes even if the threshhold is set to 0. Removal of the condition was deliberate as I noted in my earlier comment's point 2.
Oh cool! So we can actually fix a bug with this JIRA and its not a simple refactor. Swell. Thanks Kihwal! :-) This patch makes that change., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
