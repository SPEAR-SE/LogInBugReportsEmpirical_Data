, It appears that this jira introduces one new findbugs warnings in Jenkins.

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/12138/artifact/patchprocess/trunkFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs.html, thx for pointing it out, I just filed HDFS-8969, I wonder how {{editLogStream}} inconsistence synchronization findbug was introduced in this Jira, as there is no change related to synchronization in the patch.
I feel that was a existing findbug, but shown as this patch touches {{FSEditlog}}., Hi [~vinayrpet]
{{getTotalSyncCount()}} is introduced in HDFS-8911 which is using  {{editLogStream}},where it was not synchronized.And this issue introduced one more.

{noformat}, Oh. Okay, got it. Since patch accessed twice for null check, it changed the number :), FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8358 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8358/])
