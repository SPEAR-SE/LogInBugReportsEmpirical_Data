This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the fix, Brandon! The patch looks good to me. Some minors in the test:
# This line needs clean
{code}
+    //Mockito.when(fos.getPos()).thenReturn((long) 6);
{code}
# It will be helpful to have some javadoc in the test to explain what scenarios have been covered

+1 after addressing the comments., Thank you, Jing.
