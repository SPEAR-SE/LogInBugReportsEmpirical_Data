[This issue is a HADOOP (Common) one, not HDFS.

You can achieve a solution to globbing by Hadoop DFS by using {{FsShell.copy}} via {{hdfs -cp}} with a command like:
{{hdfs -cp 'file:/home/test/*.jar' /destination}}

This command does a globbing on its own (not shell-driven). Should also work inside Grunt/etc.{{.}}

To programmatically call {{fs}} sub-functions, it would be wise use the Hadoop's {{FileSystem}} API directly in your language instead. There are Python bindings for HDFS available, to start with, apart from the Java one provided.

Regarding glob differences in Shell/Hadoop, there isn't really a standard available to conform to (please correct me if I'm wrong). A good collection of cases is covered in {{test/o.a.h.fs.TestGlobPaths}}, which IMHO caters to most of globbing requirements (there's also a subset of regular-expression support available)., "Moved" to Hadoop Common as HADOOP-7141.]
