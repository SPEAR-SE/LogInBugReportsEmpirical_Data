[Here's a patch that fixes the issue (I reran TestDFSShell and TestEditLogRace manually. will rerun the rest of the unit tests on my internal hudson in a minute), Can we get this committed to 0.20-append Dhruba (Thanks)?, Oh, reviewed patch, +1 (In hbase we actually build into a dir other than 'build' -- this hard-coding was dirtying our checkout and likely confusing as fellas tried to figure where it all was coming from)., @Dhruba Any chance of getting this committed to branch-0.20-append since w/o it tests are broke?, +1

Both TestDFSShell and TestEditLogRace pass with this patch on branch 20. I will commit this to branch-0.20 and branch-0.20-append., I've committed this to branch-0.20 and branch-0.20-append.  Thanks Todd!]
