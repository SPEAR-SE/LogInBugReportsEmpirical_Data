This message is automatically generated., looks reasonable to me.  have you tested on RHEL5?, No - RHEL 6 only, but I've tested this change in another CMake project on RHEL 5 (among others) before. Is there a specific problem you might expect on RHEL 5 or something?, that's probably fine, then., Just tested on a RHEL 5 cluster - no problem., Also works on Ubuntu 10.04, FWIW, +1, the patch looks good to me. I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks a lot for the contribution, Sean, and thanks a lot to Colin as well for the review., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3653 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3653/])
