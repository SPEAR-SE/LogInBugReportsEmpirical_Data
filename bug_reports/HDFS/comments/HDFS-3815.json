[I think this is an invalid one. The "CorruptBlocks" is counted per block, not per replica. But I agree the metric name is misleading as mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5189

{code}
public class CorruptReplicasMap{
  private SortedMap<Block, Map<DatanodeDescriptor, Reason>> corruptReplicasMap =
    new TreeMap<Block, Map<DatanodeDescriptor, Reason>>();
  public int size() {
    return corruptReplicasMap.size();
  }
}
{code}]
