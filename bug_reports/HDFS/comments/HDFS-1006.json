[for previous version of hadoop. Not for commit., New patch for Y20 branch, not to be committed., Minor updates to the previous patch., Patch that removes unnecessary logins (for Y20s), Trunk for patch, pretty much.  The bugfix that was added depends on HDFS-1045, which itself depended on the original 1006.  This patch doesn't include the bugfix, which will be included as part of 1045, which is probably the more correct place for it.  Forward port is straight-forward and, due to the Kerberos, not unit testable, but has been manually tested at Y!...., submitting patch., You missed setting: 
{noformat}infoServer.setAttribute("secondary.name.node", this);{noformat}

You switched from using StringBuilder to StringBuffer in TransferFsImager.java. Is that deliberate?

I am not sure whether the SecondaryNameNode->PrimaryNameNode communication will work if security is enabled and the configured address (accessed in SecondaryNameNode.getInfoServer) is a wildcard address. If not, should we throw an error?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Now throw an exception if using wildcard addr with security, although once we have a unit testing framework for Kerberos - please, please, please - we'll need to come up with a good way of dealing with this., Re-submitting to Hudson., -1 overall.
