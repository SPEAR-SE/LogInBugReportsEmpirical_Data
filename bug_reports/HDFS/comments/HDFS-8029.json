[[~kanaka], thanks for reporting the issue. I tried your steps as shown below but can't reproduce the issue. 
Do you miss any repro step in the original description?

{code}
$ hdfs dfs -ls /
$ hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /test/sub1/sub2
$ hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal sh.tar /test/sub1/file1
$ hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal sh.tar /test/sub1/sub2/file1
$ hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /test/sub1
Allowing snaphot on /test/sub1 succeeded
$ hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /test/sub1 "s1"
Created snapshot /test/sub1/.snapshot/s1
$ hdfs dfs -rm -r /test/sub1/sub2

Deleted /test/sub1/sub2
$ hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /test/sub1 "s2"
Created snapshot /test/sub1/.snapshot/s2
$ hadoop fs -du /test/

{code}, [~xyao] , the steps are same as mentioned. But it seems the patch for HDFS-7824  given by you last week fixed this issue too.
So, in the latest trunk its not reproducing. The earlier version of code was having this issue., Thanks [~kanaka] for the confirmation! I'm resolving this as Fixed by HDFS-7824.]
