[This is critical for us to be fixed. Basically, the crash shows up when there are multiple native libraries using JNI in the same application. In our case, this was from gatk([https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk)] that packages numerous jars with some having embedded native libraries. We worked around this issue by rewriting hdfsThreadDestructor in hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/native/libhdfs/os/posix/thread_local_storage.c

static void hdfsThreadDestructor(void *v)
 {
   JavaVM *vm;
   JNIEnv *env = v;
   jint ret;

  ret = (*env)->GetJavaVM(env, &vm);
   if (ret)

{     fprintf(stderr, "hdfsThreadDestructor: GetJavaVM failed with error %d\n",     ret);     (*env)->ExceptionDescribe(env);   }

else {
     *// Buggy JVM support, DetachCurrentThread throws exceptions sometimes.*
     *// Workaround is to try to AttachCurrentThread as it is a noop if the*
     *// Thread is already attached.*
     *ret = (*vm)->AttachCurrentThread(vm, (void**)&env, 0);
     *if (ret == JNI_OK) {*
       (**vm)->DetachCurrentThread(vm);*
     *}*
   }
 }

 

Is there any possibility of getting this issue fixed soon?]
