[fs.truncate(..) is non-blocking. There is a race condition between fs.truncate(..) and restartDataNode(dn0..)

Normally the steps are:
1. NameNode convert lastBlock to UC, and put block recovery command in the queue
2. Before dn0,dn1 has a chance to send heartbeats, they restarts
3. dn0 get the command and do truncation.

It's tiemout here becasue the steps become:
1. NameNode convert lastBlock to UC, and put block recovery command in the queue
2. dn0 sends a heartbeat, get the command
3. dn0,dn1 restarts
4. lastBlock is stuck in UC state.

The test case {{testTruncateWithDataNodesRestartImmediately}} is not well designed. It should be more fine-grained. We should test restart DataNode 
1. block recovery command is sent or not.
2. before/after DataNode.updateReplicaUnderRecovery() has been called., Thanks [~walter.k.su] for the analysis. You have done a fix in HDFS-8729 so I am assuming you're the expert :) Please feel free to assign this jira to yourself!, I am assigning this JIRA to myself and will follow [~walter.k.su]'s analysis to work out a fix. Thanks!]
