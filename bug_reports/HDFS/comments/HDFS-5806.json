This message is automatically generated., LGTM, +1. Nathan, I assume you tested this manually?, Andrew, thanks for taking a look. Sorry about not mentioning the testing. 

Didn't have great ideas on how to test. Basically did the following
- Changed balancer so that sotimeout was 1 second
- Changed balancer so that sleeptime between iterations was 2 seconds
- Changed dispatch() within balancer to randomly not send the request - this causes the response read to timeout due to sotimeout
- Made sure TestBalancer still worked
, Sounds good to me, thanks Nathan. I'll commit shortly., Committed to trunk and branch-2, thanks again Nathan., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5035 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5035/])
