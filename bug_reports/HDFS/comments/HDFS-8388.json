I'm thinking changing the return value of these method is incompatible because the method is used for metrics and JMX. http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Compatibility.html#MetricsJMX
Would you fix the formatting in {{helper_date_tostring}} of {{dfshealth.js}}? I've implemented similar function in YARN WebUI by YARN-570, so you can re-use the code., The formatting should be fully done in the client side instead of server side due to complications such as locale and DST. A robust solution should use dedicated library like moment.hs, Thanks [~wheat9]. Using dedicated library like [moment.js|http://momentjs.com/] seems better than implementing it., Thanks [~ajisakaa] and [~wheat9] for suggestion.

I attached new patch, Please review...

Now this patch will format date in local time zone and display like this:

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~surendrasingh] for updating the patch. Two comments from me.
1. Started time looks invalid. Would you fix it?
2. Would you use "ddd MMM DD HH:mm:ss ZZ YYYY" format instead of "ddd MMM DD HH:mm:ss YYYY" to be consistent with YARN Web UI?, Attaching a screenshot.
!ScreenShot-InvalidDate.png!, bq. 1. Started time looks invalid. Would you fix it?
Started time is already rendered by Date.toString(), so I'm thinking we don't need to re-format by moment.js.

I have an additional comment: Would you use moment.min.js instead of moment.js to minimize the source code as HDFS-8816?, Thanks [~ajisakaa] for review..

bq. 2. Would you use "ddd MMM DD HH:mm:ss ZZ YYYY" format instead of "ddd MMM DD HH:mm:ss YYYY" to be consistent with YARN Web UI?

If I use "ddd MMM DD HH:mm:ss ZZ YYYY" format then "Block Deletion Start Time" and "Compiled" time is coming like this 
{noformat}
Compiled:	Mon Jul 06 12:20:00 +0530 2015 by sslilhore from trunk
Block Deletion Start Time:	Thu Jul 30 14:31:30 +0530 2015
{noformat}

and Started time is like this 
{noformat}
Started:	Thu Jul 30 17:01:30 CST 2015
{noformat}

here Compiled time zone is "+0530" but Started time zone is "CST".

is this ok ??, Thanks [~surendrasingh] for the comment. I'm thinking we should convert the started time to ZZ (ex. +0530) to be sync. Javascript does not support timezone correctly and that's why moment.js "zz" format support is deprecated.
We cannot change the format of {{NNStarted}} metric for keeping compatibility, so we need to create a new metric such as {{NNStartedTimeInMillis}} and parse it by moment.js., Thanks [~ajisakaa] for suggestions

This message was automatically generated., I wonder why you need to change the JMX? Is it possible to use moment.js to parse the date instead?, Thanks [~wheat9] for review...

I tried to parse *NNstart* date in *002* patch using moment.js , but some time it is giving "invalid date" message...

Please check attached image "ScreenShot-InvalidDate.png"., bq. Is it possible to use moment.js to parse the date instead?
No, moment.js cannot parse {{zz}} format. I'll check whether moment-timezone.js can parse {{zz}}. If it can parse the timezone, we can use it instead of adding a new metric., I'm thinking moment-timezone.js can parse the format by using {{user.timezone}} property via JMX, however, it needs a lot of work. I prefer adding a new metric rather than parsing the date. Please correct me if I am wrong.

By the way, v3 patch needs documentation for the new metric., Thanks [~ajisakaa] for comments.. 
I didn't see any document for {{NNStarted}}, so I didn't added for new metric.
http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Metrics.html, bq. I didn't see any document for NNStarted, so I didn't added for new metric.
I'm thinking {{NNStarted}} should be documented as well. Would you document both {{NNStarted}} and the new metric?, yes, I will do this and update the patch here soon.., Thanks [~ajisakaa] for review
Attached new patch , Please review..., Patch looks great.

I feel there are some other places in NameNode UI where this unification could be done.
ex: Datanode last contact time, file last modification time, datanode volume failure time, etc.

I feel, if we are unifying, then unify everywhere.
agree?, Thanks [~vinayrpet] for review

bq. I feel, if we are unifying, then unify everywhere. agree?
yes 

I will update the patch., Attached updated patch, Please review..., \\

Here, {{Number(v)}}, there is no {{v}}. You need to replace with {{value}}.

2. Need to fix 2 checkstyles out of 3 shown
3. You can clean lines with whitespace endings, though this can be done during commit.


In addition to the above changes, just remove duplicate line in {{dfshealth.html}}. Its not from this issue, but i think that also can go along with this patch.

Attached updated patch , Please review..

bq../hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/NameNodeMXBean.java:226:3: Redundant 'public' modifier.
bq../hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/NameNodeMXBean.java:228: First sentence should end with a period.

These two checkstyles is applicable for all the API available in {{NameNodeMXBean}} interface. Do we need to fix these ??, Thanks for the update [~surendrasingh].

bq. These two checkstyles is applicable for all the API available in NameNodeMXBean interface. Do we need to fix these ??
As for as this Jira is concerned, latest update is fine. Though you can raise a follow-up and address in that Jira. ex: HDFS-8620 fixed such issues for ClientProtocol

+1, Changes looks good to me. 
pending jenkins for one final report.

[~ajisakaa] and [~wheat9], do you you also want to take a look?

, I think if we're going down to the route of adding new JMX to make things cleaner, then it might make sense to change the compile string to return a timestamp as well.

And it would be nice to remove all these deprecated metrics in trunk., \\

Currently {{CompileInfo}} metric contain three values.
	1. Compile time.
	2. User
	3. Branch

Here we need to create three new metrics. It’s better to handle this in HADOOP-7088.
Is it ok ?, bq. It’s better to handle this in HADOOP-7088. Is it ok ?
I'm okay to do the followings in separate jiras.
* Deprecate {{NameNodeMXBean#getNNStarted}}
* Remove {{NameNodeMXBean#getNNStarted}} from trunk
* HADOOP-7088
* Deprecate {{NameNodeMXBean#getCompileInfo}}
