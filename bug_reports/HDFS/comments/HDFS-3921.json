[Got the same here with CDH4.1 (HDFS HA w/ JournalNode)
The command line give the same error on the active namenode log
  su - hdfs -c "hdfs fsck / -list-corruptfileblocks"
, I've taken a look into this. The trouble is that the NN is always processing its repl queues when it enters the active state even if it's still in startup safemode, i.e. not all DNs have reported in. This causes the web UI to prematurely indicate that blocks are missing, when in fact the NN should still just simply be waiting for more DNs to report in order to exit startup safemode., Here's a patch which addresses the issue by only processing repl queues when entering the active state if the NN has already left startup safemode. If it hasn't left startup safemode, then we should just enter the active state regardless. Repl queues will then be processed later when the NN does automatically leave startup safemode once sufficient DNs report., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

{code}

I'm not sure about this, but I think we may want to call {{processAllPendingDNMessages}} in both cases. Otherwise, we can end up with stuff in the pending/postponed queues even after we're in active mode, and they might never get processed, right?

Also, should we use {{safeMode.isPopulatingReplQueues()}} instead of {{isInStartupSafeMode}}? At the end of safe mode, it will have already started processing queues, in which case we still need to re-process, no?
, Thanks a lot for the review, Todd. I agree with both of your points. Here's an updated patch which addresses them.

I also tested this patch manually using an HA pseudo cluster and confirmed that it works as expected., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
