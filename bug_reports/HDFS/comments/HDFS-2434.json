[Hi, was this against trunk or branch-1?, Hi Harsh, thanks for looking this.
I remember i have seen this in trunk and also corrected some tests along with HDFS-1765. After that i don't see any failures in TestNAmeNodeMetrics. I am just closing this as con't reproduce ( again i ran 4 times this test for reconfirmation.)., Thanks for getting back Uma. We ran into a situation where the corrupt replica map (from where this metric derives itself, via size), ended up having bogus entries that weren't then being removed away by anything. I just happened to land on this one but is unrelated.

Thanks again :), I'm still seeing this sporadically on trunk. For example https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2841//testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.metrics/TestNameNodeMetrics/testCorruptBlock/
(and I don't think it's due to any changes in that patch), The test case fails this way when the corrupt replica is fixed right away before gathering namenode metrics. In one example, computeReplicationWorkForBlocks() was done within 10ms of the block corruption and the datanode did heartbeat in 380ms. The block corruption was resolved completely in 13ms after that.  

Since replication monitor and dn heartbeats are asynchronous, the current way of sleeping for 1 sec is not a reliable way to hit a moment between the two., Based on Kihwal's analysis, can we solve the problem on the CorruptBlocks metric by disabling the heartbeats of datanodes before marking the block as corrupt?, Made some further changes for the patch. In the testCorrupt testcase, because currently the delete operation will not remove the pending record in NN, it is possible that before the DN sends back a "block has been received" msg to NN, the block has been deleted due to the deletion request. In that case, it seems that the pending record cannot be removed until timeout. 

Thus the new patch first waits for the recovery to finish, and then do the deletion. , The 003 patch could not apply to trunk after the changes in HDFS-4059. Modify the patch to be consistent., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
