[The fix should be done in the {{FileSystemAccessService.java}} class in the {{getFileSystemConfiguration()}} method, the configuration should be seeded with {{conf.set(FsPermission.UMASK_LABEL, "000")}}
, If the REST call comes with permission, then surely use the one specified by the client. But if the call doesn't specify permission, then it'd seem more correct to use fs.permissions.umask-mode.

Basically, I don't think that the client is responsible for resolving the right permissions based on the client umask, because the "permission" param is optional in the REST API., Attached is a patch for the issue, plus unit tests.  Please review.

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good, a couple of nits:

* FileSystemAccessService.java: comment should read: // Force-clear server-side umask to make HttpFS match WebHDFS behavior
* TestHttpFSServer.java: don't use * imports.

+1 after they are fixed., +1 pending jenkins., Replaced patch with a new patch containing fixes as per code review.  Please re-review.  Thanks, -Mike, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
