This message is automatically generated., Both unit tests failures are unrelated and both tests work in my tree., Thanks [~rchiang] for the patch. Looks good to me.
By the way, I found another typo 'targests' in DataNode.java.
{code}
      if (DataTransferProtocol.LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
        DataTransferProtocol.LOG.debug(getClass().getSimpleName() + ": "
            + b + " (numBytes=" + b.getNumBytes() + ")"
            + ", stage=" + stage
            + ", clientname=" + clientname
            + ", targests=" + Arrays.asList(targets));
      }
