This wasn't caught with tests because the current version of surefire doesn't properly handle test timeouts. See HADOOP-8117.

I verified with this fix that the test no longer hangs waiting for user input., Oops... I forgot to hit "save" in eclipse before generating the patch, so the previous one didn't do anything :) Here's the correct patch., +1, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I was doing some manual testing of this before commit and realized I also missed updating the command line tool to pass the right flag. New rev fixes "-format" so it properly confirms before overwriting! I manually tested this by doing the full build and using the "hdfs namenode -format" CLI., +1, -1 overall.
