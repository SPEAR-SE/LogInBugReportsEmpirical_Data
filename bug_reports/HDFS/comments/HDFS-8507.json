[Discussed with [~ajisakaa] offline about this issue..Going to do like following...

initialize() is called before countUncheckpointedTxns() and
initialize() do the two things:

1) create connection to NN
2) launch Http Server

Therefore SNN starts. For countUncheckpointedTxns(),
2) is not needed. I'm thinking we can split initialize()
into two methods to avoid starting SNN as follows:

initialize() ... create connection to NN
startServer() ... launch Http Server

When -geteditsize is specified, only initialize() is called
and SNN does not start.]
