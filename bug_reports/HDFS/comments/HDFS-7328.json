, Thanks for fixing this, [~cnauroth].  In C and C++, {{"\n"}} is expanded into the platform-specific newline sequence.  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6891252/c-newline-character-under-windows-command-line-redirection .  It seems like Java chose to do things differently and as a consequence we probably have a lot of these cases., No problem, [~cmccabe].

bq. It seems like Java chose to do things differently and as a consequence we probably have a lot of these cases.

Don't you just love consistency?  :-)

There have been a lot of these cases throughout the past 2 years, but I think all of them have been cleaned up at this point.  If we had Windows Jenkins, then it would help catch introduction of new occurrences.  I hope to revisit this topic on the Apache infra side in the next several months.]
