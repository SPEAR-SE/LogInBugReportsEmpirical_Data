[availble method will the actual data that can be read 

since in my first call i used available() (gave me full length of file and pos in the stream is updated)

next when i called the available it will return 0 since the pos is incremented and no new data written.

since this is inline with java i feel this is not a problem, This issue is invalid., Dropping fix-version from 'non-fixed' (didn't have code-fixes) JIRAs.]
