[Resolving as not a problem.

The behavior is by design. HDFS does not calculate the total space that the directories have taken during {{ls}}., Then, can I suppose that  HDFS does not calculate the total space when
using hadoop fs -lsr, either ?

Best wishes.

, Hi Haohui,

Could I ask another question?

Is it for security purpose that HDFS is designed not to calculate the total
space of directories ?

Best wishes.
