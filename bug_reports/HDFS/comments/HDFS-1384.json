[This bug has been fixed in trunk because the client sends the excluded list to the namenode with the addBlock RPC. The NN ensures that it does not return a datanode from the excluded list.

This bug is still present in the 0.20-append branch, Dhruba,

I think I make a bad description of the bug.
The excludedList does the job.
But in this case, the excludedList contains only nodes from rack 0,
and when client retries, NN give it the first dn in the pipe which is
also in rack 0 too. Hence when client tries to create the pipe,
it contacts the first dn and fails (because of network partition).
So the problem here is that NN keeps giving client node that 
from the same rack (in this case, i.e rack 0). And because
client cannot see any node in rack 0, it retries 5 times and fail., in ur example, is the client also in rack 0?, Closing as stale.]
