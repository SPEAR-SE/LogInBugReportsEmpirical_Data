after recent changes {{checkDiskError()}}  will trigger one periodic thread which will check for disk error asynchronously. But this issue requires synchronous check for errors before initializing block pools.
Accordingly, checking for errors synchronously before initializing block pools to exclude failed disks to avoid startup failures.
