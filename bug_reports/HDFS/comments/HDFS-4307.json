[bq. {{+  private static long getMonotonicMillis() {}}

Seems like this could use org/apache/hadoop/util/Time.java:monotonicNow rather than rolling a local copy.

bq. {{+    return System.nanoTime() / 1000;}}

Alas, there are 1e6 nanoseconds per millisecond.  (So just use the library routine which gets it right.), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

LGTM! +1.

Since the patch has no observable effects short of changing the system clock, the lack of tests included is justified., yeah, sadly changing the system clock is not something a junit test can realistically do :), +1, the latest patch looks good to me. I agree that writing a test for this isn't warranted in this case.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
