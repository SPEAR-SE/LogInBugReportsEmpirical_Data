[Add the omitted information to dfsAdmin's help messages., The current docs:

{code}
Updates the set of hosts allowed to connect to namenode. Re-reads the config file to update values defined by dfs.hosts and dfs.host.exclude and reads the entires (hostnames) in those files. Each entry not defined in dfs.hosts but in dfs.hosts.exclude is decommissioned. Each entry defined in dfs.hosts and also in dfs.host.exclude is stopped from decommissioning if it has aleady been marked for decommission. Entires not present in both the lists are decommissioned.
{code}

Covers it pretty much I think? Please reopen if not.]
