, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-744, thanks very much , In hadoop 1.1.2  I can not find this hsync()  method , maybe this implement  may not  sync to  this 1.1.2   or    when   1.1.2 realsed ,this bug  has not  been fixed .   Maybe  this implement  will   sync to  hadoop 2.0.2 ++ .  

 Thanks  I  will  look   your link in details   ,if   there is any  question  I will  ask  for  your  help  .Many  thanks. !!,

, These  days  I'm  doing a reserach on Spark and  shark  and   compared    with  mapreduce.   I  find  spark/shark   have some advantages   over  mapreduce/Hive   for  spark's  im-menory computing . As  Hegel  says : What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational.     I  think  just now  spark  can not  completely replace  mapreduce Frame ,  mapreduce  has its addvantage.
 But  now I can not  find  an  advantage   that   mapreduce   has  over  spark.  Expect  for  that  spark  is a  new  system and is not  mature   than mapreduce ,  does  the mapreduce's   fault  tolerance  is  better than RDD's lineage?      So ,can you   analysis it   ?   thanks.
