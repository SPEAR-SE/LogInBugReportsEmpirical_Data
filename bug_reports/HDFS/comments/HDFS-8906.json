[Hadoop 0.20.2 had no (real) security features in it.  This is the least of its problems:  setting hadoop.job.ugi would allow anyone to connect as anyone else.

This and other issues have since been fixed in subsequent versions of Hadoop.  

Given that 0.20.2 is over 5 years old at this point and unless there is something else, I'll be closing this as won't fix., Hi [~JJHoward],

Thanks for reporting the issue, I'm closing it as 'Won't fix" per [~aw]'s comments. Please raise if you have any concern. Thanks.
