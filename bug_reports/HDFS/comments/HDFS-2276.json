[ I'd like to do the following:
- add 3 empty interfaces to the "common" project:
-- SmallTest -- for true "unit" tests that don't hit disk or network and don't sleep
-- MediumTest -- for functional tests that check a subsystem and might use local disk or loopback sockets, but should still run in under a few seconds. For example, HDFS tests that start a NN but no DNs.
-- LargeTest -- for system-wide functional tests - for example things like TestHDFSCLI that take several minutes but cover a large swath of the system.

These would be used with the JUnit 4.8 @Category annotation, eg @Category(LargeTest.class).

These are modeled after the categories in this excellent article: http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2009/07/software-testing-categorization.html

- mark the existing tests in src/test/unit as @Category(SmallTest.class), and move them into src/test/java.

We can use these annotations to have different test targets for the different size tests using the functionality in http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SUREFIRE-329 once that's released, +1, We can also use the timeout rule introduced in HADOOP-6987 for small or medium tests that violate their runtime contract.  this was introduced but fell off the radar for being added to tests., Here's a patch to add the interfaces and categorizations., looks fixed. closing.]
