[Here's a patch which addresses the issue. In GetImageServlet#isValidRequestor, we now check to see if HA is configured for this nameservice and add the principal of the other NN as a valid requestor if HA is configured.

In addition to the test provided, I also tested this manually with a pair of secure, HA-enabled NNs., +1 pending jenkins, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12523385/HDFS-3305.patch
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 1 new or modified test files.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    +1 eclipse:eclipse.  The patch built with eclipse:eclipse.

    +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    +1 release audit.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests:
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestDatanodeBlockScanner

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

Test results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2304//testReport/
Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2304//console

This message is automatically generated., I'm confident that the test failure is unrelated. That test doesn't touch this code path, and I just ran TestDatanodeBlockScanner locally on my box and confirmed that it passed just fine.

Thanks a lot for the review, Todd. I'll commit this momentarily., Fixing typo in issue summary., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2112 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2112/])
