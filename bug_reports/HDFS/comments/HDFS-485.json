[Closing as invalid because error is not due to HDFS.
The fetch is over HTTP, so it has nothing to do with HDFS . and this could be  anything from network congestion to a bad disk. The issue is invalid, since the framework- failing to obtain the map output- reexecuted the map and completed the job successfully. 
If you have any issues with Map Reduce please write email to mapreduce-user at hadoop.apache.org
