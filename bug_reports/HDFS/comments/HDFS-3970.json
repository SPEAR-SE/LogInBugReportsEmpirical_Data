This message is automatically generated., Hi Todd, Please can you look into this patch. Thanks, Hey Vinay. Sorry I missed the earlier upload.

Any chance you can add a test for this? I seem to remember it causing an easily-reproducible bug where, after rollback, the DN wouldn't properly start due to the missing storageType field. Am I remembering wrong? If that's the case, it should be easy to add a test., I added a test to Vinay's patch which attempts to rollback a block pool. Tested by running the test before and after the fix to confirm., thanks for the test, Andrew. +1 pending Jenkins, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
