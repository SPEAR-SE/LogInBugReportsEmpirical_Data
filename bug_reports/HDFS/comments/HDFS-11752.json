[I think this is intentional. My understanding is that nonDFSUsed is supposed to be the amount of HDFS space that is consumed by non HDFS entities. Since the Reserved space is not available to HDFS, nonDFSUsed shouldn't include any usage covered by the reservation. 

Are you seeing issues in 2.7 or 3.0 because there have been fixes in 2.8 and 3.0 which change some of the calculations in this area? 2.7 definitely had problems where it was not correctly calculating the amount of remaining space. The 2.8 calculations seem correct (I didn't try 3.0 but as long as nothing regressed it should be ok as well). , [~nroberts] Thank you, i have known the NonDFS mean.]
