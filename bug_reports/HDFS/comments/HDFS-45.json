[If there is a protocol mismatch between client and server, then dfs will bail out. In your case, it is possible that the protcol versionnumber was not bumped up when the new feature was introduced., I think even the build version should be checked if bumping the protocol version for every related issue is not feasible., This is no longer necessary with protobuf rpc.]
