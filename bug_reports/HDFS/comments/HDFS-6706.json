[With further investigation, we found this is due to a misconfiguration. Closing as invalid., HI [~brandonli], 

Thanks for reporting and addressing the issue.  I have some questions here.  The original report seems to indicate that the reported error message doesn't indicate the real reason of failure. My questions are,
1. In the case reported initially, the real problem was said to be "The zkfc cannot be startup due to ha.zookeeper.quorum is not met". With your last update, can we say the real problem is a misconfiguration?
2. What kind of misconfiguration caused the symptom?
3. When misconfigured, user will still see the reported error message. Should we have the error message to tell that the symptom is caused by the possible misconfiguration?

Thanks.

, [~yzhangal], I should have added more explanation. 
In the case, the 3 zookeeper was not correctly configured as an ensemble. Basically none of them was in an ensemble. However, all of them were configured in core-site.xml in "ha.zookeeper.quorum". 
When zkfs is started, it talked to a different zk server which is not the previously formatted one., HI [~brandonli], thanks for the explanation!
