[I think this issue is not a "blocker"., This is a very old defect. Has anyone seen it for a while?

The webapp location, {{getWebappsPath()}} is now in {{org.apache.hadoop.http.HttpServer}}. I would suspect the problem might be in how Jetty's {{org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext.setWar())}} takes either a file path or a URL; if it gets confused I could see this problem happening. 
, This does not seem to happen with recent releases over Windows.]
