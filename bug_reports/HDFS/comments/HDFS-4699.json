[This patch addresses multiple problems that were contributing to the intermittent failures:

# When {{BlockReceiver}} gets an {{IOException}}, it tries to assess if the error was related to disk or network, and if disk-related, calls {{DiskChecker}}.  This test triggers rapid NN failovers, so it's common to see a mix of different kinds of network errors.  The logic for detecting a network error was incomplete and miscategorizing some network failures as disk related, and triggering a huge flurry of {{DiskChecker}} activity.  Particularly on Windows, rapid calls to this can be sluggish, because it needs to fork a new process.  I've added logic to filter out TCP RST and anything related to a {{java.nio.channels.SocketChannel}}.
# The test triggers rapid NN failovers.  The client retry handling uses an exponential backoff with a maximum delay of 15s between failover attempts.  Particularly on small VMs, I saw multiple failover attempts quickly rising to a 15s delay and sometimes causing the whole test to timeout.  I've made a change to set configuration to cap the failover delay to 1s.
# There is a polling loop that tries to wait up to 30s for lease recovery.  Even with the prior changes, I've observed that 30s isn't sufficient on a small VM.  After I increased this to 60s, I saw consistent successful test runs.

I've verified the test on both Mac and Windows.

The test failure is unrelated to this patch.  The test is known to be flaky.  See HDFS-3538.
, I noticed that HDFS-4581 also put the network error filtering logic into branch-1 and branch-0.23, so I've added patches for those branches too.  I uploaded the trunk patch again, just so that Jenkins sees it as the newest file., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Yes, it's definitely brittle.  Longer-term, perhaps there is a way to refactor such that at any point in our code, we know whether the I/O error came from disk or network?  I tried investigating this briefly, but it certainly would be a much bigger and riskier change.

, I merged this patch to branch-1.2 to be picked up for 1.2.1., Changed the fixVersion from 1.3.0 to 1.2.1 per Suresh's merge.
Also made TargetVersion list consistent with fixVersion list.]
