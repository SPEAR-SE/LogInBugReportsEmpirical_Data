[Hi Thomas, could you provide more information about the version of Hadoop you are using and the RPC timeout settings? This might be related to HADOOP-12672 for instance., [~andrew.wang] Hadoop version is 2.6.0 from CDH5.8.5. We have also been able to reproduce this on a CDH5.10 environment. In our reproduction the ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms was default 0 but no exception or timeout message was seen. I observed this hanging for 15mins+ and, as soon as the SBNN is resumed the client continued and switched to the Active NN (as observed by: "Operation category READ is not supported in state standby. Visit https://s.apache.org/sbnn-error ")., Sounds like the IPC issue that [~yzhangal] had studied before?

IIRC, something similar to HADOOP-12672., Hi Guys,

Yes, it should be HADOOP-12672, As far as I know, cdh5.8.5 is not released yet.

Thanks.
, [~yzhangal] from HADOOP-12672 it seems the symptom is an exception thrown by the client? I see no exception, in fact the client continues successfully as soon as the SBNN is unpaused. I have reproduced on CDH5.8.2 as well., Hi [~thomaskwscott],

The client will not time out when the rpc time out is set, before HADOOP-12672. While this jira fix the other issue reported there, it fixed this issue here as a side effect.

Thanks.
