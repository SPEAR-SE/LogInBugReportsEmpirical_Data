[Also meet this problem in 3.0. In the code of trunk, the sleep timeÂ seems to have been changed to 1s, but the balancer is still too quick to get a ps result. The related code is inÂ {{haddop-functions.sh#hadoop_start_daemon_wrapper}}.
{code:java}
sleep 1

# capture the ulimit output
ulimit -a >> "${outfile}" 2>&1

# shellcheck disable=SC2086
if ! ps -p $! >/dev/null 2>&1; then
return 1
fi
return 0
