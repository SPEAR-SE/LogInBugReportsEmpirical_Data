[Is this actually a problem in practice?, Well, if any file/dir has the name ending with "._COPYING_". This bug will cause data loss., So no., Hi [~aw], what does the "so no" mean? I am a little bit confused.

Do you mean:
1. It is impossible for people to name file/dir end with "._COPYING_";
2. no one will hit this problem in production;
3. or others

Thank you for the explanation.


, It could do a check before the operation begins and fail...this is relatively straightforward, Thank you for the suggestion, [~stevel@apache.org], WIP patch is attached. I will add unit test to TestCopy.java. , In TestCopy, other 5 unit tests assume file._COPYING_ exists before copying starts, it is not right. Remove this "when" condition and corresponding "verify" delete check. I think these 5 unit tests want to verify the transaction operation of copying by verifying the deletion of intermediate file: file._COPYING_., \\

This message was automatically generated., The  overall patch looks good, just a bit of the details to wrap up
# the exception should be `FileAlreadyExistsException`
# The exception text should be a constant for a String.format() operation defined as a public constant
# the test should explicitly catch the  `FileAlreadyExistsException` and use the same String format constant to generate the test pattern
# if there isn't a match, rethrow the exception, rather than raise a new assertion

see: [https://github.com/steveloughran/formality/blob/master/styleguide/styleguide.md#testing-with-exceptions], BTW, I think we should consider having an option for the fs copy which just says "don't do a copy"., Thank you for reviewing my patch, [~stevel@apache.org]. Patch updated.  I like the "don't do a copy" suggestion. Would you mind we create a new JIRA to track it?, # yes, create a new JIRA. Something like a {{-direct}} flag would seem a good, simple way.
# regarding the new patch, I'd still like to see the error text in a constant, e.g

{code}
String FILE_EXISTS_MESSAGE = "Upload failed: there is a file/directory " 
  +"called "%s._COPYING_ in the destination " 
  +"FileSystem. ;
{code}

The exception would become
{code}
 throw new FileAlreadyExistsException(String.format(FILE_EXISTS_MESSAGE, target))
{code}

and the test chec
{code}
String check = String.format(FILE_EXISTS_MESSAGE, target)
{code}

Otherwise, patch looks good

This message was automatically generated., [~airbots], , Thanks for the patch.

The patch looks good to me , but i feel the current behavior would be broken.

*Before patch :* FileAlreadyExistsException will be thrown , only if "Directory" with the "File1._COPYING_" exist. But not for a file with the same name.
*After patch    :* Exception will be thrown , for both file and directory.

*This is a kind of behavior change for end-users.*

*For example:*
Say while user is writing a 10GB file ( "File1" ) and if the write operation is interrupted and if "File1._COPYING_" file is retained in Filesystem,
then user might re-try to write the same "File1".
Write will success , as we overwrite the "File1._COPYING_"

*But after patch:*
	      User re-try to write "File1" will fail with exception that the "File1._COPYING_" already exist. 

[~stevel@apache.org], can you provide your feedback on this / correct me if iam wrong., Hi [~andreina], thank you for the comments. IMHO, if there is exception during uploading ._copying_ file, HDFS will remove failed leftover file., bq.if there is exception during uploading .copying file, HDFS will remove failed leftover file.

{noformat}
I agree with you [~airbots] , incase of any exception while writing  "File1" , then temporary "File1._COPYING_" file will be deleted.
But in case of JVM crash temporary file:  "File1._COPYING_"  will be retained in the Filesystem.
{noformat}, That is true if JVM crashes. [~andreina]. 

There are 2 cases that file ends with "._COPYING_":
1. it is called "file._COPYING_" in the beginning;
2. it is leftover file because of failure(s)

How about we change the warning message and add something like:"please remove 'file1._COPYING_' first". , I am just worried that, it would break existing behavior of overwriting those temp files,  [~airbots]. If everyone agrees, then I am okay for this changes, provided Jira is marked as incompatible change., \\
