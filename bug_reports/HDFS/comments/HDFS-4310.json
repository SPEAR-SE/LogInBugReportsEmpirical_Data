[Hey Ivan, let's just have the test throw the exception without catching/printing first. An exception which is thrown by a test method will get printed to the log anyway, so there's no need to duplicate that behavior., Hi, Aaron,
yes , but the problem is that we should shutdown the minicluster in the finally block. And if another exception is thrown from here, we may lose the original exception thrown from the try { ... } block. So, such construction is somewhat more reliable., OK, fine by me., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
