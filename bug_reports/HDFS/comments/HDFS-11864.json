[Attach the initial patch. The metrics description based on the infos that given in HDFS-7129. Thanks for the review.
[~brahmareddy], the trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.8 are also missing these metrics in documenation, and should be updated, right? We would be better not only fixed this in branch-2.7., bq.Brahma Reddy Battula, the trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.8 are also missing these metrics in documenation, and should be updated, right?

, Thanks [~brahmareddy] for the review and commit. Why not merge this into branch-2.8 and add 2.8.2 into fix version? The versions 2.8.x will be fixed this issue after merging into branch-2.8.

Moving fix-version to 2.8.2 after the fact., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #14057 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/14057/])
