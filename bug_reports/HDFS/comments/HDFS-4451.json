This message is automatically generated., Thanks, Joshua.  I applied the patch to trunk and ran these test suites successfully: TestBalancer, TestBalancerWithEncryptedTransfer, TestBalancerWithHANameNodes, TestBalancerWithMultipleNameNodes, TestBalancerWithNodeGroup, TestBalancerBandwidth.  Here are a few comments.

1. It appears that it is not possible for the tool to exit with IN_PROGRESS.  We have this code in the static {{Balancer#run}} method:

{code}
boolean done = false;
for(int iteration = 0; !done; iteration++) {
  done = true;
  Collections.shuffle(connectors);
  for(NameNodeConnector nnc : connectors) {
    final Balancer b = new Balancer(nnc, p, conf);
    final ReturnStatus r = b.run(iteration, formatter, conf);
    // clean all lists
    b.resetData(conf);
    if (r == ReturnStatus.IN_PROGRESS) {
      done = false;
    } else if (r != ReturnStatus.SUCCESS) {
      //must be an error statue, return.
      return r.code;
    }
  }

  if (!done) {
    Thread.sleep(sleeptime);
  }
}
{code}

This loop will not terminate while return status is IN_PROGRESS, so I expect we would never exit the CLI with IN_PROGRESS.  If that's the case, then we wouldn't need to map IN_PROGRESS to a successful exit, and {{toExitCode}} could simplify to something like code == 1 ? 0 : 1.

2. Actually, I wonder if the simpler change is just to swap the codes in the enum, so that it's SUCCESS(0) and IN_PROGRESS(1).  Then, we wouldn't need {{toExitCode}}.  If callers never really see the IN_PROGRESS exit code (for the reasons stated above) and if we're already declaring this change backwards-incompatible, then this would be simpler.

3. Do you want to add a test that calls {{twoNodeTest(conf, true)}}?  I see that the {{useTool}} flag has been introduced in the method signature, but I didn't find any tests that set the flag to true.

{code}
-  private void twoNodeTest(Configuration conf) throws Exception {
+  private void twoNodeTest(Configuration conf, boolean useTool) throws Exception {
{code}
, Happy to change the patch to follow either suggestion 1 or 2.   

On 3, happy to do that as well.   I just felt that the one node test was sufficient to test the exit code, the two node test is exercised elsewhere, so running the two node test a second time to check the exit code would mostly just increase test run time.

Anyhoo, nothing worth arguing about.   I'll attach a new patch that follows the suggestions from 2 and 3 shortly., Change SUCCESS int value to 0
Execute two node test in testExitZeroOnSuccess test case., +1

Thanks, Joshua!

{quote}

If that extra test doesn't add anything, then the other option would be to remove the {{useTool}} flag from the {{twoNodeTest}} method signature, just so the unused flag doesn't cause any confusion.

To whichever committer picks this up: would you please review my thinking in the earlier comments about swapping the enum values?  I believe this is a safe (but backwards-incompatible) change, but I would appreciate it if you'd double-check.  Thanks!

bq. If that extra test doesn't add anything, then the other option would be to remove the useTool flag from the twoNodeTest method signature, just so the unused flag doesn't cause any confusion.
Lets remove useTool from twoNodeTest and just use one node test to test the exit code.

One minor optional thing, you have lot of empty lines in the code. It could be more compact:
{code}
 private void runBalancerCli(Configuration conf,
     long totalUsedSpace, long totalCapacity) throws Exception {
   waitForHeartBeat(totalUsedSpace, totalCapacity, client, cluster);

   final String[] args = { "-policy", "datanode" };
   final Tool tool = new Cli();    
   tool.setConf(conf);
   final int r = tool.run(args); // start rebalancing
   
   assertEquals("Tools should exit 0 on success", 0, r);
   waitForHeartBeat(totalUsedSpace, totalCapacity, client, cluster);
   LOG.info("Rebalancing with default ctor.");
   waitForBalancer(totalUsedSpace, totalCapacity, client, cluster);
 }

  * Verify balancer CLI exit code on success is 0
  */
 @Test(timeout=100000)
 public void testExitZeroOnSuccess() throws Exception {
   final Configuration conf = new HdfsConfiguration();   
   initConf(new HdfsConfiguration());  
   oneNodeTest(conf, true);
 }

{code}
, +1 again for the new patch

I reran all of the balancer tests that I mentioned above, and they all passed.

Thanks again for the contribution, Joshua!
, +1 for the change., I committed the patch to trunk and branch-2.
