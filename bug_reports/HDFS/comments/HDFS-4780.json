From the callers perspective there is no change in the functional outcome. Existing tests cover the paths, +1 the patch looks good. , I've committed this to trunk and branch-2., Thanks for working on the patch, Rob.
, The change to the callers to invoke the "check" version seems ok.

It looks like the more appropriate UGI change may be to modify by {{reloginFromKeytab}} to switch the order of {{hasSufficientTimeElapsed}} (which generates the warning) and {{getRefreshTime}} which shorts out the renew attempt.

On a related note, the two relogin methods appear equivalent aside from the {{hasSufficientTimeElapsed}} check.  It would seem that only {{checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab}} should be checking {{getRefreshTime}}.  {{reloginFromKeytab}} should be probably be unconditionally re-acquiring a TGT, hence not checking {{hasSufficientTimeElapsed}}., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3794 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3794/])
