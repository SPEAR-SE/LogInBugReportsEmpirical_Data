This message is automatically generated., (the "failure to apply patch" thing is related to the earlier patch I posted and then took down), - StreamLImiter either needs to be package-private or marked with a private interface annotation
- we don't generally mark interface methods as "abstract". In fact I didn't know that was legal java
- can you refactor out the code that checks curPos+len against the limit into a {{checkLimit(int bytesToRead);}} call?
- would be good to add a simple unit test of this functionality - eg construct a FSEditLogOp.Reader and give it a header which would cause it to try to read more than MAX_OP_SIZE, verify it throws the expected exception., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
