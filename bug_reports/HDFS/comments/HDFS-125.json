[Is this risk still present? 

I could imagine two ways of checking

* checksum validator fetches the checksum from another DN instead of the one whose block is being read.
* something gets the checksums from all DNs with the data, and looks for inconsistencies. 

Multiple blocks with different declared checksums is going to be a manual intervention kind of problem. Still, it is better to know when its arisen, This feels like a special case of the problems mentioned in HDFS-366 and friends.]
