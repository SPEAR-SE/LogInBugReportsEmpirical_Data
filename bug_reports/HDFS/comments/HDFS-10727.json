This indicates that the datanode closed the connection.  Inspecting datanode logs might reveal more information. E.g. if the xceiver count limit was exceeded, the connection will be shut down. Or it could be due to a saturation. See if there was a saturation of bandwidth in the network or disk I/O. In any case, examining datanode logs will be helpful., Thanks [~kihwal] , Will check the datanode logs to confirm.]
