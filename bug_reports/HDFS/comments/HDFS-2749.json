[Good find! I think this is probably the cause of HDFS-1029 which I saw in 2010. Do you have a unit test and/or patch for the problem?, Todd, another bug https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2748 is related with this one. They together will cause the OOM of NN., It also needs the calculating 'nsCount' at another branch with loading EditLog file.
Make the calculating as common step when the condition is true(latestNameCheckpointTime > latestEditsCheckpointTime), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
