[Looking at the source, on branch-1, line 437 is constructing a new path, which could throw this exception if {{relativepath==""}}
{code}
      for (String commonPrefix : listing.getCommonPrefixes()) {
        Path subpath = keyToPath(commonPrefix);
        String relativePath = pathUri.relativize(subpath.toUri()).getPath();
        status.add(newDirectory(new Path(absolutePath, relativePath)));            //HERE
      }
{code}, Costin -how many entries are there in the bucket? a few? A few thousand? It may be something that gets triggered at scale, I'm pretty sure it's a {{Path}} bug.  Things like cwd, and I think basename of the root dir, will return an empty string. If you try to construct another path based on those paths, it will encounter this type of exception., should that Path(base,new) ctor just downgrade to returning Path(base), or should the S3 impl (and similar) insert a / before building the path. Option #2 is less traumatic]
