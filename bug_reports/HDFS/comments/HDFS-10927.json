[Hi [~ngoswami] thanks for reporting this issue and attach the relevant logs.

We have seen the same error message a few times in the past:

java.io.IOException: THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN: getBytesOnDisk() < getVisibleLength(), 
{quote}

In one such incidence, the DataNode had a long GC pause, lasting more than 1 minute. I have a theory why this inconsistency happens and I am working on a unit test to reproduce it. Could you confirm if the DataNode in your cluster also suffered from a long GC?, Hey guys, I just found an issue like this.
HBase RegionServer got an DiskFull exception while writing WAL files, and client failed after several times retry. When Master trying to use recoverLease to recover these file, we got almost same logs as [~ngoswami] attached

java.io.IOException: File length mismatched.  The length of /home/work/ssd11/hdfs/xxxx/datanode/current/BP-228094273-10.136.5.10-1486630815208/current/rbw/blk_1073970099 is 174432256 but r=ReplicaBeingWritten, blk_1073970099_229357, RBW
  getNumBytes()     = 174437376
  getBytesOnDisk()  = 174429752
  getVisibleLength()= 174429752
  getVolume()       = /home/work/ssd11/hdfs/xxxxx/datanode/current
  getBlockFile()    = /home/work/ssd11/hdfs/xxxxx/datanode/current/BP-228094273-10.136.5.10-1486630815208/current/rbw/blk_1073970099
  bytesAcked=174429752
  bytesOnDisk=174429752

In my case, it's caused by the exception while out.write() in receivePacket() of BlockReceiver. 
receivePacket() first update numbytes in replicaInfo, then write data to disk, and update bytesOnDisk at last, the DiskFull exception makes the length not consistent.
