[FSSTAT handler uses superUserClient to get HDFS file system stats. The superUser here is the user started NFS gateway and in this case it's "UserA". The superUser hasn't logged in with Kerberos keytab when the superUserClient is created. 

The superUserClient was introduced early when HDFS requires superUser privilege to invoke getStats(). And we assumed HDFS and NFS were started by the same user. This assumption is not needed anymore since NFS uses proxy user to communicate with HDFS now.

We can simply remove it since getStats() doesn't need superUser privilege anymore. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
