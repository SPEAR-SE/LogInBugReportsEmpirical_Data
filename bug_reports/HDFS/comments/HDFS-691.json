There are two problems associated with this issue:

# If the available bytes is >= 2GB, we will lose the higher bits of the value since the value is casted from long to int.
# We may need a new API to get the available bytes as a long.  This API is useful with hflush().

I will fix the first problem in this issue., h691_20091028.patch: check limit before return.
