[We saw a scenario where datanode is unresponsive and the client silently exits with following log:

Instead these exceptions should be thrown out so that the read fails and users can retry later, Hi Amareshwari,
 
 Looks like this issue is similar to HDFS-3701 right?
 Could you check whether the fix of HDFS-3701 can solve your issue?
 Additionally It solves some other bugs in that area as well.

Thanks,
Uma, Thanks Uma for quick response. I had brief look at the patch on HDFS-3701, seems to solve this as well. , Ok, thanks for confirmation, I just marked ir as dupe with HDFS-3701.]
