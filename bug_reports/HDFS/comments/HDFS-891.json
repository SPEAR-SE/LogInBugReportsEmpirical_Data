[The lines in question went in as part of the big HADOOP-1985 topology patch, been in since 0.17., I think we can do away with this check. It is a wrong prop name today, and even if it does exist in the configuration, its not an issue if we already ignore it.

looks good to me -just deletes no longer needed lines, Agree. +1 patch looks good, Re-uploading the patch to kick jenkins. I think the previous findbugs/audit warning has to do with us removing a System.exit that is referenced in a findbugs excludes file, want to see what the actual warnings are to be sure. Will hold of committing since we may need to update the findbugs file as well., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., New jenkins run is clean. No new test is necessary since this just removes the old check.  I've committed this and merged to branch-2.
