[HDP default configuration had calculated non-HDFS reserved storage "dfs.du.datanode.reserved" (approx 3.5 %) on total disk for the lowest storage configured for a datanode (among the compute config groups) whichÂ had three drives and one drive was in TBs. Our default configuration to store data on datanode "dfs.datanode.data.dir" was pointing to a drive with lowest capacity (around 3 % of overall DN storage). This 3 % < 3.5 % had made HDFS capacity as 0% and our existing datanode storage had some supporting directories and files in KBs which had resulted in marking negative KB capacity of the datanode. To fix the downscaling issue, either, we need to lower down non hdfs reserved capacity (lower than 3 %) or point our datanode to higher disk capacity (greater than 3.5 %).]
