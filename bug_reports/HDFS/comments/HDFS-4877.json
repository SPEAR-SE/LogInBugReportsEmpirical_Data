[The main idea to fix is based on the observation that the nodes in the circle do not co-exist in the same snapshot. For example, if we took snapshot s1 on root before the rename operations, foo and bar's WithName nodes are included in s1, while the new foo2's DstReference node is not included in s1. Therefore we can break the circle while snapshot deletion if we only clean those nodes that are included in the snapshot. , Initial patch for review. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
