[The same problem in MapReduce. Created MAPREDUCE-669., The builder was originally introduced as Hadoop (Core) needed to generate Record IO classes for the unit tests to compile, and by using a builder you can get Eclipse to call the relevant ant target (generate-test-records) on various Eclipse actions (like rebuild project). With the split this was only necessary for Hadoop Common, so I didn't create a builder for the HDFS or MapReduce projects. I wanted to keep the files generated for Eclipse to a minimum, since folks have had problems getting Eclipse compiling Hadoop in the past.

However, if the "eclipse-files" target is not working for you then clearly we need to fix it., We stepped on all of our ants. Closing.]
