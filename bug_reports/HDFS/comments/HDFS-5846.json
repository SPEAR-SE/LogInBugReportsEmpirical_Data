[I'm attaching patch. I have changed {{resolveNetworkLocation}} method to throw exception and added a new method {{resolveNetworkLocationWithFallBackToDefaultLocation} for calls that want to keep default location in a case of DNS to switch mapping failure.
I'm adding a configuration property named: {{dfs.namenode.reject-unresolved-dn-topology-mapping}} (default value: {{false}}). {{registerDatanode}} method uses this config property in order to decide whether to call {{resolveNetworkLocation}} or {{resolveNetworkLocationWithFallBackToDefaultLocation}} method., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Hi, [~nikola.vujic].  This patch mostly looks good.  Just a few minor comments:
# There are a few small code formatting issues.  The Hadoop codebase wraps lines at 80 characters, and I saw some lines longer than that.  The standard for indentation is 2 spaces.  I think I saw tab characters, which we don't use, so please convert those to 2 spaces.
# I think the description in hdfs-default.xml needs to be updated.  In trunk, the property is called {{net.topology.script.file.name}}.  (Note the "net." prefix.)  I wasn't sure about the mention of {{topology.dependency.script.file.name}}.
# Let's add a unit test that turns on the configuration property and validates that an unresolved host can't register.  You can look at the {{StaticMapping}} class and its usage inside {{MiniDFSCluster}} for some inspiration on how to write tests that cover DNS queries.
, Hi Chris,

I have fixed the patch according to your comments. Now I have two lines longer than 80 characters. That is because of long names for constants. Is this ok?

I have implemented a unit test (testRejectUnresolvedDatanodes) in the TestDatanodeManager class since it seems as a more appropriate place for testing this particular thing. Also, in the same class I have changed the logger (org.mortbay.log.Log was used and now patch is using org.apache.commons.logging.Log).
