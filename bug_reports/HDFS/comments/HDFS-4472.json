[It's rather annoying when FsShell prints unexpected output that can interfere with processing the output.  A simple fix may be to drop the log level from warn to debug, or better yet maybe FsShell should use a different log4j config that maybe only prints error/fatal., Agree we need a way to log this for servers and MR jobs and not clients.
