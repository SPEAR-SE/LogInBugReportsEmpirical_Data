[You need to build the whole of Hadoop first.

Also, it is better to build off of an svn checkout instead of a downloaded release. Follow http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/QwertyManiac/BuildingHadoopTrunk for getting started - see the branch-1 section., Building all contrib modules works for me, resolving ticket as 'Can't reproduce'., Forgot to add, right steps for you are:

$ ant compile
$ cd src/contrib/capacity-scheduler
$ ant compile

OR just,

$ ant compile-contrib]
