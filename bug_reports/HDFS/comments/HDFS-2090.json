PS: This is a github commit., Is there an official workaround for this? Only thing that worked for me was to clear the edits file in dfs.name.dir. I got this error after upgrading the cloudera release from cdh3u0 to cdh3u1., Luis: I think you're looking at the wrong bug. This is related to the BackupNode, which is a new feature in 0.21. CDH3 is based on 0.20 and does not include the BackupNode.

Regarding this issue, it is fixed by HDFS-1073. So, when 1073 is merged, we can close this as dup.]
