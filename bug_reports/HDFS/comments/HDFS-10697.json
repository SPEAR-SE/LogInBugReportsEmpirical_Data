[I think this could be a similar issue HDFS-10586 where (number of datanode failures <= parity number of datanodes). Could you tell me some more details:-
# file block locations of this file to see the blocks are placed in unique data nodes to ensure that the dead datanodes have only one block each.
# the length of the file.
# please analyse the client and datanode logs to understand the failure reason., it is network issue(not a bug), so this should be closed.]
