It seems the code above is not needed since they will be closed in the finally-block.  No?, 
Hi Nicholas,
 Thanks for reviewing the patch.
  Based on the discussions in 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2243 
I am preferring to use this approach.

 If stream closed successfully in try block itself then stream will be nullified, So IOUtils.closeStream(in); will not do any thing in finally block, because closeStream method will check for null.
 If stream closure failed because of some unexpected exception, then finally block will retry for stream closure. After this, flow will go to catch block.
  Just closing the streams in finally block by suppressing the stream closure exceptions will not be sufficient as stream closure is also part of the functionality. To avoid masking these exceptions, let it be closed in try block itself.
  If we close the stream in finally block with out suppressing the closure exceptions, it may mask the root exception.

 some more disscussions from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7194.
