This message was automatically generated., Testcase is not required (as the issue is to removed unused entities)
Please review the patch., IO_COMPRESSION_CODEC_LZO_BUFFERSIZE_KEY and IO_COMPRESSION_CODEC_LZO_BUFFERSIZE_DEFAULT are actually used. Otherwise looks good to me., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
