This message is automatically generated., one minor comments:
{code}
+        f = info.getBlockFile();
         v = (FsVolumeImpl)info.getVolume();
         if (f == null) {
-          LOG.warn("Failed to delete replica " + invalidBlks[i]
+          errors.add("Failed to delete replica " + invalidBlks[i]
               +  ": File not found, volume=" + v);
-          error = true;
           continue;
         }
{code}

move {code} v = (FsVolumeImpl)info.getVolume(); {code} after the 'if' block.

another,  it'd better also add to 'errors' as other exception messages if replica cannot be found.
, bq. another, it'd better also add to 'errors' as other exception messages if replica cannot be found.

Sorry, please ignore this line., bq. move v = .... after the 'if' block.
v is also used for constructing the error message in the 'if' block.

+1 the patch looks good., Thanks Fengdong and Kihwal for reviewing the patch.
