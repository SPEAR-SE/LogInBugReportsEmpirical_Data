This message is automatically generated., Hmmm - failure must be related - I need to investigate further., It runs cleanly locally and I don't see any way in which this patch would have affected this test.
Going back to my original assertion that it is unrelated.

Has this been a flaky test lately?, Okay - seems to be a known issue as being addressed in HDFS-6694.

This patch is fine., Hi [~devaraj] or [~sanjay.radia] can I bother one of you for a quick review and possible commit for this patch? It will need to go to branch-2 as well., +1. The patch looks good to me., I've committed the patch to branch-2.
