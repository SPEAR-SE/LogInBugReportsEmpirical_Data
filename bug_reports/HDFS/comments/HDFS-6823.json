Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/7565//console

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good to me. +1. The unit test failure is unrelated. It fails on an unpatched build as well. HDFS-4663 is open (although for an OOM, I don't think it makes sense to create another JIRA.)

Will commit shortly. Thanks Allen!, Committed! Thanks Allen!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6038 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6038/])
