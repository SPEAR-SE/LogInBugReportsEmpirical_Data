[Eugene, Any idea why these data nodes went down ? 
Any chance that somebody added them in hosts.exclude file ? Please verify this, if these nodes list is present in hosts.exclude then please remove them and restart cluster., I recently saw the same error, and confirmed that the host was not listed in hosts.exclude.  However, after running hadoop dfsadmin -refreshNodes the problem was solved, so apparently the node had been in the exclude file previously, and the exclude file had been edited without refreshing the nodes.  For anyone else here, make sure to try hadoop dfsadmin -refreshNodes, Resolving as Not a Problem.]
