[It seems the test has the following issues.

1. It asserts the size of BPServiceActor is 2 after BPOfferService started. One of the BPServiceActors could have shutdown due to initBlockPool failure by the time the assert is called.

2. It assumes the first BPServiceActor is healthy and uses that for blockReport verification. It is possible the second BPServiceActor is healthy.

The patch moves the size check before BPOfferService starts. In addition, as long as one of the BPServiceActors can send blockReport, the test is considered passed., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
