[Non-23 branches appear to have a rudimentary fix for this issue.  However it appears (haven't tested) that if a node registers in safe mode with 500 blocks, then bounces and re-registers with only 100 blocks because maybe a disk died, the NN will ignore that BR if it's still in safemode.  The NN may come out of safe mode w/o realizing it doesn't really have all the replicas it needs, and probably won't issue replications until the next full BR is sent which increases the possibility of data loss., bq. Non-23 branches appear to have a rudimentary fix for this issue.

Can you point out what exactly it is in branch-2 and trunk which appears to have fixed this?, Suresh pointed me at HDFS-2753, which erroneously attributes the issue to HA., I think the second issue I mentioned regarding a bounced DN's BR not being processed can be solved have updateRegInfo reset the flag that short-circuits safemode BR processing.  I originally tried something that tracked the timestamp of the registration but I think this is much simpler.  It'll be trivial to tweak the patch for the other branches.

Aaron, if this is a reasonable fix, would you please help write some unit tests?  I'm having difficulty figuring out how to introduce a mock, or how to manipulate a mini-cluster to force the sequence of events to reproduce (ie. sync out a few blocks, stop NN, finalize last block, bring NN up in safemode and trick it into staying in safemode, ensure block update is received followed by block report, ensure block manager knows of all blocks; stop dn, remove blocks, re-reg in safemode and ensure NN forgets the removed blocks).  Plus I'm at a conference and don't have many cycles., Any comments from anyone?  Or any bright ideas on how to write tests?  I'll manually test if that sufficient?, bq. Suresh pointed me at HDFS-2753, which erroneously attributes the issue to HA
To be fair, the context of that issue was HA. , Thinking about the problem a bit, what we need is a way to indicate if this is the first block report from datanode itself. So adding a counter starting with 0 (to indicate first block report) in block reports from datanode to namenode should help solve the problem. With this we can get rid of the DatanodeDescriptor#firstBlockReport and related code. This will also solve issues related to DN restart and NN may not process the block report.
, bq. This will also solve issues related to DN restart and NN may not process the block report.

True, but the boolean patch (simple incremental improvement on the existing trunk behavior) fixes both DN restart and reregistration after a broken connection.  The NN cannot distinguish the two.  So with a boolean, the NN (naively) processes the BR associated with every (re)registration.

A sequence number, that relies on a sentinel value, allows the DN to dictate the NN's behavior.  This works well for restart since we know we are starting from 0.  For a rereg, block updates may have been lost, so the sequence number must be guaranteed to always be reset to 0.  That's naive like the boolean, and might be hard or fragile to ensure it's always reset - in which case we might as well go with the boolean.

Better yet, the logic would be to {{(seqNum == 0 || seqNum != lastSeqNum)}}.  However this requires writable/RPC changes on 23, and protobuf changes on trunk/2 and trying to ensure backwards compatibility with an optional protobuf field, etc.  Would you be ok if I filed another jira?

Separate jira should be fine. We may want to mark this jira as 0.23 only. , The change does fix the DN restart issue for trunk/2.  Other than a few tweaks to enable testing, it's a 1-line change for trunk.  I'll post that patch, followed by an amended patch for 23., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., {{TestPersistBlocks}} failure is unrelated to this jira - I was very paranoid in debugging the failure.  The problem is caused by the new retry IPC retry policies introduced by HA.  I filed HDFS-4389., +1 I ended up reviewing the patch while debugging the above test failure with Daryn. :) , The patch looks good.

While we're in this area, do we need to reset any of the other fields in DatanodeDescriptor back to their defaults on re-reg? eg blockContentsStale, heartbeatedSinceFailover, needsKeyUpdate, etc? That is to say, I think this is a correct fix (and +1 to commit it), but wondering if you guys think we might have any other similar bugs that should be considered., I committed this to branch-2 and to trunk. I'll let you guys commit to branch-0.23 at your own pace - hope that's OK., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3247 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3247/])
