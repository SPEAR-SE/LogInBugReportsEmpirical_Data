[Attached the patch which fixes the issue in IE. 
I have verified the issue in IE-10 of my Windows 8 PC.

Hi [~wheat9], Can you take a look at this if possible...

Thanks in Advance., The root issue is that the UI should not attempt to make a cross-domain request for {{GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS}} at all. Therefore the fix should get rid of the cross-domain AJAX call instead of allowing it.

{code}, For me this worked well.

It should be {{$.get()}}. Tested on chrome and IE11. Works for me.

If {{$.get()}} fails, then the whole UI shoult not work at all. [~vinayrpet], can you please dig into the error on your side to see what have happened?, Oops! I was checking in eclipse test, and trying to update js file directly under classes. But it was corrupting the js file, So only JS error.
Now fine! {{$.get()}} works. Thanks [~wheat9]. 
I will commit this soon., committed HDFS-6630-000.patch to both trunk and branch-2.

Thanks [~andreina] for reporting the issue.
