[Small patch attached. This one is hard to unit test due to how our shell command testing works, we can't easily use a proxy user. I tested manually though as follows:

{code}
-> % hdfs cacheadmin -listPools                                  
Found 2 results.
NAME   OWNER   GROUP   MODE       WEIGHT 
pool1  andrew  andrew  rwx------  100    
pool2  andrew  andrew  rwxr-xr-x  100   

..become root...

-> # hdfs cacheadmin -listPools
Found 2 results.
NAME   OWNER   GROUP   MODE       WEIGHT 
pool1                                    
pool2  andrew  andrew  rwxr-xr-x  100
