Step 4: Restart NN2  with "rollingUpgrade started" option. ( Created fsimage_rollback_0000000000000000004, closed txn 5 and NN2 became Active. But not able to upload to NN1.)
Step 5: Restart NN1  with "rollingUpgrade started" option. ( NN1 became standby)


Issue :
=======
NN1 did checkpoint for one extra txn ( id: 5) and uploaded one more fsimage_rollback_0000000000000000005 to NN2
On rollback , NN2 deletes only fsimage_rollback_0000000000000000005 , leaving behind fsimage_rollback_0000000000000000004 without deleting.
