[1) listPaths is deprecated; consider listStatus
2) I'm having trouble reproducing this. Can you provide some code or more explicit instructions?, Since listPaths is deprecated, shall we mark this issue as "won't fix"?, listPaths() is currently implemented in terms of listStatus(), so, if this still happens, it may indicated a bug in listStatus().

Brian, can you provide a reproducible test case?, I haven't looked at this issue in a long time, since my focus has shifted onto HBase. No one else seems to have turned this up, so I question whether it existed in the first place. , This has gone stale, and looking at listStatus impls, looks like it could not happen.

Can't reproduce, closing out.]
