[Hi [~yzhangal] thanks for reporting this bug,
it looks like a race condition issue. I am assigning this JIRA to myself and am trying to reproduce the bug., Thanks much  for looking into [~jojochuang].
, Unfortunately I can not reproduce the exception.
Initially I though it's a race condition, so I inserted Thread.yield() and also tried to add Thread.sleep(), but still unable to reproduce it. I studied the code but can not find a possible execution path for this to happen., Resolve as cannot reproduce. The last time I see this bug was 2 years ago. Most likely it was a real bug and fixed later.]
