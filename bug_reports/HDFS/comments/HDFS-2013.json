[This could be related to HDFS-1954 change?, Yea that looks like me, sorry. Weird that the patch test passed though. I'll get this reverted., You are right. Hudson tests had indicated tests passed and hence I was not sure if this was caused by HDFS-1954!

Should we close this bug as invalid, given HDFS-1954 is being revered?, Not sure if there are other issues but see 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-1954?focusedCommentId=13045611&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13045611
for details on TestMissingBlocksAlert specifically (which was rolled back and a new patch created).
, I don't see it failing anymore. Please free to reopen if you see it is still a problem.]
