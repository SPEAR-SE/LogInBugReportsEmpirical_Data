[Please avoid cross-project patches and split the patches into sub-projects.  Or, you have to run all the checks and tests before committing.  I guess you don't want to be known for adding findbugs or other warnings to Hadoop. ;), bq. Please avoid cross-project patches and split the patches into sub-projects. Or, you have to run all the checks and tests before committing

There's not currently any easy way to run all the checks. And the problem with splitting into sub-projects is that, often, a patch in Common would actually break the build if it were committed before the associated patch in HDFS. I'd rather chance introducing a few warnings than break the build for everyone.

Regarding these particular patches, I originally put all of the code for HA in HDFS, but others argued we should try to build a generic framework (despite the fact that HDFS is the only implementer of all of these new Common pieces). So now we're left in this situation where any non-trivial changes to failover have to go cross-project.

bq.  I guess you don't want to be known for adding findbugs or other warnings to Hadoop. 

Somehow I don't think that's what I'm known for... out of the 20+ things I've committed in the last month, a mistake rate of 5% doesn't seem so bad.

Hopefully someone can spend some time working on cross-project test-patch which would ameliorate this issue., Is this broken by HDFS-3071?, Patch makes NameNode.state volatile to quiet the warning. This should be sufficient since the actual complicated transitions are themselves synchronized., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Agree.  If splitting would break the build, it is better to commit together.

Buy why it is not easy to run the checks?  I think it is easy at least to run findbugs., BTW, +1 patch looks good., Committed to trunk and 23, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1923 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1923/])
