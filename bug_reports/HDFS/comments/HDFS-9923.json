[Apparently Todd has seen it before., HADOOP-8640 is another incidence of the same issue.
As Todd found in HADOOP-8640,
The current behavior of DU which propagates the error to callers is not a good idea, because the callers have no way of knowing how to handle it.

What about logging the error, but don't propagate the error to the caller. Instead, initiate block scanner right away?, HADOOP-12973 unintentionally changed this behavior: du errors will be caught and logged, but not propagated to the caller.]
