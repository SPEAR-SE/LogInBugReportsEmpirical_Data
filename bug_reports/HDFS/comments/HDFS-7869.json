["finalize Rolling upgrade" can be consistent with "prepare rolling upgrade" ( return the information on start time , finalize time and block pool id. ). Instead of returning null as below.

{noformat}
#./hdfs dfsadmin -rollingUpgrade preparePREPARE rolling upgrade ...
Proceed with rolling upgrade:
  Block Pool ID: BP-2080087680-10.177.112.123-1425277943198
     Start Time: Mon Mar 02 19:06:21 CST 2015 (=1425294381657)
  Finalize Time: <NOT FINALIZED>

{noformat}
    case PREPARE:
      return namesystem.startRollingUpgrade();
    case FINALIZE:
      namesystem.finalizeRollingUpgrade();
      return null;
{noformat}

Please have a look at this issue , if my suggestion holds good let me provide a patch for this issue. 
, bq. "finalize Rolling upgrade" can be consistent with "prepare rolling upgrade" ( return the information on start time , finalize time and block pool id. ). Instead of returning null

FINALIZE rolling upgrade ...
Rolling upgrade is finalized.
  Block Pool ID: BP-136082255-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-1425371756113
