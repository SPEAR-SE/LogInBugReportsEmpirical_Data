[what i also noticed is that when this call was made the cpu resources being used start growing on the namenode. we should prob set min and max values., could we also add a check for the block size when a value that is not a multiple of io.bytes.per.checksum is sent the user is redirected and then the call fails., another parameter 'replication' if the user sends a value of 0 can we reject the request at namenode rather than after the redirect, Let's fix this in HDFS-2427., Closing as a duplicate of HDFS-2427., Closed upon release of version 1.0.0.]
