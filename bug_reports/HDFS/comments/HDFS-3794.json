, Attaching a patch that fixes the issue. Its too trivial to write a unit test (which will have to be pretty complicated :'( ... I tried briefly)
Here's the testing I did
1. Small file with offset. Worked
2. Big file (multiple blocks) with offset. Worked
3. Big file with offset greater than file size. Correctly threw a RemoteException, The same patch applies to branch 0.23, 2, and trunk.

This message is automatically generated., The findbugs warnings and the failed tests are not related., Thanks a lot Nicholas! Could you please commit the patch?

Credit goes to Phil Su for filing the issue! :), Took a second look at the patch.  The length HTTP query parameter means "The number of bytes to be processed" according to the [API|hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r1.0.0/webhdfs.html#length].  So it does not need to minus offset and the code should be
{code}
      final long n = length.getValue() != null? length.getValue()
        : in.getVisibleLength() - offset.getValue();
{code}
What do you think?, Shouldn't it check if length - offset goes negative?  Or is that checked elsewhere?, Thanks a lot Nicholas! I'm afraid I don't know enough about the code. I'll defer to you on this! I'm attaching the modified patch with the change you suggested.

Thanks Daryn. It discovers an out of range offset and throws an exception before reaching this method.
