[This seems to be intentional. {{DFSUtilClient.isValidName}} is called when creating a file, and the comment of this method explicitly says:
{code}
  /**
   * Whether the pathname is valid.  Currently prohibits relative paths,
   * names which contain a ":" or "//", or other non-canonical paths.
   */
{code}, {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path}} is not limited to a distributed file system. It can be used with any FileSystem including local file system. For local file system on Linux (or Mac), colon {{:}} is a valid/permitted character., [~boky01] Will you be submitting a patch?, HADOOP-14217 will fix this.
HADOOP-14217 has already had a patch and has bigger activity so I think it can be closed as "Duplicate".]
