This message is automatically generated., Hi Bharath, I tried to re-test the patch but it did not apply anymore.  Could you update it?
, Ok, I will recheck this. , Thanks Bharath, there were some unit tests failed in [build #866|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2065?focusedCommentId=13060939&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13060939] but the test report was no longer available.  I tried to apply the patch manually.  There was some conflict in FSNamesystem., Hi Bharath,

I assumed this may happen when we create an empty file and make a call to getFileChecksum. But that doesn't seems to be the case. Even in empty file scenario this call doesn't throw any NPE.

Can you please provide the scenario or stack trace for this. That will be helpful to reproduce and provide the correct fix., Bharath,

There are some more scenarios for getBlockLocations returning null values. i.e, when we call getFileCheckSum on non existing files or directories, it will throw NullPointerException. These two conditions handled in HDFS-2509

 I think we need to clean some places, where it is checking for null values from getBlockLocations.
See the code below from NameNodeFsck

{code}
LocatedBlocks blocks = namenode.getNamesystem().getBlockLocations(path, 0,
        fileLen, false, false);
    if (blocks == null) { // the file is deleted
      return;
    }
{code}

Also can you please provide one Unit test for this scenario, which should illustrate that, when inode.getBlocks() will return null?

Thanks
Uma, I suggest we simply change null in DFSClient.getFileChecksum(..) in this issue since it is a bugs in 0.20.  We may think if FSNamesystem.getBlockLocation(..) should be changed seperatedly., updated patch for 20 security!, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

One nite: could you put {{locatedblocks = blockLocations.getLocatedBlocks();}} in one line?

Although getLocatedBlocks() won't return null in trunk, could you also post a similar patch for trunk?  It is good to check null and your patch also adds a test., Thanks a lot for the review!
Fixed the nits.

I will post the patch for trunk as well., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Handled null checks, because blockManager#createLocatedBlocks can return null when node.getBlocks return null. I did not find any direct scenario to replicate it. Added the same test cases for trunk.
