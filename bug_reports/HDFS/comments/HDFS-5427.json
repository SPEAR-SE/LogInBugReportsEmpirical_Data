This message is automatically generated., To reproduce the failure, it seems one step of removing the file /foo/bar is needed. 
I used the following steps and the failure was reproduced in the latest trunk:

(assume a local file "bar" exists)
# hadoop fs -mkdir /foo
# hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /foo
# hadoop fs -put bar /foo/bar
# hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /foo s1
# {color:red} hadoop fs -rm /foo/bar {color}
# hdfs dfsadmin -safemode enter
# hdfs dfsadmin -saveNamespace
# hdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave
# stop-dfs.sh
# start-dfs.sh
# hadoop fs -cat /foo/.snapshot/s1/bar

Then, a BlockMissingException is observed., OOPS.. 
I have missed the important step here. Title itself says deleted files, but I missed to delete the file itself. Thanks [~shenxiaoli] for pointing out., Thanks Vinay and Dongcai! 

The current patch looks pretty good to me. Only some nits:
# We may want to add more javadoc to the new unit test besides the jira number. Also, we can use HdfsConstants.DOT_SNAPSHOT_DIR instead of ".snapshot".
# In the current fix, the following code may also be hit by a rename operation, since if we rename a file under a snapshot, a reference node will be created and added into the deleted list of its original parent:
{code}
+      if (deleted.isFile()) {
+        loader.updateBlocksMap(deleted.asFile());
+      }
{code}
The current patch works fine with this scenario, but it may be better to add a unit test to cover this case. The new unit test may look like:
{code}
public void testReadSnapshotFileWithCheckpoint2() throws Exception {
    final Path foo = new Path("/foo");
    final Path foo2 = new Path("/foo2");
    hdfs.mkdirs(foo);
    hdfs.mkdirs(foo2);
    
    hdfs.allowSnapshot(foo);
    hdfs.allowSnapshot(foo2);
    final Path bar = new Path(foo, "bar");
    final Path bar2 = new Path(foo2, "bar");
    DFSTestUtil.createFile(hdfs, bar, 100, (short) 2, 100024L);
    hdfs.createSnapshot(foo, "s1");
    hdfs.createSnapshot(foo2, "s2");
    
    hdfs.rename(bar, bar2);
    // optional: delete bar2

    // verification for /foo/.snapshot/s1/bar and /foo2/bar2...
}
{code}, Thanks Jing for the review.
Uploaded the patch with comments addressed.
bq. We may want to add more javadoc to the new unit test besides the jira number. Also, we can use HdfsConstants.DOT_SNAPSHOT_DIR instead of ".snapshot".
Javadocs added. Instead of using ".snapshot" used as below
{code:java} String snapshotPath = Snapshot.getSnapshotPath(foo.toString(), "s1/bar");{code}

bq. In the current fix, the following code may also be hit by a rename operation, since if we rename a file under a snapshot, a reference node will be created and added into the deleted list of its original parent:

Yes, rename operation also will add a deleted child in diffs. But it will not result in current issue unless the file is deleted from original place i.e. outside snapshots. since original file updates the blocksmap, issue will not occur. So added a test with deletion of renamed file included.

This message is automatically generated., The release audit warning and the eclipse warning should be unrelated. +1 for the new patch. I will commit it shortly., Thanks Jing, I was checking for the eclipse related problem. But Seems jenkins build is hanged/waiting for something., bq. But Seems jenkins build is hanged/waiting for something.

Yeah. I've seen similar warning several times before. I ran "mvn eclipse:eclipse" locally and it passed. I believe the warning should be unrelated to the patch.

I've committed the patch to trunk and branch-2., Thanks Jing for the review and commit.
