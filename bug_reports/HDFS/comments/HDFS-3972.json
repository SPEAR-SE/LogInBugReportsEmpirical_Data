[edit: updated Summary and Description to indicate this only happens when HA is enabled on the secure cluster, The root cause of the issue is that, in HA, the TrashEmptier is started from the context of an RPC, rather than the context of the NN startup code. So, it was running as the administrator who called transitionToActive (remote non-keytab user) rather than the context of the NN login user.

Attached patch fixes the issue. It doesn't include a new unit test, since the issue is only on secure clusters, which aren't automatable.

I tested manually as follows:
- configure a secure HA cluster
- configure fs.trash.interval and fs.trash.checkpoint.interval = 1 in core-site.xml
- started NN and transitioned to active
-- without the patch, I saw the error mentioned above. with the patch, no error
- created and deleted a file, which got moved to trash
- waited a minute, and saw that the trash checkpointer moved the file correctly
-- without the patch, I saw the error again. With the patch, it worked.
