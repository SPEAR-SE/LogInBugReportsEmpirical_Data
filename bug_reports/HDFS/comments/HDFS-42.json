[Same stack trace, same root cause, So, what to do here?

# move that string in conf.get to a package scoped constant DFS_DATANODE_IPC_ADDRESS
# when the result of conf.get is null, raise an exception "No value defined for "+ DFS_DATANODE_IPC_ADDRESS (this could be another package scoped string)
# test: create a configuration without this value, try to create a datanode, look for the relevant string as the message in the exception

Question: what exception to raise? IOException?, Reviewing this, I will go with the IOE unless anyone objects, HADOOP-5687 duplicated this; it contained the patch]
