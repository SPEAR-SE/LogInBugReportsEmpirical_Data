[When I run {{start-dfs.sh -rollback}} the DNs do properly get the {{-rollback}} flag, but then it doesn't seem to take effect. I am seeing the following, after which the DN exits:

This is on trunk - haven't tried the same on branch-0.23., Strangely, I don't seem to have a {{previous}} dir in my DNs, though I could have sworn they all took part in the upgrade. So not 100% clear what might have happened here.. merits some investigation/testing., Aha, sorry for the many comments, but: the blockpool in question _does_ have a previous/ directory, though the DN-wide data dir does not (since this is an upgrade from another post-federation layout, assumedly), Based on the exception message "Reported: -40. Expecting = -39" it seems that for rolling back you use the same version you upgraded with. You need to run -rollback with the old version - the one with LV -39. Is that the problem?, I don't think so - I ran the rollback with the old version (-39). Maybe the issue is that it's reporting the version number from the storage instead of the _current_ version number from LayoutVersion?

In order to unblock my (unrelated) testing I used some sed scripts to change the version number back to -39 and started the DNs (which supports the theory that the DNs are indeed running -39)., I guess this old issue probably is not-a-problem anymore. Resolving ...

Please feel free to reopen this if you disagree.]
