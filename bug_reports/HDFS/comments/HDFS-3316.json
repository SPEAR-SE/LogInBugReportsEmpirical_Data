Committing to branch-1.0 and branch-1.  Thanks, Owen!, After discussion with Giri, have concluded that this change is not required after fixing the integration bug in [MAPREDUCE-3377 change #1306744|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3377?focusedCommentId=13266972&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13266972].

However, the suggested patch is part of HADOOP-8364, so changing title and description to show this.

Reverting from branch-1 and branch-1.0, until such time as HADOOP-8364 is addressed., Moved to 1.2.0 upon release of 1.1.0., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2., closing as stale, as branch-1 is effectively EOLed.
