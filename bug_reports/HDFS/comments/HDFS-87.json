[This is a trivial workaround, which can be used by anyone else stuck by a truncated log. It's not what a good solution - needs better logging, probably a preference that defaults to "don't go on", etc. However, as my log filled up doing replication changes, this even results in no data loss in my case., -1, since the patch command could not apply the latest attachment as a patch: http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12347120/fixNameNodeStartup.patch. Please note that this message is automatically generated and may represent a problem with the automation system and not the patch., Another related issue is that, currently when multiple directories are specified for Namenode, it selects the directory that has the latest FSImage file and it reads edits log only from that directory (instead of selecting the editslog with the latest mod time).

This and other issues will be covered in a new jira targeted for 0.16. Will keep it open  until then.
, You cannot rely on file mod times. It is not supported by all file systems, and time is not expected to be synchronized across different 
(mounted) file systems. That is why the name-node creates a special file fstime, which contains latest mod time for the image generated
centrally on the name-node once and the same for all image directories.
This issue is very distantly related to the issue you describe imo., The issue of having an truncated last-entry in the edit slog is an old issue and this problem should not be there in the current trunk (after we introduced the preallocation of blocks in the edits log and OP_INVALID end marker).

I am closing  this for now
