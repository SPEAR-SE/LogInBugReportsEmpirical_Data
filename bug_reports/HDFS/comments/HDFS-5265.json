[Good catch [~wheat9]! Since you're in this area, maybe you can also remove the redundant "if (certSSL)" in the same method:

{code}
    if (certSSL) {
      boolean needClientAuth = conf.getBoolean("dfs.https.need.client.auth", false);
      InetSocketAddress secInfoSocAddr = NetUtils.createSocketAddr(infoHost + ":" + conf.get(
        DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_HTTPS_PORT_KEY, infoHost + ":" + 0));
      Configuration sslConf = new Configuration(false);
      if (certSSL) {
        sslConf.addResource(conf.get(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_SERVER_HTTPS_KEYSTORE_RESOURCE_KEY,
                                     "ssl-server.xml"));
      }
    ....
