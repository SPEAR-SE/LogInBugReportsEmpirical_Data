[1. add a log message before the test goes to sleep.
2. instead of using while(true), I would prefer to put break condition there.
3, better use logging instead of System.out.print., Patch updated with Hairong's suggestions., +1 The patch looks good. One minor comment: could you please make the sleep period shorter, like 200?,  The granularity of dfs.replication.interval is 1 sec. Therefore, reducing the sleep period to a small value doesn't improve the run time of the test., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I've committed this with a minor change. I changed the sleeping period from 2000ms to 600ms. This should reduce the uneccessary waiting time.
