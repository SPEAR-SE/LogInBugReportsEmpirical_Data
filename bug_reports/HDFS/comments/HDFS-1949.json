, - The following introduces invalid markup and is also too many columns wide:
{code}
-    out.print("<form action=\"/browseBlock.jsp\" method=GET>");
+    out.print("<form name=\"browseblock\" action=\"/browseBlock.jsp\" method=GET> onsubmit=\"return chunkSizeViewValidator()\">");
{code}

- In the new JavaScript code, please follow the usual coding conventions (eg opening brace on same line as if statement, proper indentation)
- rather than complaining about whitespace, why not trim it on the server side?
- ServletUtil.htmlFooter already prints the </body> and </html> -- you're now printing it twice
, Hi Todd

Thanks for your comments.

As per your suggestion can we handle the trailing and leading white space by calling .trim() on the server side ?
If the user gives any value with spaces in the middle like 1 23 then we can throw a  pop up in javascript.
Is this fine Todd?, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
