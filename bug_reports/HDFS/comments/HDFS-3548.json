[* NamenodeFsck#copyBlock: use NetUtils#SocketFactory to get a Socket, so that it has an associated SocketChannel, as required by RemoteBlockReader2

* NamenodeFsck: if there is an error performing the actions that the user asked for, we should return failure status.

* DFSTestUtil: allow DFSTestUtil#minSize to be specified in the constructor

* TestFsck: add TestFsck#testFsckMove, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good.  I'd go one step further to prevent similar situations (we have duplicate methods, see HDFS-3015, and only copy gets the fix) and (1) nuke the bestNode method here and use the version from jspHelper, and then (2) move copyBlock here to a util class and structure it similarly to  streamBlockInAscii (eg bestNode already handles the connect timeout so we don't need to duplicate that logic in copyBlock).

Style nits:
- s/"corrupted file"/"corrupt file"
- "catch(Ex" needs a space
- Seems like "Fsck: copied the remains of the corrupted file" should be INFO instead of WARN, bq. Looks good. I'd go one step further to prevent similar situations (we have duplicate methods, see HDFS-3015, and only copy gets the fix) and (1) nuke the bestNode method here and use the version from jspHelper, and then (2) move copyBlock here to a util class and structure it similarly to streamBlockInAscii (eg bestNode already handles the connect timeout so we don't need to duplicate that logic in copyBlock).

Yeah, there is definitely some refactoring we should do here to avoid the duplication.  Let's do that as part of HDFS-3015, after the immediate bug can be fixed here.

I'll re-issue this patch with style nits fixed..., * fix style issues and rebase, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
