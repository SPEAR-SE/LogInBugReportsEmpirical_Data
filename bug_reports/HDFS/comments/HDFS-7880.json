This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~brahmareddy] for creating the patch. The patch seems to remove the tests which are not related to legacy Web UI. Would you please refer the patch for trunk uploaded to HDFS-6252? For TestJournalNode.java, removing the following code is sufficient.
{code}
    // Check JSP page.
    pageContents = DFSTestUtil.urlGet(
        new URL(urlRoot + "/journalstatus.jsp"));
    assertTrue(pageContents.contains("JournalNode"));

bq. And one more thing what about DatanodeJspHelper.java, ClusterJspHelper.java and NamenodeJspHelper.java..?
Nice catch! We can remove the code being not used by HftpFileSystem. I'm thinking the following can be removed.
* {{NameNodeJspHelper#getDelegationToken}}
* {{TestNameNodeJspHelper#testDelegationToken}}
* {{ClusterJspHelper.java}}
* {{TestClusterJspHelper.java}}, will I raise another issue for this removal of classes..?, bq. will I raise another issue for this removal of classes..?
