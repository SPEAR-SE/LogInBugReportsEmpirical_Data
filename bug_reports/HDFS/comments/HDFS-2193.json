[I'm of the opinion that the NN's hostname determination should be changed to be the same as the way the DN presently does it, namely the result of "{{InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName()}}".

It may be that there's some good reason for this asymmetry that I can't think of. (Distinct internal/external interfaces on the NN?) If so, the resolution of this JIRA should probably just be to clearly document how all the various daemons determine their own hostnames.

This same asymmetry exists between the JT and TT as well, but I figure we should just discuss the appropriate solution to this issue here first, and then I'll file a complementary MR JIRA once we figure out the correct course of action.]
