[from core-user thread at http://www.nabble.com/Could-only-be-replicated-to-0-nodes%2C-instead-of-1-td23650042.html :

Most likely this is what is happening :

  * two out of 3 dns can not take anymore blocks.
  * While picking nodes for a new block, NN mostly skips the third dn as
well since '# active writes' on it is larger than '2 * avg'.
  * Even if there is one other block is being written on the 3rd, it is
still greater than (2 * 1/3).

To test this, if you write just one block to an idle cluster it should
succeed.
[...]

This particular problem is not that severe on a large cluster but HDFS
should do the sensible thing.

Raghu.
, Any idea if the fixes for this will go into the latest trunk?

Will it be back-portable to 0.18.3?

Regards., We should verify that this is fixed.

I've seen an issue similar to this under 2.2.0 and I'm beginning to wonder if it isn't the same problem.]
