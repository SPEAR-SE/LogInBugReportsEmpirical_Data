[Attached is a patch which adds the required headers., Right, there files miss Apache license. 
From the Jenkins result of the merged patch in HDFS-6134, we have not seen these, seems Jenkins sometime can't report all issues if the patch gets too large?, I'm not sure what's going on with Jenkins lately.  It was stable after the move for a bit, then it started throwing weird errors again.  Saw these failures in another jenkins run through. So there's that I guess?  I'm really curious as to what it will say with this patch. :D
