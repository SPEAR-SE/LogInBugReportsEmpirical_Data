[Actually NN hangs 1~2 minutes because of GC.
This problem may not appear when NN have enough memory., I think NN jvm parameters should be configured correctly. That said, DNs continue to reconnect, right?, NN's jvm parameter for memory is -Xmx39G but that seems not enough to load the fsimage without GC. DNs continue to reconnect but they are also time-out because the default timeout is 1 minute. These events repeat for a while and then NN don't accept any connect trial to itself., Yep, DNs continue to reconnect, but eventually NN don't accept any connection. I waited for very long hours but NN couldn't leave safemode even once. After setting ipc.ping.interval, only 15 minutes is needed to restart hdfs.]
