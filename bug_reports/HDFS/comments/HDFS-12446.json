[bq. NameNode always print following logs.
What do you mean by always ?
Can you attach some more logs giving more context ? Does namenode log this while finalizing all inodes ?, NN log exception info as description. this because LeaseManager$Monitor#run is in a dead loop, every run will throw IllegalStateException.
[HDFS-11817|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-11817] has the same exception, but did not fix completely.

{code:java}
          boolean completed = false;
          try {
            completed = fsnamesystem.internalReleaseLease(
                leaseToCheck, p, iip, newHolder);
          } catch (IOException e) {                     // NOTE:  did not catch IllegalStateException
            LOG.warn("Cannot release the path " + p + " in the lease "
                + leaseToCheck + ". It will be retried.", e);
            continue;
          }
{code}
