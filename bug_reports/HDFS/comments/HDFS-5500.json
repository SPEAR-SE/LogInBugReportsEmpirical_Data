[Hi,

I'm investigating this issue.
When DU#refreshInterval > 0, DURefreshThread will run and execute "du" command to the directory(DU#dirPath) onece a "refreshInterval" millisecond.
So, normally, the value DU#getUsed returns is refreshed onece a refreshInterval millisecond.
When we put some files on the directory which DU#dirPath expresses, BlockPoolSlicer#getDfsUsed will return the value considering the size of the files we put.

But, if DURefreshThread dies because of some uncaught exceptions, we couldn't know it and the value BlockPoolSlicer#getDfsUsed returns will  never  be updated., Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0., There has been no movement on this for a while. We'll need to move it out of scope for 2.8.0 soon. Let me know if you disagree., Not much going on here for a long time, dropping from 2.8.0.

Not putting any target-version either anymore, let's target this depending on when there is patch activity.]
