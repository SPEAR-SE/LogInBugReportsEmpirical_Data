[[~arpitagarwal]could you assign me the ticket?, have changed most of the blockstatechange log from info level to debug level., Thanks for fixing this [~lichangleo]. Can you also wrap each call in a {{isDebugEnabled()}} call. That way we don't incur the overhead of generating the log strings unless debug logging is turned on. e.g.

{code}
    if (NameNode.blockStateChangeLog.isDebugEnabled()) {
        NameNode.blockStateChangeLog.debug("BLOCK* Removing stale replica "
             + "from location: " + r.getExpectedStorageLocation());
    }
{code}, Is this a good time to also switch BlockStateChange over to use slf4j and to use "{}" templates? Then we could avoid the if-wrappers., [~lichangleo], see if you want to follow Andrew's suggestion and update BlockStateChange to use slf4j.

I'd be +1 either way - slf4j or existing log4j calls with {{isDebugEnabled}} checks., updated patch with debugenable check, Thanks Chang.

# In {{logAddStoredBlock}}, we can just fix the call to {{if (!blockLog.isInfoEnabled())}} at the start of the function. Then we skip the unnecessary StringBuilder logic.
# Looks like patch needs to be rebased to current trunk.

+1 with these fixed.

This message was automatically generated., The original patch does not apply after switching to slf4j with HDFS-7112. I rebase and fix some missing ones in the original patch., Thanks [~xyao], we should probably leave the "Processing first storage report for " and the processReport messages at DEBUG.

Those are logged once per DN per block report and useful in practice.

. , Thanks [~arpitagarwal] for the review. Do you mean keep the processReport related log at *INFO* level? , Thanks I meant INFO. Apologize for not catching this in the earlier review., Update the patch based on feedback. 
Delta from v00: Keep the block report processing related log at INFO level. 
, +1 pending Jenkins thanks for taking over this [~xyao]., \\
