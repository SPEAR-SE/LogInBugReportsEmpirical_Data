[Patch attached. Also removes the check of cluster for null in a couple of tests where cluster should never be null., The patch looks pretty good to me. A few little comments:

# This will make a test failure harder to debug, not easier, since we'll be losing the stack trace. We should just let the IOE get thrown:
{code}
+    } catch (IOException e) {
+      Assert.fail("Failed to add NN to cluster");
{code}
# Not sure why you made this change. This is in general good practice so that we get the actual stack trace of why the minicluster failed to start, instead of an NPE:
{code}
-      if(cluster != null) 
-        cluster.shutdown();
+      cluster.shutdown();
{code}, Thanks ATM. 

Wrt #1 updated the patch to log the full IOE on failure. Wrt #2, I understand why we check cluster for null, but per my above comment cluster could never be null here right?, bq. Wrt #2, I understand why we check cluster for null, but per my above comment cluster could never be null here right?

Ah, touche. Usually when I do this I declare the cluster outside of the try block, but initialize it within, in which case the null check is desirable. You're right that in this case it doesn't matter.
