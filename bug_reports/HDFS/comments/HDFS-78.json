[FSNamesystem.exists(...) is now searching namespace once but other methods may still search namespace unnecessarily multiple times., I won't be able to work on this issue in the near future.  Setting this to unassigned., In our HDFS cluster NameNode becomes very slow when large number of files (in millions) are open for writes concurrently. Profiling NN shows the most expensive operations in the file create/close code path is INode#getPathComponents, which is called when traversing the file path. As Konstantin pointed out, startFile/getAdditionalBlock/completeFile unnecessarily traverses the path multiple times. Fixing this should greatly improve NameNode's performance.]
