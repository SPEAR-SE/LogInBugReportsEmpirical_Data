[Attached patch, Please review , [~arpitagarwal] Please can you review this patch., Thanks for fixing this [~surendrasingh]. Just a nitpick, there should be spaces between the {{else}} and the braces on line 1176. +1 with that fixed.

Also see if you want to add a unit test. It should be fairly simple., \\

This message was automatically generated., Failed test cases and find bugs are not related to this jira.

, Thanks [~arpitagarwal] for review.
Attached new patch, added test case. Please review., Thanks for the update and adding a test case. 

We can simplify the test case later - just assert that the scrubber object is null e.g.
{{assertThat(cluster.getFsNameSystem().lazyPersistFileScrubber, is(null));}}

+1 pending Jenkins., \\
