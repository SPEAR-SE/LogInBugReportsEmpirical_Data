This message is automatically generated., Hi MaWenJin, it's a little tough for me to follow the patch you've attached, since it appears to both introduce tabs instead of spaces, and because it appears to make whitespace changes on lines that are otherwise unchanged. Could you please attach a new patch which doesn't include hard tabs and only changes the pertinent lines? Additionally, please make sure that the patch you upload applies cleanly to Hadoop trunk. The reason the QA bot failed to apply the patch is probably because it was generated against a different branch than trunk., MaWenJin, checkout this page for details on ATM's suggestions. http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute
, Hi,Aaron T. Myers. According to your suggestion, I re-hit a patch,may it is available., renew patch, May available, Hi ChenFolin, I don't think the latest patch is going to work, at least because it appears to misspell the java keyword "else" as "esle":
{code}
+        if (fs != null) {
+          return fs;
+        }esle{
+          fs = createFileSystem(uri, conf);

This message is automatically generated., Hi Aaron T. Myers,
When I execute "dev-support/test-patch.sh patch",that causes many errors,such as:
"org.apache.hadoop.record.RecordComparator is deprecated."
and the code is:
{code}
@Deprecated
@InterfaceAudience.Public
@InterfaceStability.Stable
public abstract class RecordComparator extends WritableComparator {
{code}

So,"dev-support/test-patch.sh patch" exec failed.And now,how can I do for it?
