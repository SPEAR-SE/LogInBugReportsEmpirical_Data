[What's wrong with using {{hadoop fs -setrep}}?

The move command is not supposed to alter replication status..., -setrep works well but it was confusing when move does not supported it and usage tells nothing about it. Probably I should change ticket to "new feature" or "improvement"?, I don't think this is a good idea.  Consider moving a large directory with hundreds of thousands of files.  Are you going to check each file to see if its replication is equal to the current dfs.replication setting?  And if it's not, are you going to do setrep on it?  This will also create a lot of problems for current users, since they'll find that mv unexpectedly changes their replication settings.  Remember that dfs.replication is usually set to a value due to the configuration XML files, even if the user didn't set it explicitly.]
