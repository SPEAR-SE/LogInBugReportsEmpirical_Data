[Patch attached to change the docs slightly., +1, unless you think we should fix the code to use glob syntax instead of regex (might be more ops-friendly)?, Thanks for the review. I considered that as well and concluded that we should probably just stick with regexes. Regular expressions will be more flexible, and we also use them in other places in our configuration (e.g. hadoop.security.auth_to_local) so it's not as if we'll be completely absolving the need for a cluster operator to understand regular expressions if we were to change this setting., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
