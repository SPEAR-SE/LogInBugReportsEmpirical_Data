[Is this related/the same as HDFS-900?, Todd, I am not sure. From your description in HDFS-900, it seems to me that NN does not identify corrupt replicas when processing block report, which is different from this problem., Do we have a diagnosis and idea of how to fix this? If not, I'd like to flag it as a potential problem in the release notes for 0.21. , Removing the 0.21.0 fix version. I will add this as a known issue to the release notes., Now that HDFS-900 is closed, should we close this one as well?
If not than it would be good to have a precise description of what the problem is, how it reveals itself, is it reproducible, and have anybody seen it live., Resolving as duplicate of HDFS-900. Feel free to reopen if there is more work needed.]
