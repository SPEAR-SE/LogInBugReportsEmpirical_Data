[Here's a patch which addresses the issue.

I'm struggling with how to write a test case for this, since both the NN and DN use a static function to determine their own build version. Posting a patch now while I think about how to do so. Suggestions are certainly welcome.

I tested this by adding some debugging output to BPServiceActor#checkNNVersion that outputs the NN's and DN's build versions. I confirmed that without the patch the two versions are always the same, and with the patch the NN version is correctly different from the DN version if the NN's build version is different., +1 for the patch. I think this is trivial enough and unit test is an overkill. One quick comment - do we need second variant of the NamespaceInfo constructor? If it is not used at many places, can we just have one constructor?, Thanks a lot for the quick review, Suresh.

bq. I think this is trivial enough and unit test is an overkill.

OK, works for me. Writing a proper test here would probably require somehow recompiling and forking a new JVM, etc. which I agree doesn't seem worth it.

bq. One quick comment - do we need second variant of the NamespaceInfo constructor? If it is not used at many places, can we just have one constructor?

This variant is currently used in 7 places - 4 in tests and 3 in functional areas of the code. I'm inclined to leave it as-is. Is that OK by you, Suresh?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Suresh, if you feel strongly about removing one of the NamespaceInfo constructor variants, I'd be happy to do that in a follow-up JIRA., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2078 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2078/])

Just wanted to avoid the many variants of constructors and methods. Our code is replete with this :-) But no issues with the patch though., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #2015 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/2015/])
