[calculation of 01 patch:
replicas < minReplication ( UNDER MIN REPL'D BLOCKS )(HDFS-7537)
replicas == minReplication ( Minimally replicated blocks )
replicas < ReplicationFactor ( Under-replicated blocks )
replicas == ReplicationFactor ( Normally replicated blocks )
replicas > ReplicationFactor ( Over-replicated blocks )

if ReplicationFactor equals to minReplication, the block is counted by both Minimally and Normally blocks.

*scenario*
Assume minReplication=1.
Assume I have a block blk_1001 with factor=2 and 2 replicas. It's Normally replicated but not Minimally replicated.
Assume I have a block blk_1002 with factor=1 and 1 replicas. It's Normally replicated also Minimally replicated. 
The output with 01 patch:
{noformat}
 Total blocks (validated):  2 (avg. block size 1024 B)
 Minimally replicated blocks:   1 (50.0 %)
 Normally replicated blocks:    2 (100.0 %)
 Over-replicated blocks:    0 (0.0 %)
 Under-replicated blocks:   0 (0.0 %)
 Mis-replicated blocks:     0 (0.0 %)
 Default replication factor:    2
 Average block replication: 1.5
 Missing blocks:        0
 Corrupt blocks:        0
 Missing replicas:      0 (0.0 %)
 Number of data-nodes:      2
{noformat}
Now I know one block(blk_1002) is in danger., Sorry the alignment I posted here is a mess. It's not related to the patch., \\
