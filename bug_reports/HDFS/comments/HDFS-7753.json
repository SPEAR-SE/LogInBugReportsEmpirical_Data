[I've tried to fix this, please review the attached patch. Thanks!

I thought of adding synchronized block over {{loadEdits(editStreams, tmpNamesystem);}} but I avoided considering that, this operation is a costlier one. Welcome any thoughts?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Rakesh! Not very many people use the BackupNode. You might want to check with Konstantin Svachko about this., I'm +1 for ignoring the warning by adding an entry to findbugsExcludeFile.xml. I've created the patch in HDFS-7754 for doing this.
Would you close this issue and review the patch? Sorry for the duplication., OK. Based on the discussion on HDFS-7754 will go ahead and do the changes. If anyone has strong argument to fix this issue, can come back and refer the patch attached in this jira. I'm closing as duplicate now., Reopening. I think this patch was on the right track., I would rather fix it here than by suppressing the warning as in HDFS-7754.
We do not actually need to synchronize {{namesystem}} reference, but it fell casualty of synchronization of other fields. A synchronized getter should do the job., Thanks [~shv]. LGTM, +1 pending Jenkins and another committer's review., Thanks [~shv] for taking this ahead and fixing it. +1 latest patch looks good to me., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
