[since this is non-trivial to fully implement in hdfs, I am thinking of just implementing it for the case where bytes == 0. This is the common use case for: cp foo bar where bar already exists. truncate(bar, 0) is called and then foo is copied.  Getting the user/permissions right would need to do a stat on the file, get the user and groups and permissions and then do a delete, then the create and then chown and chmod. the code would look something like:

{code}, Looking at the current trunk, this is already implemented.  Couldn't figure out where the first commit was, but its current implementation was added in r723185.]
