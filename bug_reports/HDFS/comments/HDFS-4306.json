[Changes:
Reuse PBHelper.convert instead of writing  repeated convert code.
In testConvertLocatedBlock, set blockToken to non default value, so "compare(lb.getBlockToken(), lb2.getBlockToken())" actually mean something.
Add testConvertLocatedBlockArray and testConvertLocatedBlockList  , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Binglin. Good catch. Looking at this code, though, I'm not sure why we don't just do:
{code}
  public static LocatedBlock[] convertLocatedBlock(LocatedBlockProto[] lb) {
    if (lb == null) return null;
    return convertLocatedBlock(Arrays.asList(lb));
  }
{code}

Wouldn't that reduce duplicated code?, @Todd thanks for the review, here is the modified version, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Binglin, the patch looks functionally fine to me. My only comment is that the two test methods introduced seem to duplicate a lot of code, and so could be refactored easily to reduce the overlap.

+1 once that's addressed., Thanks Aaron for the review!
New version of the patch, changes:
1. refactor test code to remove duplicate code., Thanks for refactoring it, Binglin, but I think there's a little bug in your new compare method. Seems like this loop should be comparing the values from the two different arrays, {{ei}} and {{ai}}:
{code}
+    for (int i = 0; i < ei.length ; i++) {
+      compare(ai[i], ai[i]);
+    }
{code}

Otherwise the patch looks good to me., Thanks for noticing this. Correct the bug mentioned in last comment.
