[How does this issue relate to HADOOP-1707 which proposes elimination of client side caches?
In view of 1707, is this change still necessary?
, This is not related to HADOOP-1707, which is mostly about removing the temporary file that accumulates user data
until it reaches the size of the block. When hdfs client gets user data it first accumulates it in the user data buffer,
when the latter reaches its capacity the buffer is flushed into the temp file. Even if the file is eliminated there is still
a need for the user data buffer. And it still needs to be different from the buffer used to transfer data to data-nodes.]
