[This is because HADOOP-6951 just got committed, but HDFS-1399 is not yet committed. I believe Tom White said that he'd be doing that (and MAPREDUCE-2067) soon, probably today.

Aaron, We should commit this ASAP. In future, we should line them up and commit them in quick succession., HADOOP-6951 has now been reverted and I confirmed HDFS trunk now compiles. Sorry for the noise.]
