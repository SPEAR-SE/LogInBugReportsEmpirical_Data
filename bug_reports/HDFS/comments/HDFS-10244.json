[#2 is not necessary.  The are no "important IBRs" that warrant a DN excessively buffering IBRs, let alone assuming it knows the NN's heartbeat expiry.  The DN can choose to discard IBRs at any time and simply send a FBR either directly, or via willful re-registration.  The latter may be easier to accomplish, ex. trick the DN into thinking it hasn't registered.]
