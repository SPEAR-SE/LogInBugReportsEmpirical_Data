[Attaching list of failed test cases., (All fixes in the test cases)

FS shell commands expect valid URIs as inputs and hence fails when given Windows absolute paths. While it is easy enough to fix it to take paths I do not want to change that behavior. Hence the path related fixes are all in the test cases., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Nice finds, Arpit!  I verified that this works on Mac and Windows.  Here are just a couple of minor clean-up comments:

{code}
+      // Skip sticky but related tests on Windows.
+      //
{code}

Minor typo: change to "sticky bit".  Maybe delete the second blank comment line.

{code}
+      System.out.println("trashFile is " + trashFile);
{code}

Can we remove this now?
