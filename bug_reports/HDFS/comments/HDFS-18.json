[namenode log, Tamir, it would be great if you can let us know the steps to reproduce this situation. we tried with various configurations and startup options with no luck.... are you still facing this issue... ?, I've not seen this again with 19 and for a while now we're on 20 so no chance to reproduce it at my end., Please feel free to reopen if you see this as a problem again.]
