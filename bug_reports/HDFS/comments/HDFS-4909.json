[Must have installed protobuf-c to use., please read BUILDING.txt before compiling. Thanks., I have read it - nothing in there pertains to this problem, that I can see.

Is there something specific you are referring to?
, did you install protobuf before compiling?, Yes - this is a secondary JIRA filed at Arun and Aprit's request because they had closed the prior one once the compile worked, not realizing that the results failed to link. It is a problem in the .proto definitions of the three specified classes.
, yes,- this is HDFS-4866 releated. I've added reference., The full import of hdfs.proto causing duplicate definitions is the same reason that we've needed to use 4 separate protoc executions in the pom.xml.  We likely need some refactoring across all of the HDFS proto files to prevent the need for multiple protoc build steps and also prevent duplicate symbols at link time.  I don't yet know the full scope of this refactoring though., I think we cannot block 2.1.0 for this. If we think changes we need to make are not going to need incompatible changes, I suggest making this Major priority instead of Blocker., Do we all agree that this *can* be fixed later in a compatible manner?, Hi Arun

On road - up to you folks. Only made blocker as someone set that level on prior jira

, [~rhc] Thanks Ralph. I'm just trying to herd cats to get the release out... as you can imagine it's a tough job! *smile*

Frankly, my inclination is to punt this from 2.1.0-beta *iff* this is something we can fix in a compatible manner down the road., {quote}

Yes, I expect we can fix this later and still retain compatibility.  The original problem reported in HDFS-4866 required a backwards-incompatible change in a protocol method name, so we really needed to get that one done before beta.  For this one, I expect we can fix the problem of duplicate symbols during protoc/link time by refactoring the proto definitions, but still retaining the same method names., Lets get this done in 2.2.0
, This patch changes the protobuf package which DatanodeProtocol, NamenodeProtocol, and QJournalProtocol reside in to match their names.  This avoids the name conflicts that were previously caused by putting everything into "package hadoop.hdfs".

This doesn't alter what gets sent over the wire at all, so there are no compatibility implications.  I have confirmed this for myself by running some servers with this patch against clients which do not have it.

No changes to the Java code are needed, since we manually specify which Java packages things should go in (the java package is different than the protobuf package).  Essentially, the protobuf package is irrelevant in the java code because it gets overridden by {{option java_package}}.

It does change some of the generated code a bit.  For example, {{internal_static_hadoop_hdfs_CommitBlockSynchronizationResponseProto_descriptor}} becomes {{internal_static_hadoop_hdfs_datanode_CommitBlockSynchronizationResponseProto_descriptor}}.  But this seems to all be internal stuff deep inside the PB generated code which doesn't get exposed to the outside world., Hi, Colin.  Thanks for doing this.  I remember when I looked at it a few months ago, I also thought we'd be able to simplify our build a little bit.  There are multiple protoc invocations right now, and that's just a workaround due to duplicate symbol inclusion when everything was in one protobuf namespace.  I just tried using a single protoc invocation with your patch, and sure enough, it worked.  I'm attaching patch v2, which is your patch plus the pom.xml change.

I'm +1 for v2 of the patch pending Jenkins.
, Nice.  It's good to see the pom file get simplified a little bit by this change.

+1 for v2, pending jenkins, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
