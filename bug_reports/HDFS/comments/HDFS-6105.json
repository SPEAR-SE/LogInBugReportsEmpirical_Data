[It was pointed out in HDFS-5748 before.  

If you try reloading the page, it won't load multiple time. But if you click on the "Datanodes" tab, you will see multiple redundant GET being issued.  If you alternate between Overview and Datanodes, it gets worse. After going back and forth several times, I see it being loaded 9 times when clicking "Datanodes"., [~wheat9]: Would take a look at what's going on?, Every time you click on the datenode tab, it'll reload {{/jmx?qry=Hadoop:service=NameNode,name=NameNodeInfo}} to get the up-to-date information of the datanode. This is expected., > This is expected.
Please read what I said earlier. One click causes multiple loads of the same page., I can't reproduce the bug. What browser you're using?, I can reproduce it in 2.3.0.  If I open the NN page and (with the Firefox console open) I click on the "Datanodes" tab, 3 GETs are sent to http://nn/jmx very quickly.  I've attached an image of the Firefox console.  Using Firefox 27.0.1 on Mac OS 1.8.5, Thanks [~kihwal] and [~tthompso] for reporting this issue. This is because the corresponding function {{load_datanode_info()}} is called multiple times. This is because:

# {{load_datanode_info()}} is registered with the link multiple times.
# The {{hashchange}} handler calls {{load_datanode_info()}} when it detects the change of the hash tag., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
