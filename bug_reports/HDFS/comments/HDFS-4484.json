This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me. I confirmed that on gcc 4.6.3 libwebhdfs does not compile without this patch, and does compile with it.

To test this I also had to install libcurl4-openssl-dev and libjansson-dev to get this to compile at all, neither of which is documented in BUILDING.txt. Colin, mind documenting those dependencies in BUILDING.txt as well? This could be done as a separate JIRA if you'd prefer. Either way is fine by me., Canceling patch since the current patch does not apply cleanly., Hmm; what conflicts did you get when applying?  It applied cleanly for me just now.

You could also try {{patch --merge}}, available on newer versions of that program..., Sorry - I posted that comment about the patch not applying cleanly to the wrong JIRA. I meant to say that over on HADOOP-8569.

Still, though, I think we should document these dependencies in BUILDING.txt., bq. Still, though, I think we should document these dependencies in BUILDING.txt.

Yeah.  Filed HADOOP-9329 for this., +1, the patch looks good to me. I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks a lot for the contribution, Colin., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3459 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3459/])
