[I have checked this on my cluster, where I added a datanode to the exclude file which decommissions a node, if the datanode is live it will be added to the Live Decommissioned count, if the datanode is stopped it will be added to the Dead Decommissioned count, which makes sense.
There is however a bug in the code I submitted where the Dead count ends up being the same as the Live count, the following line need to be changed:
    getBlockManager().getDatanodeManager().fetchDatanodes(dead, null, true);
should be:
    getBlockManager().getDatanodeManager().fetchDatanodes(null, dead, true);
