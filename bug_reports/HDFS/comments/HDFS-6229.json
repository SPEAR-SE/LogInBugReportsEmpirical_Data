[The patch can mimic the scenario and cause unit tests in TestRetryCacheWithHA timeout., We can let HAState#setStateInternal hold locks of both FSNamesystem and FSNamesystem#retryCache. In this way reading retryCache will not happen between the NN failover. Upload an initial patch to fix., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
