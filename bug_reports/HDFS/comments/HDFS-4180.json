[The error is caused by the inconsistency between real exception msg and expected exception msg. A simple change can fix the error and the local TestFileCreation now passed., +1 patch looks good.  The patch works well., I have committed this.  Thanks, Jing!, Pardon the above thrash.  This problem only happens in 1.2.0 because it was caused by HDFS-4122 which is only committed to branch-1., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
