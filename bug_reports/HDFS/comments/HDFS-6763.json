[We're already seeing at least 6s hangs on some clusters, and expect >20s on larger clusters., Looks like the SBN does not need to call {{updateCountForQuota}} while tailing editlog, since it should be consistent with the ANN. Thus {{updateCountForQuota}} should only be called when NN starts?, It appears to be an attempt to self-correct troublesome quota bugs that in the past have crashed secondaries.  I seem to recall secondaries crashing were odd:  you can read an image, always apply edits, write the image, but further attempts to apply edits that violated quotas would crash.  The "fix" was always create a new namesystem for the next checkpoint but I don't think that's feasible for a standby.

I don't like masking bugs so maybe it should never be invoked.  Unless quotas aren't really being computed during edit tailing/replay, in which case updating the quota during a transition to active is more appropriate., It is not just SBN that is being affected. Even ANN will traverse the entire tree and update the quota each time it loads an edit segment on start-up. The only place it is needed is when a NN is transitioning to active. All other use cases of {{loadEdits()}} do not need quota to be updated: {{BackupImage}}/{{BackupNode}}, {{Checkpointer}}, {{EditLogTailer}}.  Quota is used only when serving.  We can simply make {{FSNamesystem}} do it once whenever it transitions to active., \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. The applied patch generated 1 additional checkstyle issues.
There is no additional issue. I've downloaded the two XML (patched, trunk) and diffed. They are identical.

The test failures were caused by a strange error that I cannot reproduce. All failed test cases saw ZipException while loading conf. I do not believe it is related to the patch.

This message was automatically generated., Revised the patch after HDFS-8865. The quota initialization code is moved from {{FSImage}} to {{FSDirectory}}. This is an operation against a directory tree after all.

It was wired to {{FSImage#loadImage()}}, so {{EditLogTailer}} was causing quota initialization every time it checks (default 1 min interval), regardless of whether it replayed any edits or not.  This really only needs to be done when the NN becomes active., Forgot to remove three unused imports from {{FSImage}}. Resubmitting the patch., \\
