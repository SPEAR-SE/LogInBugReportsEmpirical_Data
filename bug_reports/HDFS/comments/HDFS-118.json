[OK, first item, do you want this to be transparent - the API does all the failure handling and restart, or do you want it explicit. 

For anyone who argues in favour of "transparent", I would point them at a a console full of "NFS server not responding still trying" messages, to show that transparency removes flexibility. , Second Q: what network connectivity issues are you expecting? As there are only a subset of them that can be handled. A transient outage on the backbone is very different from the client laptop being suspended, taken home and brought up again outside the VPN., The clients referred to here are RPC clients to the Namenode, such as DataNodes, DFS clients. Currently the client fails all the requests in progress when the {{Connection}} at the IPC layer detects connectivity loss to the server. This loss of connectivity could be a network issue or the server going down. I will add more details next week on the approaches to handle this. Currently this jira has been created as a place holder for addressing this issue., HA!

As in highly available has been added to the NN which helps mitigate this problem.... so closing as fixed.]
