[Fix is simple, hdfs-config.sh was setting HADOOP_PREFIX, while it shouldn't be. 

Looks like this came in with HADOOP-7801. Before this, the setting of HADOOP_PREFIX had no effect.

This message is automatically generated., -failing test is (clearly) independent.
-patch needs review by someone who understands the scripts, I can't reproduce your error on trunk/2.x anymore. This was probably fixed elsewhere, but thank you for the patch! Resolving as Can't Reproduce (anymore).

Thanks again Ivan and Steve.]
