[We should log the error to indicate there is invalid export table entry. Real user can do "showmount" command to find the valid export.

Even with no valid export, shutdown may not be desirable given we may want to introduce a new feature in the future to refresh export table without restarting NFS gateway (HDFS-6459). , I am not sure if this is a valid issue. 'host1-rw' itself is treated as the hostname. Since the hostname and the permissions are not separated by white spaces, it is treated as if permissions are not provided for this hostname. By default, read-only permission is assumed in this case.

Following are relevant comments from NfsExports.java:

{code}
/**
   * Loading a matcher from a string. The default access privilege is read-only.
   * The string contains 1 or 2 parts, separated by whitespace characters, where
   * the first part specifies the client hosts, and the second part (if
   * existent) specifies the access privilege of the client hosts. I.e.,
   *
   * "client-hosts [access-privilege]"
   */
{code} 

The fix for HDFS-6455 shall log an error for invalid exports, like invalid separators. , NFS server also fail to parse valid host name string in dfs.nfs.exports.allowed.hosts property.

{noformat}
<property><name>dfs.nfs.exports.allowed.hosts</name><value>101.101.101.01#rw</value></property>
{noformat}

Here, # is used as separator. Hostname must not have # in it. NFS server should be able to validate host name correctly. It needs to parse for "<Valid hostname> <ro/rw>"

, Both comments from [~abutala] and [~yeshavora] make sense.

So, basically, the actually problem is "NFS should print error when there is no valid export" regardless the cause (e.g., invalid hostname string, empty value, ...). , Ok got it. Thanks for the feedback [~brandonli] and [~yeshavora], I shall work on the fix shortly., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
