Seems harmless at the moment but need to debug., I dont think this is harmless. We should find out whats the issue here., No, Mahadev is right, this is not harmless.  The interesting part of the log is:

{{Couldn't setup connection for <RM principal>/<RMhostname>@<REALM>  to *null*}}

There was a similar issue with the JHS where the "to null" error occurred when the service protocol wasn't correctly defined., I am willing to take a look at this.  How easy is this to reproduce?  Do I just need to start running map/reduce jobs, and it starts to show up eventually?  Do these need to be long running jobs? From what I have seen some of the renewal code has hard coded values to renew once a day, but I could be wrong., From looking at the code there appear to be a few different possibilities here.

# the protocol class is null.
# SecurityUtil.securityInfoProviders is some how not loading the AnnotatedSecurityInfo class.
# the protocol class is not annotated correctly.
# the key returned by the annotation is not set.

One and Three seem very unlikely, because that code has worked before.  Two also seems very unlikely because the AnnotatedSecurityInfo class and the config file for the ServiceLoader is in the same jar as SecurityUtils itself.  Found also seems unlikely because the NodeManagers would in theory use the same config and are able to talk to the NN, but this is the most likely culprit.  Especially because the RM really does not interact with HDFS at all except here to renew tokens, so if it were misconfigured then the rest of the RM could keep working just fine.

@Ramya,

Could you please verify that the following is set in your resource manager configuration "dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal", bq. How easy is this to reproduce? Do I just need to start running map/reduce jobs, and it starts to show up eventually? Do these need to be long running jobs? 
You just need to start MR jobs and it starts showing up. They dont need to be long running. 

bq. Could you please verify that the following is set in your resource manager configuration "dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal"
Verified and it is correctly set in the RM configs., OK I am seeing it in our clusters too, and I have also verified the configuration.  I will dig into this a bit more and see what I can come up with., Sorry I have been dealing with other things that have come up, and only now was I able to get back to this issue.

I have added some debug statements to the Security Utils, and indeed the config option dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal is coming back as null.  This does not mean that it is not set.  I grepped through the configs and found it set in hdfs-site.xml.  I need to see if there is something about the RM that it is not loading this resource, or what. , Yes, the issue is with the default HDFS resources not being loaded by the RM.  When I added the following to SecurityUtil.java, just as a hack to test this.

{code}
  static {
    // adds the default HDFS resources
    Configuration.addDefaultResource("hdfs-default.xml");
    Configuration.addDefaultResource("hdfs-site.xml");
  }
{code}

it worked.

I will try to track down where the proper place is to add a reference to HdfConfiguration where the confs are loaded., OK So the issue is that Tokens and Renewal of the tokens has been abstracted away so much that the RM has no direct reference to HDFS at all.  The DFSClient.Renewer is loaded using a ServiceLoader and there is no reference to HdfsConfiguration from DFSClient.Renewer.  The best I can think of is to create a static method in HdfsConfiguration that is a noop, but documents what is happening, and have it called from DFSClient.Renewer.  Without the method we run the risk of having someone clean up code that is not needed and have these things go away., Hmmm, 
 This is very interesting. Would making the Renewer non static work? 
, This patch was manually tested on a secure cluster and it does fix the issue.  Unit tests would be very hard to write as it has to deal with configuration and the classpath to make it work., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Just fair warning that I think the patch is kind of ugly.  I don't like calling an empty method to fix the issue, but I really don't want to change how these resources are loaded, because it would probably result in a much larger patch., @Mahadev,

The Renewer is already static.  The issue is that the Renewer code has no direct interaction with HdfsConfiguration.  Just an include is not enough to ensure that java will load the class and run the static block.  In the past, and in most other locations the HDFS Client would create an instance of HDFSConfiguration to access any configuration values.  This would force it to load, but because the RM does not interact with HDFS at all, except to renew and cancel tokens that interaction with HdfsConfiguration must be on the execution path of the Renewer., Sorry I misread your comment.  The Renewer has to be static or it cannot be loaded through the ServiceLoader. , HdfsConfiguration#init is already there which is noop.
I will recommend just adding a static initializer to Renewer that calls HdfsConfiguration#init., You are correct about the init method.  I did not see it there and there is no point in creating a new noop method thanks for catching that.  I will also change calling that method to be be part of a static initializer., Canceling patch to address the issues., Comments have been addressed and the code is much smaller then before.  I am still doing manual tests to ensure that this too fixes the issue, but I assume that it will so I am uploading the patch now., I have now also manually verified that this patch fixes the renewal issue as well., -1 overall.
