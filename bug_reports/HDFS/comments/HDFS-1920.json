Console output: https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/501//console

This message is automatically generated., No tests included because this change just fixes a build failure. Manually verified that x86-64 builds unchanged (-m64 is properly specified) and that ARM now builds (-m32 is not specified).

Core unit test failures are existing and unrelated issues. This change only affects libhdfs.

Would a committer please review the change?, +1  looks good.  (I also verified that x64 libhdfs still builds/runs)., I've committed this to trunk. Thanks Trevor!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #693 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/693/])
