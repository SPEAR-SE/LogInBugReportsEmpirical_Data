This message is automatically generated., Thanks for reassigning this, atm.  I fat-fingered the "assign to me" button., With regard Jenkins output: to the I don't think tests are needed for this, since it purely changes a log message.

Looks good to me., Patch looks pretty good to me. One suggestion: instead of "Please _add_ more resources" I recommend we change the message text to "Please _add or free_ more resources." Specifically, this message usually indicates that the NN is low on local disk space, so it's unlikely they'll actually be able to hot swap in _more_ resources, and instead will have to delete some stuff. Do folks agree?, Yup, I think that makes more sense.  I'll go ahead and make that change.

Thanks!, New patch implementing Aaron's recommended changes., +1 pending Jenkins., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
