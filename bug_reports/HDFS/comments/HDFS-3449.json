[Are you running this with an old version of JUnit on the classpath or something? Or is the test not JUnit 4? The JUnit runner is supposed to catch AssumptionViolatedException and treat it as a skipped test, not a failed test., Hi Todd, I ran it by "mvn test -Dtest=TestFileCreation".  Does it pass for you?

I think the problem may be due to incompatibility between junit.framework.TestCase and org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue.  Not sure why it suddenly fails today.  Did we change junit version recently?
, Looks like this was fixed in HDFS-3966 (For branch-1, TestFileCreation should use JUnit4 to make assumeTrue work)., Thanks.  Resolving this as a duplicate of HDFS-3966.]
