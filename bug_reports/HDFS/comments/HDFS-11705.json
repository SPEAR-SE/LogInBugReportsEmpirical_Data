[I think it is related to HDFS-10797., This issue still persists even after reverting HDFS-10797 and HDFS-11515., Since the revert of HDFS-10797, I started working on 2.8 optimizations to reduce object allocation rates in content summary and quota calcs.  I noticed and have been debugging this same problem.]
