I think we should still do it, at least for consistency with other commands. We don't disable dfs.permissions when you have Kerberos turned off, even though it is trivially sidestepped as you describe., Yes, consistency is good, and I think it's worth doing.  My reply was intended to address "This is problematic because the non-superusers can then process the fsimage for contents the user should not have access to".  With security disabled, there really is no such thing as "contents the user should not have access to" when all it takes is setting an env.]
