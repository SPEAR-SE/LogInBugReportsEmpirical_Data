{panel}, We can check whether a responder is running, but it may be in the process of shutting down. Therefore, a proper check requires additional locking. Alternatively, we can simply catch any {{Throwable}} and ignore, so that the shutdown thread can complete the rest of the process. Since the out of band messaging is advisory, this is acceptable, IMO., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Attached is a patch for branch 2.6. This was a trivial backport. I ran TestDataNodeExit and it passed., [~sjlee0] backported this to 2.6.1. I just pushed the commit to 2.6.1 after running compilation and TestDataNodeExit which changed in the patch., Hi [~kihwal] [~eepayne] ,
thanks for the effort fixing this issue. I just started Hadoop development recently and I am reviewing this issue. It looks to me that catching Throwable and ignore it may cause other issues, for example, ignoring a OOME can be pretty bad. How able adding a warning message after catching Throwable? It would be great if you could elaborate on this.

Thank you, Hi [~kihwal] and [~eepayne],

Thanks for your earlier work here.

It seems helpful to add a WARN message with e's info when Throwable is caught below. Would you please comment? Thanks much.

{code}
+      try {
+        xserver.sendOOBToPeers();
+        ((DataXceiverServer) this.dataXceiverServer.getRunnable()).kill();
+        this.dataXceiverServer.interrupt();
+      } catch (Throwable e) {
+        // Ignore, since the out of band messaging is advisory.
+      }
{code}
, FYI [~kihwal] and [~eepayne], 

[~jojochuang] created HDFS-9181, w.r.t the question I asked above. Appreciate if you could comment in that jira. Thanks.
