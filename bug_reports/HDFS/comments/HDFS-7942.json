[The regular expression is wrong. Instead of "206.190.52.[26|23]", it should be "206.190.52.(26|23)'.
However, the grouping expression "( )" is not recognized by NfsExports class., Uploaded a patch to support grouping in nfs.exports.allowed.hosts., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Does it need to include other escape characters, such as +, -, etc.?, "+, -" is not expected to be used frequently in hostname or ip address. But I could be very wrong here. I just didn't figure out a good way to decide if a string has regular expressing., Here is the explanation for wildcard usage in export table.(http://linux.die.net/man/5/exports)
{noformat}
wildcards
+Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and ?, or may contain character class lists within [square 
brackets]. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *.cs.foo.edu matches all hosts in 
the domain cs.foo.edu. As these characters also match the dots in a domain name, the given pattern will also 
match all hosts within any subdomain of cs.foo.edu.
{noformat}

Since NFS Gateway uses java regular expression, the usage of wildcards is a bit different. For example,
{noformat}
1. instead of "*.cs.foo.edu", one should use "\\w*.cs.foo.edu"
2. instead of "206.190.52.[26|23]", one should use "206.190.52.(26|23)"
{noformat}
I will update the user guide accordingly., The patch looks good to me. +1

In the meanwhile, looks like our parse semantic will be slightly different from the traditional one. Maybe we can handle it as future work., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
