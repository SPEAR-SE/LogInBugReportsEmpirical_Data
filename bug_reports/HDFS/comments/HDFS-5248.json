[Attaching a patch for branch-1.2

Will upload the patch for trunk soon., I guess there might be a place calling ugi.doAs or like that in the callers of putFSImage(). If so, perhaps there adding the checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab() call might work with minimized change. HADOOP-9797 is working on something that does such job automatically. For ugi logined from keytab or ticket cache, it has choice to be automatically renewed., The direct caller doesn't do the doAs. The doAs is made during the initialization.  Refactoring it will be a good idea , but involves more code changes.]
