This message is automatically generated., Thanks a lot for the reviews, Todd and Chris. I'm fairly confident that the test failure is unrelated - that test has been failing intermittently pretty frequently lately.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks again for the reviews, Todd and Chris., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3658 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3658/])
