[I find the cause, but still don't know why.

I stopped the firewall on Host3, and then restarted the hdfs on docker3. Everything goes fine. So the problem is because of the firewall.

I established a VPN server on host3, using the firewall to forward requests. I opened all the ports on host3.
This is the configuration of the firewall:

 $ firewall-cmd --list-all
public (active)
  target: default
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: eno1
  sources:
  services: dhcpv6-client ssh ipsec
  ports: 1-65534/tcp 500/udp 4500/udp 1-65534/udp
  protocols:
  masquerade: yes
  forward-ports:
  source-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:


Please confirm, which configuration affects the register of the data node.]
