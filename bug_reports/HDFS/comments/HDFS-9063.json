[Upload a patch to fix the issue. In the patch I add an extra parameter for {{INode#computeContentSummary}} to indicate the snapshot id of the path. In the meanwhile, the snapshot diff list size is no longer included in the computation result. This can bring minor incompatibility but is consistent with the change in HDFS-7728., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~jingzhao] for working on this.  Jenkins' report has issue, {{TestGetContentSummaryWithSnapshot}} can pass locally.

I also found similar issue (not the same, but also problem of getContentSummary if there is snapshot) when writing tests for large directory in HDFS-9053, it also exists in current trunk.  I apply your patch, the issue I saw is still there.
I think you can fix the issue too and write test of following steps to reproduce the issue I found (Of course if you don't want to fix it, I can do it separately :)):
# Suppose we have a directory named 'dir', create 16 files in the dir
# remove the last 1 file  -- now total 15 files in dir
# create a snapshot 's1' of dir
# add 1 file in dir -- now total 16 files in dir
# remove the first 1 file in dir -- now total 15 files in the dir
# call getContentSummary(dir), and then {{getFileCount}}.  -- the expected result is 15, but the return is 16., Thanks Yi! {{getContentSummary(dir's current path)}} should include (all the current files/directories) + (all the deleted files/directories but still in snapshots). Thus in the above case, the return value 16 in step 6 is correct: we have 15 files in the current dir, and the original first file in dir/.snapshot/s1., The test failures look suspicious. I just triggered the Jenkins again., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks Jing for the explanation, I think I missed the fact that {{getContentSummary}} also counts the files in snapshot., +1, thanks Jing.
I check the patch, now if {{getContentSummary}} on snapshot path, only content in snapshot is counted. , BTW, you can cleanup the checkstyle while committing if no other people have comments. Thanks., Thanks for the review, Yi! I will commit the patch shortly (and also fix the 2 checkstyle warnings)., I've committed the patch into trunk and branch-2.

, Hi [~jingzhao],

I am seeing a difference in behavior on the {{Count}} command before and after this fix. {{Count}} command used to account for {{.snapshot}} directory, but after this fix, _numDirs_ from Count command is less than expected as it is not including the {{.snapshot}} directory. Is the change in behavior intended ? Please clarify.



, [~manojg], the patch fixed a bug and did not change the semantic of {{du}} command. Before the patch, files that were created outside of a snapshot could be included when calculating the count/usage of the snapshot. The patch fixed this bug and there is such an example in the description.

For your case, maybe HDFS-8986 is the one related? Which Hadoop version are you using?, [~jingzhao],

Attached a test case which shows the change in behavior after HDFS-9063 fix.  

Test does the following:
1. Count dirs, files in a directory /foo
2. Allow and take snapshot of the directory /foo
3. Count dirs, files of the same directory /foo for which snapshot was taken
4. Verify the new_dir_count == 1 + old_dir_count. Because, it should now include {{.snapshot}} directory. This verification fails after HDFS-9063 fix. 

Let me know your thoughts on the test and the expected behavior., Attached test fails on the latest trunk 3.0.0.alpha2. I didn't see the test passing after reverting HDFS-8986 fix. But test passes after reverting HDFS-9063 fix. Let me know if my understanding is wrong., Ah, I see what you mean. Yes, we have a minor incompatibility here, please see my first comment:
{quote}
In the meanwhile, the snapshot diff list size is no longer included in the computation result. This can bring minor incompatibility but is consistent with the change in HDFS-7728.
{quote}

I.e., since we already have a number in the content summary to indicate the total number of snapshots, the number of snapshots is no longer added into the directory number. To me the old behavior is more like a bug, but we can still mark this jira as incompatible maybe., 
Thanks for looking into this. Thats right, {{ContentSummary}} does have good info about Snapshots and I do feel its better to keep dirCount and snapCount separate. However, the behavior of the {{Count}} command has changed and it would be good to mark this jira as incompatible. , Agree. Added the incompatible label and also updated the release note. Thanks for looking into this, [~manojg]., [~jingzhao],

Tried querying {{ContentSummary}} for the Directory which has snapshots, and still I don't see ContentSummary's {{SnpashotDirectoryCount}} reflecting any snapshots taken. Is there any other way of querying the ContentSummary which will reflect the right Snap Dir Count ? Please clarify.

Output from attached test v002.
{noformat}
ContentSummary: /foo - Dir: 2, SnapDir: 0, SnapFile: 0
ContentSummary: /foo/bar - Dir: 1, SnapDir: 0, SnapFile: 0

ContentSummary: /foo/.snapshot/s2 - Dir: 2, SnapDir: 0, SnapFile: 0
{noformat}, [~jingzhao], 

Did you get a chance to look at the attached test case ? Is there anything wrong with the expectation in the test ? I can file a jira to track this issue, if you also feel snapDir count is not working as expected. Thanks., Hm, I'm a little confused by this comment:
bq. I.e., since we already have a number in the content summary to indicate the total number of snapshots, the number of snapshots is no longer added into the directory number. 
[~jingzhao], could you clarify? 

I have just chatted offline with Manoj. The snapshotXXXX in {{ContentSummary}}, added by HDFS-8986, was to track how many files/directories are created under a snapshot, so that {{count -x}} could exclude them and calculate a result of direct usage. It is *not* tracking how many snapshots have been taken on a directory.

Do we have number of snapshots visible to users? I only found {{SnapshotManager#snapshotCounter}} at the hdfs level, and {{DirectorySnapshottableFeature#getNumSnapshots}} at the dir level - neither seems to be propagating to any shell commands.

My 2 cents are this is will not reasonably impact quotas, so maybe good as-is. Nice to have this displayed too, if users want to get it absolutely accurate. Please share your thoughts, thanks!, Thanks for the clarification [~xiaochen]. I was mistaking {{SnpashotDirectoryCount}} to include snapshot count also. After looking at the code, I see the raw snapshot count is not exposed in {{ContentSummary}} or {{Count}} command.
