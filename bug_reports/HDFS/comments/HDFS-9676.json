[Hi [~drlhome], Can you please give some more details.. like logs, etc., Ok, I execute command “hdfs dfs -D dfs.replication=3 -put $localPath $hdfsPath >> $logfile 2>&1”to catch possible error. I checked $logfile when I found $hdfsPath is empty, but I found nothing. I think the return value of the command has already shown that the command is executed successfully, actually it's failed., Can you check namenode logs?
In fact this seems to be some cluster configuration issue, as this is the basic operation which is not working for you.
May be we can take this on mailing list? If we find any issue, then  you can report issue in Jira., Ok, the previous namenode logs has been flushed and I will check it at the next backup, I would like to be able to find the relevant error log information. thanks]
