{noformat}, Eric, good catch.  Let's use a local variable to store the network location, i.e.
{code}
final String networkLocation = NetworkTopology.getFirstHalf(localMachine.getNetworkLocation());
{code}

This message is automatically generated., The failure of TestBlocksWithNotEnoughRacks is not related.  It does not use BlockPlacementPolicyWithNodeGroup at all., +1 for the patch. We should add a unit test for this., Thanks Suresh for reviewing the patch and thanks Eric for the idea.
