[Patch to remove slf4j dependency.  No unit tests since this is a build change.  Manually verified that the multiple SLF4J binding warning from the hdfs lib path is no longer present with this change., It appears that in the old case, the problem is that slf4j-log4j12 was specified wrong.  It should always be specified as <optional>true</optional> or baring that, <scope>provided</scope> is acceptable but can lead to some multiple binding errors during unit tests (but not deployment).  

It appears that it is not needed at all however -- is this because all of Hadoop is moving away from SLF4J?

This message is automatically generated., It doesn't look like the test failures are related to this change.  The findbugs warning is a known issue in trunk tracked by HDFS-3132., @Scott, I don't know if Hadoop is moving away from SLF4J or not.  I just happened to notice that it's not referenced, and removing the unnecessary dependency seemed like the most straightforward fix to the warning for the copy that's in hadoop/hdfs/lib., +1. I will commit the patch soon., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #2031 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/2031/])
