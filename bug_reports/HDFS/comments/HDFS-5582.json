This message is automatically generated., +1.  Thanks, sathish, Thanks satish. I tested this locally manually, and it seems to work. I just have some nitty requests:

* Please use follow the code style conventions for the new tests, i.e. two space tabs, no trailing whitespace, single space between "Exception{", 80 character max line width. I use this eclipse formatter to do it for me: https://github.com/cloudera/blog-eclipse/blob/master/hadoop-format.xml
* This is optional, but do you mind fixing up the spacing for the help text while we're modifying GetConf? It's ragged right now:

{noformat}
-> % hdfs getconf                      
13/12/30 11:32:00 WARN util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable
hdfs getconf is utility for getting configuration information from the config file.

hadoop getconf 
	[-namenodes]			gets list of namenodes in the cluster.
	[-secondaryNameNodes]			gets list of secondary namenodes in the cluster.
	[-backupNodes]			gets list of backup nodes in the cluster.
	[-includeFile]			gets the include file path that defines the datanodes that can join the cluster.
	[-excludeFile]			gets the exclude file path that defines the datanodes that need to decommissioned.
	[-nnRpcAddresses]			gets the namenode rpc addresses
	[-confKey [key]]			gets a specific key from the configuration
{noformat}, [~andrew.wang], I filed HDFS-5707 to fix the spacing in {{getConf}}.  We could also improve some of the test whitespace in that JIRA., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4937 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4937/])
