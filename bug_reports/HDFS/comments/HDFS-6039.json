[The problem here is that we're mishandling renames. hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal first creates the file in a temporary location. In this case it's /tmp/HDFSAcls/Dir-0/Child_file.COPYING. Then, after creation is successful, it renames to the final destination. The problem is that we copied the default ACL during the initial create, and then we tried to copy it again during the rename, resulting in this Duplicated ACLFeature error., This patch fixes the bug by skipping copy of the default ACL during renames.  This is consistent with the behavior of Linux ACLs.  If you rename an existing file or directory underneath a directory that has a default ACL, then it doesn't copy the default ACL.  The renamed file or directory retains its existing ACL (or plain permissions).

I added 2 new tests in {{FSAclBaseTest}} to cover renames of files and directories.  I also added a CLI test that replicates what Yesha reported.  These tests failed before applying the patch, and then passed afterwards., +1

Verified ACL tests pass with this change. I had to comment out the {{DFSClientShmManager#domainSocketWatcher}} for testing but that is a regression from HDFS-5950 and unrelated to the patch., Thanks for the review, Arpit.  I'll commit this after I get a response from Jenkins., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I'm unable to repro those test failures.  Re-uploading the same patch to try another Jenkins run., The {{TestIncrementalBlockReports}} is almost certainly unrelated to your patch. I added this test recently and haven't yet seen it fail in Jenkins so far but if it happens again I will probably rewrite the test. False positives are annoying., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
