[This problem occasionally causes a failure in {{TestDeleteBlockPool}}.  The client request to delete the block pool races with the block scanner.  Depending on the timing, the verification log file could remain in place, and then deleting the underlying storage fails.  I can reproduce the problem more easily on Windows.
, This patch fixes the problem by shutting down the {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}} any time a block pool gets removed from the scanner via {{DataBlockScanner#removeBlockPool}}.  I ran multiple tests with this patch on Mac and Windows.  I consistently see a pass from {{TestDeleteBlockPool}}, which is what originally made me notice the problem., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

There are no new tests, but this patch is required to get consistent successful runs for {{TestDeleteBlockPool}}.  I ran the test repeatedly with this patch on multiple platforms, and it passed every time.
