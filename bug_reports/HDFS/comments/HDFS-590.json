[This looks good, except you don't need to add a new test, but merely change the rename call in FileSystemContractBaseTest.testRenameNonExistentPath() to 

{code}
    try {
      fs.rename(src, dst);
      fail("Should throw FileNotFoundException.");
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
      // Expected
    }
{code}, This issue is handled as part of HADOOP-6240.]
