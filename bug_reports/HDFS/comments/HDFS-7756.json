[Proposed patch.

In order not to break downstream projects which reorder DatanodeInfo's (such as HBase), I was thinking keeping the method signature for LocatedBlock#getLocations().

The caller to LocatedBlock#getLocations() can do instanceof check on the first element to see if DatanodeInfoWithStorage is returned.

Comment / suggestion is welcome., Alternative patch which restores method signature for LocatedBlock#getLocations(), Rationale for keeping return type intact is that DatanodeInfoWithStorage deals with implementation detail.
It should not be directly referenced by downstream projects., +1 for the v2 patch, pending Jenkins., I did the following:
