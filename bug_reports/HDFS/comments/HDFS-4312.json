This message is automatically generated., The last test failure seems to be caused by the test flakiness or other reasons not related to the patch., This needs to be rebased using hadoop-minikdc., Test remade with MiniKdc.
Also the patch removes "startKdc" profile from pom, since it is not needed any more., See also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5410 : it makes org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/datanode/TestStartSecureDataNode work on MiniKdc., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
