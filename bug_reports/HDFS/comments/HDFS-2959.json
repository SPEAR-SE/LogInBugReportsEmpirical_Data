[Here we have 3 translator classes currently.
NameNodeProtocolTranslatorPB, ClientNamenodeProtocolTranslatorPB and DatanodeProtocolClientSideTranslatorPB.

This will be mostly refactoring work from DFSUtil and this translators. I will address all of them under this JIRA., Thanks, Uma. Note that I took care of several of these in HDFS-2958., Yes Aaron, Looks you have cleaned many of the things what I am thinking here. I missed your patch.
I will clean the remaining stuff as part of this JIRA.]
