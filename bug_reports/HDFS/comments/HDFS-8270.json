[I would like to take up this issue
Please let me know if you are already started on this, [~andreina] please, do it. I didn't start it yet., Thanks [~octo47]. Iam assigning the issue to me. Will soon update the patch., I think we can use HDFS-6697 to make the lease soft and hard limits configurable, and make retry times configurable as well., Thanks [~jingzhao] for your suggestion.

*But I have one doubt on this issue:*

     In NonHA, If client tries to create the same file, which is already exists and open, then NameNode was throwing already being created exception immediately. For NonHA case, Retry policy was added to retry 5 times, each time after 60 sec(SOFT_LEASE_TIMEOUT).

    However this retry was not working until HDFS-6478 fixed this.

    This led to behavior change and call will retry upto 5 min, before failing.
Due to this downstream projects are facing issues. HBase reported it in HDFS-8270.

*Now my doubt is*,  Is retry of upto 5 mins (or a configurable retry time ) for AlreadyBeingCreatedException is really necessary in NonHA case?
Whether waiting for a create operation failure is correct?

, This behaviour is only with NonHA. In HA it wont retry for {{AlreadyBeingCreatedException}}.

I see it strange. Retry for 5 min,. thats really not acceptable.

IMHO, by changing the SOFT_LEASE_TIMEOUT and and number of retries although we just working around this problem, but also changing the lease behaviour itself.
If this configurations changed only in client side to small value ( ex: 200ms), Same exception will be thrown as Lease still exists at NN. 

Why to keep this behaviour change only in case of Non-HA?

Any thoughts?
, I'd remove that at all.
I think that this retries can be useful in case of dead client holding lease,
so I think the idea was to wait to be sure, that file really not exists anymore.

But it seems should be userlevel implementation, not hdfs level, we should
refuse file creation immediately., Hi [~umamaheswararao] you have thoughts about this?, Attached an initial patch. 
Please review and provide feedback., \\

This message was automatically generated., Seems like default retries also got removed. 
Client is not retrying for even connect exceptions.

Just following changes will do IMO

in NameNodeProxies#createNNProxyWithClientProtocol(..) inside {{withRetries}} if block, do the below changes. Let everything else be same.
{code}     if (withRetries) { // create the proxy with retries
 
-      RetryPolicy createPolicy = RetryPolicies
-          .retryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(5,
-              HdfsServerConstants.LEASE_SOFTLIMIT_PERIOD, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
-    
-      Map<Class<? extends Exception>, RetryPolicy> remoteExceptionToPolicyMap 
-                 = new HashMap<Class<? extends Exception>, RetryPolicy>();
-      remoteExceptionToPolicyMap.put(AlreadyBeingCreatedException.class,
-          createPolicy);
-
-      RetryPolicy methodPolicy = RetryPolicies.retryByRemoteException(
-          defaultPolicy, remoteExceptionToPolicyMap);
       Map<String, RetryPolicy> methodNameToPolicyMap 
                  = new HashMap<String, RetryPolicy>();
-    
-      methodNameToPolicyMap.put("create", methodPolicy);
 
       ClientProtocol translatorProxy =
         new ClientNamenodeProtocolTranslatorPB(proxy);
{code}, This came up on the dev lists. Did a quick scan. Seems like HDFS-6478 which broke the functionality went into 2.6.0. Given that, I don't this should block 2.7.1, but if you can get it in in a day or two, I'm all good., Totally agree this retry logic should not be hardcoded inside of the proxy creation code. The only concern is whether directly removing this retry may break some existing applications which depend on this retry. If yes we may have to make this retry configurable and by default we enable it., bq.  The only concern is whether directly removing this retry may break some existing applications which depend on this retry.
I agree with you. But, till HDFS-6478 was in, this retry was not working AFAIK, and only after this real issue of waiting for long time started showing up. I will re-confirm again anyway. In that case I don't think removing would be problem to existing applications.
, Yes, before HDFS-6478, retry for create() on AlreadyBeingCreatedException was not working. So we can go ahead and remove the retry IMO., Hi [~andreina], 
In the patch, Instead of removing all retries, need to remove retries for only method-exception. Default retries should be there to retry on connect exceptions / namenode restart cases.

So following changes in would be enough in NameNodeProxies.java.
{code}@@ -442,22 +440,9 @@ private static ClientProtocol createNNProxyWithClientProtocol(
 
     if (withRetries) { // create the proxy with retries

         new ClientNamenodeProtocolTranslatorPB(proxy);
       return (ClientProtocol) RetryProxy.create({code}

Other changes in other files is fine. I think you can also remove the configuration key from DFSConfigKeys.java as its nowhere used after the patch., Thanks all for the review comments. 
[~vinayrpet] , I have updated the patch as per your suggestion.
Please review the patch., +1, LGTM

Will wait for others to give their opinion before commit.

Yeah, I also confirmed with [~vikram.dixit] about Hive. +1 for removing this retry., Latest patch looks good to me. 
Checkstyle is related to file length.

Committing soon., Thanks [~jingzhao] for the confirmation., Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7

Thanks [~andreina] for taking up the issue and contributing the fix.
Thanks [~jingzhao], [~octo47] for discussions.

, This was marked as committed in 2.6.1 but it wasn't actually in the 2.6.1 branch. Presumably because it got committed to 2.6 and by that time I already created the 2.6.1 branch.

I just pushed the fix to the right 2.6.1 branch. Ran compilation and TestFileCreation before the push.]
