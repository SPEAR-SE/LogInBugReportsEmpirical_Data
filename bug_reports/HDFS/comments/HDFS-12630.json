[May be dup of {{HDFS-11797}}/{{HDFS-11445}} ?, Thanks, [~shahrs87].
HDFS-11797 and HDFS-11445 appear to be similar but it doesn't seem they are exactly the same case as this instance. The cluster where we found this issue is running a Cloudera CDH 5.12.1 (version hadoop-2.6.0-cdh5.12.1), which [already has the fix for HDFS-11445|http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/cdh/5/hadoop-2.6.0-cdh5.12.1.CHANGES.txt].

I tried to reproduce the issue by following the steps in HDFS-11445 but was not able to reproduce it., [~shahrs87], I just noted that the HDFS-11445 patch was added to hadoop-2.6.0-cdh5.12.1 but later reverted. So it may still be the same issue.
However, I'm having problems to reproduce the issue following the steps mentioned on HDFS-11445. Any help with more specific steps would be appreciated., [~asdaraujo] it's more likely to reproduce with unit tests.
I'm pretty sure this is HDFS-11445, given the symptom and that a FBR get rid of the symptom. So I'll close it as a dup. Feel free to reopen if it's not the case.]
