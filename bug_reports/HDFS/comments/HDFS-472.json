Thanks., 1. revised some sentences according to kan's comments. 
2. added client-configuration part., forrest patch. Including 4 .jpg diagrams.
, Thanks for writing such thorough documentation. A few nits:
* The "advantages" and "disadvantages" in the comparison w/ H(S)FTP could be formatted more clearly in a list or table.
* 6.6.1 and 6.6.2 are missing a line break before the "ant clean tar" shell command
* There are several occurrences of "Ip address" (e.g. 4.2.2 sub 3) that should read "IP address"
* Why are dfs.block.size and io.file.buffer.size important parameters for the proxy?
* -There are three "hdfsproxy-default.xml" tables and all tables are labeled "Table 1"- (the structure is much clearer in the HTML rendering than in the PDF; looks like a forrest quirk)
* Has someone unfamiliar with the details of the project successfully configured an instance of HDFS proxy from this documentation?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Chris,
Thanks for the comments. I uploaded the new patch.

* The "advantages" and "disadvantages" in the comparison w/ H(S)FTP could be formatted more clearly in a list or table.
    --> yes. I listed them.
* 6.6.1 and 6.6.2 are missing a line break before the "ant clean tar" shell command
   --> good catch. I corrected a couple more.
* There are several occurrences of "Ip address" (e.g. 4.2.2 sub 3) that should read "IP address"
  --> changed
* Why are dfs.block.size and io.file.buffer.size important parameters for the proxy?
  --> They are not crucial to the functionality of proxy. Fine tuning these parameters could affect the transfer performance to some degree. This should have been documented in hdfs-client. 
* -There are three "hdfsproxy-default.xml" tables and all tables are labeled "Table 1"- (the structure is much clearer in the HTML rendering than in the PDF; looks like a forrest quirk)
--> seems <caption> tag inside <table> block is causing the problem. Replaced it with <strong> out of the <table> block. Now all look the same in HTML and PDF.
* Has someone unfamiliar with the details of the project successfully configured an instance of HDFS proxy from this documentation?
--> I did that. But maybe not fair since I am relatively familiar with it., +1 The latest version looks good.

Would it make sense to update the README as part of this issue? Even if it only briefly summarizes what the project does and refers the reader to the forrest documentation, that would likely be more helpful than docs for a previous version of the proxy., changed README file, (only change is to README, so the previous doc +1 from Hudson should be good)
