[A write request to DN will first check for a disk volume with available space then proceeds to create a rbw file on it. The 'check disk error' is triggered when the rbw file can not be created. But if a volume with sufficient space could not be found, the request just throws an exception without initiating 'check disk error'. This is reasonable to expect because if there is no space available on any volume, DN may still be able to service read requests, so 'not enough space' is not a sufficient condition for DN shutdown. However, if after this condition all the volumes happen to become faulty, a subsequent read request will detect this condition and shutdown DN anyway. Therefore there is no need to fix this behavior., Hi Srikanth ,

	Thanks for checking this jira. 

	I agree with your point . On next read request volume failure will be detected and DN  will get shutdown. 

	But until the next read request DN will be considered as healthy eventhough all volumes configured are faulty , write failure happened and exception thrown during directory scanning . 

	Can we add a disk failure check , if there is any exception during directory scanning. In this case if the number of faulty volumes is greater than "dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated" , then after directory scanning DN will get shutdown.

	I have uploaded a patch with above changes. Please review and let me know your comments. , Thanks [~andreina] for the patch.
bq. Can we add a disk failure check , if there is any exception during directory scanning. In this case if the number of faulty volumes is greater than "dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated" , then after directory scanning DN will get shutdown.
This is good point. This would help in early detection of the disk failure.
