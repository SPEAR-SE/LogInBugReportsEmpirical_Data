The meta header might be unnecessary. IE might work if you make sure that the {{DOCTYPE}} header occur first. Therefore it seems to me that moving the license headers around might be a better solution.

Can you please verify whether the proposed approach works? I cannot do it myself because I don't have a machine that runs IE 8 / 9. Thanks., Yes [~wheat9],
