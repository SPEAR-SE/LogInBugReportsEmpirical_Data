[Thanks [~shihaoliang] for reporting the issue. I added a unit test based on the repro steps but cannot repro it. I will take a look if you can post a unit test that reproduces the issue., Currently I can not reproduce this in UT, only in my cluster. I will check whether it can be produced in trunk ., Currently I can not reproduce this in UT, only in my cluster. I will check whether it can be produced in trunk ., Currently I can not reproduce this in UT, only in my cluster. I will check whether it can be produced in trunk ., Can I work on this issue?. I am able to reproduce this and I got the root cause., Little change in the scenario, before putting the file in directory first set the storage policy for directory.

*Root Cause*

	When we will add edit log for new file, we will get the storage policy from {{INodeFile}} by {{getStoragePolicyID()}}.
	{code}
	 AddOp op = AddOp.getInstance(cache.get())
	....................
	....................
        .setStoragePolicyId(newNode.getStoragePolicyID());
	{code}

	but this API will return the parent policy If file storagepolicy is UNSPECIFIED.

	{code}
        public byte getStoragePolicyID() {
            byte id = getLocalStoragePolicyID();
            if (id == BLOCK_STORAGE_POLICY_ID_UNSPECIFIED) {
               return this.getParent() != null ?this.getParent().getStoragePolicyID() : id;
            }
            return id;
        }
	{code}

	So in edits log create file will store parent storage policy.


*Fix*
	We should use {{INodeFile.getLocalStoragePolicyID()}}, it will give the current INodeFile storage policy, Attached patch with fix and test. Please review.., Changed Severity to *Major* because NN storing wrong edit info.., \\

, [~sjlee0] backported this to 2.6.1, making minor changes to make it work with 2.6.1.

I just pushed the commit to 2.6.1 after running compilation and TestBlockStoragePolicy which changed in the patch., Just pulled this into branch-2.7 (release 2.7.2) as it already exists in 2.6.1.

branch-2 patch applies cleanly for the most part, had to fix one very minor merge conflict in the test-case. Ran compilation and TestBlockStoragePolicy before the push.]
