This message is automatically generated., if you can rebase the patch and resubmit it I'll have a look and get it in, Here the new patch from the trunk:
i used openJDK 1.7 : java version "1.7.0_55"

patch created with :
git diff --no-prefix trunk > ../hadoop-patches/HDFS-4629-1.patch



, i added into the pach HDFS-4626-1 an update for hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/pom.xml
to add a depency to get the package org.apache.xml.serialize

+   <groupId>xerces</groupId>
+   <artifactId>xercesImpl</artifactId>
+   <version>2.9.0</version>

This message is automatically generated., No, there wasn't a dependency on xerces .

With IBM JVM the build works fine without xerces dependency in the pom.xml

But by using OpenJDK
i have got the following errors :
[ERROR] /home/pascal/patchI/hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/tools/offlineEditsViewer/XmlEditsVisitor.java:[33,31]
 error: package org.apache.xml.serialize does not exist
 [ERROR] /home/pascal/patchI/hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/tools/offlineEditsViewer/XmlEditsVisitor.java:[55,4] error: cannot find symbol
[ERROR]   symbol:   class OutputFormat
  location: class XmlEditsVisitor

And by adding :
+ <groupId>xerces</groupId>
 + <artifactId>xercesImpl</artifactId>
 + <version>2.9.0</version>
 + </dependency>

The build passed successfully with the both JVM : IBM and OpenJDK

To test the patch, I used :
mvn compile ; mvn test -fn
There is no new functionnality delivered on that patch, so i used the existing tests.
, # the declaration of the xerces lib version MUST go into {{hadoop-project/pom.xml}}; all JAR version logic goes in there to avoid inconsistencies
# is is going to add yet-another-dependency.
# we may need this import with java 9 anyway, as com.sun is potentially going to be inaccessible.
, I added in the new patch : HDFS-4629-2.patch : the xerces dependency into hadoop-project/pom.xml and
i udpated xercesImpl version to 2.9.1, I tested successfully  HDFS-4629-2.patch with
the both JVM : openJDK 1.7 : java version "1.7.0_55" and JVM IBM J9 VM JRE 1.7.0 
, Looks good
