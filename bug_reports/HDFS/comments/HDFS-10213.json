[Hi, [~wyukawa], can you use fsck {{[-list-corruptfileblocks}} to check whether the result has expected corrupt/missing block or not. There are two different logic to check the corrupt/missing block in cmd {{fsck <path> --list-corruptfileblocks}} and just {{fsck <path>}}. I think the fsck cmd with param {{-list-corruptfileblocks}} would be accurate. And maybe we can adjust the logic of checking corrupt/missing block in fsck <path> the same to cmd with param {{-list-corruptfileblocks}}., Thank you for comment. I'll check it out.

but I think that this is a strange situation.

There is a corrupt/missing block report.

but, a few minitutes later, There is no corrupt/missing block report.

It's weird..., [~wyukawa] I think this other JIRA is be relevant: [HDFS-8533]  I've seen the same behavior and I think there's a discrepancy between JMX and {{fsck}}. If you think the other JIRA matches what you see, please merge the JIRA :), Thank you for your comment.

Actually, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-10213 seems to be  related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8533 

So, I resolved this issue as duplicate
, Although I try to use "hadoop fsck / -list-corruptfileblocks" when there is a corrupt/missing block report, result is "The filesystem under path '/' has 0 CORRUPT files"]
