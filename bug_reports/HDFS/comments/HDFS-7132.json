[The -metadataVersion subcommand does not actually create a NameNode instance. This means that suffixed config params like DFS_NAMENODE_NAME_DIR_KEY do not get initialized.

This patch causes the -metadataVersion to call NameNode.initializeGenericKeys. It also modifies TestMetadataVersion to cover this case., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
