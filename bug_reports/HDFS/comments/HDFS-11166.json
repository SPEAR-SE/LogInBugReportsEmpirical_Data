[HDFS-11156 will change the format of the GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS output, will add doc after HDFS-11156 is done., Hi [~cheersyang], looking at GetOpParam, there's this comment:

{noformat}
    /** GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS is a private unstable op. */
    GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS(false, HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK),
{noformat}

So, I think it's intentional that GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS wasn't originally described in the documentation.

[~szetszwo], given that we rely so heavily on WebHDFS for cross-version compatibility, is GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS now effectively a stable API, and we should update this comment?, In [HDFS-11156], we add a new op {{GETFILEBLOCKLOCATIONS}} to WebHDFS REST API; and new users should use that one which follows the file system API. The output of {{GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS}} is untouched. That being said, perhaps motivation of this JIRA changes. I think we can add the doc for {{GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS}} in {{branch-2.7}} through {{trunk}} branches; and also mark it as {{deprecated}}., GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS is similar to our internal client-server APIs, like NamenodeProtocol. I don't think it belongs in user docs (we don't doc our other internal protocols). I also don't think we should deprecate it, unless there are plans to remove its usage internally.

One good change though would be to update that private/unstable comment to instead say private/stable, since it has compatibility implications, and has been unchanged for a while., private/stable change only makes more sense to me. Thanks,, Hello [~liuml07], [~andrew.wang]

I uploaded a patch to add documents for GETFILEBLOCKLOCATIONS, since like what has been discussed GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS is a private API, I will not add any doc in public. So I modified the comment for GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS in the v6 patch of HDFS-11156 like following

{code}
 /**
  * GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS is a private/stable API op. It returns a
  * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.LocatedBlocks}
  * json object.
 */
 GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS(false, HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK),
{code}

This ticket will be used to track pure doc changes. Hope it makes sense., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, I can also have a look at next week. If [~ajisakaa] can review, that will be great. Thanks,, Sure thanks [~liuml07] and [~ajisakaa], As HDFS-11156 is not committed, can we merge this issue with HDFS-11156?, v7 patch in HDFS-11156 includes the patch in this issue. Closing this.]
