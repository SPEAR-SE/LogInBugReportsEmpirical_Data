[Patch attached.  The core of the fix is here:

{code}
-      InetSocketAddress nnSocketAddress = (InetSocketAddress) context
-          .getAttribute(NameNodeHttpServer.NAMENODE_ADDRESS_ATTRIBUTE_KEY);
-      String nnaddr = nnSocketAddress.getAddress().getHostAddress() + ":"
-          + nnSocketAddress.getPort();
-
+      String nnaddr = NetUtils.getHostPortString(nn.getNameNodeAddress());
{code}

NAMENODE_ADDRESS_ATTRIBUTE_KEY contains the http bind address, it should never be used to create a NN rpc connection, I've removed it entirely. Eg DfsServlet#createNameNodeProxy is always called from w/in the NN, think this is dead code. Looks like this was introduced in HDFS-1709., Forgot to mention, I verified that with this change the links under "Node" now work on the web UI (no more InvalidProtocolBufferException exception) because they're getting passed the NN RPC address now instead of the Http address., This was broken by HDFS-2617, which changed the following:
{code}
-          httpServer.setAttribute(NAMENODE_ADDRESS_ATTRIBUTE_KEY,
-              nn.getNameNodeAddress());
+    httpServer.setAttribute("name.node.address", bindAddress);
{code}, Here's a minimal fix.

Per the previous change I  think we can probably do away with name.node.address entirely and always use NameNodeHttpServer.getNameNodeFromContext since we always create NN proxies from within the NN. Perhaps better to do as a separate change., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
