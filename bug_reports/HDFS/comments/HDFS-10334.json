[Thanks [~xiaobingo] for reporting the test failures.
Please see HDFS-10260 for Rushabh's patch for TestFsDatasetImpl#testCleanShutdownOfVolume, Thanks [~jojochuang] for the updates. I did a search, there a bunch of JIRAs related to testHFlushInterrupted failure.
HDFS-2043, HDFS-3041 and HDFS-4504, So this can be closed right..?  HDFS-2043 and HDFS-10260 will track these failures..]
