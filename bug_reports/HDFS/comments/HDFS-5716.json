Minor: it would be nice to add some comments to the unit test testWebHdfsAuthFilter()., Thanks Brandon for the review. The v2 patch addresses Brandon's comment., {noformat}+    // getFileStatus() is supposed to pass through with the default filter.{noformat}
Here, getFileStatus() should fail or pass?, {quote}Here, getFileStatus() should fail or pass?{quote}
It should pass with default filter but fail with the test filter.
