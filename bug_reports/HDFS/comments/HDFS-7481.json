This message is automatically generated., Hi, Vinay.  Thank you for picking this up.  Sorry if I wasn't clear earlier, but I was actually thinking the message would append just the + indicator for an ACL, not a larger text message.  This would be consistent with the user experience of the shell printing + in the output of {{ls}}., oh ok got it, will update it soon, Updated., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch.  Thanks, [~vinayrpet]!

bq. -1 tests included. The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.

This patch is only changing an exception message, so I think additional tests are unnecessary.

bq. -1 findbugs. The patch appears to introduce 287 new Findbugs (version 2.0.3) warnings.

This is unrelated.  Nothing was flagged for {{FSPermissionChecker}}.

bq. -1 core tests. The patch failed these unit tests in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs:

This was an unrelated test timeout, and also a known issue with the tests needing a bit more heap after the switch to running pre-commit on Java 7., Thank you [~cnauroth] for the review., Committed to trunk and branch-2., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6687 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6687/])
