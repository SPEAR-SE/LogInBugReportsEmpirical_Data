This message is automatically generated., HI Uma,

I found the same problem, and saw your patch. Thanks for the good work!

I looked at the your  patch, one small comment here, what about creating a method in the base class and call it from setupCluster in both classes:

{code}
  protected Configuration setupCommonCfg() throws Exception {
    tmpOivImgDir = Files.createTempDir();
    
    Configuration conf = new Configuration();
    conf.setInt(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_CHECKPOINT_CHECK_PERIOD_KEY, 1);
    conf.setInt(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_CHECKPOINT_TXNS_KEY, 5);
    conf.setInt(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_HA_TAILEDITS_PERIOD_KEY, 1);
    conf.set(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_LEGACY_OIV_IMAGE_DIR_KEY,
        tmpOivImgDir.getAbsolutePath());

    return conf;
  }
{code}

Thanks.
