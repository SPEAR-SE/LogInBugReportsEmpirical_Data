[I think code below in {{waitForAckedSeqno}} is already a good indicator of slow acks:
{noformat}
      long duration = Time.monotonicNow() - begin;
      if (duration > dfsclientSlowLogThresholdMs) {
        LOG.warn("Slow waitForAckedSeqno took " + duration
            + "ms (threshold=" + dfsclientSlowLogThresholdMs + "ms)");
      }
{noformat}

While slow log in {{ResponseProcessor}} indicates either slow data producer or slow ack. I'd suggest more informative slow log., I also get this warning in my client logs, but not on any namenode or datanode.
So I think this is a rather annoying bug. I get this error with a client application (Apache Flink) with very low throughput (1MB / minute) and all my other Hadoop applications work without any problem.

Any work planned to fix this?]
