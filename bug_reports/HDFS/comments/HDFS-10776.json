[Regarding
bq.1) What is the correct way of doing the hdfs audit logging?

[Here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-9395?focusedCommentId=15131106&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15131106] is the audit logging policy that was agreed up on in HDFS-9395.  The key opinion that led to the agreement was probably from [~daryn]:

... The audit log should be a record of successful or unauthorized access to data - not a debug record of every attempted operation. The reduced SNR of already monstrous logs and the performance penalty (it's already extremely high) of logging unsuccessful operations generated by polling, globbing, file not found, rename targets existing, etc is of no value to me.

Please share your thoughts on this., FWIW, I'm writing a blog post on the origins of the audit log. I figure a lot of people would be interested in it outside this JIRA. When it's posted, I'll add a link here., [~aw], Thank you! Could you point me to the blog post or share some thoughts on what is the expected route? Appreciate any inputs., Sorry, I've been distracted by security holes and life in general to finish the draft I wrote up.  I'll try to knock it out this week., [~aw], Looking forward to the blog post and get things moving on this JIRA. Thanks a lot!, Sorry, here it is:
