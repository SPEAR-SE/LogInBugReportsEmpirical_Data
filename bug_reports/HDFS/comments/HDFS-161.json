[It is true if a directory listed in {{dfs.datanode.data.dir}} (formerly {{dfs.data.dir}}) does not exist, it will be automatically created by the data-node.
I traced this behavior back to where the history goes: it has always been like that. The idea is to make data-nodes autonomous, because on large clusters it is hard to keep track of each and every one of them.
This contradicts the description to field {{dfs.datanode.data.dir}} saying "... Directories that do not exist are ignored.", which also goes far back in history.
I'd propose to update the description and change the documentation as far back in versions as we possible could., I prefer the "ignored directories that do not exist " feature.
When each machine has its own disk space configuration,it's fine to configure all possible  directories in the master's "dfs-site.xml" file and then simply copy it to slaves to avoid configuring it on each machine.
In most cases,what matters is the disk which you mount on. So mkdir dose't make sense especially when making many directories on the same disk.


, [~nemon] - There are better ways to managing configurations on a per-instance level than doing those things. There are several configuration management tools out there you can consume.

I'd personally consider that a bad practice cause when it comes to a time where you're (or someone else is) going to look at the dfs.datanode.data.dir list to debug an issue on the cluster, it would only mislead with some false values until you realize.

FWIW in here, I think the doc ought to be fixed instead. There's numerous times this 'feature' has come handy in my experience.]
