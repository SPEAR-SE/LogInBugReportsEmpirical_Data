[Amith, could please update the patch?, Yes I will provide the patch prepared by EOD, When a pipeline setup for append/recovery may fail. If the setup fails we are setting streamerClosed but there is no condition which cause the streamer thread to stop.

currently in the given stack trace
{code}
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSOutputStream$DataStreamer.run(DFSOutputStream.java:510)
{code}

caused has a side effect of not closing the streamer thread even after setting the streamerClosed.

Manually verified the scenario 
write a file
corrupt block manually
call append

This message is automatically generated., manually verified the patch, with testcase i was not able to assert the new behaviour correctly, Hi Todd/Nicholas/Uma can u have a look into my patch 

Thanks in Advance
, It seems that setupPipelineForAppendOrRecovery() always return false.  So the patch could be simplified to
{code}
+            if (streamerClosed) {
+              continue;
+            }
{code}
We should also change setupPipelineForAppendOrRecovery() to void.  We may do it separately.

Could you add a unit test?, Thanks nicholas i will redo the patch and submit a new one
, I have added a patch with a test.

In test I added a assert in the catch block because if a assert is added to check blockStream as null then in failure condition the throwable catches the assertion failed error and testcase passed.

In catch block I am checking no NPE should be thrown. 

If assertion fails in the catch block then testcase fails due to timeout, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Amith, Change looks good to me.

nits: 
{code}
DistributedFileSystem fs = cluster.getFileSystem();
+    Path fileName = new Path("/appendCorruptBlock");
+    DFSTestUtil.createFile(fs, fileName, 512, (short) 1, 0);
+    DFSTestUtil.waitReplication(fs, fileName, (short)1);
+    Assert.assertTrue("File not created", fs.exists(fileName));
+    /*
+     * Corrupt the blocks in the cluster
+     */
+    corruptBlockInFinalizedDirectory(cluster);{code}
Here null check for cluster as you have instantiated out side of try. And Better move other code into try after creating cluster. check the other places as well in corruptFinalizedBlock.

2) "Finalized directory not created yet"
used in multiple places. create constant and use.

3) con't we move this test to some existing append test files instead of creating your own test file for single test case?

Nicholas, do you have any comments? 
I agree that, other than adding assertion in code, I could not find other good way to test this, as Streamer is handling Throwable internally. I am not sure, you will agree with this, please give your opinion.

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~umamaheswararao], Thanks for taking up old issue.
 You might want to rebase last HDFS-3384_2.patch, one with test and fixed review comments., oh Yes. You are right. I have to rebase latest one. Thanks. I will do that in some tome today., [~vinayrpet] rebased the patch. Also corrected the test case where try-catch should cover the rest of the code path after cluster instantiate., +1,
