[The attached patch closes the last committed transaction ID file before pre-upgrade and before rollback.  There is also a small bug fix in {{BestEffortLongFile}} to null the {{FileChannel}} so that subsequent calls to {{lazyOpen}} will reopen it.

I haven't added any new tests.  The problem can be reproduced by running the existing {{TestDFSUpgradeWithHA}} suite on Windows.  The test suite passes after applying this patch.  I've also used the patch successfully in a live cluster., +1 patch looks good., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
