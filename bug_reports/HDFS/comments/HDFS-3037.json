This message is automatically generated., The findbugs warning is unrelated and tracked by HDFS-3038. I strongly suspect that the test failures are spurious, but I just kicked Jenkins again for this patch just to be sure., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Pretty sure the TestHFlush failure is spurious and unrelated to this patch. I suspect it's due to HDFS-3041. I just ran TestHFlush locally several times with the patch applied and it passed just fine.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., Thanks a lot for the review, Todd. I've just committed this to trunk., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1893 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1893/])
