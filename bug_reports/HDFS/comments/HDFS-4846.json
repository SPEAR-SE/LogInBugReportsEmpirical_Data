[Thanks a lot, Stephen! 

So I try to clean up the exception for allowSnapshot, disallowSnapshot, lsSnapshottableDir, and snapshotDiff. I tested them in my local cluster using your examples, and the exception got cleaned up with the patch.

, Thanks, Jing Zhao!

+1 (non-binding)

I also built with your patch and verified that the commands don't output stacktraces anymore., Hey, Jing. I noticed a typo when trying to move a directory that holds snapshots:

{code}
schu-mbp:~ schu$ hadoop fs -mv /tmp /tmp2
2013-05-23 22:30:47.580 java[4766:1203] Unable to load realm info from SCDynamicStore
2013-05-23 22:30:47,587 WARN  [main] util.NativeCodeLoader (NativeCodeLoader.java:<clinit>(62)) - Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable
mv: The direcotry /tmp cannot be deleted since /tmp is snapshottable and already has snapshots
{code}

"direcotry" --> "directory"

This is a small typo, but seems like it'll be run into often once snapshots become widespread. Think it'll be a good idea to fix this typo in the patch?, Stephen, thanks for the review and good catch! Update the patch to fix the typo., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
