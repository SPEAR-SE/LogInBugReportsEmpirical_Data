[[~wheat9], should 2.7 stop for this? If so, any plans of making progress here?, Will take care of it in a day or two., This change addresses most of the issues raised in HDFS-7270.

This change adds an optional field called ECN to PipelineAckProto and like HDFS-7270 the ECN by default is switched off. This change should make it safe for older clients to work with the ECN change.

For testing purposes we do turn the ECN on in the HDFS tests since this optional field should not impact any existing tests or communication protocols, So we verify that using a test specific site setting.

Please note : This change simply enables ECN in communication protocol layer, we will need to modify clients at some point of time to take advantage of this feature.

, Hi Anu.  This patch looks mostly good to me.  Here are a few comments.

# {{BlockReceiver.PacketResponder#run}}: There is a line that calculates a {{myStatus}} local variable.  This had been introduced in HDFS-7270.  I think it's unused now and can be removed.
# datatransfer.proto: There is typo in the comment: "configration" instead of "configuration".  Please indent by 4 spaces.  (Sorry to nitpick.)
# hdfs-site.xml: Please remove this file from the next revision of the patch.  (I know you had been doing some local testing with the ECN configuration turned on.)

I think the original intent of HDFS-7270 was to try to match the semantics of RFC-3168 as closely as possible.  Therefore, the {{ECN}} enum needed 4 possible values, which were named {{DISABLED}}, {{SUPPORTED}}, {{SUPPORTED2}} and {{CONGESTED}}.  Shall we keep the same values here in the new protobuf enum?  I'm not very familiar with this RFC, so I'll defer to [~wheat9] on what is the best definition of these values.

{{TestTracing}} fails for me on current trunk even without this patch.  All other test failures appear to be unrelated., Oops, I meant to say that the indentation needs to be 2 spaces., bq. Shall we keep the same values here in the new protobuf enum

Yes. Please keep the enum matching the RFC.

{code}
+  optional ECN ecn = 4 ;
{code}

Let's rename the field into {{header}} and make it a {{int64}} field. That way allows us to add more information in the future while maintaining both backward and forward compatibility., Took care of comments from chris and haohui, Thanks for the revised patch, Anu.  I have just one more minor nitpick.  hdfs-site.xml is still in the patch with a whitespace change.  Let's remove it from the patch completely.  With that, all of my feedback has been addressed, and I'm +1 pending another Jenkins run.  I'll wait for [~wheat9] to take another look before committing., {code}
+// A flags structure which lets us send various
+// information back to the client
+enum Flags {
+  // ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification
+  // This tells the client that we have congestion
+  // in the data pipeline. This will allow ECN aware
+  // clients to back-off gracefully.
+
+  ECN_DISABLED      = 0; // ECN information is disabled in configuration
+  ECN_SUPPORTED     = 1; // We have no congestion in the data pipeline
+  ECN_SUPPORTED2    = 2; // Same thing as above, please see RFC-3168
+  ECN_CONGESTED     = 3; // We are experiencing a congestion in the data pipeline
+}
+
{code}

There might be an issue when listing these numbers as an enum -- protobuf will create an Enum class, will it hinder forward compatibility?

{code}
+  private final static boolean DFS_ECN_ENABLED;
+      DFS_ECN_ENABLED ? Flags.ECN_SUPPORTED_VALUE : Flags.ECN_DISABLED_VALUE);

-  public PipelineAck(long seqno, int[] replies,
-                     long downstreamAckTimeNanos) {
-    ArrayList<Integer> replyList = Lists.newArrayList();
-    for (int r : replies) {
-      replyList.add(r);
-    }
{code}

I start thinking that it might be better to combine Status and ECN flags internally --- conceptually they are both parts of the header flags, it makes sense to always combine them together and pass them along, but to put them into different fields in the protobuf message. 


, Removed the spurious edit in xml file, but would that not kill compatibility with old clients ?  It thought that was the point of this JIRA all together ?, bq. but would that not kill compatibility with old clients ? It thought that was the point of this JIRA all together ?

Let me clarify my proposal:

* In the java implementation: combining Status and ECN flags together to ensure that they are always passed together through the call chains.
* Over the wire: setting the Status and ECN flags in separate fields in the protobuf messages.

Does it make sense to you?

3) Made the flags a bit mask and a repeated unit64 in the protobuf space.
