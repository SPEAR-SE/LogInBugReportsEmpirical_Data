[Why?

Safemode does not modify the file system, which is what audit log tracks., [~aw]: Thanks 

Yes, you are correct but it will change the system state., The state of the actual filesystem is exactly the same.  safemode changes the state of the namenode. If I move the fsimage+edits to another namenode, the state will be the same as it was before the NN went into safemode.
, [~aw] :  I think all the Admin commands should be log in the audit logs but if you think it's not needed then we can close this jiar.
, AS this command doesn't modify the file system, which is what the audit log keeps track of.( [~aw] also pointed)...If anyone disagree, please feel free to open this jira.... Thanks...]
