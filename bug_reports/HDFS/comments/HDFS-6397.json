[Patch uploaded, I've noticed that the dead node count does not include the nodes that are in dfs.include, but never contacted NN.  The ones that contacted NN then died do count toward the dead node count.  So live_node_count + dead_node_count can be less than total node count from dfs.include., The fix itself looks good, but adding more meaningful test case will be better. You can set {{DFSConfigKeys.DFS_HOSTS}} and add some random addresses to the file. Before your patch the dead node count will be 0, but it will be the number entries in the include file after you fix. If you are bringing up a MiniDFSCluster, starting with no data node will do.  Depending on the level you want to perform the check, it could be in {{TestDatanodeManager}} or {{TestHostsFiles}}., If we make it before 2.4.1 is cut, I want it to be in 2.4.1. Otherwise we will fix it in 2.5.0., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks like the test case failure is related. 
I ran it locally and it passed.

There is an existing JIRA and patch available to address this transient failure: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6308.
