+#include <strings.h>
{code}
I think <string.h> is preferred.  strings.h was a BSDism IIRC.

(I realize you're just moving code, but let's do the cleanup too.)

{code}
-        tSize num_written_bytes = hdfsWrite(lfs, localFile,
-                                            (void*)fileContents,
-                                            strlen(fileContents) + 1);
+        num_written_bytes = hdfsWrite(lfs, localFile, (void*)fileContents,
+               strlen(fileContents) + 1);
{code}
I'd maintain the indent style here; line up strlen with the (.
Writing the NUL terminator of the string out to the file is a little baroque, but I guess it works. Changing the semantics of the code would go beyond cleanups.

I'm not entirely convinced that adding an API {{hdfsFileUsesDirectRead}} that is only used for tests is a good idea; think of the private data members as @VisibleForTest or similar.  But I am fine if you think it's a good cleanup.

I don't think the TestNameNodeRecovery.java whitespace cleanup belongs in this patch.  If you were already touching that file for a substantive change it would be fine., * include "string.h" rather than "strings.h"

* fix whitespace issue

* put "visible for testing" functions in a separate header

* create hdfs_internal structure type, and use that for hdfsFS.  This way, type mismatches will be detected automatically.  This also allows forward declaration., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
