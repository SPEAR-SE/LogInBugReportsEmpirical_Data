[bq. So, I think when NN2 become standby due to different sessionid, NN2 should unlock the state in Znode in order to failover again.
Finding out whether the sessionId is wrong due to network fluctuation is very difficult and ZKFC cannot take a call in this case.
If ZKFC sees this different sessionId and tries to rejoin, it will keep on do the samething infinite times as long as Active is running fine, Since active's sessionId will be different., I see HDFS-8161 with the same ActiveStandbyElectorLock details. 
Can we resolve anyone as dup ?, Yes,, Both are same...duplicating to HDFS-8161,, thanks.., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161, thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161, thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161., thank you, i will watch this jira HDFS-8161.]
