[The failure is due to an HDFS path being initialized from the system property {{test.build.data}}. This works on Linux but fails on Windows because an absolute Windows path (with drive letter) is never a valid HDFS path., The fix is simply avoid querying the system property for the HDFS test path.

The branch-2 patch further renames the test case hdfs-project/TestTestCommand.java --> TestHdfsTextCommand.java to be consistent with trunk., +1 for the patch, pending Jenkins.  I verified that the test passes on both Mac and Windows, in both trunk and branch-2., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
