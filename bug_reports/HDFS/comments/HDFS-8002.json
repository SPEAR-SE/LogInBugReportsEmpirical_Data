One comment: The patch looks redundant for me. Could you document the actual path once and use trash instead of writing the actual path every time? Such as
{code}
HDFS first renames it to a file in the trash directory (`/user/<username>/.Trash`). The file can be restored quickly as long as it remains in trash. ...
