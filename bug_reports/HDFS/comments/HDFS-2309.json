[Can you please describe what the problem is and how you are fixing it., 20.security does not process second block report when the NN is in safemode. A block report is considered to be the second block report if the number of blocks for a DN is > 0.

During the test, a DN sends block received before sending block report. This results in first block report to be discarded.

Solution:
Introduce a flag in DatanodeDescriptor to track first block report, instead of using number of blocks., +1 for the change., Committed to branch-0.20-security!
This is not relevant for trunk. , Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0]
