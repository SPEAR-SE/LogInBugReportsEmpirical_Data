This message is automatically generated., +1.  Thanks, Juan., Fix unit test "testPreadLocalFS", Oops, there is a test failure that needs to be addressed.  The test failure in {{TestPread}} is because of this new addition:

{code}
  private void doPread(FSDataInputStream stm, long position, byte[] buffer,
                       int offset, int length) throws IOException {
    int nread = 0;
    if (!(stm.getWrappedStream() instanceof DFSInputStream)) {
      throw new IOException("not DFSInputStream");
    }
    ...
{code}

We need to support non-{{DFSInputStream}} objects here so that we can test {{LocalFS}} and so forth., I think Juan's new patch handles this case, so I'm +1 pending Jenkins., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
