[Hi Wenwu, this should be some warnings instead of an errors and not involved by any changes on HDFS-2832. Please check your build env., There seems to be an issue in the maven-compiler-plugin whereby when an ERROR is detected, it incorrectly marks the compiler warnings as ERRORs also.  This makes it hard to see the actual ERROR in all the noise.  It looks like [MCOMPILER-179|http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCOMPILER-179] (though that has been marked as fixed in maven 3.0...

At any rate, the actual error is 
{code}
[ERROR] /home/jenkins/slave/workspace/HVE-PostCommit-HDFS-2832/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/datanode/BPOfferService.java:[337,34] unreported exception java.io.IOException; must be caught or declared to be thrown
{code}

This has been fixed by [~arpitagarwal] (see my comment on HDFS-5448).  , Thanks for responding to this Eric.

Wenwu, please resync to the latest revision., Thanks for helpful respondce Eric and Arpit.
 it is passed after sync to the latest version.]
