[One problem is that {{TestDirHelper}} enforces some platform-specific validation on TEST_DIR_ROOT.  On Windows, TEST_DIR_ROOT.startsWith("/") is likely to be false because of the drive spec.

{code}
  static {
    try {
      TEST_DIR_ROOT = System.getProperty(TEST_DIR_PROP, new File("target").getAbsolutePath());
      if (!TEST_DIR_ROOT.startsWith("/")) {
        System.err.println(MessageFormat.format("System property [{0}]=[{1}] must be set to an absolute path",
                                                TEST_DIR_PROP, TEST_DIR_ROOT));
        System.exit(-1);
      } else if (TEST_DIR_ROOT.length() < 4) {
        System.err.println(MessageFormat.format("System property [{0}]=[{1}] must be at least 4 chars",
                                                TEST_DIR_PROP, TEST_DIR_ROOT));
        System.exit(-1);
      }
{code}

That part is easily fixable by switching to {{Path#isUriPathAbsolute}}.  After fixing that, there are additional problems with path handling:

{code}

{code}
, Chris, you are correct. This should be easy to address by detecting if the OS is Windows and addressing using the correct logic to handle the drive.

The other thing you'll have to take care to run HTTPFS in Windows are the startup scripts. They do some ENV setting and they delegate to the Tomcat startup scripts. I'd assume doing the same thing in BAT/CMD and calling the corresponding Tomcat windows startup script will do.

Hope this helps.
, Alejandro, thank you for the notes.  I was not yet aware of this part, so it's very helpful., With this patch, all of the HTTPFS tests pass on both Mac and Windows., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Chris, Sorry I did not understand the reason for this change in TestHdfsHelper
{code}      Path testDir = new Path("/tmp/" + testName + "-" +
        counter.getAndIncrement());
{code}

Nitpick, we can use Path.WINDOWS here and avoid adding a new dependency on Shell.
{code}    if (!(Shell.WINDOWS && "file:///".equals(getProxiedFSURI()))) {{code}

Rest of the changes look great!, On the BaseTestHttpFSWith#testSetPermission() changes:

This change should not be here, but in the TestHttpFSFileSystemLocalFileSystem. Making testSetPermission protected and overriding and checking if windows to do the reduced logic, else fallback to super.testSetPermission for full check.
, Thank you, Arpit and Alejandro.  I am attaching a new patch to address your feedback.

This is the classic problem of trying to use testing paths prefixed with the local testing directory within HDFS.  On Windows, this would contain a ':' because of the drive spec, and HDFS validation logic rejects any path containing ':'.  The change in this patch switches to /tmp/<test name>, the same pattern that was used in numerous HDFS tests.  This does not change the actual testing working directory.  The HDFS metadata and block files still go in the test working directory under TEST_DIR_ROOT.  This only changes the logical paths that the test uses when interacting with HDFS., +1 pending test-patch., Patch looks good overall Chris.

One minor comment though, isn't File#isAbsolute() more appropriate below given that we're talking about local paths (not DFS paths):
{code}
if (!new Path(value).isUriPathAbsolute()) {

This message is automatically generated., Ivan, thanks for the suggestion.  Here is a new patch that switches to using {{File#isAbsolute}}.  The change actually revealed a new problem with some test code in {{TestServer}}.  I've also updated that code to use inputs that contain a drive spec on Windows (and therefore are considered absolute).

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Chris for addressing the comments! One minor comment, otherwise +1 from me

 - TestServer#contructorsGetters(): I think we can avoid the {{if WINDOWS check) and the hardcoded "C:/" if we have a File object for a {{drive}} and then pass {{new File(drive, child).getAbsolutePath()}} to the Server constructor and asserts. You can use {{test.build.data}} for a test base dir. Make sense?
