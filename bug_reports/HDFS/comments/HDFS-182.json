I guess the command did complete successfully since there is no error message like "No match" or "No such file or directory".

Tested -mv with 0.20.  I cannot reproduce the problem reported.

{noformat}, Can you try with a "*" added to the <src>? The "mv" command is issued for files under a (non-existent) directory.

i.e. What is the behavior of this command?
    
./bin/hadoop dfs -mv /user/a/* b

The hadoop version that i encountered this behavior is

$ hadoop version
Hadoop 0.20.0-030909A
Subversion  -r

bash-3.2$ ./bin/hadoop dfs -mv '/user/a/*' b
bash-3.2$ echo $?

The problem also exists in trunk., {quote}
In hadoop 0.17 & 0.18 the behavior of "hadoop dfs -mv <invalid src dir>/* <target dir>" is as shown below.

$ hadoop dfs -mv /user/dfsload/does-not-exist/* /user/dfsload/.Trash
hadoop: No match.
$ echo $?

Ramesh, in the command above, * should be escaped.  Otherwise, bash will expend it.  The message "hadoop: No match" was printed by bash but not hadoop.

I tested -mv with 0.18.  It also has the same behavior.

, Hi,
   Thanks for the clarification. You are right, the source path (with *) should have been escaped.

    Then, I would like to request that the exit code for such command be non-zero  - to keep the behavior consistent with respect to invalid source directory.   

thanks,
Ramesh]
