[Attached initial patch.., Hello [~surendrasingh].  Did you try swebhdfs?  For example:

{code}
./hdfs dfs -ls swebhdfs://x.x.x.x:50070/test
{code}

{{SWebHdfsFileSystem}} is a subclass that overrides {{getTransportScheme}} to "https".

I don't think we'll be able to make a change like the proposed patch.  For a client that needs to interact with multiple clusters, some using SSL and some not, then it might be incorrect to silently convert everything to "https" behind the scenes., Thanks [~cnauroth] for suggestion..

{{swebhdfs}} is working :), but I didn't find anything related to {{swebhdfs}} in [webhdfs document | https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/WebHDFS.html]., [~surendrasingh], that's a good point about the documentation.  I filed HDFS-9483 to track a documentation improvement.  If you're interested in providing the documentation, please feel free to pick up that one.  I'm going to resolve this one.]
