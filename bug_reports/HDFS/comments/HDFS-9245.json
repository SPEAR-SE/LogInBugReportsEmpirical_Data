This message was automatically generated., Yes I think using volatile here is appropriate. Findbugs also turned green for the fix. , Per offline discussion with [~brandonli], the {{volatile}} works just fine., Per offline discussion with[~wheat9] and  [~gtCarrera9], the {{volatile}} is considered premature optimization. The v1 patch simply use the synchronized block for accessors. The main observation is that synchronized read is not in critical path., \\

This message was automatically generated., Patch v002 LGTM. +1. I validated locally that it fixed the two findbugs issue on IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC. 

Not sure why Jenkins still reported the same issue with the latest patch. 
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/13201/artifact/patchprocess/trunkFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs-nfs.html, Thanks for the review, [~xyao]. I validated locally too and found the findbugs issue was gone with this patch.

Though there is findbugs warnings in the pre-patch findbugs warnings, the comment table says:
{quote}
The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs (version 3.0.0) warnings, and fixes 2 pre-existing warnings.
{quote}
It should be fine?, cc: [~aw] who may have an answer to this. It looks like a Infra issue unrelated to this change. 
I will commit it later today if I have not heard any additional comments by EOD today. , Thanks [~liuml07] for the contribution and all for the reviews. I've committed the patch to trunk and branch-2. , Thanks [~gtCarrera9] and [~brandonli] for your review and offline discussion.
