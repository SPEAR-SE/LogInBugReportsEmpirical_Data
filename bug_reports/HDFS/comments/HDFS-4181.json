[It seems odd to check if debugging is enabled to issue an alternate error.  I'd suggest changing:
{code}
if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
  LOG.error(src + " not found in lease.paths (=" + lease.paths + ")");
} else {
  LOG.error(src + " not found in lease.paths.");
}
{code} to {code}
LOG.error(src + " not found in lease.paths");
if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
  LOG.debug("lease.paths = (" + lease.paths + ")");
}
{code}

Otherwise it looks good if the pre-commit passes., Thanks, Daryn. Here are the new patches., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
