[All, 
This is the first Jira ticket that I have opened so apologies if I haven't provided enough information up front. 

The issue is that the Hadoop 1.0 dfshealth web page and its supporting .jsp classes did not have any security. 
While we can modify the web.xml file, its a temporary fix and can be accidentally removed in subsequent releases or patches. 
(/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/webapps/hdfs/WEB-INF/web.xml ) 

The question is what code besides the web page for dfs health uses the _jsp.classes and if they can be removed. 

The only downside that I can see is a loss of backwards compatability, along with now requiring that to view these pages, you must have an HTML5 capable browser.
, Hi, [~msegel].  Thank you for the bug report.  All of the jsp code has been removed already as part of issue HDFS-6252, so I'm resolving this one as duplicate.  That issue is targeted to 2.7.0, so in the Apache Hadoop 2.7.0 release, the jsp pages (and any of their security vulnerabilities) will vanish.]
