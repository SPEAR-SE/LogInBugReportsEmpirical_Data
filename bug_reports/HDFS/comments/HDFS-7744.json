This message is automatically generated., Thanks Colin for the report and the patch. Mostly looks good to me. Two comments:
# I suppose the name of the test method would be inconsistent with the added test case. Would you create a new test method (such as testSeekAfterCloseBlockReader) and add the test case there?
# (minor) Would you reverse the order to "{{fis.read() != -1}}" for code readability?
{code}
+         Assert.assertTrue(-1 != fis.read());
