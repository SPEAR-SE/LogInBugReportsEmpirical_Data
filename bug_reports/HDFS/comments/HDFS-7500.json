[A proposal for a plan of action:

a) Pull all user-level commands out of HDFSCommandsGuide and into FileSystemShell (if any are missing)
b) Point the Hadoop command manual at FileSystemShell.
c) Update HDFSCommandsGuide to only include HDFS-specials and/or admin-only commands

Thoughts?, It looks like maybe the only problem is actually two fold:

* FileSystemShell uses hdfs dfs instead of hadoop fs in all of the examples
* CommandsManual points to HDFSCommands instead of FileSystemShell.

These are both easily fixed. :), I'm going to fix this as part of HADOOP-10908 .]
