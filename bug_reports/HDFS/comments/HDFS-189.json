[Don't know what happened, but since the issue has been created, I'm going to use it even though the Summary is not very informative.

Summary should read: 
                 reportWrittenBlock() in DFSClient should retry

Description:
DFSOutputStream.internalClose() calls reportWrittenBlock().
If reportWrittenBlock() fails because of e.g. a SocketTimeoutException the client will call
abandonBlock() and repeating of allocating and transferring the block from the very beginning.
The client should retry sending reportWrittenBlock() since at that time it knows the data-nodes
already have their copies.]
