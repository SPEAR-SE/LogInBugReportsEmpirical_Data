Nit: what you're calling "URI prefix"/"location"/"protocol type" in the comments is called the "scheme" in URI lingo.

Testing?  Eg confirmed you can run libhdfs against an HA config (ie one w/o a port) now?

The test failures here are obviously unrelated.

, I've verified I can connect without an explicit port, using hdfs_test.  There will be an opportunity to add more unit tests once HDFS-3606 is in., * refer to 'hdfs://' as a 'scheme' rather than a 'prefix', -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
