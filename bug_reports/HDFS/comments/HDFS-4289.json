[This was discovered while researching HDFS-4261.  All subsequent notes assume that HDFS-4261 has been fixed first.

Running {{TestBalancerWithNodeGroup#testBalancerWithRackLocality}} shows this in the output:

{code}
java.io.IOException: THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN: replica.getBytesOnDisk() !=
 block.getNumBytes(), block=BP-TEST:blk_1000_2000, replica=ReplicaUnderRecovery,
 blk_1000_2000, RUR
{code}

That log message came from this check in {{FsDatasetImpl#updateReplicaUnderRecovery}}:

{code}
    //check replica's byte on disk
    if (replica.getBytesOnDisk() != oldBlock.getNumBytes()) {
      throw new IOException("THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN:"
          + " replica.getBytesOnDisk() != block.getNumBytes(), block="
          + oldBlock + ", replica=" + replica);
    }
{code}

This is causing the current {{Balancer}} iteration to move 0 bytes.  Then, the {{Balancer}} logic returns {{NO_MOVE_PROGRESS}} after exceeding the maximum iterations.
