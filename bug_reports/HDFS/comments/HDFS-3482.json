This message is automatically generated., Madhu, Thanks a lot for the patch. A few comments:


- 
{code}
try {
+      Balancer.Cli.parse(parameters);
+      fail(reason);
+    } catch (Exception e) {
+      assertTrue(e instanceof IllegalArgumentException);
+    }
{code}

Please handle specific exception instead of handling genric one and checking for instanceOf.

- 
{code}
   try {
+      Balancer.Cli.parse(parameters);
+      fail(reason);
+    } catch (Exception e) {
+       assertTrue(e instanceof IllegalArgumentException);
+    }
{code}
same as above

- 
How about adding below part before the if statements?

{code}
 Preconditions.checkArgument(args.length >= 2, "args = "
        + Arrays.toString(args));
{code}

- 
{code}
-      
       return new Parameters(policy, threshold);
-    }
+  }
{code}
seems like wrong format here?

- 
{code}
 /**
+   * Test parse method in Balancer#Cli class with wrong number of params
+   */
{code}
format the header comment correctly. and also need not have empty line between header comment and @Test annotation.

- 
args.length>= 2  ---->   args.length >= 2 please note here, there should be one space before operator., Hi Uma Maheswara Rao,
Thanks a lot for reviewing the patch. I have updated the patch according to your comments., Hi Madhu, Thanks for the update on the patch.

some format issue in the patch.

{code}
           for(int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
+	    checkArgument(args.length >= 2, "args = " + Arrays.toString(args));            
             if ("-threshold".equalsIgnoreCase(args[i])) {
{code}

problem with tab.

in tests also there is one hard core tab introduced.

{code}
+    String reason =
+	"IllegalArgumentException is expected when value" + "is not specified";
{code}
other than that looks good., updated the patch to fix tab issues., Attached the same patch as Madhu.
