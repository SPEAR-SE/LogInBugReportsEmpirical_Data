[As discussed in HDFS-13815, we should reset exitcode -1 when we gives invalid params. Will handle rest of the commands here.

In this solution, When 'If' conditions become false, it would entry to else part and make exitcode value -1., Once, update the patch for HDFS-13815, would like to give patch for this Jira also.]
