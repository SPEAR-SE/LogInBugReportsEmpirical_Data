[Thanks for reporting the issue [~archanat].

I think message was truncated to avoid excessive logging. But true there should be option to get the complete information or limit the content size in different way by extracting  important details (Ex- Log only live node name ignoring all other details like infoAddr,etc.)

For simplicity I am thinking to make the truncate length configurable and don't truncate by default . [~arpitagarwal], do you have any other view on this?, The truncation was intentional.

Instead of an option to avoid truncating, I suggest adding an option to filter out specific metrics from the output and add the more verbose metrics to that option as deaults. Then you can remove the truncation altogether. What do you think?, Yes fine [~arpitagarwal]. Let user configure comma separated prefixes like {{excludekeystartwith = NameNodeInfo:LiveNodes, IPCLoggerChannel}} then NameNodeInfo:LiveNodes and all the metrics like IPCLoggerChannel-XXX will be ignored. 

Also shall we consider flatten and log values from TabularData & CompositeData types which are ignored currently?, Hi [~kanaka], that sounds fine to me.

bq. Also shall we consider flatten and log values from TabularData & CompositeData types which are ignored currently?
Good idea, we could add them to the default exclude list if they are too verbose.]
