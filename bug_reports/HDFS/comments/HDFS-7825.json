[[~jingzhao] can you take a look?, [~hagleitn] [~sseth] fyi :), Duplicated with HADOOP-11039, bq. Also, while I haven't verified yet, it may be that the 0-length read is not handled properly.

Thanks for reporting this, [~sershe]! The doc part has been fixed in HADOOP-11039. For the 0-length read issue, could you please give more details? Feel free to reopen the jira or create another jira if you think there is some bug there.]
