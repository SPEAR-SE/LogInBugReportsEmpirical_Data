[The fix for HDFS-11251 (ConcurrentModificationException during DataNode#refreshVolumes) making the {{Storage#storageDirs}} a {{CopyOnWriteArrayList}} is needed for this bug. On top of HDFS-11251 fix, we need more clean up patches., Attaching v01 patch to address the following:

1. Avoid storageDirs getting re-defined in NNStorage. The redefinition is not needed as HDFS-11251 is anyway making the parent member variable stroageDir a {{CopyOnWriteArrayList}}
2. Make {{Storage#storageDirs}} a private member and expose get() method for the same.
3. Clean up all direct accessors of storageDirs with getStorageDirs() method

[~eddyxu], can you please take a look at the patch ?, Hi, [~manojg]

Thanks a lot for cleaning the code.

I have a few questions remained:

{code}
protected List<StorageDirectory> storageDirs = new ArrayList<StorageDirectory>();
{code}

Can we change it to {{private}} and adds the {{public getStorageDirs()}}?  Adding {{new ArrayList<>()}} to constructor makes duplicated code. Btw, as for JDK 7, the second template parameter can be removed:
{code}
protected List<StorageDirectory> storageDirs = new ArrayList<>();
{code}

* Regarding thread-safe iteration, the proposed patch can protected get/set the reference of the StorageDir collection. But it might be difficult to protect iterating the collection. 

* Would using {{ArrayList()}} in {{NNStorage}} weaken the concurrency protection of {{NNStorage}}?

Thanks!, Thanks for the review [~eddyxu].

1. Protected vs Private:
v01 patch already converted the "protected List" to a "private List", initialized it only in the constructor and added getStorageDirs(). Yes, the second template parameter in the constructor is not needed. Removing it.

2. Thread Safety:
The idea is to use {{CopyonWriteArrayList}} in the base Storage class for storageDirs. The proposed patch is missing the CopyOnWriteArrayList as I assumed HDFS-11251 will bring in that fix.  But, thinking more about it, its better to make the fix for this issue a self contained one and so will amend the patch with storageDirs initialized with CopyOnWriteArrayList.

After storageDirs is made a {{CopyOnWriteArrayList}}, the iterator will use a snapshot of the underlying list and the iterator will never throw a {{ConcurrentModificationException}}. There can be parallel addition and removal of storageDirs and still other threads can iterate over the storageDirs without facing any issues (because, they are iterating on the point in time copy of List). 

So after CopyOnWriteArrayList change, it will be thread safe. 

3. NNStorage concurrency 
Since we are making the base Storage class storageDirs a CopyOnWriteArrayList, there will be no weakening of concurrency protection for NNStorage.

, +1 for the 02 patch that [~manojg] submitted. Committed to trunk and branch-2.  Thanks for the good work [~manojg] and reviews from [~linyiqun].

My bad, the patch was accidentally committed to {{trunk}} and {{branch-2}} without running jenkins. However, the patch is relatively safe and has passed the review from [~linyiqun] as well.  If there is any issue, let's file a follow up JIRA for it. 

Thanks again.]
