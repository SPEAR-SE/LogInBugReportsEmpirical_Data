[I have a patch in progress, so I'm assigning this to myself., I'm uploading a patch.  This makes audit logging for the ACL APIs consistent with what we already do for {{setPermission}}.  We'll log the path, the operation name, and the permissions after execution of the operation.  The existing audit logging relies on {{FsPermission#toString}}, and we've already updated that method in a prior patch to append '+' if there is an ACL present.  I also noticed that {{FSNamesystem#setAcl}} was missing its edit log sync, so I added that.

I also considered the possibility of putting the full ACL into the audit log entries.  However, that could cause some very long audit log lines.  I estimate an extra ~600 characters for an inode that uses the maximum of 32 ACL entries.  There is also the matter of changing a lot of existing operations to fetch the ACL just for the sake of logging.  Let's not do this right now, and we can always revisit it later if it's requested., +1 for the patch. I agree that logging the full ACL is overkill. We could make it an option later., Thanks for the review, Arpit.  I committed this to the feature branch.]
