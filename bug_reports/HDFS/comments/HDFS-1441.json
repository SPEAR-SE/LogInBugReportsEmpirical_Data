[This issue will come if the user keeps on opening the connection and doesn't close it while making a re-try.
Ideally on a failure of ImageIO.read() operation; user should close the InputStream and then re-try. The reason why the client code is waiting for infinite timeout after 4 connection is because RestUtils of Jets3t library passes the property *http.connection-manager.max-per-host* as 4.

Close the connections while proceeding for re-try. The issue looks to be invalid., User can configure the values to over-ride the default values:
||Property ||Description||
|httpclient.max-connections|The maximum number of simultaneous connections to allow globally| 
|httpclient.max-connections-per-host|The maximum number of simultaneous connections to allow for a single host|

For more details please refer the Jets3t configuration link:
http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/toolkit/configuration.html#jets3t, +1 for closing it as invalid. This is the expected behaviour when connections are not returned to the pool. ]
