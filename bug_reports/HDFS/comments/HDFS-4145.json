This message is automatically generated., Ivan, I think there is an issue with handling of the --config option to override the configuration directory.  hdfs.cmd has code to parse --config and then shift away the arguments.  Later, it calls hadoop-config.cmd.  Inside hadoop-config.cmd, it resets HADOOP_CONF_DIR to a default of %HADOOP_HOME%\etc\hadoop.  hadoop-config.cmd then repeats the check for --config, but by now hdfs.cmd has already shifted the arguments out, so the config directory override isn't found.

I temporarily hacked around this on my machine by commenting out the line in hadoop-config.cmd that sets it to %HADOOP_HOME%\etc\hadoop.  After that, it worked for me.  I successfully formatted and started a namenode.
