[[~ajisakaa] thanks for reporting this issue. Patch,LGTM,+1 (non binding), Hi [~ajisakaa], good catch. We can just remove it from the command line help altogether. I verified that starting the NN with '-finalize' fails and points to 'hdfs dfsadmin -finalizeUpgrade'.

, +1.  I'll let you commit Akira. :), Thanks [~brahmareddy], [~arpitagarwal], and [~aw] for the reviews. I'll commit it shortly.

bq. We can just remove it from the command line help altogether.
Removing it from command line is being done in HDFS-8241. I'm thinking it's better to do this separately since HDFS-8241 is an incompatible change., Committed this to trunk and branch-2.
