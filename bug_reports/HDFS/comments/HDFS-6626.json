[Hi Ming,

I think the main goal of decommissioning is to shift blocks off of a DN, which is done at low priority to avoid disrupting the cluster. However, if a DN dies while decommissioning, HDFS is forced to immediately re-replicate all of its blocks at a high priority. Thus, the end result of a successful decommission vs an "aborted decommission" as you term it is the same: no blocks on that DN.

What additional actions would the admin be able to take if we also had a "decommission aborted" state? If you're interested in process / host health, that's typically handled by dedicated monitoring tools like CM or ganglia., Thanks, Andrew. I discussed more with our admins and they want to identify bad nodes quickly in the context of decommission. I agree such new state doesn't help much, given the dead nodes UI can provide such information., Thanks for checking in on this Ming. Since it seems like the dead node list is sufficient, let's close this JIRA out. Please reopen if a usecase reemerges.]
