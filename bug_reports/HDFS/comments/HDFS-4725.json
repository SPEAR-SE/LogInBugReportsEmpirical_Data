[I'm attaching a patch to address the file handle leaks that I've found.  Here is a summary of the changes:

# Namenode shutdown during an early termination (fatal error) did not guarantee complete cleanup.  I've made changes to {{NameNode}} and {{FSEditLog}} to guarantee all edits logs get closed and storage lock files get released via {{FSNamesystem#close}}.  Previously, we could skip closing edits logs and releasing lock files when {{ExitUtil#terminate}} was running in test mode, and therefore throwing an unchecked exception instead of exiting the process.
# {{OfflineEditsBinaryLoader}} was not closing the edits log it was reading.  I've added a finally block to guarantee that it gets closed.
# {{DFSTestUtil#loadFile}} had a file handle leak, so I added a finally block to guarantee close.
# Various tests were not calling shutdown on their {{MiniDFSCluster}} instances.  You'll see some big diffs from where I added finally blocks to guarantee shutdown, but this is just due to the indentation changes.
# {{TestEditLogJournalFailures}} had set up a mock to do nothing when anything called {{EditLogOutputStream#abort}}.  Under normal operation, the file would get closed in that method, so the mocking would cause tests to leak file handles.  From what I can tell, there is no particular reason that the tests need to skip the abort, so I just removed that part of the mocking.

I tested this successfully on Mac and Windows.  With this patch, we'll stop seeing failures on Windows in these test suites:

* {{TestEditLogJournalFailures}}
* {{TestStartup}}
* {{TestDatanodeDeath}}
* {{TestDFSClientExcludedNodes}}
* {{TestDistributedFileSystem}}
* {{TestQuota}}
* {{TestOfflineEditsViewer}}
