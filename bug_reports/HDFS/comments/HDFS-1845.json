This message is automatically generated., I think you want to call getFileStatus instead of globStatus since you don't appear to be testing a glob.

Very minor comment: it seems like the general coding style is to use cuddled else clauses., Thanks Daryn. Attaching another patch by taking Daryn's comments into consideration., The fix in INode.java looks good. 

In the test you can't successfully access a symlink via FileSystem as symlinks are only implmented in FileContext (this is why TestCheckpoint is failing). You need to use FileContext#getFileLinkStatus as you want to check the isSymlink property (and getFileStatus will resolve the link).

Nit: no need for the writeLink and checkLink utility methods since they are/can be 1-liners.

TestCheckpoint is fixed in the latest patch. TestFileConcurrentReader is unrelated.

Do you mean for branch-0.20-security? 

I think HDFS-1845-2.patch is equivalent to hdfs-1845-branch22-1.patch. , Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #643 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/643/])
    HDFS-1845. Symlink comes up as directory after namenode restart. Contributed by John George
, Yes Eli you are right. Both the patches were the same. I did not realize that there was another patch attached till after I attached this patch. Sorry for the confusion., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #600 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/600/])
    , Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-22-branch #35 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-22-branch/35/])
