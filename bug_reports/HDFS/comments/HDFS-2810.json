[I think I see the bug here. DFSClient.renewLease has:
{code}
  void renewLease() throws IOException {
    if (clientRunning && !isFilesBeingWrittenEmpty()) {
      namenode.renewLease(clientName);
    }
  }
{code}
and LeaseRenewer only calls {{renewLease()}} on the first DFSClient with any given name.
So, if there are multiple DFSClients with the same clientName, but the first of them has no files open, then the lease renewer will stop actually renewing the lease.
, I think the attached patch fixes the issue. Will verify on a cluster as well., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Good catch!  Thanks for fixing this., Letting my test cluster run for a couple more hours, then will commit it. Thanks for the reviews., My HBase cluster remains up a few hours later. Committed to trunk and 23, thanks for the reviews., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #382 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/382/])
