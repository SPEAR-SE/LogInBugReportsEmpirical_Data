[Can you describe the changes you have made?, Sorry, uploaded a wrong path., The patch just cleans up the namespace before test in testcorruptBlock() so it won't be affected by possible pending blocks left by other tests. 

Also corrected a comment., +1 for the change., I committed the patch to branch-1. Thank you Brandon., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
