This message was automatically generated., Testcase is not required as it is HDFS command usage updation, {noformat}echo "  debug                validate blocks and invoke recover lease."{noformat}

'hdfs' commands are in alphabetical order. Need to insert this in correct place., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for reviewing the patch.
Updated the patch as per your comments
Please review., Just before committing, thought it would be better if generic usage is mentioned. Like below.
"Run a Debug Admin to execute HDFS debug commands"

Even if some more commands are added in future, this message need not be changed.

[~andreina], Can you update the patch as mentioned?, [~vinayrpet] , updated the patch as per your comments .
Please review., Committed to trunk and branch-2.

Resolved a little conflict in branch-2, as everything is not in sorted order in branch-2., Attaching the branch-2 committed patch for reference., Thanks [~andreina] for the contribution., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8091 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8091/])
