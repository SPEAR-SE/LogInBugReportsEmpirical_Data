[I experience the same behaviour with the OpenJDK's IcedTea JVM, but I suspect that the SIGSEGV has to do with the inner workings of the JVM. So, this is not a bug.

The Hotspot JVM generates and handles the SIGSEGV signal. (see 7.4.3, 9th bullet in http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/tsg/TSG-VM/html/bugreports.html )
The stack trace in the description confirms that the SIGSEGV occurred in code generated by the JVM.

Just simply issuing the GDB command 'continue' will do the trick., By the way, the JVM uses SEGV internally, so this is expected.]
