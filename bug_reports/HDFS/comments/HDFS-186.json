[I have put a temporary directory with 500 files. then they are all displayed in my web browser (ie6). My hadoop's version is 0.9.1, Can we get this fixed in 0.13?
, I just loaded 2000 files to test this. The web browser loads the list just fine.

Even with larger numbers, I think it'd only take time depending on the NN's responsiveness. Probably best not to browse such directories in the browser page by page and get to things directly via the URLs.

Resolving as not a problem. (This was filed circa '07), 2000 is not a sufficient test.

If you try to browse a dir with significantly more (10x+ and more), the browser takes several minutes to load.  It would be better if the dfs jsp paginated large dirs. just as it does blocks., Gave another try with 10k, looks good still, but my NN isn't really under load and the transfer was over localhost.

Agreed on pagination and thanks much for reopening with that idea (although this bug was related to the page not responding _at all_ back then), but wouldn't that be a waste of NN's resources even then since the NN does not have a way to query only N:M items of a list? Cause otherwise, the same amount of data would require transferring, and lead to the same problem again.

Thoughts, Allen?]
