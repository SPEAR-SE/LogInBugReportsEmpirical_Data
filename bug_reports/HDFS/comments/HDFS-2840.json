[localhost.localdomain is RedHat centric and will certainly fail on other rpm distros, This is an issue in systems where /etc/hosts is not properly configured for the loopback

The loopback definition should be:

  127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost

It seem the system had:

  127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain



, it seems there is no standard for what goes first, we'll have to change the test to test for both., changing assertion to check for containing 'localhost' instead of equals, wrong attachement name, same patch this time with correct JIRA in the name., -1 overall.
