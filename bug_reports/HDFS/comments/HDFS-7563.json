This message is automatically generated., Hi Hari,

I think HDFS-6361 fixed the issue. Would you please verify whether you have HDFS-6361 fix? thanks.
, I believe it's similar but not the same since that was in a different class updateMapInternal in 2.4.0 and iirc this static mapping functionality for the NFS gateway was added by ATM in version 2.5.0 and I'm running 2.6.0 whereas HDFS-6361 was fixed in 2.4.1 earlier this year.

I also followed the java stack trace to the code itself as detailed above to see the line as described above which is why I believe it's an int vs long issue on that recently added static mapping functionality from 2.5.0.

Reproducing should be as simple as adding a 4 billion UID to /etc/nfs.map and restarting HDFS NFS gateway., HI Hari, thanks for the explanation, ATM is not available and I will look into.
, Thanks Hari for reporting the issue.

I uploaded a patch to reuse existing code introduced for HDFS-6361. 

Hi [~brandonli], thanks your help with HDFS-6361 earlier. The patch here is very small, wonder if you could help doing a review? 

Wish you all a happy new year!
