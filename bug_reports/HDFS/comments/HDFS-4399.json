[I'm not sure why this is happening in the yarn builds.  I can't reproduce it when run manually.  None of the other precommit builds are seeing it.  I'll take a look at the build box to see if its different somehow., I was wrong looks like HADOOP and HDFS precommit also see same error., I'm not seeing these on RHEL. They show up as binary files.  Perhaps Ubuntu is treating them different.  Since everything in that directory is supposed to be images anyway simply exlude anything in that directory from the checks., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
