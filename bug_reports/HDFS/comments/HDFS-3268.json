[Modified {{Hdfs}} to not overwrite the token service.  Changed {{DistributedFileSystem}} and {{Hdfs}} to call down into {{DFSClient}} to get the token service.  This simplifies the code and eliminates a false coupling between the filesystem and feature of the underlying {{DFSClient}}., lgtm, except a typo in this comment:
{code}
+   * Get a canonical token service name for this client's tokens.  Null should
+   * tokens if the client is not using tokens.
{code}, Fixed the comment I butchered, and serendipitously noticed that I wasn't checking for null., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
