[So there are two cases for {{InvalidMagicNumberException}}:
*. failed handshake for encryption.
*. failed handshake for data transfer protection (only available after 2.6.0)

A simple way is change the log message to something like:
{quote}
Failed to read expected handshake from client at .... Perhaps the client is running an older version of Hadoop which does not support the correct handshake.
{quote}

Or we can distinguish these two kinds of failure and give different log messages.

This message is automatically generated., Hello, Yi.  Thank you for investigating this and posting a patch.  I have a possible idea for distinguishing the 2 cases.  We throw {{InvalidMagicNumberException}} from {{SaslDataTransferServer#doSaslHandshake}}.  Within this method, we have the information we need to distinguish between the 2 cases:
* {{if (dnConf.getEncryptDataTransfer())}}, then it's the encrypted case.
* {{if (dnConf.getSaslPropsResolver() != null)}}, then it's the data transfer protection case.

After checking that, we could throw exceptions with different messages depending on the case.  This could either be done with 2 distinct subclasses of {{InvalidMagicNumberException}} or adding some kind of type tag as a member.  For the text of the messages, I suggest:

{code}
        LOG.info("Failed to read expected encryption handshake from client " +
             "at " + peer.getRemoteAddressString() + ". Perhaps the client " +
             "is running an older version of Hadoop which does not support " +
            "encryption");
{code}

{code}
        LOG.info("Failed to read expected SASL data transfer protection handshake from client " +
             "at " + peer.getRemoteAddressString() + ". Perhaps the client " +
             "is running an older version of Hadoop which does not support " +
            "encryption");
{code}

This message is automatically generated., The test failures are not related, all them passed in my local env., Hi, Yi.  This looks good.

This is really minor, but I wonder if it's possible to simplify the patch by avoiding changing the signature of {{SaslDataTransferServer#doSaslHandshake}}.  The {{handshake4Encryption}} is {{true}} if and only if {{dnConf.getEncryptDataTransfer()}} is also {{true}}.  We could check {{dnConf}} directly and avoid the need to pass around an additional flag.  Let me know if you agree., Thanks Chris for the review.
