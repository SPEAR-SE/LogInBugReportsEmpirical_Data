[Some issues could have been placed under Release 0.21.1 sections instead of Release 0.22.0 or Release 0.21.0 sections. So it should be an "intelligent" merge.
I checked other projects, they have only one Release 0.21.1 section.
Branch 0.23 has the same problem as trunk., stale, reopening--I checked the wrong changes file. :), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

It would better to remove the other line - the top one, rather than the bottom. That way we will merge the middle section to 0.22 release. It seems that most of those jiras were actually committed to 0.22 not 0.21.1, Oh I get it now.
