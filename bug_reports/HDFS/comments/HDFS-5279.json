[I'm attaching a patch to add guards against a null {{FSNamesystem}}.  I did a full review of the JSP pages, and I think this patch covers everything.  I also skipped rendering the "Browse filesystem" hyperlink when the {{FSNamesystem}} is null, because there is no way for that page to do anything meaningful before initialization of the {{FSNamesystem}}.  I've added several tests that pass null to the {{NamenodeJspHelper}} methods.  I also manually tested a browser opening all of these pages before the {{FSNamesystem}} is initialized., [~cnauroth], how about making a change in the web UI to say "NameNode is initializing" instead of giving either empty string or 0 as count when FSNamesystem is null?, Thanks, [~sureshms].  I'm attaching version 2 of the patch, which sets an "initializing" label and refactors some duplicated code for generating the label behind a helper method.  Regarding the 0 counts, this was part of the XML output, and I figured it was safer to emit the exact same XML structure with 0 values, just in case of compatibility problems with anything that parses that XML and isn't equipped to handle missing elements or new elements., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

, I have committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.1-beta.  Suresh, thank you for the code review., I ended up needing a slightly different patch when I merged down to branch-2.1-beta.  This is because {{generateSnapshotReport}} doesn't exist in branch-2.1-beta.  This was added in HDFS-4096, which targeted 2.3.0.  I'm attaching the branch-2.1-beta patch, just FYI., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #350 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/350/])
