That one added connect timeouts and read timeouts to the sockets opened by {{WebHdfsFileSystem}}., I noticed extra new lines in test cases, but the backport itself looks good., Remove the extra lines, +1 The patch looks good., [~cnauroth], I am working on backporting HDFS-3180, I will put the patch on that ticket or create a new Jira., I've committed this to branch-0.23. Thanks for working on the patch, Rob., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #614 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/614/])
