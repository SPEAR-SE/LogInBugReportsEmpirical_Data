[HADOOP-8689 made an incompatible change and moved fs.trash.interval to server side. When you ran this test, is trash enabled on the server side? If it is, there is no way to disable it on client side!, bq. Expected that the file doesnt go to Trash and gets deleted directly.
The -skipTrash option will delete the file immediately., Yes, trash is enabled in tests on server side.
So looks like its expected behavior in that case., Can you run this test with -skipTrash, as Daryn suggested. If -skipTrash does not work as expected, this is a more serious problem., That is run rm with -skipTrash and trash is enabled on the server side., Never mind, I just checked the code, skipTrash will work and there should not be an issue.

Shall I close this bug as Not A Problem?, Yea should be okay to close as Not a Problem]
