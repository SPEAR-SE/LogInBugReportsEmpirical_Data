[We saw a case where local disk was corrupt and we were unable to read edits from the disk. We used to hit Input/Output error while reading the edits midway. SecondaryNameNode pulls fsimage,edits and it has to make sure we got all of the bytes. One way is to make sure the file size matches as expected. , Is this still an issue?  I'm guessing no?, This is fixed by HDFS-903 in a more generic way, I believe.]
