This message was automatically generated., The fix looks good to me but the patch cannot be applied to trunk. Hi [~zhz], would you rebase the patch?, Thanks Akira for reviewing! Attaching updated patch to resolve conflict with HDFS-6682., Thanks [~zhz] for updating the patch. 

bq. The patch appears to introduce 1 new Findbugs (version 3.0.0) warnings.

Detail: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/11813/artifact/patchprocess/patchFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs.html

I'm okay with synchronizing {{clear()}} method to fix the warning., Great catch Akira! It seems the findbugs link in the Jenkins report is broken.

I agree {{clear}} should be synchronized. Updating the patch. The two reported test failures pass locally., \\
