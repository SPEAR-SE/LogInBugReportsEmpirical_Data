[I would like to work on this issue. [~daryn] please assign back if you have already started to work on this., bq. Ideally last contact for nodes that never connected would be "never" instead of the epoch or boot time.
AFAIK, Nodes those never connected will never show even in 'Dead' nodes list. Because NN doesnt persist Nodes information.
'dead' nodes from NN UI are only those nodes which are connected but got lost.
Am I missing something here?

Also for the available dead nodes list, Can you confirm similar problem exists in new HTML5 UI?]
