[Be aware that this document is different in trunk due to the shell rewrite.

, Also: 

It's worth noting that your replacement balancer command does something slightly different.  The previous version starts it as a daemon.  If it was intentionally meant to be a daemon, then we need to add a {{--daemon start}} to the replacement.

There's likely other fixes that need to go in place now that more of the shell rewrite is in place.  (e.g., get rid of all of the hadoop-daemon commands), Thanks [~aw] for the comments.
I agree with your point . 
Shall we update the command to *start-balancer.sh -policy* which would be common to both branch-2 and trunk, bq.  Shall we update the command to start-balancer.sh -policy which would be common to both branch-2 and trunk

No, because sbin/* is mostly deprecated in trunk.  This needs to be two different patches for the two different branches., Thanks [~aw] for the comments.

Attached separate patches for trunk , branch-2 and branch-2.7.0 (as the fixes are different in each branch).
Please review., \\

This message was automatically generated., All changes are looks good to me. +1 for all.

[~aw], do you also want to take a look?

Will wait for a day before commit.
-Thanks, The given trunk patch appears to be missing the same fixes as the branch-2 patch.  Also, if we're going to bother with this, let's make it complete:  all of the sbin commands should get replaced with their equivalent bin versions since sbin is mostly deprecated., Thanks [~aw] for the comments.

bq. The given trunk patch appears to be missing the same fixes as the branch-2 patch
In trunk already command is updated correctly using hdfs as :
{noformat}
[hdfs]$ $HADOOP_PREFIX/bin/hdfs --daemon start balancer [-policy <policy>]
{noformat}

bq.  Also, if we're going to bother with this, let's make it complete: all of the sbin commands should get replaced with their equivalent bin versions since sbin is mostly deprecated.

Currently the sbin commands used are :
{noformat}
sbin/refresh-namenodes.sh
sbin/distribute-exclude.sh
sbin/stop-dfs.sh
sbin/start-dfs.sh
{noformat}
And for above commands there is no alternative yet. 

Please correct me if iam wrong ., bq. In trunk already command is updated correctly using hdfs
bq. And for above commands there is no alternative yet.
Sounds good., Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7
