[Here's a patch which addresses the issue. Determining the NN's info server now tries to use the configured HTTP address, but falls back on the configured NN RPC hostname + the configured HTTP port if the NN HTTP address is INADDR_ANY.

In addition to the included automated test, I've also tested this patch manually using fsck and verified that it correctly determines a resolve NN HTTP address when dfs.namenode.http-address is left at the default value., +1 looks good, +1 overall.
