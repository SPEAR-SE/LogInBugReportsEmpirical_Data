    HDFS-13514. Avoid edge case where BUFFER_SIZE is 0

    As reported in [HDFS-13514](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-13514), there is a potential bug in the following code block:
    ```
    byte[] data = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];
    long size = 0;
    while (size >= 0) {
      size = in.read(data);
    }
    ```
    where BUFFER_SIZE is 0
    I believe switching to a simple do/while can fix this.

, Please ignore PR #374; after I saw the similar HDFS-13513 I needed to pull that PR back to sort out my local branches. #376 contains the same changes.]
