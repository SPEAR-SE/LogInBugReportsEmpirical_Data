[The attached patch ports the sh scripting in the distribution build to Python.  It wasn't possible to use only Maven plugins (like maven-antrun-plugin with a <tar> task), because they mishandled permissions and symlinks in the built tarballs.

I tested all of the following build variations:

Windows: mvn -Pnative-win -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package
Mac: mvn -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package
Ubuntu: mvn -Pnative -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package
Ubuntu: mvn -Pnative -Pdist -Dtar -Drequire.snappy -Dbundle.snappy -Dsnappy.lib=/usr/local/lib -DskipTests clean package

This works on Windows.  Additionally, on Mac and Ubuntu, I compared the built tarballs from before and after my changes.  I confirmed that the resulting tarballs have exactly the same contents, including permissions and symlinks.
, +1 Looks Good To me.
One nit.
Please consider using os.path.abspath(os.path.join()) instead of normpath for cross platform sake. But it's just for code readability sake. I will leave it to you.
{code}
>>> os.path.abspath(".")
'/Users/raja/work/repos/'
>>> os.path.abspath("../")
'/Users/raja/work'
>>> os.path.normpath("../../")
'../..'
>>> os.path.normpath("..")
'..'
>>> os.path.normpath("..")

{code}, Raja, I am attaching an updated patch that incorporates your advice to use abspath and / where applicable to improve readability. I verified that this works cross-platform by retesting all build variations., +1 LGTM, +1. Committed to branch-trunk-win. Thank you Chris. Thank you Raja for the review.]
