[[~shv]: I can work on this jira.
Let me know or re-assign to yourself if you are planning to work on this by EOD otherwise I will start working on this  from tomorrow., Hey [~shahrs87], thanks for volunteering.
One thing though, this should be dependent on HDFS-10301. It wouldn't make sense to collide the two. I'll re-link issues to emphasize this., Moving target version to 2.7.5 due to 2.7.4 release., Moving target version to 2.7.6 due to 2.7.5 release.]
