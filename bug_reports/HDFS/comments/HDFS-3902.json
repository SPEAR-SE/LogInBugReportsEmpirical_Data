[Since HDFS-3828 fixed the block scanner to not repeatedly rescan small blockpools, the following test in TestDatanodeBlockScanner times out after 13 minutes in {{waitReplication}}:
{code}
207     assertTrue(MiniDFSCluster.corruptReplica(0, block));
208     assertTrue(MiniDFSCluster.corruptReplica(1, block));
209     assertTrue(MiniDFSCluster.corruptReplica(2, block));
...
219     // We now have the blocks to be marked as corrupt and we get back all
220     // its replicas
221     DFSTestUtil.waitReplication(fs, file1, (short)3);
222     assertTrue(DFSTestUtil.allBlockReplicasCorrupt(cluster, file1, 0));
{code}
That assertion seems very odd to me: it claims that a replication=3 block with two corrupt replicas should report 1 location, but once we corrupt the third replica the block should report all three (corrupt!) locations.

While validating this test regression, I found that TestDatanodeBlockScanner varies its completion time between 1.5 and 12 minutes when run under {{mvn test}}., bq. That assertion seems very odd to me: it claims that a replication=3 block with two corrupt replicas should report 1 location, but once we corrupt the third replica the block should report all three (corrupt!) locations.

Oddly enough, this is the expected behavior, AFAIK., Copied from HDFS-3828:

bq. TestDatanodeBlockScanner did not run as part of the precommit build. It's under o.a.h.hdfs. Would have it run if it was under o.a.h.hdfs.datanode? If so, we should move it., bq. TestDatanodeBlockScanner did not run as part of the precommit build. It's under o.a.h.hdfs. Would have it run if it was under o.a.h.hdfs.datanode? If so, we should move it.

It did run as part of the pre-commit build (you can see it in the full log output [here|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/3153/consoleFull]) but looks like there's a bug (in Surefire? in test-patch.sh?) that fails to report a test which times out entirely as having failed., I reproduced this as well, filed HDFS-3910 to make DFSTestUtil#waitReplication bail so we get a clean test failure in this case., Due to HDFS-1371, the {{IOUtils.copyBytes}} in testBlockCorruptionPolicy does not report a fully corrupt block as corrupt, so testBlockCorruptionPolicy has been broken for a long time. The breakage was hidden by the overly fast rescanning in HDFS-3828.

In order to fix this, Todd suggested we should directly run the block scanner on each DN, which requires some straightforward tooling (DataNodeTestUtils#runBlockScannerForBlock and a few @VisibleForTesting annotations).

After this patch, TestDatanodeBlockScanner still fails about 1/5 runs in testBlockCorruptionRecoveryPolicy2. That's due to a separate test issue also uncovered by HDFS-3828., Attaching hdfs3902.txt which fixes the reliable test failure in testBlockCorruptionPolicy., bq. TestDatanodeBlockScanner still fails about 1/5 runs in testBlockCorruptionRecoveryPolicy2. That's due to a separate test issue also uncovered by HDFS-3828.

The failure scenario for this one is a bit more tricky.  I think I've captured the scenario below:
# The test corrupts 2/3 replicas. 
# client reports a bad block.
# NN asks a DN to re-replicate, and randomly picks the other corrupt replica.
# DN notices the incoming replica is corrupt and reports it as a bad block, but does not inform the NN that re-replication failed.
# NN keeps the block on pendingReplications.
# BP scanner wakes up on both DNs with corrupt blocks, both report corruption.  NN reports both as duplicates, one from the client and one from the DN report above.
# since block is on pendingReplications, NN does not schedule another replication., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Nice debugging Andy.  +1 to this patch, let's pull the 2nd failure scenario you describe out to another jira and address there.

The test failures are unrelated, I filed HDFS-3930 for TestBPOfferService. TestWebHDFS and TestPersistBlocks both failed due to networking issue (connection refused to a grid machine)., I filed HDFS-3931 for the issue with testBlockCorruptionPolicy2.

I've committed this and merged to branch-2 and branch-2.0.2-alpha. Thanks Andy!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2788 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2788/])
