[In the log from the build, the deletion happened 3 seconds after setReplication was done. The log shows that triggerHeartbeat() didn't work, because it raced with block report and lost. As a result lastHeartbeat was reset to the block report time and heartbeat wasn't sent right away. The 3 second delay can be explained by this.

It seems that increasing the existing sleep to 3 seconds + slack will prevent this race., HDFS-4067 made it better but 1 second sleep isn't enough in some cases.

HDFS-342 was fixed by HDFS-4067 in most cases. In the latest build of 0.23 without HDFS-4067, this test took 641 seconds. After inserting 5 second delay, it finished in 18 seconds., The test timeout has been decreased to 1 minute from 5 minutes. If it loses the race, it fails even with 5 minute timeout., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~jingzhao], probably you are the best person to review this, since you understand the original issue., Sure, I will review this., bq. The log shows that triggerHeartbeat() didn't work, because it raced with block report and lost. As a result lastHeartbeat was reset to the block report time and heartbeat wasn't sent right away. 

I think you're right. When triggerHeartbeat() is called, the main loop of offerService may not be at the stage of waiting for the next heartbeat. In that case the next heartbeat will still need 3 seconds to happen.

+1 for the patch., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4100 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4100/])
