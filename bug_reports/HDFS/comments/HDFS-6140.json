[The attached patch fixes the bug by switching to a different {{URI}} constructor that takes care of URI escaping for characters like space.  I had written a unit test to cover this in HDFS-4944.  Unfortunately, the unit test had a bug, which is why we didn't catch this earlier.  I've fixed the test too, now passing real spaces in the path instead of pre-escaping them., I also plan to provide a branch-1 patch.  The bug is not present on branch-1, but the faulty test is there.  I'd like to correct the test in branch-1 too., +1 patch looks good., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

, I committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4.

I had mentioned that I wanted to patch the test in branch-1 too.  It turns out that when I did that, it exposed a different bug that we have in branch-1, but not trunk.  Since it's a different bug, I filed HDFS-6141 to address fixing branch-1 separately., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #517 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/517/])
