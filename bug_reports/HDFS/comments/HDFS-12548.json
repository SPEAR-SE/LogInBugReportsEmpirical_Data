[Possibly a completely separate issue, but Jenkins wasn't running at all on HDFS-12495 after submitting and resubmitting patches multiple times, I am moving this to 3.1.0 as it seems an one-off occurence. Feel free to revert if anyone has concerns. Thanks!, We plan to start merge vote of 3.1.0 on Feb 18, please let me know if any plan to finish this by Feb 18 or we need to move itÂ to 3.2.0., Changed target version to 2.10.0 since this is a branch-2 issue.

Per [~aw]'s [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-13272?focusedCommentId=16452535&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16452535], branch-2 hasn't managed to run its test properly in a long time. Judging from looking at a few log outputs, it looks like the HDFS tests always end up hanging on some test (not always the same one). I am wondering if there is some deadlock in the testing infra code (hopefully not in the production code).]
