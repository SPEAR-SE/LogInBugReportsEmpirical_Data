[A few options here, I think:

1) When we call recoverBlock for a client, we pass the client lease holder name to the DN. Then when the DN asks for a new generation stamp, it passes along the lease holder to the NN, who can reject if it's not the current lease holder. This would likely be difficult to do in branch-1 without breaking compatibility, but could be done in branch-2 given we have protobufs.

2) In the client, if the error message we get back from attempting recovery is that the generation stamp is out of date, then no number of retries is going to help, so we can immediately stop retrying at that point.]
