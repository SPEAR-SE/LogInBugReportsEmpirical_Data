[Typo {quote} 1. Start 1NN and IDN {quote}
Start 1NN and 1DN. , Please use target versions instead of fix version while rasing the bug. Fix versions will be updated once it committed and resolved., {quote}
Now DN1 is added into aboveAvgUtilizedDatanodes and DN2 into belowAvgUtilizedDatanodes. Hence overLoadedBytes and underLoadedBytes will be equal to 0. Resulting in bytesLeftToMove equal to 0. Thus balancer will exit without balancing the blocks.

Everything works as expected.  Nothing to balancer since both DN1 and DN2 are within threshold., Resolving as not-a-problem.  Please feel free to reopen if you disagree.]
