[Thanks for creating the JIRA Zhe. I'll be working on it. , After some investigation, although {{QUEUE_WITH_CORRUPT_BLOCKS}} is not scheduled for replication, it is needed to list corrupted blocks from {{FSNamesystem#listCorruptFileBlocks}}. This happens in scenarios like {{fsck -list-corruptfileblocks}} and NN WebUI. So I propose we close this JIRA for now.
BTW, seems I assigned myself at the same time as [~jagadesh.kiran] assigned, hence overwrote that one. Apologies!, Thanks Xiao! Good analysis! Closing this as invalid., No issues [~xiaochen] , Good Analysis ]
