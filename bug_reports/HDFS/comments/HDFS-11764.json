[Hi [~runlinzhang], could you please elaborate a little bit about how you ran into this? Looks like none of the subclasses of GroupMappingServiceProvider would ever return a null for getGroups(). And from which branch were you getting this? The line numbers in the image file do not seem to match any of trunk, branch-2.7 or branch-2.7.2, Thank you for your attentionï¼Œthe version is  branch-2.7.2 

When the default implementation JniBasedUnixGroupsMapping GroupMappingServiceProvider,
And nodemanager does not configure the group for the user, which causes the group to be null, which makes null judgment to avoid this problem]
