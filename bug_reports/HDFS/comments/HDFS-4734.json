This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch.  I verified by running the tests on Mac and Windows.  Thanks for fixing these, Arpit!, +1 for the patch., BTW it probably is a good idea to split this into separate common and HDFS patch. can you please create a common patch and mark this jira as dependent on it?, Thanks for reviewing Suresh and Chris!

This message is automatically generated., Arpit, there are lot of empty line changes in this patch. Can it be undone? Also should TestNodeFencer constants be reused in TestDFSHAAdmin?, Fixed the whitespace changes - sorry about that.

I didn't want to add a cross-package dependency between the tests. However I removed the duplication in TestDFSHAAdminMiniCluster., bq. I didn't want to add a cross-package dependency between the tests.

+1 for the patch. I will commit it once Jenkins +1s it.
