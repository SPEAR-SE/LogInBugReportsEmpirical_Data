[I think we should keep the default value to disabled, but the property and this value should be documented in hdfs-default.xml.

It'd also be nice (if not true already) to pretty print this value on NN startup, e.g. "30 minutes" rather than "1800 seconds". It'd actually be nice follow-on work to look for similarly unfriendly values in the logs and pretty printing them. There are some time-related function in DFSUtil (e.g. durationToString, datetoIso8601String), but feel free to write your own functions too., Thanks for the suggestion., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
