[It seems like the {{journalSet}} member is null. We should add a test for edit log retention on the 2NN., Changing affectsVersion to trunk, I bet this was introduced recently by HDFS-3573., Here's a patch which addresses the issue. This works by adding a generic edit log purging interface, which FSEditLog implements on the NN side, and a new inner class in the 2NN which also implements it in a way that's specific to the 2NN. NNStorageRetentionManager is augmented to take a reference to this interface, instead of to the FSEditLog concrete type.

In addition to the test provided here, I also tested this patch manually and observed that the NPE is gone from the 2NN logs, and that 2NN edit log files are purged appropriately from a pseudo cluster., - Why not make JournalManager extend PurgeableEditsStorage? And maybe rename PurgeableEditsStorage to PurgableLog?
- Seems better to refactor FSImage to take a NNStorageRetentionManager rather than have CheckpointStorage create one via super then immediatley re-create it
- In purgeLogsOlderThan you can just check f.getLastTxId() < minTxIdToKeep since EditLogFile first is always <= last.
- Nit: @param and @throws don't end w periods
- Nit: s/there's no/there are no/

This message is automatically generated., Thanks a lot for the review, Eli. Thispatch addresses all of your comments except for refactoring the FSImage constructor to take an NNStorageRetentionManager. The difficulty with doing so is that the NNStorageRetentionManager needs to take a reference to the edit log, which itself is constructed in the FSImage constructor. I agree that doing it the way I have here isn't the cleanest thing in the world, but I can't think of a cleaner way to do it. This is also consistent with the nulling-out of the editLog member that's also done in the SecondaryNameNode., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., - Wrt NNStorageRetentionManager, the new comment helps, think that's sufficient. 
- I was thinking introducing LogsPurgeable means we'd no longer need PurgeableEditsStorage (they're the same interface), make sense?
- The purgeLogsOlderThan declaration can be removed from JournalManager now, bq. Wrt NNStorageRetentionManager, the new comment helps, think that's sufficient.

Cool, thanks.

bq. I was thinking introducing LogsPurgeable means we'd no longer need PurgeableEditsStorage (they're the same interface), make sense?

Not sure what you're referring to here - I did remove the PurgeableEditsStorage interface.

bq. The purgeLogsOlderThan declaration can be removed from JournalManager now

Good point. Done., bq. Not sure what you're referring to here - I did remove the PurgeableEditsStorage interface.

Arg, the old file was still around in my local repo that I use for reviews. Sorry bout that!

TestDatanodeBlockScanner is known to be flaky and passes for me locally. TestHftpDelegationToken appears to be currently failing on trunk.

, I'd like to merge this change to branch-2 as well. It's not strictly necessary because this bug doesn't exist in branch-2, but merging this restructuring of the code to branch-2 will make future merges in related code easier.
