[Colin, do you mean it' wrong to use CommonConfigurationKeys and we should use a class extending CommonConfigurationKeysPublic right?, I looked at this again, and I think the intention is just that you use {{CommonConfigurationKeys}} throughout your code, since that inherits a bunch of constants from {{CommonConfigurationKeysPublic}}]
