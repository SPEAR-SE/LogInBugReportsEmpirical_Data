[I solved this problem on opensuse 11.2 by installing a different version of java (sun java 1.6.0) and updating hadoop-env.xml to use it., the same issueon non virtual box with opensuse 11.2 and 
java version "1.6.0_20"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.9.1) (suse-67.1-i386)
OpenJDK Client VM (build 17.0-b16, mixed mode)

change of jre to downloaded from SUN 1.6.0_19  solved the issue
Looks like that some some class in OpenJDK  not support operation used by Hadoop, Similar problem, under openSuSE 11.3.   Solved the problem by installing an Oracle JDK and ensuring JAVA_HOME enivonment set properly in daemons as well as client.  , Seems this is nothing to do with DFSClient.  Revised the summary., Same problem, openSuSE 11.4 on x86_64.  I had this java stack installed:
linux-z6tw:/> java -version
java version "1.6.0_20"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.9.7) (suse-1.2.1-x86_64)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0-b09, mixed mode)

I yanked out the java-1_6_0-openjdk* version:
linux-z6tw:~> sudo zypper remove java-1_6_0-openjdk*

And Hadoop is now running MapReduce jobs!, Summing up, I still assume that HDFS won't run properly on 1.6.0.x OpenJDK, right?]
