[This was caused by the attempt to deep-copy in the PBCD Builder. Paths normalize the URI upon creation, so the single . simply gets thrown away. There doesn't seem to be a way to deep-copy a Path, but at the same time it doesn't look like you can mutate a Path either.

This didn't crop up on the other relative path tests because they aren't a single ".", so I added a unit test for that. Also tested manually via CacheAdmin., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. This was caused by the attempt to deep-copy in the PBCD Builder. Paths normalize the URI upon creation, so the single . simply gets thrown away. There doesn't seem to be a way to deep-copy a Path, but at the same time it doesn't look like you can mutate a Path either.

I took another look and you are right.  Although the Path does make its URI accessible to the outside world, the URI has no methods that could be used to mutate it.

Can we merge {{testSingleDotPath}} into another junit test?  It just seems kind of like overkill to set up a whole DFSCluster just to see if a PBCE with "." as the path can be added and then removed.  It would be nice to keep test execution time down.

+1 once that's addressed, Thanks Colin. I combined the test into one of the other ones in the file. Let's see what Jenkins thinks., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
