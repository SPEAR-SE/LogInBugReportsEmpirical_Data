[A patch for review., +1. , The patch passed all unit tests.

It's too trivial to add a unit test., I've just committed this., I propose that we backport this to 0.20? This is a very simple and row risk fix and helps applications that depend on the correct offset being recorded inside Checksumexception. If folks agree, then I will pull this into 0.20 as well., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #65 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/65/])
