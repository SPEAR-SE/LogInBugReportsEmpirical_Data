[[~wheat9] Thank for very much for filling this. 

Where should I add document to? , Thanks for the follow ups. Based on the discussion on HDFS-6673, I think it is necessary to document that:

* Assumptions. The tool assumes that the LevelDB has to be fitted into the memory, otherwise it will lead to one seek per inode.
* Scope of applicability. As the tool might trash the system when processing large fsimage, it is reasonable to state that it does not work with large fsimage and to ask the users to use the legacy oiv tool.

It might also makes sense to state the tool as experimental and unstable so that we can continue to improve it without having the worries of maintaining compatibility., I think it is best to get it done before 2.7 is out. A simple change is to mark the tool as experimental should be sufficient., Thanks to bring it up, [~wheat9]. I will post the document no later than earlier next week., Mark {{hdfs oiv}} delimited processor as an {{experimental}} feature. Also update {{HdfsImageViewer.md}} to reflect the changes.
