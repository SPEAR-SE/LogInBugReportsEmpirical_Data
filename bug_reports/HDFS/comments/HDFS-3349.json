[With the commit of HDFS-2617 to trunk/branch-2, this now works if the user running `hdfs dfsadmin -fetchImage' has Kerberos credentials in their local ticket cache. Given that, lowering the priority of this JIRA., Trying with lack of credentials throws the proper response back (No tgt). I think this is stale given Aaron's comment as well, marking as resolved.]
