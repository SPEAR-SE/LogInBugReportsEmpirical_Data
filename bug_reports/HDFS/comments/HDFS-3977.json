[Hi Arpit. This was explicitly changed in HDFS-3446 and marked there as Incompatible. I think it is much better to error on startup with a meaningful error message than to silently ignore the file when it can't be read. The issue with having just a WARN is that most admins won't notice, given our logging is so noisy., Thanks Todd.

Resolving it as invalid.]
