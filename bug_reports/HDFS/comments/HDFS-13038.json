[Don't agree with the patch.  There's no formal posix spec for acls.  This patches appears even more restrictive than linux by requiring path read access instead of possibly parent read access.  Linux docs for getfacl state:
{panel:title=PERMISSIONS}
Process with search access to a file (i.e., processes with read access to the containing directory of a file) are also granted read access to the file's ACLs. This is analogous to the permissions required for accessing the file mode.
{panel}

This is confusing at best. It implies parent "search access" equals "read access".  "Search access" means execute bit regardless of read bit – which is what hdfs enforces today.  Please test how linux actually works and I'll verify when time permits., Hdfs is following the same conventions as linux so I'll close this jira.

I just made a dropbox directory "getfacl-test".  Added a file "f" only readable by me with an ACL for kihwal:
{noformat}
$ whoami
daryn

$ find getfacl-test  -ls
2006111485    0 drwx--x--x   2 daryn    users          60 Jan 24 19:10 getfacl-test
2006109820    0 -rw-------   1 daryn    users           0 Jan 24 19:09 getfacl-test/f

$ getfacl getfacl-test/f
# file: getfacl-test/f
# owner: daryn
# group: users
user::rw-
user:kihwal:r--			#effective:---
group::---
mask::---
other::---
{noformat}


I can still do getfacl on a file using a user with no permissions to the file.
{noformat}
$ whoami
hadoopqa

$ find getfacl-test -ls
2006111485    0 drwx--x--x   2 daryn    users          60 Jan 24 19:10 getfacl-test
find: `getfacl-test': Permission denied

$ ls -l getfacl-test/f
-rw-------+ 1 daryn users 0 Jan 24 19:09 getfacl-test/f

$ cat getfacl-test/f
cat: getfacl-test/f: Permission denied

$ getfacl getfacl-test/f
# file: getfacl-test/f
# owner: daryn
# group: users
user::rw-
user:kihwal:r--			#effective:---
group::---
mask::---
other::---
{noformat}

So all you need is search (execute) perms to the parent directory.  If you think about it, the user/group shown by ls are just the default ACL.  Displaying additional ACLs isn't top secret information. ]
