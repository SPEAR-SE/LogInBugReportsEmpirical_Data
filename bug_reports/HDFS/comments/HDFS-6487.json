[Attaching patch for trunk and branch-2, In testSBNCheckpoints, after doEdits() it waits for the SBN to do checkpoint and immediately after that checks if the OIV image has been written. The race lies in between completion of checkpoint and checking for OIV image.
I have added a wait for writing the OIV image. This prevents the test from failing due to the race and if the OIV image is not written even after 5000ms, the test will fail. Which is what is expected., Hey Mit, nice find, thanks for working on this. Could you try using GenericTestUtils.waitFor rather than your own function? Also, it seems like 5s is pretty short, maybe we should wait for more like 30s or 60s instead?, Thanks Andrew for looking into the patch. Using GenericTestUtils.waitFor looks like a better option. I will update my patch.
For the timeour, 5sec works for me now. But I will increase it to 60s (It does not hurt in waiting a little longer. It will come out of the wait before that time anyways), {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
