[Here's a patch which fixes the issue. I tested this manually in a secure+HA setup and confirmed that it works as expected., +1 looks good

ATM mentioned offline that he tested doing checkpoints every 30s for 15 mins with a lowered ticket renewal., This is a 1-liner and only runs when security is enabled so new test case won't cover it.

I've committed this and merged to branch-2. Thanks ATM., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2320 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2320/])
