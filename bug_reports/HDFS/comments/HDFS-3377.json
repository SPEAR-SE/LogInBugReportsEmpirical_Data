[Hi Andreina.

There is no restriction on the number of blocks a datanode can move in one iteration. 

{quote}But MAX_NUM_CONCURRENT_MOVES in one iterations is hard coded to 5.{quote} 

MAX_NUM_CONCURRENT_MOVES - specifies the maximum number of concurrent block moves for balancing purpose at a datanode can be scheduled at one single point of time(range varies from cluster to cluster), not in one iteration. 

Following are the balancer outputs obtained by executing the adove mentioned scenario.

Here you can observe that, 
In the first iteration, the first 5 blocks had moved between 11:44:06 - 11:44:51 
and the next 5 blocks had been moved between 11:49:55 - 11:51:49. 
So at one single point of time (here the range is one minute) there are no more than 5 blocks movement from the datanode. 

Conclusion - Balancer can move more than 5 blocks from one datanode in one iteration but not at a single point of time. 
, Thanks Ashish for clarifying the point that 
MAX_NUM_CONCURRENT_MOVES is not the number of blocks which can be moved in one iteration. But it is the number of blocks which can be moved at a single point of time.
