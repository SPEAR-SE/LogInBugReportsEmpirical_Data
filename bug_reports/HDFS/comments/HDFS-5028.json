[This patch avoid to create iterator to prevent throw ConcurrentModificationException., Update patch for both trunk and 1.1.2., Hi zahoyunjiong,
I think your modification may reduce the likelihood of this issue but doesn't address essentially.
Instead, how about synchronizing "dfsclients"?
How do you think?, dfsclients was syncronizing.
The problem here is Iterator.
You can get more information here:

For short:
The iterators returned by this class's iterator and listIterator methods are fail-fast: if the list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.

c.abort() will remove c(a dfsclient) from dfsclients, so iterator generated in "for(DFSClient c : dfsclients)" will throw ConcurrentModificationException., Yunjiong, good catch.  Patch looks good.  Just a very minor nit: how about using dfsclients.get(0) instead of dfsclients.get(dfsclients.size() - 1)?, Thanks Nicholas.
Change "dfsclients.get(dfsclients.size() - 1).abort()" to "dfsclients.get(0).abort()"., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
