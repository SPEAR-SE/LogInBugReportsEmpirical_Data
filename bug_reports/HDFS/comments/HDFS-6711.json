[We need to confirm what is expected behavior for a read-only operation with respect to the audit log.  This appears to be inconsistent in the code right now.  {{getFileInfo}} writes to the audit log for both successful calls and access denied.  {{getContentSummary}} logs only for successful calls, not for access denied.  {{listStatus}} logs for both successful calls and access denied.  {{listCacheDirectives}}  and {{listCachePools}} log for both successful calls and access denied.  {{getXAttrs}} and {{listXAttrs}} log only for access denied., I'm linking this to HDFS-5730, which seeks to make the audit logging policy consistent across all APIs.  The decisions in that issue will influence our choice for how to fix this bug., This was fixed in HDFS-7218, so I'm resolving this as duplicate.]
