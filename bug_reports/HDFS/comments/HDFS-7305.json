[Looks more like the NPE is caused by possible null message contained in the Exception:
{code}
if (re.getMessage().startsWith(
          SecurityUtil.FAILED_TO_GET_UGI_MSG_HEADER)) {
{code}

{code}
public static RemoteException toRemoteException(final Map<?, ?> json) {
    final Map<?, ?> m = (Map<?, ?>)json.get(RemoteException.class.getSimpleName());
    final String message = (String)m.get("message");
    final String javaClassName = (String)m.get("javaClassName");
    return new RemoteException(javaClassName, message);
  }
