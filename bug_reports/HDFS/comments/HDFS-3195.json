[Appears to have been caused by HDFS-3168 per [this comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-3168?focusedCommentId=13245996&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13245996]., Patch attached. 

The throws clause was removed in HDFS-2301 and it looks like HDFS-3168 re-introduced it, which is kind of troublesome. I'll ping Nicholas on HDFS-3168 to double check that he didn't accidentally revert other changes., Nicholas, could you take a look at this?  I think HDFS-3168 needs to be backed out of branch-2 or HDFS-2564 should be pulled into branch-2 to fix the build., Whoops, comment race, sorry back to Eli., Actually, it looks like HDFS-3168 removed the throws from reassignLease, which should have been done when  HDFS-2301 (part of HA) was merged to trunk., ATM had a better idea, fixing this by merging HDFS-2564 to branch-2, I'll do that and close that out when I've committed and verified the build is fixed., I've merged HDFS-2564 to branch-2, which fixes this issue., Very sorry that I did not check branch-2 when merging HDFS-3168 last night and thanks for fixing it!]
