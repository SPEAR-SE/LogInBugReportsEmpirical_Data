[+1 for this; its a historical relic that actually loses data which different appenders (e.g the json appender) to not see data.

This could also be a time to move to SLF4J for a logging api?, bq. ...loses data which different appenders ...

Yes, agreed.  Just to expand on this a bit, I was prompted to file this jira by a use case for a custom appender that wants to forward the stack trace, but not the log message, to an external system for tracking.  Right now, this ends up missing out on the exceptions that were packed into the message field.

bq. This could also be a time to move to SLF4J for a logging api?

This seems reasonable as long as there is no risk of impacting library dependencies for downstream projects.  I see we already have slf4j as a dependency in hadoop-common, so I expect this is not a problem.]
