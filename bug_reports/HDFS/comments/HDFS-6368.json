[Ted, note that ImageServlet#validateRequest checks that the upload comes from an authorized user. If an attacker has compromised the NN or superuser account, many other bad things can also happen.

I guess we could still validate, but I'm inclined to close as "not a problem"., closing as not a problem, since this is only an issue if the cluster is already compromised.]
