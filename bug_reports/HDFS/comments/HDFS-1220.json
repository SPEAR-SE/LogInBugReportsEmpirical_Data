[I believe we fixed this in trunk by saving to an fsimage_ckpt dir and then moving it into place atomically once all the files are on disk. See HDFS-955?, Is this the same as HDFS-1221?, it is not exactly the same as HDFS-1221, although fstime suffered from corruption too
(which may lead to data loss). 
In this case, i think the update to fstime should be atomic, or NameNode some how
should anticipate reading an empty fstime., I think in both issues (this and HDFS-1221) you are missing the point discussed in HDFS-955 in details. 
We first write everything (fsimage, edits, fstime, and VERSION) into a separate directory. If everything is done successfully then this directory will be used as a startup point by the NN. If not the old directory is still present and NN will recover it and start from the previous image.
Does this answer your concerns?, The rename does not actually sync all the data from the kernel buffers to disk. Thus, it is theoretically possible that  even though the NN actually wrote out everything to disk and the machine rebooted, some data in any of the fstime/edits/fsimage could be missing. I think we should issue a fsync() on all these files before closing them.
