[Hi [~kevy]

Thanks for reporting this.
I just have a quick look at this but the usage seems correct to me. So it takes either 1) {{-f <host-file>}}, this option let you specify a file which is parsed by the regex {{[ \t\n\f\r]+}} or 2) {{<comma-separated list of hosts>}}, this option let you specify a comma separated list of hosts as arguments, this is parsed by {{StringUtils.getTrimmedStrings()}}. Am I missing anything?
