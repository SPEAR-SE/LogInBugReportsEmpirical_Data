[>    The question is why name-node returns the same blocks twice?
HADOOP-2576 could explain most of it. In fact Namenode could could delete the same block many more times on a busy cluster. HADOOP-2576 should drastically reduce these cases. To properly fix them, please look at the follow up jiras mentioned there., Could you please inter-link related issues. This would substantially simplify tracking their progress., It does not throw IOException now.  This is no longer a problem.]
