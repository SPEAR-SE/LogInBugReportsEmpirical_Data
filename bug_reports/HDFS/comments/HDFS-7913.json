[I dont see any hdfs-env.sh in trunk.
Will it be added by user?, Yes,, [~aw] can you please update..? Did not seen hdfs-env.sh..., We basically don't ship one because all the content is there in hadoop-env.sh.  It's there for future considerations and if someone wants to create one and use it.  , Oh!

Wait a sec.

Let me update the description.  Now I see the confusion.  I meant hdfs-config.sh .  haha!, Thanks for update, one more query here..HADOOP_HDFS_LOG_DIR only depreciated right..? HDFS_LOG_DIR was not there earlier.AFAIK HADOOP_HDFS_LOG_DIR only deprecated not HDFS_LOG_DIR...Please correct me,If I am wrong.., That's the problem:

HADOOP_HDFS_LOG_DIR was not supposed to be deprecated because it never existed in previous versions of hadoop.  HDFS_LOG_DIR was the one what did exist and it's supposed to be replaced with HADOOP_LOG_DIR in the new code.
, Here I got confused, which is from HADOOP-11460..did not seen HDFS_LOG_DIR..
   {code}
   # ...
   # this should get deprecated at some point.
-  HADOOP_LOG_DIR="${HADOOP_HDFS_LOG_DIR:-$HADOOP_LOG_DIR}"
-  HADOOP_HDFS_LOG_DIR="${HADOOP_LOG_DIR}"
-  
-  HADOOP_LOGFILE="${HADOOP_HDFS_LOGFILE:-$HADOOP_LOGFILE}"
-  HADOOP_HDFS_LOGFILE="${HADOOP_LOGFILE}"
-  
{code}

full list
, should we change HADOOP_MAPRED to MAPRED, for following..? If yes, will give patch... Correct me If I am wrong..
