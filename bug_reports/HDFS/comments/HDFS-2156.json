[This patch applies to both hdfs and mapreduce dependency mappings.  Dependency mapping is described as x.y.0 <= current => x.y.9999, where "x.y" is the compatible version., Correction to my comment, the range mapping should be the invert:

{noformat}
x.y0 >= current <= x.y.9999
{noformat}, Correction to my comment:

{noformat}
x.y.0 <= current <= x.y.9999
{noformat}, Remove jdk dependency per requested by Owen., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
