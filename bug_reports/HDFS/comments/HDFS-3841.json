[This patch only applies to branch-0.23.  The main difference between this patch and HDFS-3835 is that the DelegationTokenSecretManager is in a different location so FSImage was modified to use the new location.  Also The tests do not compile because HDFS-2579 is not part of 0.23 so DFS_NAMENODE_DELEGATION_TOKEN_ALWAYS_USE_KEY does not work.  In response I removed the test.  It seemed more risky to try and pull out DFS_NAMENODE_DELEGATION_TOKEN_ALWAYS_USE_KEY support then to simply remove the test., test-patch is not going to work.  I have run several of the HDFS tests manually without any failures. I will update the JIRA once my test run completes., This patch modifies TestCheckpoint, intentional? Sounded like from your above comment you mean to remove that diff., You are correct, by bad.  I commented it out to validate that it runs, and I forgot to remove it.  I'll upload a new patch.  Thanks for the catch., Patch updated without test., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Note that it's pretty easy to test this manually, if you wanted to, using a secure pseudo-cluster:

# Start up the NN and 2NN, with the checkpoint period set low.
# Get a DT using `hdfs fetchdt'
# Make sure the 2NN performs a checkpoint.
# Restart the NN, which on startup will merge the edits and fsimage.
# Without restarting the 2NN, make sure it successfully performs another checkpoint., Thanks for the reviews.  The HDFS unit tests all pass.  I asked Daryn to check it in when he gets a chance., Daryn just checked this in to branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #353 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/353/])
    HDFS-3841. Port HDFS-3835 to branch-0.23 (bobby via daryn) (Revision 1376485)

     Result = UNSTABLE
