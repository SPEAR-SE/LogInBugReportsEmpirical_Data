[Seems pretty straightforward. Here is my patch. Running HDFS tests locally right now., My results were 6 failed tests amd 1 error. The failures seem to be related to symlinks.
I am unsure about the "testSaveNamespace" failure though -- I will look into it; nor am I sure about the corrupt replicas.

Failed tests:   
  testCreateWithPartQualPathFails(org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestFcHdfsSymlink): HDFS requires URIs with schemes have an authority
  testCreateLinkUsingRelPaths(org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestFcHdfsSymlink)
  testCreateLinkUsingAbsPaths(org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestFcHdfsSymlink)
  testCreateLinkUsingFullyQualPaths(org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestFcHdfsSymlink)
  testSaveNamespace(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.TestCheckpoint): File /Users/plamenjeliazkov/Documents/workspace/hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/target/test/data/dfs/name1/current/edits_0000000000000000001-0000000000000000012 should exist

Tests in error:
  testCorruptBlockRereplicatedAcrossRacks(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.TestBlocksWithNotEnoughRacks): Timed out waiting for corrupt replicas. Waiting for 1, but only found 0, The failures in {{TestFcHdfsSymlink}} are likely unrelated.  (See discussion on HADOOP-9357 for full details.), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Plamen, what is the status on this, are the tests still failing, are they related to the patch?, Yes tests need updating. Will attach new patch soon., New patch -- TestCheckpoint and TestDFSUpgrade were failing because now we have less transactions being stored in the editsLog and therefore a lower than expected TxID; updated tests to reflect new TxID(s)., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
