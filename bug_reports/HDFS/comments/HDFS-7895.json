[Resolve as invalid. [~sershe] did not called {{getPathName}} before passing the path to DFSClient., Yes, I also wanted to add that {{FileSystem#getFileStatus}} (specifically the {{DistributedFileSystem}} subclass implementation) would have taken care of this automatically.  {{DFSClient}} is annotated {{Private}} and therefore not intended as a public API.]
