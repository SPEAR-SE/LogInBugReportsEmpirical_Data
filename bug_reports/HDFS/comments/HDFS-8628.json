This message was automatically generated., 1. hdfs command execution shows below output for '--renew' option.
{noformat} --renew             Renew the delegation token.  Delegation token must have been fetched using the --renewer <name> option.{noformat}
Same should be updated in doc too.

2. {noformat}	| *token_file_path* | Token info file path. |{noformat}
Description, 'File path to store the token into.' looks better for understanding., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for reviewing
Updated the patch as per your comments., \\
