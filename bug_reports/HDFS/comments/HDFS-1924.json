This message is automatically generated., This patch is for 0.20-append branch, This patch looks similar to HDFS-381. I'm hesitant to include it in 0.20-append since it has no serious ramifications and touches NN internals. Have you tested it on a real cluster for any length of time?, Thanks Todd for your comments.
We have tested in our cluster in long run scenarios also.

But i will check the HDFS-381 defect also. , After the analysis, the root cause for this issue should be HDFS-140, So, closing this as duplicate.]
