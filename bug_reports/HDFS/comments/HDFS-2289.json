, Alejandro - http://archive.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/ only has binaries upto 1.0.5 (we need to d/w jsvc from there).

Also, I'm having trouble with commons-daemon-1.0.5 since it has an additional dependency on libpcap - not sure it's worth it. OTOH I can get everything working with 1.0.3 - can we just stick to that version?, 'v1' patch, works with Mac a Linux amd64 commons daemon.

Don't have Solaris/i686/Win VMs to verify the  os/arch properties to resolve the commons-daemon TAR URL., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., 'v2' patch, order of setting props for the commons daemon download changed to ensure it works correctly later when adding other platforms.

I've tried to get it working with Windows, but the problem is that commons daemons for for windows comes only in ZIP and for Unixes comes only in TAR.GZ. This would complicate the logic and I'm not sure HDFS secure runs on windows.

*IMPORTANT*: 

Another thing regarding building in Windows. The current patch will fail in Windows as the commons daemon download will fail.

One solution is to move the commons daemon download into the native profile. Does this make sense?

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Alejandro, this looks reasonable for now. Testing on a secure cluster - I'll commit after., Updated patch, 2 changes:

# Setup hdfs pom.xml to d/w either i686 or x86_64 versions of jsvc binaries
# Change bin/hdfs to use libexec/jsvc rather than bin/jsvc.

This message is automatically generated., Why are we not rebuilding it? It is trivial to do and generates a much cleaner builds with dependencies to system libraries (like libc) being properly accounted for., (repeating comment from IRC):

There is a small nit, ant related. Ant does not let you change the value of a property once set, so you'd have to invert the setting of i686 and still you should add an arch="WHATEVER-i686-IS" so it can work with other Linux archs.

@Roman, it makes sense, I was just porting the existing functionality pre-Mavenization.

So the question is, do we do this as part of this patch, or as a follow up?, I can provide a follow-up patch. It is pretty trivial., 'v4' inverted condition order, first attempts more specific matching (for x86_64), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., it's not being built because there's no guarantee that the packages will be run on the same hardware they're being built on.  We originally were building it and then ran into problems where 32bit jvms were being used against packages built on 64bit machines., Thanks Jakob. I'll commit this and we can have a follow on jira to make this part of the native build - makes sense Roman? , Fixed a minor nit - changed d/w dir to hadoop-hdfs/target/downloads since:
# We don't want temporal files in main director 
# svn needs to ignore hadoop-hdfs/downloads along with git, I just committed this. Thanks Alejandro!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #798 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/798/])

, Arun,

The hdfs-project/downloads was not a nit, it was on purpose. That is why it was .gitignored as well. The reason is that if it is under target, everytime you do a 'mvn clean' you'll end up downloading it. Having it outside of target and .gitignored allows you to download it only once per workspace (if working offline mode you'll want this).

Would you mind amending the patch to the original download dir?

Thxs.

Alejandro, Arun, sure I can follow up with the patch on Mon. Couple of questions -- do I need to reopen this JIRA? Will the native build patch be included in 0.23?, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #774 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/774/])

, @Alejandro - please open another jira to fix the d/w, I still think it should be target, else we need to add svn:ignore etc., but happy to discuss. Apologies again.

@Roman - Please open another jira and I'm happy to commit to 0.23 if there is consensus. Thanks!, @Arun -- HDFS-2303 opened. Please comment over there.]
