[Here's the graph of the lock cycle., Confirming that this happens in practice, at least in tests. The TestDistributedUpgrade test is flaky due to this reason. We're capturing thread dumps of tests failing due to timeouts (HADOOP-8755) and here's the tread dump of TestDistributedUpgrade failure (see attachment). Thread #110 is blocked by #107 (or #109) and in turn #107 (109?) is blocked by #110. The first one acquired a monitor on the UpgradeManagerNamenode instance, and the second one got an fsLock, so both are waiting for each other. The test fails to start the cluster as DN heartbeats can't be processed by NN. 

, Given that we removed the "distributed upgrade" code recently, maybe we should just backport that patch to earlier branches to avoid this issue entirely? Thanks for digging into this, Andrey!, Yes, backporting would be helpful then. Can you initiate it please?]
