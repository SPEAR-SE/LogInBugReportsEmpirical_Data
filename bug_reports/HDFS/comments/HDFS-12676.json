[Thanks for reporting the issue. I am pretty sure this is fixed by HDFS-11445 + HDFS-11755.
What is the version you have?, hadoop-2.7.3ï¼Œbut i can't find the difference between the version 2.7.3 and the version 2.7.4 on the github source codes as follows:
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.BlockManager

private LocatedBlock createLocatedBlock(final BlockInfoContiguous blk, final long pos
      ) throws IOException{}

Is these exceptions repaired by modify other class codes?, Correct. Please check out the attached source code patch at HDFS-11445, HDFS-11755., Resolving it as a dup. Thanks @lynn for reporting it.]
