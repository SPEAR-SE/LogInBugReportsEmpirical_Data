This message is automatically generated., fixing the 2 findbugs issues., +1 for the patch.  The code looks good, and I tested successfully on Mac and Windows.

Very minor nit: Is the new class supposed to be named {{TestHttpFSCustomUserName}} instead of {{TestHttpFSCustomerUserName}}?

Thanks, Alejandro!

This message is automatically generated., Perhaps a silly question, but if the pattern is a "saga", why do we even have it?  Aren't we just putting more burden on the user to configure?, Daryn, different unix have different rules for the valid usernames, still they have rules., +1, the patch looks good to me.

Daryn - has Tucu addressed your concern?, Perhaps we should "end the saga" by letting the underlying OS decide what's valid, instead of using a config value that must be identical to what the OS considers valid.  Seems redundant, so -0, I won't stand in the way., Thanks, Daryn. I agree with what you're saying in principle, but that seems like a much more involved change for this little issue. Not sure it's worth it.

+1, I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks a lot for the contribution, Tucu, and thanks also to Chris and Daryn for the reviews., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3689 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3689/])
