[Hi Ramkrishna. Can you provide a unit test which shows this issue? It would be especially good to see such a test against 0.22, since HDFS-1073 will restructure all this code when it's merged into 0.23., Writing UT for this may be difficult to reproduce the scenario.

The steps that I followed to reproduce this issue are
	1. Start namenode and backup namenode
	2. Allow checkpointing to happen such that the edits.new file is created on the namenode.
	3. At this point kill the NN and BNN.
	4. Now start the NN and BNN.
	5. When checkpointing starts again we will get the above exception.


The exact problem comes in the loadFSEdits() api in  FSImage.java

Here if the loadFSEdits() api returns 0 then 

if (fsImage.recoverTransitionRead(dataDirs, editsDirs, startOpt)) {
          fsImage.saveNamespace(true);
}

saveNamespace() will not be invoked.

Kindly correct me if you find any problems in this.

This message is automatically generated., I have seen this bug in 0.22. Making it a blocker. Will review the patch [very] soon., It looks like this was probably caused by the bug fix HADOOP-5314. In 0.20, the NN would always save the image at startup due to 5314, and thus we wouldn't run into the issue described here.

Still working on understanding the issue, but this is one of the missing links., Not sure what introduced it, but 
The problem is that NN does not saveNamespace() when editsNew is present.
This only happens in Ramakrishna's scenario, when editsNew is empty. That is when you start the checkpoint, and fail NN before modifying anything in the namespace.

Deleting editsNew, is probably valid, but not consistent, since at this stage NN is in read-only mode. That is if something goes wrong we should leave the storage directory in exactly the same state as it was before the startup.

I propose to increment numEdits if editsNew exists. This will trigger saving namespace after loading. So just one line change:
{code}
. if (editsNew.exists() && editsNew.length() > 0) {
+   numEdits ++;
    edits = new EditLogFileInputStream(editsNew);
    numEdits += loader.loadFSEdits(edits);
    edits.close();
  }
{code}
Well, may be not one line as you need to increment even if {{editsNew.length() == 0}}.

Your test should work in this case as well. Could you please convert it to JUnit4 and use {{MiniDFSCluster.Builder}} instead of a direct constructor., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Thanks for your comments..
I have reworked on some of the comments.

I think you have reviewed the old patch and not the patch with the name
HDFS-1981-1.patch

Any way I have corrected some of the comments in the latest patch also

    *  As Konstantin said, please use Junit 4 (annotations API) instead of Junit 3, and use the MiniDFSCluster builder
	Already Addressed in previous patch.  
    * typo: NEW_EIDTS_STREAM
        have changed this to NEW_EDITS_STREAM
    * don't use the string constant "dfs.name.dir" - there are constants in DFSConfigKeys for this
        Updated 
    * "false == editsNew.exists()" ?? !editsNew.exists()
        Udpated
    * TODOs in the test case. don't swallow exceptions
        Updated
    * you can use IOUtils.cleanup or IOUtils.closeStream in the finally block inside of the block
        Updated
    * no need to clear editsStreams in teardown method - it's an instance var so it will be recreated for each case anyway
        Updated
    * what's the purpose of the setup which creates bImg? It's not used in any of the test cases.
       Instead of using the variable bImg, have now created an instance local level
    * assertion text is wrong: "image should be deleted" â€“ but it's checking that "edits.new" should be deleted.
	Fixed in the previous patch- as per the latest fix told by Konstantin, The patch looks good, except it is not compiling now.
You should not remove the two imports from FSImage.

In TestFSImage.testLoadFsEditsShouldReturnTrueWhenEditsNewExists()
- getNameDirs() should not take parameters
- FSImage does not have getStorage() method
- Also member conf is not used anywhere in the test, can be removed

If you could update the patch, I'll commit it., Hi Konstantin,
 Thanks for the comments.
Updated the patch on trunk.

I did not remove the getStorage API, because in latest trunk i can see that api in FSImage class.

{code}

  public NNStorage getStorage() {
    return storage;
  }

This message is automatically generated., Hi Konstantin,
 I have provided path on 0.23 version.
Are you expecting patch on 0.22 version? I think , we have not release 0.22 officially right. That is why i provided patch directly on trunk.
If you are expecting patch specifically on 0.22 branch, i can provide it.
is it required on 0.22 as well? 
Current patch can be committed on trunk.

--Thanks, Hi Uma. Since the merge of HDFS-1073 is imminent, and this bug is not present in HDFS-1073, I think it's best to target only 0.22 for this patch., Thanks Todd,
 I will update patch for 0.22 branch.
I think we can merge the tests in HDFS-1073 / 0.23 as well for more coverage. What do you say?

This patch is based on 0.22 branch. So, HDFS-1981_0.22.patch can not compile on trunk directly. , + 1 on both patches., I just committed this. Thanks Uma.

I agree with Todd this is mostly targeted for 0.22, but had to follow the procedures so committed to both trunk and the branch., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #811 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/811/])
