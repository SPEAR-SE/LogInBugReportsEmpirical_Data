[Looks like the issue here is that {{CAPABILITIES_SUPPORTED}} has not been correctly initialized because the enum {{Capability}} is not loaded?, [~jingzhao]: Daryn has a patch and he will upload on Monday.
I have to delete the previous comment since I copied the wrong user., Any update here? I can also upload a patch to fix if [~daryn] is busy., Yes, the enum is lazy initialized so it wasn't advertised.  Here's the patch we've been using internally to force a static init., Thanks for the fix, Daryn. +1 pending Jenkins., \\
