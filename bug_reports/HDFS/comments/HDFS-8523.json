[Attached an initial patch.
Please review., Update looks good.
Patch seems to be generated only for branch-2.7.  But same update needed in branch-2 as well.
[~andreina] can you update one more patch rebased against branch-2?
Because doc needs to be updated first in branch-2 and then merge to branch-2.7, resolving conflicts if any., \\

This message was automatically generated., I think for the latest patch, jenkins verified against trunk. Still its fine for this update, as both trunk and branch-2 are same for this issue.

But in future, if you want to run against specific branch (only major branches, ex: branch-2, HDFS-7285, etc), need to name the patch as following.
<issue-id>\-<branch-name>\-<patch-version>
ex: *HDFS-8523-branch-2-3.patch* NOT *HDFS-8523-3-branch-2.patch*, +1 for latest patch.
