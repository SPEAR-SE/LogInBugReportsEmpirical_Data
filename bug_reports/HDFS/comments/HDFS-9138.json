[Similar to HDFS-4732, this can be fixed by avoiding hard links in the checked-in tarball and instead using copies of the files., Here is a {{git diff --binary}} patch to fix it.  I haven't tried this with test-path in a while.  Let's see how it goes., Err... wait... I completely forgot about the work I had done in HDFS-8554.  :-)  Let me cancel this patch and rethink for a moment., Yes, my earlier HDFS-8554 patch fixed this already.  I was only seeing a test failure on an older branch.  I'm resolving this issue., [~cnauroth], just out of curiosity, what was the resolution on Windows?  Do we create the hardlinks there, or do we swap in the referenced file?, Hi [~cmccabe].  We create the hard links on Windows now.  In HDFS-8554, I changed the untar logic in {{FileUtil}} to support hard links on Windows.  When I created this issue, I was running older code, and I had forgotten that I already fixed root cause in HDFS-8554., Thanks, [~cnauroth].]
