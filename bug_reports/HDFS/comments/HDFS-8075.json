[[~sanjay.radia] - Thanks for filing this. Agree that HDFS could use more flexibility in this sense. Are you familiar with the discussion on HDFS-5223? Seems like this JIRA may have similar goals to that one., Here is proposal:
* Add a *second* layout version field (call it "compatible-layout-version") that states which version can safely read the image without data-loss.
** The ACL example will state that the previous version  can safely read the image without data loss.
** Truncate example is tricky: one can safely downgrade if the truncate operation was not used. We could add code to not allow such new features till finalize is done. Or we could say don't support downgrade for such a feature and simply mark the compatible-layout-version accordingly.

, Oops. I will close this as duplicate. I will  copy the description of this Jira to the HDFS-5223 since it has some good examples., Closed: duplicate of HDFS-5223]
