This message is automatically generated., Our code style use separated lines and { } for if-statements, i.e.
{code}
if (...) {
  ...
}
{code}, Patch LGTM  +1. An 'if' followed by a short clause all on one line is fine by me but if hdfs style-guide has it different, add brackets on commit?, Adding brackets., A little more background here: we use the official Java style guide, but with 2-space indents.  I thought there was some text in there about short "if" statements being OK to do on one line, but I don't see it in the guide.  Maybe it was always an unofficial convention?  Certainly there are a lot of examples of this in the code.  Anyway I'm not that concerned either way, so let's use braces., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~cmccabe], [Java coding style|http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-142311.html#449] says that we should avoid emitting braces:

{code}
The if-else class of statements should have the following form:

if (condition) {
    statements;
}

Note: if statements always use braces, {}. Avoid the following error-prone form:

if (condition) //AVOID! THIS OMITS THE BRACES {}!
    statement;
{code}

Right.  That's why I commented that "I thought there was some text in there about short "if" statements being OK to do on one line, but I don't see it in the guide."

Can I get another +1 on this?  Since we're being pedantic :)

It's clear that the findbugs warning in AbstractDelegationTokenSecretManager is not related, since this patch doesn't change that., +1 on v2, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6324 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6324/])
