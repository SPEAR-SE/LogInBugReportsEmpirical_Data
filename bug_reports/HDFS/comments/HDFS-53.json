[This affects emacs autosave files.  When a buffer is edited, emacs automatically creates a .#filename file which returns false when java runs an exists() test.  This means that I can't list directories where I have unsaved emacs buffers open., This issue is the same as HADOOP-7015, which has been fixed., yes, I just verified it. It looks duplicate of HADOOP-7015
Closing it as duplicate.
Amar, if you have any issues with it, please reopen it.]
