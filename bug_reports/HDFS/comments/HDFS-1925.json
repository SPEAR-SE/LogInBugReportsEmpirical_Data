[If no one else is working on this, I'll take a stab at it., Here's my first official patch!, I'm impressed by the valiant effort to make a regression test, but I think the test itself is too fragile for what's essentially a code cleanup. +1 on the fix but -1 on the test :) Assuming the test-patch comes back clean I'll commit just the fix part., -1 overall.
