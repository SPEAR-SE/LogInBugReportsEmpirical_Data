[{{FSDirectory.directoryMetrics}} reports two metrics - files_created and files_deleted. This is unnecessary as it is already covered by the NameNodeMetrics  "FilesCreated" and "DeletedFileOps".

I propose deleting file_created and files_deleted metrics from FSDirectory.directoryMetrics. With that directoryMetrics will be reporting nothing. We could leave it in FSDirectory for future use or delete it altogether., Changes:
# FSDirectory.java
#* Removed metrics with context name "dfs" and record name "FSDirectory". This was being used just to track files deleted. Moved the metrics for files deleted to NameNodeMetrics.
#* Not very happy with introducing an argument logReplay in unprotectedDelete and unprotectedRename to differentiate an operation while replaying edits log from user operation. The assumption in the code is - unprotectedXXX is called for both regular operation and operation while replaying edits. However, returning number of files deleted from these methods seems like a lot more change and the method signature will not be clean either. 
# TestNameNodeMetrics.java - Removed importing org.mortbay.log.Log. Also cleaned up the code a bit to get rid of some warnings.

Note removing metrics record "FSDirectory" is an incompatible change., New version of the patch with minor changes:
# unprotectedDeleted returns the number of deleted inodes and no longer takes logReplay argument.
# unprotectedRenameTo returns boolean to indicate the existing rename target was overwritten. logReplay argument to the method is removed., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
