Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/7799//console

This message is automatically generated., [~atm] These two failures are all related to balancer, which is not related to this patch., +1, patch looks good to me. It's fairly obviously trivially correct, so I don't think there's any need for a test on this one.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., It was fixed in HDFS-6774.]
