This message was automatically generated., The fix looks good. One minor nit is that logging at {{INFO}} can sometimes be noisy. I think end-users rarely care about the fact that it is talking to an older namenode. Let's make it {{DEBUG}}., Hi [~kihwal],

Thanks a lot for taking the time to look at the patch! I have addressed your comment by changing the log level. Please take a look and let me know if you have any other comments.

Regards,
Tony Wu, \\

This message was automatically generated., Since no test was run for {{hdoop-hdfs-client}}, I ran the tests manually. No need to run server-side tests, since this is client-only change.

, HI [~kihwal],
Thanks for taking the time to manually run these tests. I didn't know Hadoop QA does not kick off test runs for client changes. Will make sure I include my manual run results in the future.
Thanks,
Tony]
