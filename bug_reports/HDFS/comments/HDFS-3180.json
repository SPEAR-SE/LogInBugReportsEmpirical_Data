[Hi, Daryn.  I'm tentatively assigning this to myself to work on a patch for WebHDFS socket timeouts.  (It was unassigned.)  If you prefer to keep it, let me know, and I'll send it back.  Thanks!, Changing Affects Version/s and Target Version/s to target trunk and branch-2.  I'm going to post a patch later today for trunk/branch-2, but it also can be backported if needed., I'm attaching a patch that guarantees setting open and read timeout on the sockets opened by {{WebHdfsFileSystem}}.  This reuses the {{URLUtils}} class developed for HDFS-3166.  I've also added a new test suite that covers both connect and read timeout for all code paths that open a connection.

I ran all WebHDFS tests, including the new ones, on Mac, Linux, and Windows.  Everything passed consistently on all platforms., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
