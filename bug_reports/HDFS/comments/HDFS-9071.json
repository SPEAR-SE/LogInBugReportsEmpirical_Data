This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~He Tianyi] for reporting this issue, that was a good catch. 
bq. I've observed that chooseTargets in ReplicationWork may pass incomplete srcPath (not starting with '/') to block placement policy.
I agree .

But i doubt , is there any specific reason for going ahead to choose target (in ReplicationWork), after finding that srcpath is invalid/null , in the patch ?, Thanks for your time, [~andreina].

I think there may be compatibility issue if {{chooseTarget}} get skipped if srcPath is invalid, e.g. there are tests that would fail. 
, Kick jenkins again., \\
