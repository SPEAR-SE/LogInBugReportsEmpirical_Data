[Marking this as an incompatible change, since tSize is used in the external-facing C APIs., We should not change the type of {{tSize}}.  It would silently break everyone using libhdfs, causing crashes and memory corruption.  Instead, we should add a new API for creating files that takes a block size bigger than 32 bits.  The other uses of {{tSize}} are all places where 31 bits is enough (reading into and out of buffers which can't be larger than 31 bits anyway), The new hdfsStreamBuilder API added in HDFS-9541 allows users to create files with a block size bigger than 2 GB.

For the other places where tSize is used, a 4-byte number is appropriate.  It doesn't make sense to read/write more than 2 GB in a single call to {{hdfsRead}} or {{hdfsWrite}} (this is why the Java code uses {{int}} for those values).

Meanwhile, the size of files returned by {{hdfsListDirectory}} uses {{tOffset}} rather than {{tSize}}.  Unlike {{tSize}}, {{tOffset}} is typedef'ed as an {{int64_t}}

Closing as a duplicate of HDFS-9541.  Thanks, all.]
