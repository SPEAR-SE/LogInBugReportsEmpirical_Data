[Check whether fsimage exists before return., [~zhaoyunjiong], can you please add a brief description about why you resolved this as Not A Problem?, The first image storage dir always have fsimage file in it.
Restored image storage always append to the end.
So the first one must have fsimage in it., I made a mistake when I resolved this as Not A Problem.
Because   
for (Iterator<StorageDirectory> it = 
              dirIterator(NameNodeDirType.IMAGE); it.hasNext();)
    sd = it.next(); 
will return last StorageDirectory of image, but due to HDFS-5367, it may not have fsimage in it.  , Update patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12630250/HDFS-5396-branch-1.2.patch
  against trunk revision .
