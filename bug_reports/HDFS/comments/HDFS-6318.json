This message is automatically generated., The test failure is not related to this patch., Thanks [~azuryy] for reporting the issue and patch.
As of now, there are multiple Jiras [HDFS-6507, HDFS-5147] discussing same/similar problem you can also provide your inputs, i.e. handling certail DFSAdmin commands with HA setup.

Coming to your patch, current approach looks good. 
I have one question, how will you handle the failures here? In your current patch, if the command fails at first namenode it wont go to next. 
What if standby namenode is made down for maintainance ..? then this command may not even go to active namenode, if the standby namenode is first in the list.

Any thoughts.?, \\
