[Reverted changes to MiniDFSCluster ctor introduced via HDFS-3049., Wouldn't it make more sense to just add a constructor with the previous API?, The newly added, but already deprecated ctor (which broke MR1) isn't used at all...

So, it's better to not bother?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

+1   I've committed this, thanks Arun!, Thanks for fixing this, Arun.

I'm a little concerned that something like this could happen in the future.  MiniDFSCluster is currently marked as @InterfaceAudience.LimitedPrivate, @InterfaceStability.Unstable.
Should we change that to @InterfaceStability.Stable?  Or would be it be better to mavenize TestMapredGroupMappingServiceRefresh and the other MR tests that use MiniDFSCluster?, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #1098 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1098/])
