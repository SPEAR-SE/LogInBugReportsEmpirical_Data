[Upon further research, this affects only the branch-1 code. Not an issue for trunk., Patch for branch-1 that adds in the super-user privileges check akin to trunk., For trunk it was handled via HDFS-3331, (Change in the patch is akin to refreshNodes in FSNameSystem. Functions in the same way, so no tests are required. Patch compiles branch-1 build locally, but let me know if test-patch is still requiredâ€¦), +1  Since this is a 1-liner no test-patch is necessary., Committed to branch-1. Thanks Eli., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
