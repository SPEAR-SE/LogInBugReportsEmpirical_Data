[I was confused by looking at Test-Plan-for-Extended-Acls-2.pdf attached in HDFS-4685 . First scenairo mentioned in the issue works fine by giving executable permissions to User1. 

It would be helpful , if the following scenario is been updated in the Testplan. 


Scenario No : 18 
Summary     :
	set extended acl to grant Dan and Carla read acess.
 
		hdfs dfs -chmod -R 640 /user/bruce/ParentDir
		hdfs dfs -setfacl -R -m user:Dan:r--, user:Carla:r-- /user/bruce/ParentDir
		hdfs dfs -getfacl -R /user/bruce/ParentDir
Expected Result: 
		Extended Acls should be applied to all the files/Dirs inside ParentDir

In the above summary instead of giving just read permissions , executable permissions should also be given as below

	hdfs dfs -setfacl -R -m user:Dan:r-x, user:Carla:r-x /user/bruce/ParentDir, bq. Step 4: Now unable to write a File to Dir1 from User2
This is by specification. User2 needs EXECUTE permission to write a file to Dir1.

bq. Fetching filesystem name , when one of the disk configured for NN dir becomes full returns a value "null".
I suppose it has been fixed by HADOOP-10462. You will see the right value in the next release., {quote}

I don't think the plan should be updated because it is only to confirm if a permission is applied recursively., Closing this issue. [~andreina], please feel free to reopen this if you disagree.]
