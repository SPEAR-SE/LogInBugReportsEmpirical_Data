String... is essentially a String array right?

The advantage of this approach is - caller side one could pass variable number of args without having to explicitly construct an array., I committed the patch., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #660 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/660/])
    , Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #673 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/673/])
