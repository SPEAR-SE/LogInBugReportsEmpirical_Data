[Kiran, do you want to take a stab at fixing this. The relevant files are in: hadoop.committer/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/docs/src/documentation, Per HDFS-3458 we don't actually build/publish the forest docs. How about working on HDFS-3458 to convert the current ones to forest? The MAPREDUCE-4282 patch may already do this.]
