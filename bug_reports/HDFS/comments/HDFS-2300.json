[The exception thrown in TestFileAppend4 is correct but the expected message in the test is different. The attached patch fixes the expected message.

TestMultiThreadedSync is writing lots of debug messages in tight loop because the flusher threads are syncing in a tight loop., +1 for the patch. Can you please mark the Fix Version/s as 0.20-append., If no one chooses to port this patch to 0.20-append, perhaps we should go ahead and close this jira.]
