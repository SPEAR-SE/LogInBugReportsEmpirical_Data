[This patch changes:

1. Use {{StorageDirectory.getCurrentDir}} to construct {{FsVolumeImpl}} when adding the volume dynamically.
2. Changed removeVolume() to compare volumes using {{File#getCanonicalFile()}}. 
3. Added a test case to verify that a newly added volume can be located and removed., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

We can't ignore exceptions like this.  Anyway, I don't think we need the "canonical" filename anyway.  If someone is playing games with symlinks, that's their own problem, not ours.  Just get the absolute pathname, an operation that can't fail.

Changes like this are just churn that makes it harder to read the diff, so let's not

, [~sjlee0] backported this to 2.6.1, after fixing minor issues (with java diamond operator). I just pushed the commit to 2.6.1 after running compilation and TestFsDatasetImpl which changed in the patch.]
