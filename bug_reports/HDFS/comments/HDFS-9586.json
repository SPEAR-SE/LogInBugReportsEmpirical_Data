[FSNameSystem#listCorruptFileBlocks gets the list of corrupt blocks from UnderReplicatedBlocks.QUEUE_WITH_CORRUPT_BLOCKS queue.
According to below code, the block will be added into QUEUE_WITH_CORRUPT_BLOCKS queue only if there are zero decommissionedReplicas (This name is little confusing since this is the sum of decommissioning and decommissioned replicas).

{noformat}
if (curReplicas == 0) {
      // If there are zero non-decommissioned replicas but there are
      // some decommissioned replicas, then assign them highest priority
      if (decommissionedReplicas > 0) {
        return QUEUE_HIGHEST_PRIORITY;
      }
      if (readOnlyReplicas > 0) {
        // only has read-only replicas, highest risk
        // since the read-only replicas may go down all together.
        return QUEUE_HIGHEST_PRIORITY;
      }
      //all we have are corrupt blocks
      return QUEUE_WITH_CORRUPT_BLOCKS;
{noformat}
So all the blocks that go into QUEUE_WITH_CORRUPT_BLOCKS already has zero decommissioning replicas.

Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.

In theory, I think it is right. However when decommissioning nodes there may be false positives of block-missing error. It is another bug that I'm digging out.

I'm not sure why we need 
{code}
if (inode != null && blockManager.countNodes(blk).liveReplicas() == 0) 
{code}
in FSNamesystem.listCorruptFileBlocks, in theory the second condition should be always true. But because of the bug, we need this condition indeed, so I think we need another condition about decommissioning replicas., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
