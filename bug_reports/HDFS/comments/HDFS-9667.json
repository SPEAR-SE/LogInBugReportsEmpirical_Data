[Hi [~aderen], do you have an explanation for why the enum order matters? IIRC it should not.

Also as part of the 2.7.0 release we moved over StorageType to a different package. See HDFS-7806., Thanks [~aderen] for reporting this, this seems to be a dup of HDFS-8361., Nice catch [~xyao]. I forgot about that one.]
