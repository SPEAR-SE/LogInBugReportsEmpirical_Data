[This may be negligible since one iteration of the while-loop takes a long time (seconds or even minutes)., Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of having the following reporting like? 
the output looks like:
System.out.println("Time Stamp               Iteration#  Bytes Already Moved  Bytes Left To Move  Bytes Being Moved");

where timestamp is the current iterations's timestamp, to cache it would show an inaccurate time stamp in the report. Considering how heavy the other parts of this are you would probably need 10,000 nodes to see a difference in performance times., Resolving this as not-a-problem.  Please feel free to reopen if you disagree.]
