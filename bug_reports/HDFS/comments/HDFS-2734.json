[Hi J.Andreina,

That property is for upto 0.20/1.0 SecondaryNameNodes. It is OK to be in core-site.xml.

What exact version are you reporting this for? What do you see in SNN_HOST:50090/conf?, The property has been configured in 0.20/1.0  (core-site.xml) only but still the values which are configured are not taken into account.

SNN_HOST:50090/conf is also verified, With 1.0.0, I'm unable to reproduce your issue.

Can you verify if the other changes from your core-site.xml appear, and only not this? Is the config directory that contains the core-site.xml file on the launched SNN's classpath?, Andreina,

Please provide the following files:

ps aux | grep SecondaryNameNode > snn-ps.txt
hadoop classpath > hadoop-cppath.txt
wget http://SNNHOST:50090/conf -O snn-conf.txt

I can't reproduce your issue and its most likely a misconfiguration at your end. Having the above would help determine if its a bug or if this can be closed., I see that that there is no activity on this Jira since a long time. [~andreina], Is this still reproducible on your side? If this is still an issue, can you provide the information [~qwertymaniac] requested?
For the analysis that Harsh did, I think this is not reproducable on his side and I have not seen anyone else raising this concern. In that case, if I do not hear back by 4/17/14, I will go ahead and close this issue as Not A Problem.

-Mit, I think this issue is not a problem. Resolving it as Not a Problem. But feel free to reopen this jira if you still feel there is a problem]
