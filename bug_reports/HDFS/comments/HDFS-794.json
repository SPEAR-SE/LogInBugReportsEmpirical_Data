[This problem has been found in the process of investigation for HDFS-792 (please see the comment for more information and the link to so called successful patch verification).
I have dig a bit deeper and found out that many verification jobs are seemingly Ok, but actually has a number of failing tests. E.g.
[this build|http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch-h4.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/135/testReport/] claims no problems with tests, however a brief look reveals that many tests have finished in a few milliseconds (sic!). A deeper look shows that many of them has a single message like this 

2009-11-12 20:48:23,870 WARN  conf.Configuration (Configuration.java:<clinit>(345)) - DEPRECATED: hadoop-site.xml found in the classpath. Usage of hadoop-site.xml is deprecated. Instead use core-site.xml, mapred-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml to override properties of core-default.xml, mapred-default.xml and hdfs-default.xml respectively 

in there logs. After that message tests are terminated _successfully_., The ten-minute-tests are a subset of the larger, complete test set, and are run in ant via the same process.  So, it shouldn't just be the 10-min tests that are failing.  If they are, the tests should be failing in both runs.  Is this the case?, Apparently, I can't see this issue with commit builds (which are running same tests and more). Perhaps, it is a patch verification machine problem (i.e. Hudson's slave glitch) or something., I have found out after some investigation that the problem's symptoms are a combination of empty test  list of TestCLI (addressed by HADOOP-6222) and an deprecated file left behind in the Common's code (HADOOP-6411).

So, this JIRA needs to be closed as it already represented by other JIRAs.]
