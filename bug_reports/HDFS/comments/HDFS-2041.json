This message is automatically generated., +1, the change looks good to me, Todd. Great find.

Thanks also for removing the vestigial {{runCommand}} from {{TestHDFSConcat}}., Committed to trunk.

Even though this bug affects earlier versions, it's not a major issue and the concat feature is rarely used. Since the backport would be hairy, I've elected not to backport for now.
