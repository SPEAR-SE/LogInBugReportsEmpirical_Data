[The patch modifies {{BlockManager.addStoredBlockUnderConstruction()}} to update {{BlockInfoUnderContruction}} with the reported block, not the stored block itself.

In this method, the old behavior is restored if {{ucBlock.storedBlock}} is used instead of {{ucBlock.reportedBlock}}. The unit test will fail with the old behavior.

An incorrect assertion is removed from {{DFSOutputStream}}. The assertion is only correct if the block is the last block. If there is more data to be written beyond this block, it fails., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

If the last block is completed, but the penultimate block is not because of this issue, the file won't be closed. If this file is not cleared, but the client goes away, the lease manager will try to recover the lease/block, at which point it will crash. I will file a separate jira for this shortly.

This message is automatically generated., Great finding Kihwal.
Patch looks quite good and test fails without actual fix.
I have following comments:

{code}+      DFSTestUtil.createFile(fileSys, file, 68000000L, (short)numDataNodes, 0L);{code}
Here why you exactly used *68000000L* ? wanted to write more than one block?
 If yes then you might have to set the block size to 64MB, default is 128M now in trunk.

bq. If the last block is completed, but the penultimate block is not because of this issue, the file won't be closed.
Better to add a test for this too, You can reproduce this failing the last packet of only penultimate block. for that you might need to change Mock statement in test and one more line in DFSOutputStream.java to following
{code}Mockito.when(faultInjector.failPacket()).thenReturn(true, false);{code}
and 
{code}if (isLastPacketInBlock
                && DFSClientFaultInjector.get().failPacket()){code}


Also I looked at the patch HDFS-5558,
I think that will not solve the issue mentioned there i.e. crashing of LeaseManager monitor thread. that fix actually comes in flow of client's completeFile() call, not from lease recovery. That change might be required in this issue, to block the client committing the last block., bq.

Oops. Sorry for not completely understanding the problem. lastBlock can be complete without completed penultimate block only if client calls completeFile() and fails.

It doesn't have to write more than one block. I tried that, but the problem is reproduced without writing more than one block. But multiple packets is still better. It's an arbitrary number., [~daryn] spotted a bug in {{setGenerationStampAndVerifyReplicas()}}. It was checking for null replicas and returning before setting the gen stamp. Although in practice this bug doesn't trigger, it is logically wrong.  Attaching a new patch., The patch also applies to branch-0.23 except against one test case. It can be ignored, since 0.23 does not need the test case to be updated., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
