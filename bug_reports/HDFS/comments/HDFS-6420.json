This message is automatically generated., What happens if the include file isn't up to date on the other node?, Thanks for the comments, [~aw].

I think to make decommission/recommission work properly, the users should make sure the include/exclude files are updated correctly in both NameNode. For decommission, if the include file has not been updated in one of the NameNodes, the corresponding DN will be set as disallowed in that NN. This is just like currently users send refreshNodes request to one of the NN (either the one specified in the -fs option, or the first NN specified in the configuration property "dfs.ha.namenodes.$nameserviceId") and have not updated the hosts files correctly (maybe because the user does not understand which NN the command will be sent to).

Have you seen any bad scenarios if we send refreshNodes to both NameNodes by default, [~aw]?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
