This message is automatically generated., How could getUserName() / getGroupName() return null? Maybe I missed something but I couldn't find a case in current code which can make the inode have null user or group names. 
Are we proposing the code change just to prevent future errors (e.g., future code change might introduce a null reference)?, I don't think we want to do anything special here. If it ever happens for some reason, it should fail. I think it already does with NPE.]
