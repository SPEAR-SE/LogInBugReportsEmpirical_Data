[looks dupe of HDFS-13482?, After this change HDFS-13292, it won't throw {{RemoteException:Attempt to create an encryption zone for non-empty directory}}.
 It will throw {{Directory /kms is already an encryption zone}}., Thanks  [~Harsha1206] for reporting this issue.

Yes [~shahrs87] , you are correct it won't throw this exception "RemoteException: Attempt to create an encryption zone for non-empty directory", after this change HDFS-13292. it will throw Directory /kms is already an encryption zone.]
