, [~brahmareddy] Thanks for interest in this issue.

bq. can you describe more about the scenario..like does path gzip contain any special character like "+"..? 

There's nothing special about the filename. {{hadoop fs -text file}} doesn't work with any file, even one that is not gzipped. If a file is plain text, it should work the same as with {{-cat}}.

The problem is in the webhdfs {{ParameterParser}} code. If an offset is not passed, it should assume offset = 0 rather than allow null., This patch (HDFS-7818.v1.txt) contains a test to ensure that ParameterParser#offset defaults to 0 when not present. I feel that there should be additional tests to ensure that the other parameters are handled properly when not present. For example, buffersize. blocksize, replication, etc., The test case of the first patch wasn't catching IOException. HDFS-7818.v2.txt fixes that., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Note that {{OffsetParam}} is also used by the NN and {{WebHdfsFileSystem}}. I believe that we should fix it in {{org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.resources.OffsetParam}} (or even in {{LongParam}}), where the default value is specified., [~wheat9]: Thank you very much for reviewing the patch and for your comments.

I have made the changes you suggested in the OffsetParam constructor. Please review., Maybe it might make more sense to introduce a new method {{getOffset()}} in {{OffsetParam}}.

As a reference, the following code snippet in {{PermissionParam}} handles the same issue:

{code}
  /** @return the represented FsPermission. */
  public FsPermission getFsPermission() {
    final Short v = getValue();
    return new FsPermission(v != null? v: DEFAULT_PERMISSION);
  }
{code}

Can you please update your patch? Thanks., Thank you for your review, [~wheat9]
bq. Maybe it might make more sense to introduce a new method {{getOffset()}} in {{OffsetParam}}.
If a {{getOffset()}} method is created instead of handling the NULL case in the constructor as is done in the HDFS-7818.V3.txt patch, won't I also have to change all of the {{offset.getValue()}} calls to {{offset.getOffset()}} in the {{NamenodeWebHdfsMethods}} class?

The change in the current patch seems less risky because it catches the NULL case during construction of the object and has less code change., Now that I look at it, the patch in HDFS-7818.v3.txt is not exactly correct either. I think that if we want to keep the NULL check in a constructor, it should be done in {{OffsetParam(final Long value)}} instead of {{OffsetParam(final String str)}}, since the latter invokes the former., Hi [~wheat9]. Did you have a chance to think about my response?, I'm not sure the PermissionParam is a good pattern to follow.  I would expect that getValue returns either the user specified value, or the default value.  That means the ctor should sub in the default when no param string is given (Eric's patch) so getValue always returns a non-null value.  Adding a second method to morph a null value into the param's default value seems counterintuitive.

Note the NN doesn't encounter a NPE in the absence of the parameter since it subs in the param's default value, so getValue never returns null., bq. That means the ctor should sub in the default when no param string is given (Eric's patch) so getValue always returns a non-null value

I'm fine with that, but I think it might make sense to make it consistent with the current pattern. We can fix the current pattern in a separate jira., [~wheat9], thank you for your review and thoughtful comments.

Does that mean you would give the patch a plus 1 :-), bq. Does that mean you would give the patch a plus 1 

No :-). Just to quote myself:

bq. but I think it might make sense to make it consistent with the current pattern.

I propose landing a change that is consistent with what is done in {{PermissionParam}} in 2.7, then we'll fix the current pattern for all WebHDFS params in a separate jira. How does it sound?, Thanks for the quick resply, [~wheat9]

No . Just to quote myself:

Ah well. It was worth a try :-).

Okay, I will implement the {{getOffset()}} in {{OffsetParam}} in order to follow the existing pattern., [~wheat9], thank you for helping out with this issue, for your reviews, and for your helpful comments.

I have updated the patch with your suggestions for a new method called {{getOffset}}. Will you please take a look and let me know if it meets your approval?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
