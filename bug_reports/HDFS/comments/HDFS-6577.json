[Thanks for looking at the code [~yzhangal]].

The result of the last call is accurate. See HDFS-6340 for a related discussion. Also see the return value of {{BlockManager.processReport}}. I will resolve this as 'Not an Issue'., Resolving, feel free to respond if you disagree., HI [~arpitagarwal], many thanks for the info. Indeed, I looked a bit more at BlockManager.processReport closer, it seems to try to remember earlier state, so the last call has the accumulated result. BTW, I just filed HDFS-6578 for a little better logging and debuggability, I wonder if it makes sense to you, would you please help taking a look? thanks.


, BTW, as part of HDFS-6578 fix, I will add a comment in {{blockReport}} method to state that the last call is a collective result of all calls to {{bm.processReport}} in the loop, so other readers won't get confused like I did:-)

, Sounds good. I can review and commit HDFS-6578 when you have a patch., Thanks a lot Arpit! I will post a patch later today.
