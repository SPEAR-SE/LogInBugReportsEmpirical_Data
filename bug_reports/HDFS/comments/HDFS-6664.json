[http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsPermissionsGuide.html#Group_Mapping, Mostly a cut-and-paste from core-default.xml, which has some very good descriptive text for the org.apache.hadoop.security.JniBasedUnixGroupsMappingWithFallback implementation behavior.

Let me know how it looks to you., Thanks [~rchiang] for the patch! Some comments:
1.
{code}
+   the <code>bash -c groups</code> command to resolve a list of
{code}
{{<code>}} and {{</code>}} should be {{<<<}} and {{>>>}}. Most of Hadoop documents are now written in APT format (*.apt.vm). The format is described in http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html

2.
{code}
+   This implementation shells out to the Linux/Unix environment with
{code}
{{ShellBasedUnixGroupsMappings}} now supports Windows also.

3 (minor).
{code}
+   JNI is available the implementation will use the API within hadoop
{code}
I think it's better to add a comma(,) between 'available' and 'the'., [~ajisakaa], thanks for the quick feedback.  I've incorporated your suggestions., Thanks for the update!
{code}
+   This implementation shells out with the the <<<bash -c groups>>>
{code}
