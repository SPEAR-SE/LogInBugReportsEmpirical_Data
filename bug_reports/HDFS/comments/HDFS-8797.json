[Simply removing "seek(oldPos)" can avoid the issue but also changes the behavior: with resetting the position, after a pread we can continue the original stateful read., One possible way to fix can be to override the {{readFully}} method in {{ByteRangeInputStream}} in which we use a newly created InputStream so that we do not need to touch the internal states. Upload a patch to demo the idea., Thanks Jing for working on this, I think it's a good approach to override {{readFully}} and create a new InputStream for pread. A minor comment, we should also override {{int read(long position, ...}}, \\

readFully call read repeated so that it is a problem.  read itself seems fine., Thanks for the review, Yi and Nicholas! Update the patch to address comments.

bq. A minor comment, we should also override int read
bq. readFully call read repeated so that it is a problem. read itself seems fine.

Yeah, looks like the main issue is with {{readFully}} here. So currently I keep the original {{read}} unchanged., Just a minor comment: in the new readFully method, how about using the length returned by openInputStream to detect EOF so that it can fail fast?, Update the patch to add the check suggested by Nicholas. Also added a unit test., \\

Yeah, looks like the main issue is with readFully here. So currently I keep the original read unchanged.
{quote}
Sorry, I was dizzy here, {{readFully}} is the main issue, but is it a bit more efficient if we use the same way for normal pread? 
# The new approach hear is  to open a separate new connection for pread, then close it after finish. When client does stateful read again, original connection is not affected.
# {{seek}} + {{read}} + {{seek}}: will close the original connection hold by stateful read, and open a new connection for pread.  But when client does stateful read again, connection should be close and open again.

So #2 ({{seek}} + {{read}} + {{seek}}) requires additional one more close/open connection for normal pread?, Yeah, it will also be good to keep read/readFully consistent. Update the patch to override {{read}} in {{ByteRangeInputStream}}., +1 the new patch looks good., \\
