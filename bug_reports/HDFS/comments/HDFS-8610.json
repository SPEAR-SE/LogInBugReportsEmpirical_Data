[[~tongshiquan] thanks for reporting... As you are pointing to namenode UI , It will be sum of all the DN's data.dir... do you have 10 DN's in your cluster..?, Ok.. I got , what you mean...What is the usecase of configuring multiple paths to single disk (physical drive)..? AFAIK, this will not be an issue, since you are configuring multiple dir's to same disk.., Hi [~brahmareddy]

Yes you are right. Please refer HDFS-8574 when very high number of files with small size are present we encounter {{InvalidProtocolBufferException}}. So to avoid this, the data.dir was split into subfolder so that the block report size will be smaller. Looks like we have a dead end for this scenario, > ... set several dirs which belongs to one disk in "dfs.datanode.data.dir", ...

I believe we currently do not support such setting.  You probably could find many features won't work correctly with such setting.

There is an ongoing work for splitting full block report; see HDFS-9011., Hi [~szetszwo]

HDFS-11191 seems to be duplicated with this one. I worked on that JIRA for a while and posted a fix to count the capacity with honoring the file system, that should be able to resolve the mis-report of the capacity. I understand your point that in most of circumstances, it may not be a validate setup to have more than 1 data dir configured per disk, however you can't stop people doing this and some particular cases like HDFS-8574. I hope my fix improves the usability. Please comment if you have suggestions, in HDFS-11191, thank you.]
