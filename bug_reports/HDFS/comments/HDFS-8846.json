[[~mingma] [~cmccabe] Let me know if the below looks a reasonable plan:
# Start a local 2.5.2 cluster (it's just the oldest version shown on Apache website, let me know if the version is appropriate)
# Add the following Ops:
#* Create a directory
#* Copy ~10 local files into the dir
#* Delete a few copied files
# Add the generated edit log files in {{hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/target/test/data/dfs/old-edits}}
# Copy over old edits in {{TestDFSUpgrade#testPreserveEditLogs}}

Thanks, 2.5 should be fine. Although people still use 2.3 or 2.4, this test tries to verify old edits can be replayed during upgrade; not necessarily compatibilities around edit log formats.

If you unpack the existing fsimage tgz files under {{hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/resources}}, they have the proper namenode dir contents that include VERSION file, etc.. Just wonder if you are going to create something similar except that the fsimage is empty., Thanks Ming for the feedback!

I was planning to only add edit log files. But I think creating an entire NN dir structure with old layout version is a good idea. It could support a broader range of upgrade tests., The patch does the following:
# Added a packed {{/dfs}} dir. I basically started a 2.5.2 local cluster, created {{/input}} and 200 sub directories under it. The {{inotify}} test in this patch only uses the create event of {{/input}}.
# Moved {{testPreserveEditLogs}} to {{TestDFSUpgradeFromImage}}. Similar to other tests in the class, it unpacks the image and tries to upgrade., Hi [~zhz],

It seems that you left out the binary changes:
{code}
diff --git a/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/resources/hadoop-252-dfs-dir.tgz b/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/resources/hadoop-252-dfs-dir.tgz
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..2aaab18
Binary files /dev/null and b/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/resources/hadoop-252-dfs-dir.tgz differ
{code}

You should create the patch with {{\-\-binary}} so that these are included, Thanks for the good catch Colin! Updating the patch with the binary diff., \\

This message was automatically generated., Updating the patch to fix white space issue and removing unused imports in {{TestDFSUpgrade}}.

The reported test failures are unrelated and pass locally.

One thing I'm not sure about is whether I should shrink the binary file by only containing 1 (or 2~3) edit log. Right now it has ~200 edit logs., \\

This message was automatically generated., The reported test failures are unrelated (this change itself is test-only), and they all pass locally., Looks good overall!  Can we test reading a few different events rather than just the CreateEvent?  And perhaps also test reading by transaction ID.  (i.e. if we poll a transaction ID that's too high, we get nothing... if we look for one that exists in the old edit logs, we start right there).  +1 once that's addressed, Thanks Colin for the suggestion! Updating the patch with more comprehensive checking of returned edits., \\

, Pulled this as a companion to HDFS-8480 into 2.6.1.

Fixed minor merge conflicts. Ran compilation and TestDFSInotifyEventInputStream, TestDFSUpgrade, TestDFSUpgradeFromImage before the push., Attaching patch that I committed to 2.6.1., The patch looks good (I suppose the binary file was also included). Thanks [~vinodkv]!, Just pulled this into branch-2.7 (release 2.7.2) as it already exists in 2.6.1.

branch-2 patch had a minor merge conflict in the test on 2.7. Ran compilation and TestDFSInotifyEventInputStream, TestDFSUpgrade, TestDFSUpgradeFromImage the push.]
