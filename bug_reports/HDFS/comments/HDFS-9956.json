[Hi [~sanjayvamanna] thanks for reporting the issue and offering workarounds.

The parameter {{hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout}} is supposed to stop queries if it goes over time. Would this parameter work in your scenario? , Thanks for replying, Which version of hadoop,this parameter is there., That is implemented in HADOOP-9322, and you should be able to use it since Hadoop 2.1.0-beta, or if you're using CDH, >= CDH 4.3.0., the default 10 secs is not working and still we are facing the same problem from past so many days.We dont want to keep the users in static binding and we dont want to use the unix shell mapping as well., 
ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms, default is 5 secs, this default has to be greater than hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout (default 10 sec). We increased "ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms" to 20 secs but still have an issue.
, Sounds to me this is a really bad thing that LDAP group mapping could fail over a name node. We should investigate why this is happening.

I've had worked on a new LDAP group mapping implementation, but I've not finished it yet. I'll prioritize that too., is a naming services caching daemon being used or is this just a raw LDAP connection?, Allen,
Thanks for replying,The issue in this jira about timeout that causes the nematode failure. I know you are taking about faster LDAP response using caching daemon, That may speed up the ldap response but is not related to timeout(10 sec).

Thanks,
