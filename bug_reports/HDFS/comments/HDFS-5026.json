[Eli chatted with me about this one, and we decided it's not really a bug. getFileStatus/getFileLinkStatus are supposed to be like stat(2), not stat(1). We only recently got inodes in HDFS, so FileStatus was using this path for a similar purpose to an inode #. Thus, this path is meant to be opaque.

I suspect there's be code out there making incorrect assumptions about this path, but these functions themselves are not in error.]
