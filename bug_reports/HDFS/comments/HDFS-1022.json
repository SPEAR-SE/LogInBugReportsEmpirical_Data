[Hey Erik,

Is there anything to do here?  This patch depends on MR-670, which isn't targeted for branch 20, and since the projects are split on trunk this patch doesn't make sense here.

Are you thinking we need to put MR-670 and this patch in branch-20?  If not, please close this out as won't fix.

Thanks,
Eli
