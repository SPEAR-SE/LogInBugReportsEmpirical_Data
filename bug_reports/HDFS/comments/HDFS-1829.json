[Converted the infinite waits to 20 second timeouts with informative TimeoutException message info.

I did not find an obvious explanation for the failure, but did find that only one of three calls to namesystem.blockManager.countNodes(block) was correctly synchronized on namesystem.  Fixed the other two, following the same pattern.  Although, in retrospect, all three really should be replaced by readLock() calls.  I'll fix that in the next version., In test build 366, we see TestNodeCount fail with NullPointerException in BlockManager. (ref https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/366//testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode/TestNodeCount/testNodeCount/ )

Such an error certainly can be caused by lack of synchronization.  This patch [ 12476098 ] should address it.
, This patch has correct synchronization using readLock()., I think it makes sense to have a new private method instead of copying pretty much the same code 3 times. Surely the iterators in while loops are different methods but I think you can parametrized it via Callable., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I had originally rejected trying to factor out those similar-but-different loops, because using callback objects would have increased the code complexity more than was worthwhile.  However, you pushed me to look at it again, and there's a better solution :-)  Please see if you agree., Ah, 'better simpler than clever'! You've avoided callables all together yet the code doesn't have original dups. I like it.

+1 patch looks good.

What about failing tests? Are they related?, How about handling these as is done for HDFS-1562? You could augment NameNodeAdapter#getReplicaInfo to return excess and live replica counts as well and then just add waitFor[Live|Excess]Replicas methods to DFSTestUtil and have TestNodeCount call them. This way we could re-use them in the other replication tests., Eli, can we open another Jira for that?  My goal here was only to get rid of the recurring false positive in Hudson for this unit test, which this patch does in a clean way.  Your suggestion would be a good contribution to the toolkit (and I have been trying to do that along the way, as you know), but I've already spent more time than I should on this issue.

, Cos, this patch only modifies TestNodeCount, and TestNodeCount and its methods are not called from outside that unit test module, so other tests failing have nothing to do with this test.  However, I am waiting for another run of Hudson and will respond to its results before asking for a commit.  Thanks., bq. Eli, can we open another Jira for that?

Absolutely. What you have here is the right direction, we can always refactor the wait to DFSTestUtil later.

+1 on 1829_TestNodeCount_v4.patch, Thanks, Eli.  Opened HDFS-1853 for the suggested refactoring.  Also opened HDFS-1852 as an umbrella task for gathering and discussing many possible such improvements., re-upload to trigger Hudson, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
