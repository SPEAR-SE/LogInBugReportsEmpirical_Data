Thanks., Targeting 2.6.3 now that 2.6.2 has shipped., Moving this to 2.7.3 since there's been no update in a while., Hi, can we move this out of 2.6.3? Thanks!, Moving this to 2.6.4 as no update for a while., Move it out of 2.6.4 given no update for a while., [~daryn] / [~kihwal], any update on this? Is this still a bug?
