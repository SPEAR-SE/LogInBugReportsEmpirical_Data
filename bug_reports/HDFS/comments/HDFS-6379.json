This message is automatically generated., [~michaelbyoder], nice work. Would you mind adding a testcase where ACLs are disabled in HDFS to verify that being disable do not break file status and list status? After that I think it is ready to go., Looks like there's another me out there!  I'm [~yoderme], not that other...uh...guy with my name. :-)

[~tucu00], I totally agree with that test case, but can you send a quick pointer as to how to do that in an automated fashion?  All the test cases I've seen fire up the server part once at the start and leave it running for all tests.  Any way to change the server conf dynamically?

Thanks, -Mike, Updated patch with test case for ACLs turned off., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., One minor nit, the new testcase should be named 'TestHttpFSServerNoACLs'. +1 after that is fixed., +1, Nice job, thanks Michael. Committed to trunk and branch-2., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
