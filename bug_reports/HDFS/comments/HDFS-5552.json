[I attach a screenshot. It displays as "3 files and directories, 0 blocks = 1 total filesystem object(s)."., In FSNameSystem#metaSave, there is a similar expression.

{code}
  private void metaSave(PrintWriter out) {
    assert hasWriteLock();
    long totalInodes = this.dir.totalInodes();
    long totalBlocks = this.getBlocksTotal();
    out.println(totalInodes + " files and directories, " + totalBlocks
        + " blocks = " + (totalInodes + totalBlocks)
        + " total filesystem objects");

    blockManager.metaSave(out);
  }
{code}

As you can see, "files and directories, blocks = total filesystem objects" means "totalInode + totalBlocks = (totalInodes + totalBlocks)".
On the other hand, dfshealth.dust.html defines "files and directories, blocks = total filesystem object(s)" means "{TotalLoad}(FSNameSystem#getTotalLoad) + {BlocksTotal}(FSNameSystem#getBlocksTotal) = {FilesTotal}(FSNameSystem#getFilesTotal)".

TotalLoad means num of active xceivers and FilesTotal means num of inodes so these are different from metaSave's., [~wheat9] addressed this issue during I commented., +1 LGTM, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
