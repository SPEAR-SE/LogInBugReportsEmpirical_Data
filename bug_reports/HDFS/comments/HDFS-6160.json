[Fix a couple of race conditions with the test case:
# The {{waitFor}} predicate was just checking that _safeModeBlocks > 0_ which can happen before block reports from all storages attached to the DN are processed. If the subsequent block reports come after this check and before we sample {{getSafeModeSafeBlocks}}, then {{safe}} will be wrong. Fixed it by adding a metric for storageBlockReportOps and checking it.
# Put the check for {{getUnderReplicatedBlocks}} in a loop since the processing is asynch and may be delayed., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
