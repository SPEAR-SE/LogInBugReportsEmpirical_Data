Minor nits:
# Instead of repeating e.getMessage() many times, you could use String msg = e.getMessage(). Might make it is easy to format the code.
# One of the lines goes beyond 80 chars. It might be more readable with a line limited to a single exception.

Other than that it looks good. , Thanks for the quick suggestions, [~sureshms]. New patch with your suggestions taken into consideration., +1 for the patch. I will commit it once Jenkins posts +1., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
