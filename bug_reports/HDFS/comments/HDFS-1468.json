[This failure is not consistent.  From just now:
{noformat}    [junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.TestBlockReport
    [junit] Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 67.186 sec{noformat}, I've personally seen this fail several times when running the full HDFS test suite, but I've never seen it fail when run standalone, which suggests some test interference is the cause of this failure. Apologies for not having more details; this is just what I've observed.

Todd, how did you run the test(s) when you encountered this failure?, The failure was seen when running the full suite. I can confirm that running it alone seems to pass (on the same machine), This is knowingly  flaky test... Perhaps I'm personally responsible for it, but it's pretty hard to catch the failure consistently. I never been able to reproduce it in my own runs, only have seen it in Hudson builds.

There should be a JIRA for this... here it is HDFS-733. I'm going to close this one as a dup., Dup. of HDFS-733]
