[Attached a patch with it applied secure datanode logs will be written to the correct dir by default. Without this it wanted to write to your_log_dir/root dir., regenerated the patch --no-prefix, Hi, Arpit.  With this patch, does a secure data node end up with 2 occurrences of -Dhadoop.log.dir and -Dhadoop.id.str on the command line?  It appears that there would be one occurrence generated in the hadoop-config.sh script and then a second occurrence appended in the hdfs script (with different values).  This could be confusing for an operator looking at the process table.

Thanks!

Actually it will appear 3 times after this change for secure datanode. It appears twice for any hdfs service right now.

hadoop-deamon.sh -> hadoop (sources hadoop-config.sh) -> hdfs (source hdfs-config.sh which sources hadoop-config.sh) and then we set it again.

I think the problem of duplicates in OPTS is a an issue that should be solved in a different jira., {quote}

Yikes, you're right!

+1 for this patch since the duplication is an existing issue.

I filed HADOOP-9351 for follow-up on the duplication problem.

This message is automatically generated., No tests added as this is a change to shell scripts. Manually verified that the secure datanode logs are being written to the appropriate directory.

Test failure is unrelated., +1 for the patch., Committed the patch to both trunk and branch-2. Thank you Arpit!
