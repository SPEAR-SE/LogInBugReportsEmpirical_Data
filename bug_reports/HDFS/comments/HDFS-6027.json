[This is a duplicate of HDFS-2551.  The issue is that HDFS doesn't allow other readers to see what the writer wrote until {{DFSOutputStream#close}} has finished.  But fuse's close doesn't wait until that happens.  Hence the inconsistency you saw., okay, thanks for the review Colin.  That clears it up.]
