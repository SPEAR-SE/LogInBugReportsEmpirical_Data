[With this patch applied the directory names are as expected.

$ ./bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hrt_qa

$ ./bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hrt_qa/FileNameLength

$ ./bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hrt_qa/FileNameLength/ReallyLongFileName_003_Fail
mkdir: The maximum path component name limit of ReallyLongFileName_003_Fail in directory /user/hrt_qa/FileNameLength is exceeded: limit=20 length=27

$ ./bin/hdfs dfs -touchz /user/hrt_qa/FileNameLength/ReallyLongFileName_003_Fail
touchz: The maximum path component name limit of ReallyLongFileName_003_Fail in directory /user/hrt_qa/FileNameLength is exceeded: limit=20 length=27, [~anu],
   The fix looks ok to me. However, this means that following line is also broken
  {{final INodeDirectory parent = existing.getINode(pos - 1).asDirectory();}}
which is used for {{verifyMaxDirItems(parent, parentPath);}} in the same method. 

If that is the case, we should file another jira to track the fix for that too., It is not really broken, the reason why that code looks different is the semantics of getINode seems to be different from getPath(int pos). In the second call we send the pos as the max length of path component, and if you call getPath() without any argument then the pos parameter passed to DFSUtil.byteArray2Path string is the length of the path components.

It took me a while to notice this subtle difference, I did another fix in DFSUtil but that cause some test failure, hence this minimal invasive fix.

, +1. I will commit it shortly., I will commit it after test results come out satisfactorily., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
