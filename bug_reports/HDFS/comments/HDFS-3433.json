[Here's a patch which addresses the issue. The ACL which is already used to allow admin access to other HTTP servlets is extended to also allow access to the GetImage servlet.

In addition to the automated test, I also tested this manually on a secure cluster, by ensuring my principal could not fetch the fsimage without the ACL in place, then adding my principal to the ACL and ensuring it then worked. I also made sure that checkpointing still worked both with and without the ACL in place., +1 pending jenkins, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
