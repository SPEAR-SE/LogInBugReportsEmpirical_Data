, I've committed this to trunk and branch-2.  I have not committed to branch-2.1-beta.  The code has diverged due to HADOOP-9817, which is only targeting 2.3.0, so no patch is required for 2.1.1-beta.

I'm also relating this to HADOOP-9817, which introduced the failures on Windows.

Thank you for the contribution, Chuan., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #303 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/303/])
