[Attached patch depends on HADOOP-8350. It includes a regression test which fails without the patch and passes with it., It's worth pointing out that we now have a timeout for the non-cached case as well. This changes fixes two bugs: #1 that the setSoTimeout for the keepalive was a NOP, and #2 that there was no default timeout set on the socket given to DataXceiver. Perhaps DataXceiverServer could use a comment:
{code}
s = ss.accept();
s.setTcpNoDelay(true);
+ // DataXceiver sets the socket timeout
{code}

Looks good, +1 pending jenkins

I had to add a "triggerHeartbeats" call after the DN restart in the test. Otherwise, the WRITE_BLOCK request was coming into the DN while it was in the process of starting up, which failed the write (this was just a test bug, nothing to do with the patch), -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Committed to trunk and branch-2., Removing 1.1 from target versions. Although branch-1 does read the data xceiver header with no timeout, it doesn't really cause problems because branch-1 clients don't have the socket cache (HDFS-941). So I don't think there's any strong reason to do the fix. If others disagree, I'm happy to review a patch, though., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2189 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2189/])
