[I propose removing initializeReplQueues() from checkMode(). If IBR is handled in safe mode. Also in checkMode(), call to needEnter() causes DatanodeManager#getNumLiveDataNodes() to be called. So it is being called for every block being added. We can modify the condition so that it is skipped if the dn threshold is 0. DatanodeManager#getNumLiveDataNodes() walks the TreeMap and recounts the live nodes., Patch for trunk, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Canceling patch to attach patch for 0.23, This patch for 0.23 changes the following:
1. In checkMode(), initalizeReplQueues() is called only if we are NOT in startup safe mode.
2. needEnter() 's condition is modified so that it doesn't traverse the TreeMap everytime if datanodeThreshold is 0., The patch with the same changes for trunk, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hmm.... We realized we can set dfs.namenode.replqueue.threshold-pct to 1.0 or even 1.5 to make sure that only when the NN enters the Safemode extension period are the replication queues initialized. Thus truncating the patch to include only the optimization for the condition to not traverse the TreeMap., Attaching the same patch for trunk, even though the branch-23 patch applies to trunk with some fuzz. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Thanks for the analysis, Ravi. As you said, setting this config to something > 1.0 will prevent the replication queues from being initialized in the middle of block report processing.  Since the main loop of SafeModeMonitor in trunk/branch-2 and leaveSafeMode() called by SafeModeMonitor in branch-0.23 are acquiring FSN lock, nothing will get in the way between replication queue initialization and leaving safe mode and cause delays. 

+1 The patch looks good.  I will change the title of this jira to reflect the actual change., I've committed this to branch-0.23, branch-2 and trunk.
