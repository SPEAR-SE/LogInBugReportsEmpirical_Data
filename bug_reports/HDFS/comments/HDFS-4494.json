[This seems resolved now (as of 2.6.0):

{code}
[root@host ~]# hdfs getconf -confKey hadoop.security.authentication
kerberos
[root@host ~]# hadoop fs -ls hdfs://asdfsdfsdf/
-ls: java.net.UnknownHostException: asdfsdfsdf
Usage: hadoop fs [generic options] -ls [-d] [-h] [-R] [<path> ...]
{code}

Marking as Done.]
