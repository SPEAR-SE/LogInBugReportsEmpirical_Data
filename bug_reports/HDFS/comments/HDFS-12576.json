, [~bharatviswa] I am sorry, but I don't see how this patch is adding the check for a specific setting {{dfs.namenode.shared.edits.di}}, Could you please help me understand this change better? Thanks in advance.
 , [~anu]
What is happening currently is 

{code:java}
JOURNAL_NODES=$("${HADOOP_HDFS_HOME}/bin/hdfs" getconf -journalNodes 2>&-)
{code}

this will get an empty string with a new line, when dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir or dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir.<<namespaceId>> is not set.
*Example Output:*
{code:java}
hdfs@4abb0327cd7f:/$ /hadoop/bin/hdfs getconf -journalnodes
2017-10-02 21:30:46,563 WARN util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable

hdfs@4abb0327cd7f:/$
{code}
*Note: Internally getconf -journalnodes uses dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir to find list of journal nodes in the cluster.*
So, when nothing is set, the below  check is passing , 
if [[ "{$JOURNAL_NODES-}" != $'\n' ]]; then

So, to avoid that checked the lenght of the returned journal nodes. If length is greater than zero, there are journal nodes available, I need to start/stop otherwise nothing is set, no need to start/stop journal nodes.

Pls let me know if it makes sense., Thank you for the explanation, it makes better sense now. However I do not agree with the fix, since does not even tell you why it is failing. 
I would suggest that we check this inside Journal node if this is indeed a bug and fail with a proper error so that user of the system is aware what needs to be done. Does that make sense? , [~bharatviswa] Thanks for the very detailed off-line explanation. It looks like the older shell check is failing, this new check ensures that JNs are not started if the variable is indeed not set.
To understand this change HDFS-12486 and HDFS-12375 patches are essential. The original sed based parsing was replaced with java code, but the return was an empty string with \n from the java code. The shell script checks for \n, but *IFS* strips it out. So, unfortunately, the shell check fails and Journal nodes are started even if the Journal nodes are not set. This new change fixes it via making sure that JOURNAL_NODE variable is not zero length instead of *'\n' check. This makes sure that JN is not started until we have a valid setting.

+1, I will commit this shortly. 
 , [~bharatviswa] Thanks for the contribution and a very detailed explanation of what is happening. I have committed this patch to trunk., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13007 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13007/])
HDFS-12576. JournalNodes are getting started, even though (aengineer: rev 015abcd8ce1d360830ee2960f1cdc743e09f1629)
