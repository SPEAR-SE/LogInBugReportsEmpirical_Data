This message is automatically generated., I did not intend to have the other code in the patch.  Findbugs gave me some extra warnings that went away after doing a clean and rerunning findbugs, but not before I started trying to fix those other warnings.  Thanks for catching that.

I like your patch it fixes the issue just as well as my patch.  In either case this is just defensive programming as that enum is never actually serialized in the code.
