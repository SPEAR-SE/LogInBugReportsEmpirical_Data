[I'm attaching a patch with the simple fix.  We just need to check if the channel is secure/trusted before entering SASL negotiation.  As per the definition of {{DomainPeer#hasSecureChannel}}, traffic over a domain socket is assumed to be trustworthy, because it doesn't cross a network, and we restrict the permissions on the domain socket.

I don't have a test yet.  I'll look into adding one., I also meant to mention that this is exactly the same way the code already handles it for the encrypted case.
