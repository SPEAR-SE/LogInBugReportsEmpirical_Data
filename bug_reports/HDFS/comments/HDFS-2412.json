[With this patch, I'm able to get past the related errors compiling HBase against 23-SNAPSHOT, HDFS-1620 has caused a fair bit of strife - was it really worth it?, The other option is to fix HBase if we really think HDFS-1620 is worth it - of course it'll imply a new HBase release., The problem is that HBase wants to build against both trunk and 20. We could introduce shims into HBase... but I think the deprecation approach is good to have anyway, in case others have similar reliances.

I could also just be convinced to revert HDFS-1620., I personally do think HDFS-1620 is worth it, and shouldn't be reverted. The patch Todd's provided is very straight-forward, and should fix things up for all down-stream projects that might be affected.

My apologies for not realizing that these private constants are referenced in public APIs when I originally reviewed HDFS-1620. I should have checked for that., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Can I get a +1 on this small patch in the meantime, so we can get the HBase-on-23 build back to compiling? Then we can consider whether we should just revert the whole thing., +1, Resolved this in 23 and trunk. If we have more issues related to 1620, let's just revert both this and 1620., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1117 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1117/])
