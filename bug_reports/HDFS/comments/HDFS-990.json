Trunk compiles for me, do you still see this?, I'd also suggest doing an "ant veryclean" to make sure you aren't getting a stale jar from ivy. 

Have I mentioned that ivy is a big problem..., Looks like HDFS-986 made it over to git but HADOOP-6551 is still on the way, my git connector is probably just being slow.  Sorry for the noise!]
