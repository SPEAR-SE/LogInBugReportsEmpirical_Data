[On second thought this might be HDFS-3026., I agree this looks like HDFS-3026. I'll look into this., Here's a patch which fixes the issue. The trouble was that the test JVM was exiting in this case post HDFS-3026. The fix is to stub out the Runtime.

There's also another fix in this patch related to the fact that HDFS-3031 changed the expected exception stack in the case of an error from transitionToActive., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
