[I guess changing it to an INFO might be appropriate.  It's definitely not worth a WARN., * log 'skipping bytes' message at DEBUG rather than WARN.  It's not an error or unusual condition of any kind., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Test results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2784//testReport/
Findbugs warnings: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2784//artifact/trunk/patchprocess/newPatchFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs.html
Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2784//console

This message is automatically generated., +1, test isn't required and findbugs are unrelated. One nit, that LOG.debug statements must always be wrapped inside LOG.isDebugEnabled() condition blocks, I've fixed myself since it was trivial to. Please just ensure this in the future debug log printing/changes.
