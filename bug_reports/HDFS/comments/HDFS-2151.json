[Just now I ran the tests, but in my machine it is not hanging..... & restartDFS cases passed.
 is it happening randomly?, Yes actually, it is. The most frequent response is for it to either take a very long time, or to timeout., Even in the event that testRestartDFS passes, testDecommissionStatus, testChkpointStartup2 and all the way down to testNodeCount seem to fail because they cannot remove directories., Error was in the core-site.xml file. Needed to comment out the location property so it would not try to access existing directories.]
