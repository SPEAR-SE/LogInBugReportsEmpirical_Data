[I beleive this should this be a Hadoop-common bug ? as it's not related to  hdfs specifically..., The intention here was that filesystems could identify themselves as supporting symlinks or not based on the output of this method.

Then, later, when we discovered the bugs in symlinks and disabled them in branch-2, the {{areSymlinksEnabled}} logic was added.  Perhaps it would be less confusing if the exception message read "Symlinks not enabled"?

I would review this patch if you wanted to created it.  I'd also review patches to get symlinks enabled in 2.x, if you have time for a BIG project... :), Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0.]
