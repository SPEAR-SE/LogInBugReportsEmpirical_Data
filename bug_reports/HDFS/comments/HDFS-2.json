[ipc.Server.stop() is synchronized, so this should be impossible. Yet it has happened. Maybe the interrupt() operations that take place in the block do something to release the locks. This is going to be a tricky one to deal with. It could just be a quirk of the test bench, with all the different bits of the cluster running in the same JVM. Or it could be a problem that can occur in the wild.

What waits for these notifications? , Another occurrence of a test failure with same exception @ [failure |http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Mapreduce-Patch-h6.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/573/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.mapred/TestClusterMapReduceTestCase/testMapReduceRestarting/]., I don't think there is much choice here but to close this as stale.]
