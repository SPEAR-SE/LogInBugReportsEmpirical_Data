[This manifested itself by Pig being unable to move directories to Trash., [~jrottinghuis]

Thank You for reporting this.

I think, it is very long time back opened the issue, do you remember any information on this issue?

Like are you calling the moveToTrash with PathObject which is fully qualified, like hdfs://mycluster:8020/<<path>> or are you calling with simple path like new Path("/<<path>>")?
