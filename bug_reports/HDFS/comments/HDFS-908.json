[This patch against branch-0.20 fixes it for me., Actually, that patch fixed the machine that used to not work, but now another machine that used to work doesn't work anymore :( Will upload a better patch when I figure one out., Here's a new patch that fixes this issues on all the hosts I've tried it on, +1 patch looks good., Try Hudson., Hudson's AWOL.  Todd, please run tests and test-patch manually so this can be committed., I ran the tests and committed.  Thanks Todd.]
