[Seems reasonable to me.  We added those logs at INFO back when the mechanism was new, and never changed it., Hi [~xyao], you don't need the "if" statements any more.  slf4j is smart enough to not do any extra work if debug is not turned on.  See http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2013/08/why-use-sl4j-over-log4j-for-logging-in.html for details.

So instead of this:
{code}
182	              if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
183	                LOG.debug("Rescanning after " + (curTimeMs - startTimeMs) +
184	                  " milliseconds");
185	              }
{code}

You just need this:
{code}
LOG.debug("Rescanning after {} milliseconds", curTimeMs - startTimeMs);
{code}
