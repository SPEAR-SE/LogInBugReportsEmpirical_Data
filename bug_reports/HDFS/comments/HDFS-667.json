[hdfsproxy tests fails on 20 branch and not on trunk. The trunk failures are fixed as part of the project split.
, this patch fixes hdfxproxy test failures on branch-20., Is this JIRA still relevant? Doesn't look so to me. Let's close it?, No longer valid since we're removing hdfsproxy (HDFS-2210)., Note HDFS-2210 was applied only to trunk and 22, not 20 where this bug relates.]
