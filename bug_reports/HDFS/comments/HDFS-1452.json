, Oops.. here's the fix., A script settings for CLASSPATH is missing., With Cos' patch, I can compile test-contrib.  However, TestHdfsProxy fails for me, as it did before this patch.  Even omitting that test, I can't get cleanly through the test; instead I get an exception with test-cactus.  This corner of the code is a mess, but it's not HDFS-1444's fault.  +1 on the patch., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #410 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/410/])
    HDFS-1452. ant compile-contrib is broken. Contributed by Konstantin Boudnik
, I have checked that contrib compilation is back to normal and isn't affected by HDFS-1444 anymore.
