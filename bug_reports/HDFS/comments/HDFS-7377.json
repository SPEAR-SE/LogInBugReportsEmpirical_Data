[As format will  come as null when we access from http://<DN_IP>:<http port>/dataNodeHome.jsp, resonse will be null...Please check the following code for same..

{code}
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {

    if (!HttpServer2.isInstrumentationAccessAllowed(getServletContext(),
                                                   request, response)) {
      return;
    }

    String format = request.getParameter("format");
    Collection<MetricsContext> allContexts = 
      ContextFactory.getFactory().getAllContexts();
    if ("json".equals(format)) {
      response.setContentType("application/json; charset=utf-8");
      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
      try {
        // Uses Jetty's built-in JSON support to convert the map into JSON.
        out.print(new JSON().toJSON(makeMap(allContexts)));
      } finally {
        out.close();
      }
    } else {
      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
      try {
        printMap(out, makeMap(allContexts));
      } finally {
        out.close();
      }
    }
  }
{code}


can we add like blow..as we are handling the json format...
{code}
if (null == format) {
      format = FORMAT_JSON;
    }
{code}
, Problem is contextMap having null value...:).

{code}
Collection<MetricsContext> allContexts =
      ContextFactory.getFactory().getAllContexts();
{code}, Same issue with Nodemenager UI also...Anyone have any thoughts on this.. do we need add any plugin for metrics or need to enable metrics..etc..?, This issue was fixed by HADOOP-9907. You can access {{http://hostname:port/jmx?qry=Hadoop:*}} to get the metrics.
May I close this as duplicate?, Thanks a lot [~ajisakaa]
