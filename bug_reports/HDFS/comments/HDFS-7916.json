[{{BPServiceActor#processQueueMessages()}} tries to execute the {{ReportBadBlockAction#reportTo(..)}} and on any exception, it will add back to queue.
So in case of standby node, adding back to queue should be ignored for the bad block.
, Attaching the patch for the same., Hi [~vinayrpet],
I implemented this feature in HDFS-7704.
I missed out this case.
apologies for the inconvenience caused.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Vinay for the patch, it looks good, one comment, +1 after addressing:
Please do the same handle in {{ErrorReportAction}}., [~hitliuyi]: This standby exception is thrown by checkOperation(OperationCategory.WRITE) function in FSNamesystem#reportBadBlocks.
This check is not there for NameNodeRpcServer#errorReport(). So I think there is no need to handle StandByException in ErrorReportAction.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

, [~vinayrpet]: We deployed this fix to one of our cluster and unfortunately the datanode were still spamming the namenode with the same stack trace as before.
We debugged the issue and found out that the Datanode were receiving StandbyException wrapped in RemoteException.
And the patch was checking for StandbyException and not RemoteException.
I have patch along with testcase with me.
Let me know if you are fine with me posting the patch.
Waiting for your reply.

, Oops, that was a miss. :)

, This patch simply ignores the block when BPServiceActor receives the RemoteException from namenode.
The namenode got the report once and then it chose not to process that request. 
So it doesn't make much sense to add that request again to queue.
, Kicked the precommit build., \\

, Set affects version to 2.7.0 since this issue is caused by HDFS-7704., If HDFS-7704 is backported to a branch, this issue should be backported to the same branch as well., I earlier removed HDFS-7916 from the 2.6.1-candidate list given HDFS-7704 was only in 2.7.0.

[~ctrezzo] added it back and so it appeared in my lists. I removed the label again, Chris, please comment on the mailing lists as to why you added it back. If you want it included, please comment there and we can add it after we figure out the why and the dependent tickets., Hi [~shahrs87] and [~vinayrpet],

Thanks for your earlier work on this.

I saw that the latest patch does handle ErrorReportAction the same way but there was a comment below:

Yes. Rushabh S Shah is right. I had already checked about this. ErrorReportAction doesn't need to be handled.

This is related to [~hitliuyi]'s comment (thanks Yi). It seems reasonable to handle both, but because of the above comment, I have a question, did we discover something new such that we made the the change in ErrorReportAction?
 
At least this seems to be a discrepancy between the comments and the patch. Thanks.

{quote}We deployed this fix to one of our cluster and unfortunately the datanode were still spamming the namenode with the same stack trace as before.
We debugged the issue and found out that the Datanode were receiving StandbyException wrapped in RemoteException.
And the patch was checking for StandbyException and not RemoteException.
{quote}
Inititally we were catching specifically StandbyException. At that time we thought not to catch StandbyException in ErrorReportAction.
But then we discovered that the namenode was throwing StandbyException wrapped in RemoteException.
So we chose to ignore all the RemoteException in both the class and just log it as WARN.

Hope this helps., HI [~rushabh.shah],

Thanks for your reply and sorry I missed this update until now that I'm looking at a related issue.  I created HDFS-9532 when I look at the related code here.

One thing I'd like to check with you and [~vinayrpet]: the HDFS-7916 fix tries to handle StandbyException correctly as reported, but the fix catches  RemoteException and did not check whether the exception wrapped by the RemoteException is StandbyException or not. Is it intended to handle all exceptions wrapped by RemoteException the same way as StandbyException? Is there any case that we don't want to do the same?  It seems worth some understanding here. Would you guys please comment?

Thanks.
, {quote}This patch simply ignores the block when BPServiceActor receives the RemoteException from namenode.
The namenode got the report once and then it chose not to process that request. 
So it doesn't make much sense to add that request again to queue.{quote}
Hi [~yzhangal], This is earlier comment from [~rushabh.shah] about handling entire RemoteException. Do you find any problem here?, Hi [~vinayrpet],

Thanks for your reply. My question was, this jira suggest to ignore StandbyException, but the fix only check RemoteException. RemoteException could wrap exceptions other than StandbyException.  Should we treat the other kind of exceptions wrapped by RemoveException the same as StandbyException (the current fix does that), or we should do more checking to handle StandbyException only this way? Thanks.



, If the namenode in service successfully received a reportBadBlock request and then threw exception (i.e. RemoteException), there is no need to retry, thus no need to unwrap the exception and interpret.  But what about SafeModeException? If the active namenode is in safe mode, do we want it to be retried? If yes, we might need to interpret the exception., Thanks [~kihwal], I created HDFS-9540 accordingly. Are there any other exceptions that we need to be aware of? Or maybe we just change the HDFS-7916 fix to interpret RemoteException and handle StandbyException only, and retain the behavior for other exceptions.
