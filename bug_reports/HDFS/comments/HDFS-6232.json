[I reproduced the error. It occurs because {{XMLUtils.addSaxString}} can't handle null ACL entry name. The name is an optional value, so it can be null.
I attached a patch to add null check., I confirmed the patch fixed the issue locally.

This message is automatically generated., The javac warnings in the test code are due to the use of {{com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.serialize.XMLSerializer}} and {{com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.serialize.OutputFormat}}. They are already used by OfflineEditsViewer.
I suggest to use Xerces instead., bq. I suggest to use Xerces instead.
I tried to use {{org.apache.xml.serialize.XMLSerializer}} in Apache Xerces, but it was  deprecated. I'm thinking we should use another library or write our own code., It looks like you are trying to make {{XMLUtils#addSaxString}} treat a {{null}} value as equal to the empty string.  This seems confusing to me, since when we read the XML file and create edits again, we can't distinguish between null and the empty string.

While it's possible that null and empty really are interchangeable here, I would rather leave it to the caller to make this determination.  Why not just do the simple thing and fix the ACL code so it doesn't pass {{null}} to this function?

Yeah.  The deprecation warnings aren't relevant to this JIRA.  Check out HDFS-4629 if you're interested in a solution to that., Thanks Colin for the comment. I updated the patch to distinguish null and the empty string.
