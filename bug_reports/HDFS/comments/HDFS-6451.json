[From [~zhongyi-altiscale]:
{quote}Hi Jing Zhao, it's definitely good to have a single exception handler instead of replicating the same code everywhere, but since each server procedure (ACCESS, GETATTR, FSSTAT, etc) might have their private data that needs to be written out, the child NFS3Response class still need to overload the writeHeaderAndResponse anyways
for AccessControlException, do you mean we need to catch it together with AuthorizationException in RpcProgramNfs3.java?
or do you mean we need to examine the whole codebase looking for every function that could potentially throw AccessControlException,
and make sure the error code is set correctly in the catch clause?{quote}, Attaching one version of the fix, which introduces a function to check the IOException type and return the NFS3Status code accordingly. 

Please note that, the function returns NFS3ERR_ACCES for AccessControlException (instead of NFS3ERR_PERM), as that gave 'Permission denied' responses on my setup as shown below (this is also in sync with some of the discussion in HDFS 6411):

{code}
$ ls
log4j.properties  loglog
$ mv log4j.properties abc
mv: cannot move `log4j.properties' to `abc': Permission denied
$ ln -s log4j.properties abc
ln: failed to create symbolic link `abc': Permission denied
$ rm log4j.properties
rm: remove write-protected regular file `log4j.properties'? y
rm: cannot remove `log4j.properties': Permission denied
{code}

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks pretty good to me. Some minor comments:
1. checkIOException() might be better called mapError/mapErrorStatus/mapStatus or something similar 
2. it would be nice to add some unit tests, Thanks for your feedback [~brandonli]. I am currently working on the unit tests and shall upload the patch soon., Attaching a patch which addresses the review comments by [~brandonli]. Added tests for all the handlers in TestRpcProgramNfs3.java. Kept the tests generic, so they can be extended in future to include other tests (various corner cases, other NFS3ERR* messages, etc). 

While testing read() I hit HDFS-6582. I have made a note of this and commented that specific test for now. 

Let me know if there are any suggestions. Thanks!, Forgot to mention, I also cleaned up some white spaces in RpcProgramNf3.java. Please forgive me for that. :) , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
