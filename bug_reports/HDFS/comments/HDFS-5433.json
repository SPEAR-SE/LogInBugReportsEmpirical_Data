Patch looks good to me.   

Small Nits:
Duplicate assertions in  TestCheckpointsWithSnapshots.testCheckpoint()
{code:java}+      assertEquals(1, nnSnapshotManager.getNumSnapshots());
+      assertEquals(1, nnSnapshotManager.getNumSnapshots());{code}
{code:java}+      assertEquals(0, nnSnapshotManager.getNumSnapshots());
+      assertEquals(0, nnSnapshotManager.getNumSnapshots());
{code}

+1 on addressing these nits., looks good to me too, +1 with Vinay's comments addressed, New patched attached fixing Vinay's nits. Will commit shortly based on Todd's +1., Committed to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.2. Thanks Aaron for the patch and Vinay and Todd for reviewing., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4672 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4672/])
