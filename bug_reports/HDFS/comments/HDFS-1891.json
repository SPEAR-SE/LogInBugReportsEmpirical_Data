[TestBackupNode failure is due to ipv6 address returned by java Socket.getLocalSocketAddress(). The returned address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:50100.

We need to disable IPV6 by setting system property java.net.preferIPv4Stack to true,
as indicated in http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/ipv6_guide/index.html

{noformat}, For junit tests enabling the preferIPv4Stack to true., Is this related to HDFS-1883 or a new issue?, Searched for TestBackupNode fails and could not find your jira. This is addressing TestBackupNode failure. But the failure is not related to HDFS-1052 change. I will close the other bug as duplicate., I started a hudson validation and TestBackupNode succeeds. IPV6 address is no longer returned -

This message is automatically generated., I had submitted the patch to Hudson to ensure indeed we are getting IPV4 address. Based on the result posted here, TestBackupNode no longer fails and I also confirmed in the test log that IPV4 address is returned., It's worth noting that HADOOP-6056 set java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true in hadoop-config.sh, with the intent of making all Hadoop execution environments use this setting, as of end/Jan/2011, and that need was in part identified by HDFS-1561, which also relates to BackupNode!

+1 for this proposed patch, which should do the same for HDFS unit tests, which indeed typically do not use hadoop-config.sh.

Please also open Jiras and submit the corresponding fixes for build.xml in COMMON and MAPRED components, even though failures due to IPv6 have not been detected there yet., Second part of the patch to turn off IPV6 for junit tests in contrib modules., +1  -  and contrib/hdfsproxy/build.xml imports contrib/build-contrib.xml, -1 overall.
