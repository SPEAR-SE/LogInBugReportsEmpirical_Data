[In HDFS-8905 there is a refactoring for {{ReadStatistics}} to make it separated out and thread safe. Looks like this is a good rational. Thanks., Thanks [~drankye]! HDFS-8905 indeed will address the issue. Feel free to resolve this jira., Thanks [~mingma] for the confirm! Yes I will resolve this once HDFS-8905 is in.]
