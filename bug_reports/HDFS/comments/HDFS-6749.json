[It looks to me like {{getAclStatus}} has the same problem, and maybe {{concat}} also?, concat's comments say that it does not support /.reserved/.inodes so I think that omission is by design. However, isFileClosed looks like it too needs appropriate calls to resolvePath.
, Sounds good.  Thanks, Charles., It looks like 4 places total: getXAttrs, listXAttrs, isFileClosed, getAclStatus. None of the snapshots methods call resolveHost, which I suspect is by design.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good.  I suppose the way to test this would be to call these APIs using /.reserved/.inodes/<inode ID> as the input path.  I'd expect the tests to fail before your patch, but pass after your patch., [~cnauroth],

Thanks for the review and that's a good point about adding a unit test. I've added calls to these methods in TestINodeFile and confirmed that each of them fails without the patch and passes with the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
