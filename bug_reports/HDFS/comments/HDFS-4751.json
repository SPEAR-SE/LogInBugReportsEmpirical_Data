[Teensy patch attached. Synchronizing on the DFSClient should make it safe.

I couldn't repro this race locally, but this is a known issue in Mockito [1] and this test has flaked on an Apache daily build before too.

This message is automatically generated., The test failure is unrelated. Has flaked on other builds too., Though I think you've correctly identified the issue, I'm not sure that this patch will definitely address it, since it looks to me like the {{isFilesBeingWrittenEmpty}} isn't synchronized on DFSClient. Please let me know if I'm missing something., I'm not sure what I was thinking in that last patch. New patch attached.

I couldn't find a nice way of synchronizing the renewer thread and test thread, so I resorted to adding a new method. I think the twiddling of {{DFSClient.isFilesBeingWrittenEmpty}} to get the renewer to exit was already a bit of a hack, so this is essentially equivalent., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
