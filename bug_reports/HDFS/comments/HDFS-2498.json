[I cannot reproduce it locally. So I ran Jenkins with {{-Dtest.output=yes}}. Here is the log., Upgrading to a blocker as test failure., See the following assert in the logs when the test actually succeeded:
{code}
Exception in thread "ReadWorker-7-/TestParallelRead.dat.0" java.lang.AssertionError: Bad args: 262098 + 46 should be < 262144
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:91)
	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:43)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestParallelRead$ReadWorker.read(TestParallelRead.java:137)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestParallelRead$ReadWorker.run(TestParallelRead.java:104)
{code}

This is a wrong condition, should be <=, Dup of HDFS-2287, You are right, Todd. I'll incorporate.
I see that even when TestParallelRead succeeds (rather rarely) on Jenkins its running time is around 14 minutes. While on my linux box it completes in less than 20 seconds.
And in the log attached I see
{code}
[junit] 2011-10-24 19:58:35,474 INFO  hdfs.TestParallelRead (TestParallelRead.java:runParallelRead(269)) - === Report: 16 threads read 941298 KB (across 1 file(s)) in 550.051s; average 1711.292225629987 KB/s
{code}
So the second runParallelRead() is actually running more than 9 minutes (550.051s). Again, on my box it completes in only 2-3 seconds.

Is it possible that because ReadWorker,run() does not catch Error (only Exception) the thread cannot complete?, That's strange that it's so slow - hundreds of times slower. Is the Jenkins build directory hosted on NFS or something? Is this the Apache jenkins boxes or one of your internal hosts?, This is Apache Jenkins. Here is how I just reproduced it:
https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-22-branch/113/console

Login to Jenkins. 
Go to: https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-22-branch/
Click on "Build now"
In the BUILD_ARGS add {{-Dtestcase=TestParallelRead -Dtest.output=yes}}
In the BUILD_TARGETS replace with {{clean test}}, This is a very old jira. I am going to resolve this as not a problem.]
