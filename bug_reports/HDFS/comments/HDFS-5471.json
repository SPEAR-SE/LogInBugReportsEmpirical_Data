[Colin asked to bump some CacheManager cleanup work from HDFS-5326 to this JIRA, cross-posting:

* Add and modify aren't that different besides the difference in required, optional, and default fields. I just first validate all present fields in the directive, then enforce required fields, then fill in default values.
* Modify and remove have the same checks for an existing entry
* Add and modify have the same checks for an existing cache pool
* All three do write checks to a cache pool, moving this into FSPermissionChecker or a method was an easy savings
* success/fail logs are inconsistently formatted. I'd like something like e.g. "methodName: successfully <verb> directive <directive>" and "methodName: failed to <verb> <noun> <parameters>:", e
{code}
      LOG.warn("addDirective " + directive + ": failed", e);
    LOG.info("addDirective " + directive + ": succeeded.");
...
      LOG.warn("modifyDirective " + idString + ": error", e);
    LOG.info("modifyDirective " + idString + ": applied " + directive);
...
      LOG.warn("removeDirective " + id + " failed", e);
    LOG.info("removeDirective " + id + ": removed");
{code}, This has turned into a cleanup patch in addition to the permission fix:

* Use a CachePoolInfo PB type everywhere
* Move permission checking/validation in CacheManager out into helper methods for hopefully better clarity
* Consistent log/exception messages, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., thanks, this is a good cleanup.  How about creating {{InvalidRequestException}} instead of {{InvalidDirectiveException}}?  The latter feels too specific to caching.  Also this would mean we could use it for the cache pool add/modify/etc rather than just adddirective, etc.  Sort of our equivalent to EINVAL., Thanks for the review Colin, new patch attached doing your recommended rename. I also used it in a few places in the CachePool code in CacheManager., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
