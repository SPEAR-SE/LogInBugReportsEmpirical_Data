[Good catch , [~megas].
Is there a way to add a unit test for this ?

This message is automatically generated., _unfinalizeBlock_ in _SimulatedFSDataset_ needs to be fixed as well. 
, _unfinalizeBlock_ indeed needs to be fixed, but I am not sure what the expected behavior should be. 
The way it is structured now, it seems that it would suffice to delete the block from the SimulatedFSDataset's map of blocks. However, note that this is not exactly the opposite of _finilizeBlock_ as one might expect.

Also, I realized that _TestSimulatedFSDataset_ also has bugs:
_checkInvalidBlock(ExtendedBlock b)_ creates a new simulated dataset every time it is called. Clearly, b will not be in the new dataset and _checkInvalidBlock_ practically always assumes that b is indeed an invalid block. Should I submit this as a separate bug, or fix it here?

, The block removal issues in _SimulatedFSDataset_ are related to the introduction of block pools.
Could you please fix the _unfinalizeBlock_ so that block is removed from the map inside _blockMap_ ?

Please open a new issue for the bugs in _TestSimulatedFSDataset_.

It might be related to the change here since there were a lot of ReplicaNotFoundException resulted from SimulatedFSDataset.  For example,

{noformat}, Thanks for letting me know [~szetszwo]. I will take a look., Thanks Benoy.  The patch here was correct.  There might be more bugs in SimulatedFSDataset or TestBalancer.testUnknownDatanode.  The fix here simply triggered them., [~szetszwo], I am not able to simulate the error locally.

I also went through other builds randomly, but doesn't see any more failures. 
, [~benoyantony], thanks for checking it.  Let's ignore it for now and see if the test fail again in the future.]
