[Trivial patch applies to both trunk and branch-2., +1 for the patch. I will commit it soon., I committed the patch. Thank you Andrew., The BlockPoolScanner is supposed to be starting a new period every three weeks, not every 5 seconds.  See HDFS-3194.

I think this -LOG.info +LOG.debug change should be reverted and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-3194?focusedCommentId=13399085&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13399085 should be merged instead., Committed to 2.1, @Andy, I think LOG.debug seems reasonable level for it. I am not sure if this calls for a revert. I will look at HDFS-3194., Please revert this change and review HDFS-3194., bq. Please revert this change and review HDFS-3194.
Not sure if you saw my previous comment. Debug level seems reasonable for that log. Do you disagree.

I will get to HDFS-3194 as soon as I can., bq. LOG.debug seems reasonable level for it.

I disagree, without the "Starting a new period" message it's very difficult to diagnose the block pool scanner in production scenarios.  Production cannot run with debug enabled due to other cases where debug logging is actually expensive.  So making this critical status message a LOG.debug makes it effectively useless.

I'd be OK with replacing all of these logs with a useful set of (for example) JMX metrics so that the scanner is more observable in an automatable/graphable fashion, but until that happens, this message needs to stay in at LOG.info., If the default period is supposed to be 3 weeks, then this message wouldn't represent the large fraction of log (therefore low S/N) as current. Whatever., bq. I disagree, without the "Starting a new period" message it's very difficult to diagnose the block pool scanner in production scenarios.
Let me know what production scenario you have in mind. Debug logs should be the last resort for this kind of debugging. For thread related issues one can look at java stack. I agree we should do it with metrics.

Currently this log is an annoyance. When HDFS-3194 goes in we can undo this change. , Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #2603 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/2603/])

, Linked this issue to HDFS-3194, reasonable to undo this once HDFS-3194 goes in.
(Actually HDFS-3194 addressing one more potential issue, that will be bit serious than this. But observation of that issue comes from this logs. Most of the times we will run with INFO logs only. If we change that to DEBUG, we would have missed that actual potential issue...More details on HDFS-3194)
Need to check, because of this change whether that patch going stale and need to regenerate again., Uma, the log can be turned back to info in HDFS-3194 as well., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #1135 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1135/])

, Looks like HDFS-3194 turned this log back to INFO level., Yea, now that we don't start a new period every 5 seconds it's no longer chatty even at info level., Sorry for the bother, I didn't see HDFS-3194. ]
