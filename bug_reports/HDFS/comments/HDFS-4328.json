[This appears to be different than HDFS-3825 since I don't see any exceptions in the test output.  Instead it just hangs trying to shutdown the cluster after the test ran normally., git-bisect indicates that this test timeout was introduced by HDFS-4274, and indeed I confirmed that reverting this commit allows the test to pass., Thread dumps show the test hanging when {{DataBlockScanner#shutdown}} tries to join with the {{blockScannerThread}}:

Meanwhile in the {{blockScannerThread}}, it's stuck in an infinite wait loop in {{DataTransferThrottler#throttle}}:

It's likely that this infinite loop problem existed before the HDFS-4274 patch, but {{blockScannerThread}} was a daemon thread, so it didn't block datanode shutdown.  With the HDFS-4274 patch, datanode shutdown now joins to this thread and waits for it to finish, causing it to block datanode shutdown.

I need to keep investigating why {{DataTransferThrottler#throttle}} is stuck in an infinite wait loop.
, My last comment wasn't entirely correct.  It's not an infinite loop.  It's making progress, but this test uses a very large block (>2 GB), and the throttler is just doing its job limiting bandwidth consumption.

I think the real problem is that {{DataTransferThrottler#throttle}} is ignoring an {{InterruptedException}}.  {{DataBlockScanner}} interrupts its thread to signal shutdown, so if that thread happens to be waiting in {{DataTransferThrottler#throttle}} at the time of interruption, then the signal gets ignored, and block verification just keeps on running.

I'll work on a patch to handle the {{InterruptedException}} by aborting any block verification in progress and allowing shutdown to proceed.  (That's effectively what the behavior was before HDFS-4274, because the thread was a daemon.)
, Makes sense, Chris. Thanks a lot for the investigation., I'm attaching a patch.  {{DataTransferThrottler#throttle}} has been changed to abort the throttle and re-interrupt the thread instead of ignoring the {{InterruptedException}}.  The main loop for sending packets has been changed to terminate early if it gets interrupted.  I've also added a timeout to the @Test annotation in {{TestLargeBlock}}., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1, the patch looks good to me. I also manually ensured that the test passes without timing out after this change.

Thanks a lot for figuring this out and fixing it, Chris. Now we just need to get test-patch to notice timeouts so we catch these earlier. :), I've just committed this to trunk.
