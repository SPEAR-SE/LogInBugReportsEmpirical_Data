[Right now I don't have unit test case to reproduce but tried stubbing DatanodeUtil.createTmpFile(...) to throw IOException unconditionally., Attached patch to release reserved space in case of IOException while creating the RBW file, bq. In a scenario, when the data node disk is full it causes no space left IOException.
If this was truely the cause, it indicates {{getNextVolume()}} is not working properly. Normally {{DiskOutOfSpaceException}} is thrown before any space is reserved. So, if you believe it was caused by {{ENOSPACE}}, try finding out why the remaining space check was not working.  We have seen bad disks causing ext4 to return incorrect values to the du command. In that case, the {{getAvailable()}} may not return correct result.

In any case, the proposed change is still good for any other types of file creation failures.  [~arpitagarwal], what do you think?, Thanks [~kihwal], In that scenario we had only one disk path configured for data node.
Also for information, get availability on separate Java code  test  and df command gives available space from disk as 100+ GB but data node jmx report shown as 3 GB  after few hours  also.

In order to confirm the leak , I have ensured  through datanode heap dump analysis that reservedRBW variable in FSVolumeImpl is holding the number equalent to missing 100+ GB., Hi [~kanaka], have you ruled out HDFS-8072? I'll take a look at this patch., The patch looks good. Nitpick - you can simplify the try block.
{code}
    try {
      return getBlockPoolSlice(bpid).createRbwFile(b);
    } catch (IOException exception) {
{code}

+1 with that fixed., AFAIK, it is different from HDFS-8072.., [~kanaka] Nice finding...And thanks for working on this..+1 (non-binding ) after addressing [~arpitagarwal] comment., \\

This message was automatically generated., Canceling patch for addressing the comment above.., Thanks for the review [~arpitagarwal], I am aware of HDFS-8072 which is handling when client terminate while DN receiving the block. 

However this issue happens during the construction of block receiver as per the stack I observed. (Right now I don't have stack.. will update description with exception stack trace some time tomorrow) 

I will wait for the jenkins result before updating the patch for the given review comment.

 

,  :) jenkins gave result while I was writing comment. I have updated the patch for comment now., Thanks for updating the patch.

+1 for the change. Is it straightforward to add a test case?, I am trying to find a way to mock BlockPoolSlice/java.io.File to reproduce it in junit test case. :( But couldn't do it successfully yet.
Down to File level can't be done as implementation looks different from java 7 & 8.

If its urgent for 2.7.1, we can go a head,, Otherwise I will try for some time to add test case., Updated patch with test case. [~arpitagarwal], please review., Hi [~kanaka], thank you for adding the test case. I don't think the reflection trick in the test is working, else we'd get an exception while writing the file correct?, \\

This message was automatically generated., :) Reflection was working fine [~arpitagarwal] on 0th DN, but file creation was not failed may be because of multiple DNs in the MiniDFSCluster.
Anyway to avoid confusion, I have updated patch to start single DN and expecting exception during file creation. 

Seems some problem with jenkins due to maintenance shutdown. Will check the failures if any in the next build., Thank you for fixing the test case [~kanaka]! The v4 patch and test look great.

+1 pending Jenkins., \\

This message was automatically generated., Committed for 2.7.1. Thanks [~kanaka].

I did not include the test case in branch-2.7 as it causes a build failure.
