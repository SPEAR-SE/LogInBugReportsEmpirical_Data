[This must be because of the way the build files are setup. Please let me know if you are blocked on a fix for this issue., This also happens with MAPREDUCE's contrib/ stuff. The ${version} is present in the main project's build.xml, which isn't really imported.

What could be a proper fix? Move ${version} to build-utils.xml?, thriftfs contrib removed]
