[Hello [~machey].  I recommend taking these questions to the user@hadoop.apache.org mailing list.  We use JIRA for tracking confirmed bugs and feature requests.  We use user@hadoop.apache.org for usage advice and troubleshooting.

Regarding whether or not this is a recommended approach, I think it depends on a few other factors.  Is the intent to use these cached files from Hadoop workloads, such as MapReduce jobs or Hive queries?  If not, then I wonder if your use case might be better served by something more directly focused on general caching use cases, such as Redis or memcached.  If your use case does involve Hadoop integration, then certainly Centralized Cache Management is worth exploring.

Regarding the timeouts, I can tell from the exception that this is the heartbeat RPC sent from the DataNode to the NameNode.  I recommend investigating connectivity between the DataNode and the NameNode and examining the logs from both sides to try to determine if something is going wrong in the handling of the heartbeat message.  On one hand, a heartbeat timeout is not an error condition that is specific to Centralized Cache Management.  It could happen whether or not you're using that feature.  On the other hand, the heartbeat message does contain some optional information about the state of cache capacity and current usage at the DataNode.  That information would trigger special handling logic at the NameNode side, so I suppose there is a chance that something in that logic is hanging up the heartbeat handling.  Investigating the logs might reveal more.

user@hadoop.apache.org would be a good forum for further discussion of both of these topics.]
