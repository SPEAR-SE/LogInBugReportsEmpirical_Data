[Seems like we have two problems:
1) we don't notice that we've lost a connection to a NN until the next time we try to make an RPC
2) addBlock isn't idempotent

I think we may be able to address #1 in many cases by checking socket.isConnected() or something before making each RPC call. It's not guaranteed to work but makes it a tight race instead of a wide one.

#2 could be addressed by augmenting addBlock() with a simple check: if the value passed for "previousBlock" is equal to the 2nd-from-last block of the file, and the last block of the file is under construction with 0 length, then we can simply re-return the last block., Converting to top-level issue with commit of HDFS-1623., This patch makes getAdditionalBlock() idempotent. I think it might still have some issues with append, perhaps - will see what tests it fails up on Jenkins, (aso need to make close() idempotent, I think, before we mark this JIRA resolved -- just wanted to post the partial patch to see how it fares against the whole suite), New rev fixes the issue with append(): the problem is that the client doesn't send any previous block when appending to a file, when the append starts exactly at a block boundary.

I attempted to make the client cleaner, but DFSOutputStream is a hairball. Without a substantial reworking of that, it was cleaner to do this on the server side., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks pretty good to me, Todd. A few comments:

# Did you intend to leave that INFO log in DFSOutputStream? It seems to me like it should either be removed or lowered to debug or trace.
# Why make the changes in MiniDFSCluster? Those seem unrelated to this issue, and has the potential to cause unintended side effects in the tests, since some tests might be relying on the RPC behavior which this change cuts out of the call stack.

I really like the new test testIdempotentAllocateBlock, and thanks for converting TestFileAppend3 to JUnit 4-style., Attached patch implements idempotence on the complete() RPC as well.

The approach is similar but simpler because the client reliably sends the last block as part of this IPC. Let me know if the new comment block isn't clear enough.

I also removed the debug log message from DFSOutputStream that I accidentally left in.

The reason for the test changes in MiniDFSCluster is that the cluster.transitionToActive() call to fail-back in doTestWriteOverFailoverWithDnFail was failing without it. The IPC client cache was holding a connection to the restarted node, so using the transitionToActive() RPC here threw an EOFException.

I think if other tests want to explicitly test the RPC call, they should use the normal APIs like HAAdmin or FailoverController., Latest patch looks great. +1 pending Jenkins., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
