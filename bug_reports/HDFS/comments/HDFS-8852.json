[May be we can update it to "Appending the content to files is supported at the end but cannot by updated at arbitrary point and it is also not possible to have multiple writers. Files can only be written by a single writer.", +1 for updating the document. Thanks [~nhahtdh] for the report and [~ajithshetty] for taking this issue. I'm thinking
* "the end of the files is supported" would be better than "files is supported at the end".
* "cannot by updated" should be "cannot be updated".

bq. and it is also not possible to have multiple writers. Files can only be written by a single writer."
Already written in "Data Replication" section (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.1/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html#Data_Replication), so we don't need to write it again., +1 will update accordingly. Thanks [~ajisakaa], Please review the patch, \\

bq. except for appends
truncate, introduced in Hadoop 2.7.0, can change the file. Would you change "appends" to "appends and truncates"? I'm +1 if that is addressed., Thanks for the input [~ajisakaa]
