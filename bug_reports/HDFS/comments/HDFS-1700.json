-1 system test framework.  The patch failed system test framework compile.

The system test failure is a failure to pick up the newest COMMON jar, even though the other tests in test-patch did
so.  Opening a bug for that.  Seems okay to ignore it this time, as the changes in this patch are not likely to change fault-injection scenarios, nor to impact system test results.
, +1 for the change. I committed the patch.]
