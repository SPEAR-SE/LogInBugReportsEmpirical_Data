[[~gehaijiang] Thanks for filing this JIRA.
To my knowledge, I don't think it's convenient for EC to support append operation,
since the block of EC file is divided into several cells which are distributed to different nodes. 
I'd prefer marking this JIRA as "Won't fix"(If I'm wrong, please let me know), Thanks for creating this jira, [~gehaijiang], and thanks for the comment, [~yuanbo]. This may duplicate of HDFS-7663.

Appending operation depends on hflush/hsync and it has been being implemented and discussed in HDFS-7661. But it is determined as unsupported feature for 3.0., Thanks [~tasanuma0829]
I mark it as duplicated JIRA.]
