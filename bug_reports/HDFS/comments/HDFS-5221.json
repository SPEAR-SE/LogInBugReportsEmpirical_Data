[We're thinking of two approaches:
1) Fixing the hdfs-client when the hftp is used to use a retry mechanism to fail over to the active NN
2) Use URL re-direction from the standby to the active NN.

Advantage of 1) is that it will work even if the (previously) active NN host is completely down, or if the NN process is not running at all.

Advantage of 2) is that it will give _some_ benefits / resilience, even if Hadoop 1.0 clients are not modified., This might be a dup of HDFS-5123, Duping to HDFS-5123. Joep, it seems likely that one of your two approaches will be implemented (probably the first).]
