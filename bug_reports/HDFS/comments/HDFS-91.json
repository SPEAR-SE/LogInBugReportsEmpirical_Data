[
to fix this inline, something like the following is needed:

<%
  response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
  response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache");
  response.setHeader("Expires", "0");
%> 

However, this just increases the amount of replicated java code across every JSP page.

Better to have a JSP utils class which is bound to the various instances, and which can do this as part of a page init

public class JspPageHelper {
  
  private HttpServletRequest request;
  private HttpServletResponse response;

  public JspPageHelper(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
    this.request = request;
    this.response = response;
  }
  
  public void initPage() {
    response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
    response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache");
    response.setHeader("Expires", "0");
  }
}

This class could also do more of the jsp output, but then you'd need to have the JSP classes on the classpath; this should clearly go into a separate module under src/, have some tests, etc.



, The test for this would be with httpclient or htmlunit -fetch the page, look for the headers., Fixed by HADOOP-8998.]
