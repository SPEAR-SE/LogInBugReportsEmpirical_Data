[bash-3.2$ ./bin/hadoop --config /etc/hadoop/ dfs -tail hftp://NN_HOST:50070/file_path
tail: Can't seek!


No information was captured in the namenode logs., This behavior is expected for hftp, although -tail should work for webhdfs.
Please re-test on 204 to confirm that it didn't work in hftp on 204 either., in 204 -tail with hftp does not work, Thanks Rajit, i have tested webhdfs with tail and it worked in 205., As mentioned by Matt and Rajit, hftp in 0.20 does not support position read (or seek) so that the failure is expected.
