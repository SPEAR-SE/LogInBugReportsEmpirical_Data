[I was able to reproduce the bug on the latest 3.0.0 code from the git repo.

It looks like the uri wasn't being properly encoded before send the request, i.e., % should be converted to %25. So, I added to explorer.js an encoding command.

But after that, the datanode broke when answering, because it wasn't decoding the uris. To fix that, I added to ParameterParser.java the decoding command from QueryStringDecoder.

See the attached hdfs-6662.patch for the diff code., {code}
+    abs_path = encodeURI(abs_path);
     var url = '/webhdfs/v1' + abs_path + '?op=GET_BLOCK_LOCATIONS';
{code}

I think it should be {{encodeURIComponent()}} instead of {{encodeURI()}}.

Can you add a unit test to ensure that the DN decodes the path correctly?, Thanks Haohui for noticing it.

In fact, I had to add {{encodeURIComponent()}} with some adjustments, because it encodes even the separator {{/}}, thus broking the URI. But now it treats the slash and other reserved characters (&, =, +, for example) as well.

This update is on the second patch version. I pretend to also add the unit test soon., I've added a unit test to ensure that the decoding is correct. I'm attaching a new patch with this update., Looks good to me. +1 pending Jenkins.
* Built a cluster with the patch.
* Created some files including %, &, + and =.
* Confirmed the WebUI worked well with the paths., Cancelling my +1. Some comments:
{code}
+  private static final String SCAPED_PATH = "hdfs-6662/test%25251%26%3Dtest?op=OPEN";
+  private static final String EXPECTED_PATH = "/hdfs-6662/test%251&=test";
{code}
The paths look to be used only once, so would you move them into the test method?
{code}
+     Assert.assertTrue(testParser.path().equals(EXPECTED_PATH));
{code}
You can use {{Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual)}} instead of {{Assert.assertTrue}} to make the error message clear., HI [~gerson23] 
can you please adress [~ajisakaa] comments..? , Hi, yeah, I'll upload a new version of the patch with the changes soon., Thanks for noticing it. I'll update the patch., I've upload the third version of the patch with [~ajisakaa] suggestions.

Would you reverse the order of the arguments to match with {{assertEquals(expected, actual)}}? Sorry for going back and forth. +1 if that is addressed., No problem. I'll fix that., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
