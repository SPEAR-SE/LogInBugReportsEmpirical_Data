* If you have already formatted the NameNode, or are converting a non-HA-enabled cluster to be HA-enabled, you should now copy over the contents of your NameNode metadata directories to the other, unformatted NameNode by running the command "hdfs namenode -bootstrapStandby" on the unformatted NameNode. Running this command *needs the formatted NameNode to be up and functional, and will* also ensure that the JournalNodes (as configured by dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir) contain sufficient edits transactions to be able to start the new NameNode.
* If you are converting a non-HA NameNode to be HA, you should run the command "hdfs *namenode* -initializeSharedEdits", which will initialize the JournalNodes with the edits data from the local NameNode edits directories.
