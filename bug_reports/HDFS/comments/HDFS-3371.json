This message is automatically generated., I'm not sure I see the point of this change. It only changes EditLogBackupInputStream, where closing is a no-op anyway. And closing all of {{in, tracker, inner}} isn't necessary, since the wrapper streams will pass through the close to the streams that they wrap already., Currently, this code gets an NPE:
{code}
EditLogBackupInputStream elbis = new EditLogBackupInputStream(...);
elbis.close();
{code}

so that seems incorrect.

Also, if there are exceptions, you can't really assume that all of the streams will exist in EditLogBackupInputStream#close.

Yeah, it's a minor nit, so it's really up to you guys whether it's worth it to submit such a small fix.  But I'd rather have it than not, personally., I guess there's no point in doing this one as the outer stream will close all the inner ones.]
