[[~yzhang], could you please take a look at this?

We could either try to have Last Checkpoint: be a relative time (e.g. "26 secs ago" as the current SecondaryNameNode#toString does, or we could have it be a wallclock time. Unfortunately, having it be a relative time means that the JS for secondary/status.html would have to compute that in the brower client's local TZ which is problematic. In fact, Start Time is already in wallclock time so it feels best to mimic that. This does, however, mean that the #toString method has to be changed (back) to have Last Checkpoint be a wallclock time rather than the relative time that HDFS-5591 changed it to be., \\

This message was automatically generated., No test is needed since it's just a change to a display message., Hi Charles,

This change basically makes sense. We were too zealous when we changed getLastCheckpointTime(), that needs to still be a wallclock time for compatibility purposes.

However, we have the option of displaying both the wallclock and the relative time in the 2NN's toString. On the webUI, if we expose the relative time via a new MXBean method, we can again display both., [~andrew.wang],

Thanks for the review. Please check out the attached., \\

This message was automatically generated., The test failure is spurious. I ran the failed test (TestDiskspaceQuotaUpdate) and it passed on my machine.

The checkstyle warning is

{quote}
<error line="56" column="3" severity="error" message="Redundant &apos;public&apos; modifier." source="com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.modifier.RedundantModifierCheck"/>
{quote}

This is because I added the new getLastCheckpointDeltaMs() method. It is complaining about "public" being redundant. I could remove it, but keeping it there is maintain the existing style of other getters.
, Hi Charles, this patch looks good, only two comments:

* Since we return 0 for the delta when no checkpoint has been done, we can't distinguish this situation from a checkpoint having been just completed. We could also check the wallclock time, but so we can interpret the delta in isolation, how about returning a -1 value in this situation instead?
* We get the monotonic time before calling doCheckpoint, and set the member variable after it finishes. Could we do the same with the wallclock time for parity? doCheckpoint takes some time, so as is they won't match up quite right., [~andrew.wang],

Thanks for the review. The .003 patch makes your suggested changes. I also added a < 0 check to dfs-dust.js. Perhaps it should just return "" instead of "unknown".
, (!) The patch artifact directory on has been removed! 
This is a fatal error for test-patch.sh.  Aborting. 
Jenkins (node H8) information at https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/10417/ may provide some hints., +1 LGTM, thanks Charles. I rekicked Jenkins, should come back clean., \\

It might make more sense to move it to the template (i.e., {{status.html}}), as the function might later be superseded by moment.js., [~wheat9],

I'll make the change in a followup-jira. Thanks for the review.
, I created HDFS-8292 for this., OK, I'll commit this shortly. Thanks for looking at this Haohui, and Charles for the patch., Committed to trunk and branch-2. Charles, please update this JIRA when you file the follow-on, and we'll get it sorted right quick. Thanks for the patch., Ah, I see the JIRA has been created, thanks. I'll review as soon as a patch goes up :), FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7703 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7703/])
