[Hey Sujay. I think you need to copy-paste the error so folks outside our VPN can see what you're talking about :), Just guessing here from the name of the JIRA, but a Distributed cache object changed error typically happens when the file on HDFS changes in-between the submission of a job and a container being launched that is going to download the file.  It sounds to me like it may be a test error where you a submitting lots of jobs and changing an object in HDFS in between them that is shared by all of the jobs.  I cannot be sure without more information though.]
