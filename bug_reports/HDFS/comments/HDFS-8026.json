This message is automatically generated., TestTracing fails again., TestTracing succeeds locally for me.  The jenkins failure seems to be a timeout that I can't reproduce.  Let me re-run this on upstream Jenkins., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I think the previous test timeout on {{TestTracing}} was not related to this patch, since it didn't reproduce the second time I ran it on JIRA.  I also can't reproduce it locally.  This patch is not really changing how {{TestTracing}} works, just tweaking a string that it's looking for, so I would not expect it to regress this.  While it's kind of unfortunate that the test (may be?) flaky, I think we should not let that block this patch.

I'm going to commit in just a bit... if we hit more timeouts on {{TestTracing}}, we'll have to have a separate JIRA to investigate.  Thanks, [~hitliuyi]., Yes, please go ahead to commit it, thanks Colin.

I remember there is a JIRA about {{TestTracing}} failure filed few days ago, but I can't find it now, let's use that JIRA?, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7488 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7488/])

, I'm not sure if there is an open jira about TestTracing being flaky.  The ones that I'm familiar with (and can find in a quick search) have already been resolved.  We can open a new one if it keeps re-occurring.  In the meantime, I put it down to the usual jenkins flakiness.  Hopefully the new test-patch.sh will resolve some of these issues..., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #885 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/885/])
