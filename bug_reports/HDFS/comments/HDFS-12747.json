[I've been unable to determine how/why the received IBR for block1 was "lost".  I suspected a race condition with {{updatePipeline}}, which did occur for block1, which sparked Kihwal into remembering HDFS-11445 which describes the same race condition.  HDFS-11755 was believed to inadvertently fix the issue but it apparently does not., It involves decomming.  HDFS-11499 attempted a partial fix the problem.  About 2.5yr I internally patched symptoms of the problem in a more complete way, but based on what I understand now is not entirely insufficient., move to 2.8.4 as 2.8.3 has been released., move out to 2.8.6 given no progress for a while.]
