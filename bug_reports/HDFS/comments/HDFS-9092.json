Hi [~brandonli],

Thanks a lot for some side discussion about this issue earlier. i got to the bottom and implemented a solution. Would you please help taking a look at the patch? Very much appreciated!

This message was automatically generated., Thank you, [~yzhangal] for the patch. Could you roughly describe the idea of the fix? possibly by copy&paste the comment from the code to here., Thanks [~brandonli].

Good idea, below is some comment I made in the code, hope it helps:

{quote}
 /**
   * Overlapping Write Request Handling
   * A write request can be in three states:
   *   s0. just created, with data != null
   *   s1. dumped as length "count", and data set to null
   *   s2. read back from dumped area as length "count"
   * 
   * Write requests may have overlapping range, we detect this by comparing 
   * the data offset range of the request against the current offset of data
   * already written to HDFS. There are two categories:
   * 
   * 1. If the beginning part of a new write request data is already written
   * due to an earlier request, we alter the new request by trimming this
   * portion before the new request enters state s0, and the originalCount is
   * remembered.
   * 
   * 2. If the lower end of the write request range is beyond the current
   * offset of data already written, we put the request into cache, and detect
   * the overlapping when taking the request out from cache.
   * 
   * For category 2, if we find out that a write request overlap with another,
   * this write request is already in state s0, s1, or s3. We trim the
   * beginning part of this request, by remembering the size of this portion
   * as trimDelta. So the resulted offset of the write request is
   * "offset + trimDelta" and the resulted size of the write request is
   * "count - trimDelta". 
   * 
   * What important to notice is, if the request is in s1 when we do the
   * trimming, the data dumped is of size "count", so when we load
   * the data back from dumped area, we should set the position of the data
   * buffer to trimDelta.
   */

, BTW, 

Category 1 is handled by existing code (however, it will not add the write request to cache if the cache is not empty). category 2 is where the issue reported in this jira from. My fix handles the case when cache is not empty for category 1, and handles category 2 as described above.


, For category2, the assumption of the fix is that, the trimmed data is the same as what's already written to HDFS.

So far we claim that NFS gateway supports the user cases of file uploading and file streaming. 
For file uploading, the overlapped section is safe to drop since it will be the same as what's already written to HDFS. It's the same case for file streaming. 

The only possible problem is this: before the patch, if users do random update to an HDFS file, NFS gateway will report error. With this patch, there is a chance we wont's see the error if it happens that the updated section is trimmed.

Since random write is not supported anyway, the possible nicer reaction to a random update seems still acceptable to me.   , +1. Patch looks good to me. Thank you [~yzhangal], Thanks a lot [~brandonli]!

I found trunk is changed such that the patch no longer compiles. Uploading rev 002 to address it. In addition, removed extra spaces reported by last jenkins job.

I originally planned to get this into 2.6.2, however, I found that both 2.7 and 2.6 miss some changes thus the patch can not be applied cleanly. I'm targetting this change to 2.8 for now.

, Thanks [~brandonli] a lot for the review!

I committed to trunk and branch-2. 

BTW, the test audit msg is due to my accidental inclusion of CHANGES.txt in the patch; somehow my earlier cleaning of whitespaces using  --whitespace=fix did not clean up everything; the new test failure is irrelevant to the fix here.

, There are new findbugs warnings in the last patch. Please comment in [HDFS-9245] that the findbugs warnings can be ignored., Hi [~liuml07],

Per

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/12719/artifact/patchprocess/newPatchFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs-nfs.html

It shows 0 findbugs.

Guess you meant
Pre-patch Findbugs warnings: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/12719/artifact/patchprocess/trunkFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs.html

Thanks.
, Thank you [~yzhangal] for your quick reply. You're right. The Jenkins report shows 0 findbugs. I can reproduce the findbugs warnings locally and saw the pre-patch in the QA report., Thanks [~liuml07]. It'd be nice to find out why jenkins job did not report the same. We should look into HDFS-9245 too. 

, It happens to me sometimes when the Jenkins did not report findbugs, in which case I have to run it locally to double check. It will be nice if we can find out why.

As to the warning itself, I think the unsynchronized access is read only, and for LOG/toString purpose. Do it make sense to make the {{offset}} and {{originalCount}} volatile?, s/Do/Does/, mark  this.]
