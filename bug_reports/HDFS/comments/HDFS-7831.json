[{{binarySearch(diffs, snapshotId)}} returns {{i == -insertPoint-1}}, where {{insertPoint}} is the index of the first element greater than the key. So if the {{snapshotId}} is not found then we can start searching backwards from {{insertPoint-1 == -i-2}}.
Current code start with {{-i == insertPoint+1}} and unnecessarily checks two extra elements., Fixed the starting index for the loop. Also we do not need to check that {{i < diffs.size()}}, because now it always is.
This should be treated as an optimization, so there are no additional test cases., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
