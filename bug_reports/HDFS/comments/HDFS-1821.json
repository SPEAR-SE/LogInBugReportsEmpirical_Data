Took a second look,
- There is another call to {{getUserName()}} in {{NameNode.createSymlink(..)}}.  So we need to change it as well.
- Then, username should be obtained from {{dirPerms}} in {{FSDirectory.addSymlink(..)}}.

In the existing code, we have {{FSDirectory.addSymlink(..)}} calling {{UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser()}} which violates the code design: {{FSDirectory}} manages the directory tree data structure and should not care about {{UserGroupInformation}}   The username resolution should be done in {{NameNode}} or {{FSNamesystem}}.  The use of {{UserGroupInformation}} in {{FSDirectory.addSymlink(..)}} is the only such violation in {{FSDirectory}}.

John, could you change your patch?  Sorry that I didn't see it earlier., patch to address comments from Nicholas,      [exec]
