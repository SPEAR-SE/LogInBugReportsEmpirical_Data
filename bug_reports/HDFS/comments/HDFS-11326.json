[Hello [~piaoyu zhang] thanks for reporting this jira.
Do you have more information regarding this finding? For instance, stack trace that shows a thread is stuck in this call?

Without more information it would be hard to tell what happened here exactly. If I were to guess, was the file being closed in a snapshottable directory?

Also, your reported environment is on Hadoop 2.2. A lot have changed since Hadoop 2.2, do you think the issue still applies to more recent versions?, Hello [~piaoyu zhang] sounds like this was already fixed by HDFS-5790, which was included in Hadoop 2.4 and above.

With the little information given, I am going to close this as a dup of HDFS-5790., For some reason I can't resolve this jira. So I'm just going to remove the target version so it doesn't appear in Hadoop 3.0 release dashboard., Deleted unresolveable duplicates of this Jira HDFS-11325, 11329, 11330, 11331 and 11332., Thanks,[~arpitagarwal].  It happened in the network problem.  I create the issue but can't see it . so it repeat in issue. ]
