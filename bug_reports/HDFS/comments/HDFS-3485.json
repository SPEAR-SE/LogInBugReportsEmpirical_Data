[Hmm, nice find.

It's kind of unfortunate that java.lang.System conflates the concepts of "nanosecond accuracy" and "monotonic time."  Linux has a coarse-grained monotonic timer, but there's probably no way to really get at it through Java6., Yes, it is a little unfortunate, there is a tiny optimization that we miss out on here, we could save a few hundred clock cycles if we could use CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE.

But, on modern systems the overhead of CLOCK_MONOTONIC (which presumably backs nanoTime()) is not that much greater than CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE, and is probably the same as gettimeofday() which presumably backs currentTimeMillis()., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Looks pretty good. One small nit: can you move monotonicMillis() to o.a.h.hdfs.server.common.Util, so it's next to the "now()" function we've already got there? Then, folks are more likely to see it and use the right method. Also worth adding a note to the javadoc for this function like: "Whenever time is only used to calculate a duration or interval, this method should be used instead of {@link #now()} so that the timer is not affected by changes in the system time.", Thanks for the comments, Todd! I've renamed the helper to monotonicNow() and moved it to Util.  I also added a note to the now() javadoc noting when it should not be used. , +1 overall.
