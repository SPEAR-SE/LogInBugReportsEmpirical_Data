, no. Follow the link for suggestions on how to go about addressing problems like that, the key one being: not via JIRA, For future readers:
I encountered this exact problem while trying to run the NameNode on Docker, and the issue was `hdfs` having one UID when running `hdfs namenode -format` and a different UID when starting `hdfs namenode`. I suppose mismatches between `supergroup` and `hadoop` could potentially cause this too.]
