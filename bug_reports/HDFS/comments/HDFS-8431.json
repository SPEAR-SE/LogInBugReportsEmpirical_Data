[changed hdfs.cmd to support crypto command. This was added only in hdfs shell script and hence was not working on windows

Hand tested on Windows 2012 server, Hi Anu.  This looks good, and I can help test it.

I have one minor nitpick.  hdfs.cmd is much like the hdfs bash script on branch-2.  (The cmd scripts haven't implemented the bash rewrite that was done on trunk.)  I'd like to try to keep the cmd scripts as similar as possible to the branch-2 bash scripts.  For consistency in the usage output, let's please move {{crypto}} after {{cacheadmin}}.  That's how the commands are ordered in the bash script's usage message:

https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/bin/hdfs#L68

It looks like some other inconsistencies in the ordering have crept in, but don't worry about fixing those within the scope of this issue.  We can just make sure the addition of {{crypto}} doesn't introduce a new inconsistency.  :-)

Thanks!, will do, I did look at if there was any ordering and since I did not find any added it at the bottom in the help.

, [~sjlee0] backported this to 2.6.1 after fixing minor conflicts.

I just pushed the commit to 2.6.1 after running compilation.

, Just pulled this into branch-2.7 (release 2.7.2) as it already exists in 2.6.1.

branch-2 patch applies cleanly. Ran compilation before the push.]
