, The removed private constructor was used in Datanode to create SimulatedFSDataset using reflection, in the code below:
{noformat}
this.data = (FSDatasetInterface) ReflectionUtils.newInstance(
                   Class.forName("org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.SimulatedFSDataset"), conf);
{noformat}

Removed constructor resulted in failure of tests that depended on the above code., I ran the tests to make sure the above test failures are fixed., I committed the patch., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #406 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/406/])
