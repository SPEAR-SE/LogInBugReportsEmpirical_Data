[IMHO,CLI should be same as rest call as storagepolicy bydefault it will be enabled.

 

CC to [~arpitagarwal]/[~surendrasingh]/[~msingh] as you worked on HDFS-11968., Thanks for raising this issue [~brahmareddy]. The difference between the REST and CLI command is because of the way {{-getStoragePolicy}} is implemented.

{{-getStoragePolicy}} is implemented by getting the file status of the path and then fetching the storage policy out of it.
{code}
 status = fs.getFileStatus(p);
......
byte storagePolicyId = status.getStoragePolicy();
if (storagePolicyId == HdfsConstants.BLOCK_STORAGE_POLICY_ID_UNSPECIFIED) {
System.out.println("The storage policy of " + path + " is unspecified");
return 0;
{code}

where as the rest call directly fetches the storage policy for a given path, and hot is the default storage policy.
{code}
    return new BlockStoragePolicySuite(hotId, policies);
  }

  private final byte defaultPolicyID;
  private final BlockStoragePolicy[] policies;

  public BlockStoragePolicySuite(byte defaultPolicyID,
      BlockStoragePolicy[] policies) {
    this.defaultPolicyID = defaultPolicyID;
    this.policies = policies;
  }
{code}, Thanks for the analysis [~msingh]. 

[~brahmareddy], any change here will likely be incompatible and hence out for Hadoop 3.x, so probably we should leave things as they are. What do you think?, Thanks [~brahmareddy] for reporting issue.

One suggestion, currently  {{-getStoragePolicy}} command give the current inode policy. It will not inherit from the parent. We can add one optional parameter "-i" in command to return the inherited policy when current inode policy is undefined.  

For example: 
{noformat}
./hdfs storagepolicies -getStoragePolicy [-i] -path <path>{noformat}]
