This message is automatically generated., I know getListingInt() does it too, but it will be better if we do logAudit() outside of the FSNamespace lock. We could catch AccessControlException, record the failure, then rethrow. In the finally block, we can then call logAudit() with false if a failure was recorded, otherwise call it with true. , Thanks for the comments Kihwal.  Attached updates to move the logAuditEvent outside the lock., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The eclipse build works fine for me, but the pre-commit build had an OOM while in the hadoop-mapreduce-examples module.
