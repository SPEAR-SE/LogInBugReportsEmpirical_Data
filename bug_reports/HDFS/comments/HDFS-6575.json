[I am going to give a patch later.
This issue is found in the trunk., I changed the title for this jira.
I made some mistake in my UT, that is why I thought there might be a bug in quota update.

Now I have gone through the code about quota update when changing File replication. It looks good.
However, looks like some UTs for quota update are missing. We should add them.]
