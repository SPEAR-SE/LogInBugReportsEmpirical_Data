[The CacheCleaner thread is supposed to time out replicas that haven't been used for a while (5 minutes by default).  It looks like this thread has not been timing out the non-mmapped entries as it should, due to a typo.  This patch should fix it.

We probably should also have the DN notify the client when a block that the client is reading is unlinked.  It could do this via the existing shared memory segment code, in the same way we handle uncaching now., Hi, Colin.  Thank you for picking this up.  The patch looks good.  Can you please enhance {{TestShortCircuitCache}} to catch this problem, just to guard against a regression in the future?, Thanks, Chris.  There is an existing unit test for timing out replicas, but it was broken.  Basically, "staleness" was kicking in, even though the cache cleaner was not working.

"Staleness" is different than the LRU timeout, since the LRU timeout is based on the time since the replica was last used, but staleness is based on the time since the replica was created (unless shared memory is enabled.)

This patch fixes that, and also fixes a case where we were using the configured value of {{dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms}} instead of the value of {{dfs.client.mmap.cache.timeout.ms}} to deal with mmap timeouts., +1 for the patch, pending Jenkins run.  I just clicked Submit Patch.  Thank you for tuning the test, and nice find on the mmap timeout issue too., lgtm, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
