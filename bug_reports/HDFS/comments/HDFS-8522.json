[RollingWindowManager.java:getTopUsersForMetric issue has been fixed in HDFS-7890., Attach a patch that change the listCorruptFileBlocks log to DEBUG level and also clean up if (NameNode.stateChangeLog.isDebugEnabled()) as it is not needed for slf4j., Thanks Xiaoyu for doing the cleanup. Overall LGTM, but we should use string templating with braces for the stateChangeLog debug logs, to avoid string construction overhead., +1 to Andrew's comment. Also does stateChangeLog use SLF4J? Not clear to me from a quick look., It's using {{LoggerFactory.getLogger}} which is from org.slf4j so I think it's good. I think log4j will compile error when you pass all the extra parameters too., Thanks [~andrew.wang] and [~arpitagarwal] for the review. I've updated the patch with string template for slf4j debug log in FSNamesystem., Some of those lines look a bit long, but checkstyle will catch it if so. +1 pending Jenkins., Fit the lines within 80 columns., +1 for the .02 patch, pending Jenkins., \\

This message was automatically generated., I don't add test because this is a log only changes. The 1st checkstyle issue is known and the 2nd one will be addressed by reverting unnecessary change at FSNamesystem.java:2513 for Log.Warn(...), which causes the line longer than 80 characters. The test failure is unrelated. The change is low risk, I will commit it shortly to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7.

{code}
./hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/FSNamesystem.java:1: File length is 7,628 lines (max allowed is 2,000).
./hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/FSNamesystem.java:2513: Line is longer than 80 characters (found 82).
{code}, The only delta from .02->.03 is to revert unnecessary change at FSNamesystem.java:2513 for Log.Warn(...), which causes the line longer than 80 characters., +1 for the v3 patch, pending Jenkins., \\
