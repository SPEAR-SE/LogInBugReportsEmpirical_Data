[HADOOP-7426 is for the doc.  The configuration description is availabe in the doc., It would be useful to show how this file can be referenced in the core-site.xml since this is a typical use case.

For example,core-site.xml

<xi:include href="pig-mount-table-bigpig.xml"/>


I'd also note that the client side table is loaded dynamically and there's no need to restart the namenodes., Hi Araceli,

You may take a look the doc posted in HADOOP-7426.  There is an example in Appendix B.  It also tells how to use
{code}
<xi:include href="mountTable.xml"/>
{code}]
