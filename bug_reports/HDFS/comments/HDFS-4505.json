[what is the ip address for queryio10.local?, I think the problem is hdfs://queryio10.local:9000 and hdfs://192.168.0.10:9000 are actually mapped to the same machine. Therefore, the exception is because of two balancers run at the same time on one namenode., I had the same problem with balancer on my dev cluster and this is the solution to fix it., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

I added the following to hdfs-site.xml on my pseudo-distributed single node cluster (my fs.defaultFS is set to hdfs://localhost:9001 the only thing different is port 9001)

I started the balancer with {{hdfs balancer}} and I did not see the exception. Could you please confirm that with the latest trunk you don't see the exception either? Or how best to reproduce this issue?
I checked out a version of trunk on Jan 9 and built it, but wasn't able to reproduce the issue., \\

This message was automatically generated., I believe after HDFS-6300 is in, this problem should not occur. HDFS-6300 prevents multiple balancers running at same time., closing as duplicate of HDFS-6300.
[~stayhf], If issue found not fixed by HDFS-6300, please feel free to re-open,
Thanks.]
