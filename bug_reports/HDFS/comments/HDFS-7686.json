[The feature implemented by HDFS-7548 was removed by HDFS-7430. , [~cmccabe], it looks like your change accidentally dropped it. Can you take a look?, Thanks, guys.  I have a patch for this one but I want to add a few unit tests to it.  Will post tomorrow., Thanks for finding this Rushabh, thanks Colin for the patch. A few light review comments:

* Unused Iterator import in the test, LoadingCache import in VolumeScanner
* I like the cache since it's a nice way of preventing scanning the same blocks over and over again, but it'd be good to also use a LinkedHashMap instead of the LinkedList and also check existence in there before adding. That way we never have dupes in the suspect queue. It seems possible to have a working set bigger than the 1000 element cache size, like if an entire disk goes bad.

Otherwise looks good!, bq. Unused Iterator import in the test, LoadingCache import in VolumeScanner

ok

bq. I like the cache since it's a nice way of preventing scanning the same blocks over and over again, but it'd be good to also use a LinkedHashMap instead of the LinkedList and also check existence in there before adding. That way we never have dupes in the suspect queue. It seems possible to have a working set bigger than the 1000 element cache size, like if an entire disk goes bad.

good idea... I'll use a {{LinkedHashSet}}., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Just a little nit, the suspectBlocks check is copy pasted from the recentSuspectBlocks check, but shouldn't the log message say "already queued for scanning" instead?
