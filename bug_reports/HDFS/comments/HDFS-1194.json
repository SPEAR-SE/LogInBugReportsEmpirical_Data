[This seems to be the underlying issue for HDFS-1024, Removing append tag, since it's unrelated., We switched to using jetty 6.1.24 and can now checkpoint using secondary again.

The log on both nodes shows that we are hitting the JVM bug over and over again (24 jetty has instrumentation to better understand what is happening to the transfer).

So I say we should update the jetty version from the currently used 6.1.14 to 6.1.24, We updated our jetty to 6.1.24, but it also had some issues that were fixed in 6.1.25
What do people think? Should we update all the packages to have newer version of jetty as a dependency? ]
