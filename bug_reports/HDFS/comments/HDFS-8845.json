[Hi, [~lichangleo], after HDFS-6482, finalizedDir has two-level of subdirs ({{finalized/subdir0/subdir23/blk_1234}}). Would this change lose the coverage of checkDir() on these subdirs?, Hi  [~eddyxu], thanks for comments.  It's intentionally done for performance by a little bit trade off. , \\

This message was automatically generated., It'd be a little better for coverage if we tried looking at the file path that had the error, since it's possible there's an error on some subdir. Agree though that traversing the entire tree doesn't have much point though., That's an interesting point, [~andrew.wang].  However, the BlockScanner should be scheduled to rescan the block after the error occurs.  So it should be reported to the NN relatively rapidly even without adding synchronous code that looks at the block file path.

+1 for the latest patch.  Will commit in a day or two if there are no more comments, Committed to 2.8.  Thanks, [~lichangleo]., Yea sounds good to me too, Colin explained to me offline that the BlockScanner processes "suspect" blocks like these first, so anything that would get caught by a path-checker will get quickly caught by the BlockScanner. Thanks all., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8315 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8315/])

, Do any body thinks this should be merged to 2.7 and 2.6?
cc. [~djp], [~kihwal] ?

I am +1 for merging., +1 for merging to 2.7., Cherry-picked to 2.7., Adding 2.6.5 to the target versions with the intention of backporting this to branch-2.6. Please let me know if you think otherwise. Thanks!, Closing the JIRA as part of 2.7.3 release., Cherry-picked it into 2.6.5 (trivial)., Thanks!]
