[Currently in DatanodeHttpServer, we are passing the port as 0 (which means random port ) for endpoint that HTTP server would listen to.
{code}
    HttpServer2.Builder builder = new HttpServer2.Builder()
        .setName("datanode")
        .setConf(confForInfoServer)
        .setACL(new AccessControlList(conf.get(DFS_ADMIN, " ")))
        .hostName(getHostnameForSpnegoPrincipal(confForInfoServer))
        .addEndpoint(URI.create("http://localhost:0"))
        .setFindPort(true);
{code}
We can make it configurable and provide a default port instead of taking up a random.
Please provide your feedback., Hello, [~neha.bathra].  This issue is tracked in HDFS-9049, so I'm resolving this one as a duplicate.]
