[Patch that removes from WebHDFS and HttpFS server side the setting of the token service., Patch seems good to me. [~daryn]?, Removing it from the NN methods is fine, but I'm not familiar with where/how {{HttpFSKerberosAuthenticator}}.  It's in a "client" package which would indicate it should set the service.  Or is this something like a client within a server?, DAH, me growing old, you right, the authenticator is client side, that shoud be there. did a quick grep looking for setTokenService in HTTPFS to make sure I was not missing from doing it there and didn't  see realize it was on the client side. Let me upload a new patch without that change. thx for catching that., new patch removing incorrect changes from httpfs client authenticator., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
