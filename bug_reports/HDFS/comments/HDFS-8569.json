[Full log trace:

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/11295/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode/TestDeadDatanode/testDeadDatanode/, We are seeing issues related to {{NoClassDefFoundError}} often in branch HDFS-7285, because of the parallel Hadoop-common build in the same machine replaces the hadoop-common.jar in mvn repo.

I quite doubt this also to be the same issue.
Anyway, we could wait to see if the same issue repeats in multiple runs]
