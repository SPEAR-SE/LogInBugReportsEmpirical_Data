This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~shihaoliang] for fixing this. The patch looks good to me.  I only have two NITs: 

1. Can you update the title (or description) of the bug about the root cause? "CommandFormat#parse() should not parse option as value of option". I will resolve HDFS-8184 as a dup of this one.

2. Can you format the code below with the appropriate amount of spaces (4).

{code}
 String withStorageTypeHeader =
337	            // <----13---> <-------17------>
338	            "   DISK_QUOTA    REM_DISK_QUOTA " +
339	                    "    SSD_QUOTA     REM_SSD_QUOTA " +
340	                    "ARCHIVE_QUOTA REM_ARCHIVE_QUOTA " +
341	                    "PATHNAME";

{code}, Thanks [~xyao], attached patch., \\

This message was automatically generated., Failure in hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.TestDiskspaceQuotaUpdate is tracked by HDFS-8247. Other failures cannot be reproduced locally.  , +1 for the patch. I will commit it shortly., Verified all Jenkins failures are all unrelated to the patch.

I committed this to trunk and branch-2 and credited both Peter and Xiaoyu. Thanks for fixing this promptly., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7687 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7687/])
