[Missed target version for this ec blocker. [~Sammi] please let me know if you have a patch ready. Thanks!, Since HDFS-12682 should be able to handle this, and it's pretty hard to split that work into 2 jiras due to protobuf changes, I'll resolve this as a dup.

Thanks Sammi for filing the jira and Wei-Chiu for checking!, Hi [~jojochuang], this JIRA is closely related with HDFS-12682. I was plan to work on it after HDFS-12682 is committed.  Thanks [~xiaochen] for taking care it together in HDFS-12682. ]
