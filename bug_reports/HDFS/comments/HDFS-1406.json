[Wrote this little script while looking at this issue, it may be useful for others.

On the default ubuntu config, I get:

todd@ubuntu64-build01:/tmp$ java -cp . Test
socAddr: localhost/127.0.0.1:0
hostname: localhost
Bound to: /127.0.0.1:55081
Hostname: ubuntu64-build01

If I switch the order in /etc/hosts it goes to:

todd@ubuntu64-build01:/tmp$ java -cp . Test
socAddr: localhost/127.0.0.1:0
hostname: localhost
Bound to: /127.0.0.1:46112
Hostname: localhost

and TestCLI can pass, I have seen the same issue running Herriot system tests where the framework couldn't connect to a datanode exactly because of this reason., I'd suggest the regexps are fixed not to expect a particular hostname (be it a localhost or something else)., and a similar fix needs to be done MR, Patch for 0.20 branch as well., +1

Looks good Cos., I have ran test-patch manually:
{noformat}
-1 overall.

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 182 new or modified tests.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs warnings.

    -1 release audit.  The applied patch generated 97 release audit warnings (more than the trunk's current 1 warnings).  

    +1 system test framework.  The patch passed system test framework compile.
{noformat}

Ridiculous number of audit warnings are caused by HDFS-1511.

I am going to commit shortly unless there are objections. 
Also, I will open a similar JIRA for MR.
