+1, 1.0.4 was released without this patch.  Removing it from Target Versions list.
Next opportunity is 1.1.1., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2., Closing this as won't fix.  Hadoop 1.x is dead and this code has been removed from modern versions of Hadoop.]
