[Attaching the patch, The patch mostly looks good. A few minor comments:

{code}
+  static NamenodeProtocols getRPCServer(NameNode namenode) throws IOException {
{code}

It should be a private method.

{code}
+    final NamenodeProtocols np = getRPCServer(namenode);;
{code}

There is an additional semi-colon.

Line 9 also has trailing whitespaces., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
