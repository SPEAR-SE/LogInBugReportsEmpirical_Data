This message is automatically generated., I like the patch... we should definitely be closing those {{TemporarySocketDirectory}} objects.

Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I don't completely understand how you feel the missing closes are leading to test failures... can you clarify?, Hi Colin,
Thanks for taking a look at the patch. 

We saw the failures when running the UTs with IBM JAVA. In each one of the failed tests, the TemporaryScoketDirectory object is initialized, which creates the directory, but the objects are never used/referenced again, so they can poetinally get garbage collected and the finalize method is called for the object, which deletes the directory (see code snippted below). In our case, the TemporaryScoketDirectory is getting garbage collected before the datanode initializes and causing the FileNotFoundException.

{code: borderStyle=solid}
  @Override
  public void close() throws IOException {
    if (dir != null) {
      FileUtils.deleteDirectory(dir);
      dir = null;
    }
  }

  protected void finalize() throws IOException {
    close();
  }
{code}, Not having the closes is not the root cause for the failures. The root cause is the TemporaryScoketDirectory are not being referenced anywhere in the test. Adding the close method is making sure TemporaryScoketDirectory is referenced during the test and it's consistent with some other test cases using TemporaryScoketDirectory ., bq.

[edit: it took me a minute or two to figure this out.  My first comment was wrong.]

OK, I see what's going on.  The object may get GC'ed immediately if it's not referenced later.  And then the finalizer removes the directory.  Ah.  Of course.

+1 for the patch.  I will re-trigger Jenkins since the last run had some issues it seems., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
