[This was already fixed by HADOOP-6114., Thanks for taking the time to report this Oleksandr. This doc discrepancy has already been fixed in future releases (0.23+).

Please see HADOOP-6114 for the original issue report and fix to javadoc., That's true - but it is not fixed in 1.x branches, e.g. branch-1, which is marked as "sustaining branch for updates to Hadoop 1.0.0.". That means future minor version of 1.x.x likely would not have this fix.
