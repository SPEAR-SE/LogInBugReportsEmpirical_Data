This message is automatically generated., Hey Robert, patch looks pretty good to me. One suggestion: could we perhaps catch the more specific UnknownHostException instead of just Exception? You wouldn't want to catch and continue processing in the event of, for example, an NPE, I assume., That's a good point.  I've uploaded a new patch that just catches {{UnknownHostException}}.  , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
