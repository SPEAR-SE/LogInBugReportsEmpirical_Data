[Introduced in HDFS-8826. Interestingly that {{toString()}} was also modified in that jira., If I am not mistaken, the 
{code}
LOG.info("parameters = " + p);
{code}
at
https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/balancer/Balancer.java#L675

would invoke the BalancerParameters#toString 
https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/balancer/BalancerParameters.java#L98

which prints the size of those sets.

The next three lines :
{code}
    LOG.info("included nodes = " + p.getIncludedNodes());
    LOG.info("excluded nodes = " + p.getExcludedNodes());
    LOG.info("source nodes = " + p.getSourceNodes());
{code}
would print the elements in those sets. In that case, it would not be redundant? 
, Hi [~shv] I agree with [~vrushalic], the {{BalancerParameters.toString()}} only prints the size, not actual nodes. Can you please double check if this is a valid issue? Thanks., Yes, I agree there is no redundancy. Not sure now where I saw it. 
[~vrushalic] thank you for verifying. Closing.]
