[If these are trivial bugs that need not be fixed, leave it open. Let someone else pick it up. Please add newbie label. 


, This issue should have been fixed with HDFS-5111., Hello,
I am new to jira and hdfs but would like to pick this bug up.  Am I required to change the assignee?  If so, please point me to how it can be done as I could not find a way  
to change this field.  If not, is there a way to indicate that an issue is being worked on?, [~jxiang] is right. HDFS-5111 has solved this. I am not getting extra 'Permission denied' now.
[~schu] Can we set this as resolved?, All,

I think it can be closed. Do you agree?, Hi [~boky01], I agree that this is a duplicate of HDFS-5111. Thank you for closing this issue, but the resolution should be "Duplicate" instead of "Fixed". "Fixed" is used when the source code is actually changed in this issue. I'll reopen this to change the resolution., Thanks [~ajisakaa] for correction.]
