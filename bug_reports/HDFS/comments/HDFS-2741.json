[As discussed in the following thread:
http://search-hadoop.com/m/I5uSBI9xLY&subj=Re+I+O+errors+reading+task+output+on+20+205+0, This is same as HDFS-1866 but targets branch-1 alone., Markus,

Thanks for filing this! Would you like to checkout branch-1 and provide a patch as well?, Patch adding dfs.datanode.max.transfer.threads to hdfs-default.xml., Markus,

In branch-1 (formerly branch-0.20), the property is named as dfs.datanode.max.xcievers. Could you amend your patch to that effect?

Also perhaps you may want to add a note about this property under src/docs/ too somewhere relevant (public pages)?, Here, but without a note on the setting in the documentation. I've been looking at 0.22 public docs but nothing really comes to mind to write about this setting., Markus,

I think its mostly only HBase that needs this raised anyway. Thanks for the patch, it looks great, committing in a few :), Committed to branch-1. Thanks for your time and contributions Markus! Looking forward to more improvements and reports from you :), Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.1.0.]
