[All operations are implemented via AbstractRunner subclasses.  The decoding of responses is now performed within an exception handler, and the decoding is part of the run loop.  This will allow for retries of operations with malformed responses.  In particular, it will help with a future change for error handling and retries of dead jetty nodes., Pre-commit didn't run before.  Rekick., Nice work, Daryn.  Thank you for adding the failure tests too.  I have just one question.

bq. The json decoding routines do not validate the expected fields are present which may cause NPEs.

It wasn't clear to me if this patch is really doing anything to address this part.  I don't see addition of explicit validation checks, and it also doesn't look like an NPE would be handled any differently.  Can you please clarify?  Thanks!, Rather than change all of the decoding methods (yet), I went the quick route of converting any non-IOException during decoding to IOExceptions.

{code}
+      catch (Exception e) { // catch json parser errors
+        final IOException ioe =
+            new IOException("Response decoding failure: "+e.toString(), e);
{code}

This also handles the case where the json parser itself throws runtime exceptions if the json is incomplete or malformed as stressed in the test cases., Re-kicking precommit again., Got it.  Thanks for the explanation.  +1 for this patch, pending Jenkins., Trying again to kick the precommit., Kicked jenkins. there are 3 or 4 builds ahead of this one. It may be late tonight to see the results.
