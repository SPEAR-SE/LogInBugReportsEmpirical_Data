[Hi [~jghoman] thanks for reporting. I would like to work on this JIRA as it's status is un-assigned. If you have already started working, please feel free to assign to you., Attached patch to consider the user from request and direct the call to actual namenode which intern returns the requested user's home directory rather than hard coded paths. , \\

This message was automatically generated., check style issue reported doesn't seem to be valid because in my eclipse the indention looks fine and matches with other similar code snippets in the file

{{./hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/web/WebHdfsFileSystem.java:287: '.' have incorrect indentation level 9, expected level should be 12.}}, * The checkstyle ding is a bit convoluted, but probably correct since the matching brace is nested pretty heavily.  Let's make checkstyle happy and give it what it wants.
* Please remove the println from the unit test
* Not sure it's worth caching the response here.  Home directories *shouldn't* change, but there's no huge reason why they couldn't between calls.  Since there's no way to clear the cache and this call is pretty light, I'd rather not cache.  Not caching will simplify the code.
* The existing org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/web/TestWebHdfsFileSystemContract.java is incorrectly testing the getHomeDirectory method:
{code}    {//test GETHOMEDIRECTORY
      final URL url = webhdfs.toUrl(GetOpParam.Op.GETHOMEDIRECTORY, root);
      final HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
      final Map<?, ?> m = WebHdfsTestUtil.connectAndGetJson(
          conn, HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
      assertEquals(WebHdfsFileSystem.getHomeDirectoryString(ugi),
          m.get(Path.class.getSimpleName()));
      conn.disconnect();
    }{code} 
since it's calling the static getHomeDirectoryString method rather than the instance getHomeDirectory method.  We should fix this and deprecate the static getHomeDirectoryString method since there's no use (or callers) for it.

Otherwise looks good.  Thanks., Canceling patch post-review., Thank you [~jghoman] for the review. I have uploaded new patch by fixing all the comments mentioned except the one about caching.

I have considered caching to address based on the discussion in HDFS-3620 (Suggested by Alejandro Abdelnur). In my opinion also caching is better to avoid multiple HTTP calls.

This message was automatically generated., I'm still not wild about caching the result since again, (a) the value is never discarded, so it's not a cache and (b) backing systems could choose to change this value on a subsequent call.  However, both FileSystem and DistributedFileSystem are doing some questionable things with this API, so I'll worry about those issues later, if we run into them.

+1 on current patch.  Failed tests are spurious.  Attaching a version for 2.7 (same except location of JsonUtils).  Will commit both after Jenkins has a pass over backport., \\
