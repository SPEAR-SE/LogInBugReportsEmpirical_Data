This message is automatically generated., Failing testcases are related to HDFS-3616 (TestWebHdfsWithMultipleNameNodes) and HDFS-4067 (TestUnderReplicatedBlocks)., Volatile variable brings performance issues in multithreaded environment. If the testing thread is only concern, can we fix the tests instead?, Thanks for the comments Brandon! So the cost of a volatile read/write may be an extra memory access. For a BPServiceActor thread which communicate with NN periodically, I think this may not cause a performance problem (also considering variables like lastHeartbeat are not accessed a lot). While without the volatile keyword it is possible that the triggerHeartbeatForTests cannot trigger the heartbeat as it intends to, since the change of lastheartbeat may not be seen by the actor thread. Also the testing thread may be waiting for an unknown period of time because the change of lastheartbeat by the actor thread may not be seen by the testing thread., OK. Please update the patch with comments explaining why the 3 variables can be volatile., Updated based on Brandon's comments., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
