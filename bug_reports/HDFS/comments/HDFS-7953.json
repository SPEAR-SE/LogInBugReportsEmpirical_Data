[In {{explorer.js}}  file  {code} browse_directory(dir){ ...  var url = '/webhdfs/v1' + dir + '?op=LISTSTATUS' ...} {code}

The directory path in URL is not encoded which is causing the error from server side.

I am submitting the patch to encode path with same function used to fix {{HDFS-6662}}, LGTM. +1. I'll commit it shortly., I've committed the patch to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7.
