[I think we need a {{\-ns}} option, like we have for the haadmin commands., CacheAdmin commands work with -fs option.
Commands where {{AdminHelper}} is used the help page misses the -fs option (since generic options are not printed).
If there is no objection I will resolve it., [~boky01], correct if cache admin commands accept generic options then we can resolve this., FYI. HDFS-11226 is added {{"-fs"}} support. :)]
