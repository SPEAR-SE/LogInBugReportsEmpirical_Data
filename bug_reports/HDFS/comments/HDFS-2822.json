Findbugs warnings: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/1795//artifact/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/patchprocess/newPatchFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs.html
Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/1795//console

This message is automatically generated., +1  lgtm.   test failure looks unrelated., Forgot to mention, the patch does need to be rebased on top of branch. , I re-ran TestFileAppend4 locally and it passed. That test has been flaky in the past. The findbugs warning is not new., bq. Forgot to mention, the patch does need to be rebased on top of branch.

It applies to trunk - we'll deal with the conflicts with the HA branch when we merge trunk->HA.

    Merge trunk into HA branch.

- Some conflicts on BlockManager due to the recent commit of HDFS-2822 - moved logic to processMisReplicatedBlock function
- testNoExtensionIfNoBlocks(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestSafeMode) is now failing due to an existing bug in the HA branch, to be fixed soon
