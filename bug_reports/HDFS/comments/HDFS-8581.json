[*Issues in count is :*

While traversing throught subFolders for calculating the file count , if the value execeeds "dfs.content-summary.limit" , 
then traversing through other child nodes for calculating the file count is been skipped.

{noformat}
Scenario :
=========
dfs.content-summary.limit = 5000
/Folder1   - 10 file
/Folder2   - 6000 files
/Folder3   - 10 file

Now when i do count on "/"  it returns me file count as 6010 files , instead of 6020 files.. 
Files under Folder3 is not counted.

Attached an initial patch.

Please review, bq. While traversing throught subFolders for calculating the file count , if the value execeeds "dfs.content-summary.limit" , then traversing through other child nodes for calculating the file count is been skipped.
Thanks [~andreina] for the analysis and the patch.

Your patch is almost correct. 
I observed that this problem will come only with "/". Not with any low level directories. It will not skip any contents for low-level dirs even with any number of files.

Reason is, "/" always have parent as null. So skipping further count, treating that directory was deleted in between when the lock was released.

Correct fix would be as below.
{code}      // The locks were released and reacquired. Check parent first.
      if (!isRoot() && getParent() == null) {
        // Stop further counting and return whatever we have so far.
        break;
      }{code}


Also In Test, you make it run faster by skipping the start of datanodes as you are not really worried about the content of files.
You can start 0 datanodes and you can create empty files. This will make test run little faster., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for the review comments. 
Updated the patch . please review., \\
