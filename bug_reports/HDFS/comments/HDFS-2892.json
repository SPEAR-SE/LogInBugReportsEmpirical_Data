{quote}Small clarification for following property..if some value configured this then NN will be safe mode upto this much time..
May I know usage of the following property...
<property>
<name>dfs.blockreport.initialDelay</name> <value>0</value>
<description>Delay for first block report in seconds.</description>
</property>
{quote}

This property is to send the block report when starting up the system. If you mention this delay more, then initial block report will take tame(delay you configured)..
Also i would suggest that, this kind of clarification questions can be asked in mailing list.

, Hi Uma,

Thanks for your reply and suggestions...

 ~This property is to send the block report when starting up the system. If you mention this delay more, then initial block report will take tame(delay you configured)..~

Ya..I knew this property for sending block report when DN is started...My query is If initial-delay is configured as say 5 mins upto this time NameNode will be in safemode hence it's wn't get block report from DN's.If continuous restarting DN's then NN will go to safemode all the time...So what my doubt is why this initial delay is required.?.

Please correct me If I am Wrong here..

since descriptions of two properties missed and one property is commented,I raised as suggestion..

., Brahma, initial block delays has been implemented for randomizing the block reports. Please take a look at the issue HDFS-273., Hi Uma,
I gone thru HDFS-273,Thanks for your reply..
Hope remaining quries(Property descriptions and commented property) will be addressed
