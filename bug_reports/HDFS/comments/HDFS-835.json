[Stacktrace

java.io.IOException: FileSystem name 'foo' is provided in an unsupported format. (Try 'hdfs://foo' instead?)
	at org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.checkName(FileSystem.java:171)

	at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestDefaultNameNodePort.testGetAddressFromConf(TestDefaultNameNodePort.java:49)
, I think it had to be addressed by the reversal of HADOOP-5901., The URI format {{foo}} has been deprecated for several versions. If HADOOP-5901 is committed, then this deprecated URI format will finally be removed.

This patch updates the test case to no longer check the deprecated URI format for success.

This should be committed only if HADOOP-5901 is committed., Aaron, moving this to minor (the same priority as the issue it depends on).]
