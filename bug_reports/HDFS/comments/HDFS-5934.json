[Thanks for reporting this issue. The current implementation should manipulate {{window.history}}, or put the hashtag directly into the links. [~tthompso], can you please provide a patch if you have time? Thanks., Yeah I can take a look at this issue, I should have some time this week., Added handler to watch for hash changes so that the back button works correctly., I've tested the patch in Chrome / Firefox / Safari on Mac OS X, it works nicely.

It seems that there is one remaining issue. When I directly type in the URL, it seems that explorer.html does not recognize the directory in the hash tag. For example:

{noformat}
http://localhost:50070/explorer.html#/foo
{noformat}

Always shows the information of the root directory. Maybe we can change the explicit call of {{browse_directory()}} in {{init()}} into a callback of the hashchange event. What do you think?, New patch to handle direct links.  Good catch by the way.  Since the hash isn't changing you still have call {{browse_directory()}} but only if we have a dir to browse to., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
