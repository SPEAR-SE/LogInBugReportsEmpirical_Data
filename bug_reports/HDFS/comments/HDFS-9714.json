[Along similar lines, when trying to {{rename2}} with {{src}} being a file and {{dst}} being a directory, pre-2.7.0 the Namenode would always return an {{IOException}} with the message {{"Source <src> and destination <dst> must both be directories}}.

Following HDFS-7509, the Namenode only throws this exception when {{dst}} is _writable_. If {{dst}} is unwritable, an AccessControlException is thrown instead., I've just tested 2.6.3 and 2.5.2; this issue exists there as well. I was mistaken to think that HDFS-7509 introduced this behavior; it just touched the same code.

Nonetheless, I think this is probably a bug -- it makes no sense to return an {{AccessControlException}} claiming a file is unwritable when in fact it doesn't exist.
, Assigning to Bimal since he is interested in working on. Thanks Bimal.
, Forgot to mention, thank you [~jake-low] very much for reporting the issue!
