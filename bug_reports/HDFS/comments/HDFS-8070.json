[Both Hadoop 2.7 and the Haodop 2 branch (which is what I assume you mean by Hadoop 2.8) have HDFS-7915.  So I think there should not be any compatibility issues on that front.

Can you check whether the patch up at HADOOP-11802 solves your issue?  At very least, it should get you a more informative exception., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

For this patch, do I have to redeploy the HDFS DN to test?
, bq. For this patch, do I have to redeploy the HDFS DN to test?

Yes, this is a datanode-side fix., Marking it for 2.7.1 given the discussion on dev lists., +1 for the patch., Committed to 2.7.1.  Thanks for the reviews., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7659 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7659/])

, Attaching a patch for branch-2.6. If we are going to include HADOOP-11802, we need to include HDFS-7915 and this issue as well., Thanks [~ajisakaa]. Pulled this into 2.6.1 after running compilation and TestShortCircuitCache.]
