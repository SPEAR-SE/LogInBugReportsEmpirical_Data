[As per java.io.File documentation, file.isFile() & file.isDirectory() return false and file.list() return null for non regular files like pipes. 
I this case {{RawLocalFileSystem.listStatus()}} returning null. So, we can check if the file is of type other and return the status

Attached patch for fix, this'll need a test for unix which at least downgrades on windows, \\

bq. --The format looks fine in eclipse. Fixing this will reduce the readability

Readability is subjective. It might make more sense to fix it to avoid the checkstyle warnings.

{code}

To me it seems that it makes more sense to test it through mockito instead of creating a real pipe file. I'll upload a patch later to demonstrate the proposed approach.
, The v3 patch is mostly identical to the v2 patch, except that it changes the test to use mockito so that it no longer depends on the {{mkfifo}} command in the test environment. [~kanaka], does it look good to you?, \\

, This patch introduced a test failure on Windows, which has now been fixed in HADOOP-12438., Does this issue exist in 2.6.x? Should this be backported to branch-2.6?, Hi [~wheat9] and [~cnauroth], does this fix should land on branch-2.6 also? Thanks!, +1 for merging to branch-2.6.  It looks like it will be a clean merge., Cherry-picked this to branch-2.6. I ran the regression test in the patch and it passed. Attaching the diff.
