+{#UpgradeFinalized}
+{:else}
+<div class="alert alert-dismissable alert-warning">

It might be better to do it in the following code segment:

{code}
{#nn}
{@if cond="{DistinctVersionCount} > 1 || '{RollingUpgradeStatus}'.length"}
<div class="alert alert-dismissable alert-info">
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button>

  {#RollingUpgradeStatus}
    <p>Rolling upgrade started at {#helper_date_tostring value="{startTime}"/}. </br>
    {#createdRollbackImages}
      Rollback image has been created. Proceed to upgrade daemons.
      {:else}
      Rollback image has not been created.
    {/createdRollbackImages}
    </p>
  {/RollingUpgradeStatus}

  {@if cond="{DistinctVersionCount} > 1"}
    There are {DistinctVersionCount} versions of datanodes currently live:
    {#DistinctVersions}
    {key} ({value}) {@sep},{/sep}
    {/DistinctVersions}
  {/if}
</div>
{/if}
