[First. Seems like your zookeepers are not stable. ZKFC getting session timeouts and triggering the failovers.
Try increasing the timeout in ZKFC's configurations. {{ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms}}

Second. If you are not sure about the exact problem, then you can ask the query in the mailing list before raising a jira ticket. There will be many people, who might have experienced similar problems. I am sure they are very kind to help you.
See details about mailing list at http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html

Thanks., Many Thanks [~vinayrpet]. It helps a lot.]
