[{{tracer}} seems to be null if the filssystem instance is not created by {{FileSystem#createFileSystem}}. Should we add NullTracer (similar to NullScope) to HTrace and use it's singleton as default tracer rather than adding around null check everywhere?, [~iwasakims] Yeah, we should probably get a NullTracer in... Less null-checks all around. Would be htrace-4.0.2?, Tracer without recievers and samplers seems to work as effectively no-op tracer. Maybe we could the singleton instance to static field of Tracer later., I think adding a NullTracer would make sense.  I also think there is an easier solution via using FsTracer.java... let me check it out, This is a different approach that just removes Tracer from FileSystem, given the difficulty of ensuring it's initialized.  (The other Tracers like DFSClient don't have this problem since the constructor ALWAYS does it... unlike FS where there is a no-argument constructor.)  I also added a unit test which is a regression test for this bug., Globber is only place that uses the FS tracer?

This patch is better than what I was thinking of doing.

This patch seems good to me. We should work on the [~iwasakims] idea in the meantime "for everyone else.." to save having to do null checks., bq. Globber is only place that uses the FS tracer?

Yeah

bq. This patch seems good to me. We should work on the Masatake Iwasaki idea in the meantime "for everyone else.." to save having to do null checks.

Agree.  I filed HTRACE-275 for this., Let me test to see if it fixes the issue I saw above..., \\

This message was automatically generated., I also ran into this issue with the HBase mini cluster.

In the latest patch (v.2), the latter change in Globber.java is causing the NullPointerException in the test failures, and doesn't seem necessary:

{code}
58	    this.tracer = FsTracer.get(fs.getConf());
{code}, Thanks, [~sjlee0].  Should be fixed in v3., \\
