[Also looks like a protocol or call somewhere seems to have a typo in it, i.e. {{getTransationId}}. We could fix it as part of this itself perhaps., The problem is that WritableRpc proxy is getting created in the PB translator. We don't see this problem in unit tests because rpc engines are globally configured.

I have tested the patch on a single node installation.

Also fixed the typo pointed out by Harsh., +1 for the patch., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12510134/HDFS-2739.trunk.patch
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    -1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
                        Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.
                        Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.

    -1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool appears to have generated 21 warning messages.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    +1 eclipse:eclipse.  The patch built with eclipse:eclipse.

    -1 findbugs.  The patch appears to introduce 1 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    -1 release audit.  The applied patch generated 1 release audit warnings (more than the trunk's current 0 warnings).

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests:
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.common.TestDistributedUpgrade

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

Test results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/1771//testReport/
Release audit warnings: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/1771//artifact/trunk/patchprocess/patchReleaseAuditProblems.txt
Findbugs warnings: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/1771//artifact/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/patchprocess/newPatchFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs.html
Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/1771//console

This message is automatically generated., TestDistributedUpgrade failure is unrelated and it actually passes on my machine.
The findbugs, release audit and javadoc warnings also seem to exist in trunk for a while now.

I tested the patch manually because secondary namenode was required to be run as a separate process to reproduce the problem., Committed., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1597 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1597/])
    HDFS-2739. SecondaryNameNode doesn't start up.
