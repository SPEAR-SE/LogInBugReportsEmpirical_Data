[Thanks [~surendrasingh] for reporting the issue. This is by design as document in "Quota Usage Update" section of HDFS-7584 design spec at this [link|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12693543/HDFS-7584%20Quota%20by%20Storage%20Type%20-%2001202015.pdf]. Usage of quota by storage type follow the same pattern as regular space quota. It is based on intended usage rather than actual usage. , I'm resolving this issue as by design. Let me know if you think it differently.]
