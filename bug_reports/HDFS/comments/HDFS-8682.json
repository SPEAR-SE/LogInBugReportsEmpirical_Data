This message was automatically generated., Testcase failures are not related to this issue.

As removing decommissioned node from node list has issue (HDFS-8780) , testcase related to FSNamesystem#getNumDecomLiveDataNodes and FSNamesystem#getNumDecomDeadDataNodes are validated properly.So no need for updating or adding new testcase.

Please review the patch., +1,
Will commit soon., Committed to trunk and branch-2.
