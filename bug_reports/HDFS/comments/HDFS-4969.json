[making this a blocker as the change introduced by HDFS-4772 in the WebHDFS filesystem client requires a non-standard WEBHDFS JSON field., Specifically, in {{JSONUtil.toFileStatus()}}

{code}
    final int childrenNum = (int) (long) (Long) m.get("childrenNum");
{code}, [~brandonli], mind looking at this? thx, The patch simply makes {{JsonUtil#toFileStatus()}} check if the "childrenNum" is null before trying to cast it., the following it would be a bit more clear:

{code}
    Long childrenNumObj = (Long) m.get("childrenNum");
    final int childrenNum = (childrenNumObj == null) ? 0 : childrenNumObj.intValue();
{code}
, That is clearer; uploaded new patch, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Robert, have you tested the HTTPFS testcases that were failing to see that they pass now? test-patch didn't test httpfs as there were not changes in that module.

thx, Yes, I made sure that the failing testcases pass now.  , +1, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4061 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4061/])

, Thanks Robert. Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.1., [~tucu00] Sorry for the late reply. I am just back from vacation. HDFS-5043 addressed the concern in HDFS-4772 and it also updated the default value to -1 for the Jeson element. ]
