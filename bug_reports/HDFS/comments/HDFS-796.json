[attaching jstack, just realized I was actually running an earlier checkout that didn't have HDFS-723 included. These stacks aren't exactly the same, so I'll leave it open, but feel free to resolve as dup if it's the same root cause., Hi Todd Lipcon ,

I am using hadoop 20.1 version,I tried with 5 threads,I didn't get this issue..can u tell me exact scenario to reproduce this issue.., Never saw this come back, I think its dup of HDFS-723]
