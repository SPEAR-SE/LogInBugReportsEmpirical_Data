This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch. I will commit it shortly., I am hitting an issue with subversion right now, will commit this later.

I also downgraded the priority since this issue has been around for a while. It need not be a blocker., I committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks for the contribution [~timxzl]., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5754 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5754/])
