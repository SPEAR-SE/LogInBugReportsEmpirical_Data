[The javadoc says "@return true if the file is already closed".

What is the expected behavior in your mind?, Thanks [~szetszwo] for having a look at this issue. 

My expectation on invoking recoverlease is to return true when:
	*1. File is already closed*
	*2. Lease Recovery is successful and file is closed.*

Say consider following scenario
Step 1:  Client1 created a file with 0 byte or file with blocks in finalized. Client1 is aborted
Step 2:  Explicit Lease recovery is triggered.

As per current implementation , lease recovery will be successful on first try , but still it returns false.
{code}
Rex@XXXXXXXXX:~/hadoop/bin>./hdfs dfs -appendToFile hadoop /Test_file1
appendToFile: Failed to APPEND_FILE /Test_file1 for DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_-899478418_1 on XXXXXXXXX because this file lease is currently owned by DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1903738807_1 on YYYYYYYYYYYYY

Rex@XXXXXXXXX:~/hadoop/bin> ./hdfs debug recoverLease -path /Test_file1
recoverLease returned false.
Giving up on recoverLease for /Test_file1 after 1 try.

Rex@XXXXXXXXX:~/hadoop/bin> echo $?
1
Rex@XXXXXXXXX:~/hadoop/bin> ./hdfs dfs -appendToFile hadoop /Test_file1
Rex@XXXXXXXXX:~/hadoop/bin> echo $?
0
{code}

*Expected* is to return successful on first try. Attached an initial patch for the same. 
Please review and give your feedback., I see your point now after checking the patch in more details. The summary "Lease recovery returns false , eventhough recovery happens" is missing leading since there is no lease recovery in this case, it only releases the lease.

Some minor comments on the patch:
- The javadoc is inaccurate as mentioned previously.  Let's change it to "if the file is already closed, or if the lease can be released and the file can be closed."
{code}
+   * @return true if the file is already closed or if lease recovery
+   *         is successful and file is closed.
{code}
- Rename recoverLeaseInternal to isClosed and declare it as final in recoverLease.
- Let's change the following
{code}
          boolean isClosed = internalReleaseLease(lease, src, iip, null);
          if(!isClosed)
            throw new RecoveryInProgressException(
                op.getExceptionMessage(src, holder, clientMachine,
                    "lease recovery is in progress. Try again later."));
          return isClosed;
{code}
to
{code}
          if (internalReleaseLease(lease, src, iip, null)) {
            return true;
          } else {
            throw new RecoveryInProgressException(
                op.getExceptionMessage(src, holder, clientMachine,
                    "lease recovery is in progress. Try again later."));
          }
{code}
-  asFile() won't return null so that we can change the if-statement in recoverLeaseInternal to:
{code}
    INodeFile file = iip.getLastINode().asFile();
    if (!file.isUnderConstruction()) {
      return true;
    } else {
      ...
    }
{code}
Notice that we don't need "return false" at the end., Thanks [~szetszwo] , I have updated the patch fixing your review comments.
