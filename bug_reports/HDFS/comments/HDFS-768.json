[Attaching patch which fixes this issue. build-contrib.xml change is identical to HADOOP-6370. hdfsproxy and raid contrib projects were found to be specifying alternate versions for commons-logging and junit than the rest of the project. I changed these to reflect the rest of the project. Their JUnit tests still pass with JUnit 4.5 instead of 3.8.2 as they had previously specified., -1 overall.

, Moving to open, pending discussion on HADOOP-6370., Here's a patch that uses the new approach to package contribs in HDFS.

The raid project has a lot of unshipped dependencies which will be fixed by this. Some of the raid dependencies were on incompatible versions of libraries; I've updated these as follows:

* aspectj: upgraded 1.5.3 to 1.6.4
* commons-httpclient: DOWNGRADED 3.1 to 3.0.1

There were three dependencies that I couldn't fix -- servlet-api-2.5.jar, slf4j-log4j12-1.4.3.jar, and jsp-api-2.0.jar.

I don't know why, but ivy complains that it can't find the specified versions of these if I use the properties from the main project. Maybe someone who's better with ivy than I could take a look, or a raid-project maintainer should update the rest of the dependencies. In either case, I don't think this is a blocker for inclusion of this patch. Just something to be fixed down the line., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
