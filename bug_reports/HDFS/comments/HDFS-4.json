[Are there any other disadvantages you can think of in going with used+available? Any edge cases where that sum may be incorrect to use?, This breaks with pooled storage. e.g.:

{code}
NAME                           USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
rpool                         1.42T   548G   316K  /rpool
rpool/zones                   47.5G   548G   184K  /rpool/zones
rpool/zones/ryoko             2.20G   548G   160K  /rpool/zones/ryoko
{code}

Closing as won't fix.]
