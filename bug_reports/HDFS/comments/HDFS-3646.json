[Kihwal, Thanks for filing the JIRA.
I have seen this. One possible option to fix this issue is:
Actually lease renewer required for the opened files. So, while opening the file it can add the renewer if there is no client present in Renewer's list of clients.
So, file close can remove the dfsCLinet instance completely if there is no filesBeingWritten with that client. Means that, if there is no open files with a particular DFSClient, then that clinet will not be there with renewer. If the same DFSClient wants to open new file, it will take care of adding client to renewer.
How does this sounds to you?
, Thanks Uma. That makes sense., There will be caveats, such as the leak will still occur if client code doesn't explicitly close all streams.  I'm not sure how you can tell if there are no more references since {{DFSClient}} holds references to all open streams.  Maybe weak references to the streams could be used?, {quote}

If client code doesn't close the file, dfsClient object should be there and lease renewal should happen as file is in open state. At that time keeping the reference in LeaseRenewer will not be a leak. Please correct me, if I understood your point wrongly., I agree with everything you said if a client code is still holding a reference to the stream.  Unfortunately accidents do happen and streams don't always get closed.  Since {{DFSClient}} has a hard reference to the stream, the lost stream will remain open as long as the client is open.  In turn, the lost stream will prevent the lease renewer from removing the client when all other streams are closed., {quote}

IMO, this will a leak from application side, since there is a bug in closing the streams from app., bq. .... the lost stream will remain open as long as the client is open.

I think Daryn is bringing up the issue because its solution also take care of this jira. If we have a finializer for FileSystem, we could have it call close(), then everything will go away. 

But short of automatic cleaning, this issue still remains. Currently DFSClient won't get garbage collected even if lost streams are automatically closed.  I think we should still fix it, even if we eventually implement automatic clean-up., bq. IMO, this will a leak from application side, since there is a bug in closing the streams from app.

Agreed, but it can have pretty severe consequences that aren't easily detected unless explicitly hunting for leaks.  It makes me uneasy that an out of scope fs stream can cause a massive leak of heavy objects, threads, and tie up sockets that may exhaust fds and/or memory for long running processes.  Emitting an angry log error for lost & unclosed streams may be more beneficial. 

I don't think a finalizer on the fs will work.  If I do {{in = path.getFileSystem(conf).open(...)}}, the fs might get garbage collected but we certainly don't want its finalizer to shoot the dfs client that is still holding open a stream.  Maybe a finalizer on the dfs client, but in any case, the circular hard references need to be broken somehow., The goal of this patch is to remove unnecessary references from both DFSClient and LeaseRenewer whenever possible., Hey Kihwal. I'm looking at this patch. Does this intend to fix the entire problem as described? Or is it just a step along the way? Haven't thought deeply enough about it to be sure, yet., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., This patch will allow LeaseRenewer and DFSClient to be GC'ed when all streams are closed by users. Oozie once reported an OOM due to this problem. I looked at the heap dump and there were a large number of trios: DFSClient, JobConf and the array entry in LeaseRenewer. There were no leaked streams/sockets, or FileSystem cache bloat. Had they given up references to others, they would have been GC'ed. (there was no other external reference to them)

What Daryn mentioned will solve a diffetent problem, which can happen when streams are lost without being closed. Daryn has some ideas, so he will probably file a separate jira once its feasibility checks out. , In {{DFSClient#beginFileLease}}, should {{leaserenewer.put(src, out, this)}} be in the synchronized block?

Instead of trying to break the hard ref from client to renewer when streams aren't open, would it maybe make sense to remove the hard reference entirely?  Maybe the client could use a {{LeaseRenewer.getInstance(String, UserGroupInformation)}} (note the client isn't passed) when it needs to invoke methods on the renewer?  I haven't fully thought it through...
, LeaseRenewer#getInstance() doesn't seem heavy. The only danger will be getting a different (newer) instance when trying to free something, but that shouldn't happen since it means all streams were closed before. when it happens the client was removed from renewer's client list, so there will be no reference leak.  So I think we can safely remove the class level reference holder for LeaseRenewer as you said and use getInstance() method.

I will make changes accordingly and also address the other breakages reported in the test-patch., Followed Dary's suggestion and simplifed the {{DFSClient}} side. All affected tests have been updated. The termianl condition of the renewal loop in {{LeaseRenewer}} has been changed to make it honor the grace period after {{dfsclients}} becomes empty.
, bq. Dary's suggestion ...

This message is automatically generated., Looks very nice!
# In the new comments, "renwer" and "runing" are misspelled
# Another comment of "Does this renewer has nothing to renew?" should use "have" instead of "has"
# Just a suggestion: Maybe DFS should instantiate the client with its canonical uri instead of its given uri to avoid the authority of "null"
# I don't understand this new chunk of code since it looks like {{emptyTime}} is internally handled correctly and checked by {{isRenewerExpired}}.  Is there an edge case this is fixing? 
{code}if (!clientsRunning() && emptyTime == Long.MAX_VALUE) {
  emptyTime = Time.now();
}{code}, Since we are now removing the reference to a client when all streams are closed, the renwer's loop exits right away ({{clientsRunning()}} is false when there is no more clients left). In order to honor the grace period, I had to move the check and set {{emptyTime}} so that the thread is kept alive until isRenewerExpired() returns true.

The failed test cases don't seem to be related to the patch and I could not reproduce the failures.

- TestFileAppend4 ran sucessfully, but it timed out because Datanode didn't shutdown.
{noformat}
012-07-17 01:58:56,034 INFO  datanode.DataNode (DataNode.java:shutdown(1079)) 
- Waiting for threadgroup to exit, active threads is 1
{noformat}
- TestBlocksWithNotEnoughRacks: MiniDFSCluster exited in the middle of test.

Regarding null authority, there is a check for nameNodeUri being null, it will throw an IllegalArgumentException. If the uri is not null, but the authority is null, it also won't go far because proxy won't get created properly. Since {{DFSClient}} blows up anyway well before a {LeaseRenewer} is created, the content of variable, {authority}, being "null" or null does not matter.

I will upload the updated patch soon., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
