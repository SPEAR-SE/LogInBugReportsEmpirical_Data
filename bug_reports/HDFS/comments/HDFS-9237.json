[Uploaded the patch.. kindly review.., In unit test methods we assume the {{cluster}} is not null as {{setup}} method is called before each test. This works just fine since the unit test methods won't run if {{setup}} throws an exception when constructing {{cluster}} and other resources.

However, the @After annotated methods are guaranteed to run even if a @Before or @Test method throws an exception. Thus we'd better check the {{cluster}} before using it in {{tearDown}}.

Another approach is to make the {{teadDown}} method throw an exception. This patch looks good to me., \\
