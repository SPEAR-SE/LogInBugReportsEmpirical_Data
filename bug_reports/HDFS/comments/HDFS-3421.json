[Couple of questions:

* Did you do {{dfsadmin -refreshNodes}} after updating your files?
* What version did you test this against? Do you see the same issue with 2.x/trunk?, Hi harsh,

thanks for looking this issue.

Yes I do dfsadmin â€“refreshNodes and for testing i am using 0.24 version., Looks it is caching the mapping because you might use CachedDNSToSwitchMapping#resolve internally for resolving .

Here is the relevent code, where it caches the mappings

{code}
@Override
  public List<String> resolve(List<String> names) {
    // normalize all input names to be in the form of IP addresses
    names = NetUtils.normalizeHostNames(names);

    List <String> result = new ArrayList<String>(names.size());
    if (names.isEmpty()) {
      return result;
    }

    List<String> uncachedHosts = getUncachedHosts(names);

    // Resolve the uncached hosts
    List<String> resolvedHosts = rawMapping.resolve(uncachedHosts);
    //cache them
    cacheResolvedHosts(uncachedHosts, resolvedHosts);
    //now look up the entire list in the cache
    return getCachedHosts(names);

  }
{code}

I am not sure, wehtehr we have an option to disable this caching by using other mappings.
Any one know about that?]
