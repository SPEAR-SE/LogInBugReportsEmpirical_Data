[It's probably the timing-based nature of the test.  I'll dig into the errors and see what I can do., The failure was not what I was expecting. There is a test to validate that things shut down promptly when requested, and that's what was failing.  And it was failing big time.  The test allows for a couple of seconds.  The failured shutdowns were taking hours.

But, it only failed twice.  Since those two failures, the test has passed in the last 5 Jenkins runs.  Since it appears to be working now, I'm going to close this issue.  If it reappears later, we can reopen it., The test failed twice is an odd way and hasn't failed since in the last 5 runs.  I'm going to blame environment or other changes., The latest build hit the same issue again, so it wasn't just a temporary environmental effect., Doh.  If you look carefully at these log lines, you'll see the issue:

{noformat}
2015-10-05 15:22:33,725 [pool-53-thread-1] WARN  datanode.DirectoryScanner (DirectoryScanner.java:shutdown(527)) - DirectoryScanner: shutdown has been called, but periodic scanner not started
2015-10-05 15:22:33,726 [Thread-911] INFO  datanode.TestDirectoryScanner (TestDirectoryScanner.java:testThrottling(675)) - Scanner took 3609189682ms to shutdown
{noformat}

Notice that the shutdown() method is called in the same second as the assert fails, and yet the assert says that the shutdown took a very long time.  The issue is that the assert is occasionally happening before the interrupter thread updates the timestamp.

The attached patch should resolve the issue., This JIRA fixes a new test introduced by HDFS-8873., \\

This message was automatically generated., Made patch a little more robust., [~templedf] thanks a lot for the patch.

One question:

{code}
// If the scan didn't complete before the shutdown was run, check
// that the shutdown was timely
if (finalMs > 0) {
    LOG.info("Scanner took " + (Time.monotonicNow() - finalMs)
             + "ms to shutdown");
    assertTrue("Scanner took too long to shutdown",
               Time.monotonicNow() - finalMs < 1000L);
}
{code}

Because {{masterThread}} and {{reportCompileThreadPool}} will be terminated within 1 minutes, 
should we wait and retry several times here so that the above code has higher chance to be executed? , Once the block scanner has run, there's no point in waiting any more.  The threads that shutdown() would stop are already stopped.

I have the throttle set to 1ms, which means that only one directory will be scanned per second.  The idea is to slow the process down as much as possible.  I'm guessing that there are sometimes fewer directories than 2x the number of threads, resulting in the scan completing early.  There's no way to slow it down any more than that.

I suppose one additional way to increase the likelihood of having the shutdown() thread run would be to reduce the scheduling delay to 1s or 500ms.  Still no guarantee, but it would increase the odds., I poked at it a bit, and it's not possible to reduce the schedule delay.  If it goes less than 2s, a different test fails because there wasn't enough time to let the waiting/running ratio stabilize., I made one small change to (slightly) reduce the likelihood that the shutdown timing test will be bypassed., \\
