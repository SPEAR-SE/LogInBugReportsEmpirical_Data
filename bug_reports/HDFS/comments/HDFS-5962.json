[Attaching a patch to save/load the modification time of symlinks.
The patch changes the protocol buffer fsimage format, so I suppose there's something to do (ex. change layout version)., Does this apply to atime also? On my local machine, the atime is updated when you access a symlink., Thanks, Andrew.

This message is automatically generated., It should be easy to add a test case for this. Start a mini cluster, create a symlink, do saveNamespace and restart the namenode. Compare the time stamp before and after.  Directory (mtime) and file inode (mtime and atime) can be covered in the same test., The old fsimage does not persist mtime and atime. The PB-based fsimage follows the old behavior. I wonder whether this is a bug in the old code, or it's done intentionally., Thanks [~kihwal], added a test-case for loading atime and mtime., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
