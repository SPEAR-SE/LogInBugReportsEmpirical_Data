[Not turning on "Submit Patch" since patch is for 20.205., +1 patch looks good., Does this affect trunk?, No, doesn't affect trunk.  I didn't port the QueueProcessingStatistics stuff the bug relates to, to v22, because after some experience with it I concluded it was better to just use simple logs., Committed to 0.20-security and 0.20-security-205., Hadoop 0.20.204.0 was released.]
