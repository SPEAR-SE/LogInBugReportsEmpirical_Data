[{{fsaction=r-w}} doesn't match POSIX style, but it matches regex {{"\[rwx-\]\{3\}"}}.
Currently, The behaviour on the server side:
The request passes argument checks in {{FsActionParam.parse(.)}}, so the server doesn't return {{IllegalArgumentException}}.
In {{FsAction.getFsAction(..)}}, {{r-w}} doesn't match any enum types, so the function returns {{null}}.
{{FSPermissionChecker.checkPermission(..)}} will *NOT* throw {{AccessControlException}} if {{access==null}}
Currently, The behaviour on the client side:
{code}
curl -X GET "http://localhost:50070/webhdfs/v1/myfile?op=CHECKACCESS&user.name=nobody&fsaction=r-w"
{code}
is the same as 
{code}
curl -X GET "http://localhost:50070/webhdfs/v1/myfile?op=CHECKACCESS&user.name=nobody&fsaction=null"
{code}
is the same as 
{code}
curl -X GET "http://localhost:50070/webhdfs/v1/myfile?op=CHECKACCESS&user.name=nobody"
{code}

This behaviour is not right, we should fix it. It should be like the filesystem in linux
{code}
 # chmod rxw /tmp/tmpfile
chmod: invalid mode: `rxw'
Try `chmod --help' for more information.
{code}

*In conclustion*
We should change the regex pattern in {{FsActionParam}} to  {{"\[r-\]\[w-\]\[x-\]"}} as [~jake-low] proposed, and the server should throws {{IllegalArgumentException}} if the argument doesn't match POSIX style., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
