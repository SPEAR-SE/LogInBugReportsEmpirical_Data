[During a decomm of a faulty nodem the NNs frequently reported invalid protobufs from the node during decode of {{reportBlock}}, interleaved with {{ArrayIndexOutBounds}} during actual processing of the report.  The jvm clipped the stacktrace of the exception so it is unknown where it occurs.

The {{DecommissionManager}} stopped after the first AIOB which is probably the root cause of HDFS-12703.  The block states appear to be corrupted into an unknown state.  Since the decomm task aborts and the exception is lost, it's impossible to know where the bug is occurring., move to 2.8.5 given issue has been quiet for a while.]
