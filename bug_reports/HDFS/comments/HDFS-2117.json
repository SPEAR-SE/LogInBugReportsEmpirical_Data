[Minimal patch attached., +1 looks good, shame that it's not an exception..., I am with Daryn here. API that return true/false and throw IOException are ugly. Should we change it to throw exception, instead of return false?, Continuing my previous comment, should not return boolean at all from the method?, I agree using exceptions would be better, for some reason exceptions were used in the trunk version of HADOOP-6566 but not in the YDH patch which introduced this code. How about we fix the current function (which should be returning false in this case) and file another jira to bring the code in line with trunk?, Given that this is a minor change - why not just do in this?, Are you referring to throwing an exception here instead of returning false? Given the rest of the method returns true/false I think we should be consistent. I do think it's also reasonable to replace the entire function and it's caller(s) with the code from trunk, however that seems like it can be done separately. Presumably Arun generated different patches for 20/trunk for a reason, though I haven't looked closely.  , I think this is not a big deal... +1 for the change., Thanks Suresh. I've committed this., Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0]
