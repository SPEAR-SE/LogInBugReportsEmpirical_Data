[I'm seeing this on trunk as well, I did a bit of investigation on this problem, and it appears to be a bug in the Maven Eclipse plugin since version 2.7.  This problem may be fixed in version 2.9 (see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MECLIPSE-621).  Unfortunately 2.9 still hasn't been released.

There have been plenty of discussions about how to workaround this issue.  One tactic is to request version 2.6 of the Eclipse plugin rather than the latest (2.8).  That's what this patch does, and it appears to work.  It does have the drawback that we'll have to remember to remove this workaround at some point (e.g.: when 2.9 or later becomes generally available).

Another possible approach would be to place the filtered and unfiltered resources into separate directories (e.g.: src/main/resources/filtered/ and src/main/resources/unfiltered/) but have the build remove the extra directory level before depositing the resources into the target/ directory., I did not add a test since this patch just affects the build.  Also test-patch is reporting a large number of javadoc warnings that are unrelated to this patch., Jason, the eclipse plugin version should be added into the pluginManagement section in the hadoop-project/pom.xml so the same plugin is used for the whole project. (why is this JIRA is assigned to me? you filed/did it), (ignore the Q about the JIRA assignment, just found why, Eli), +1 fixes the issue for me, I localized the change to the hdfs-httpfs project since I didn't want to force the entire project to the 2.6 plugin version for a workaround in one subproject.  I tried using 2.6 for the entire project, and while it does allow the eclipse:eclipse target to build successfully, the Eclipse hadoop-hdfs project has build failures because it cannot locate FileUtils and cannot resolve an org.aspectj import.  So using the 2.6 version for the entire project doesn't look like a viable option.

If we'd rather not combine plugin versions piecemeal like this, I can pursue the filtered/unfiltered directory idea instead if that would be more desirable., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12507017/hdfs-2649.patch
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    -1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
                        Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.
                        Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.

    -1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool appears to have generated 90 warning messages.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    -1 findbugs.  The patch appears to introduce 12 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    +1 release audit.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests:
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.TestListCorruptFileBlocks
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestDfsOverAvroRpc
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.TestLargeDirectoryDelete

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/1689//console

This message is automatically generated., I don't use eclipse, thus I'm not familiar on how multi-module maven projects are handled (I would think eclipse configs for all modules better be generated by the same plugin version). But if the current fix handles things correctly for eclipse users, then I guess it is OK. BTW, it is a good practice, to have reproducible builds, to nail down the version of the plugins you use, you don't want to unknowingly start using a newer plugin version just because it was released. As this is a plugin for an IDE won't affect the build, but still it is a good practice to do so., Thanks for the review, Alejandro!

The javadoc, findbugs, and core test failures are unrelated to this patch., +1 This fixes 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' for me, and the projects load correctly into Eclipse., +1  works for me as well.  I've committed this and merged to 23.
