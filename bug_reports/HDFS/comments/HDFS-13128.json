[What do you see in the balancer log?  Look for something like this.
{noformat}
[main] INFO balancer.Balancer: namenodes  = [hdfs://mynn.com:8020]
{noformat}

Do you see two entries that essentially point to the same namenode?, As message says clearly that another balancer is running,I can see both are triggered from same machine(from provided logs),you can check "jps or ps"(apart from [~kihwal] mentioned above).
