[related jira [HDFS-4619|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4619], RawLocalFS could look for the dir existing and throw the exception if it exists -and we were happy that this is the expected behaviour. I'm not sure it is. 

The FS will throw {{FileAlreadyExistsException}} if a parent directory entry exists and is not a directory. This is the same behaviour as -on a first glance- HDFS does. 

It is not an error to create a filesystem that is already there. 
# we should add a test, if there is not one already, that creating a dir under a file throws an exception.
# {{FileSystemContractBaseTest#testMkdirsFailsForSubdirectoryOfExistingFile()}} verifies that trying to create a subdir of a file fails, while {{testMkdirs()}} verifies that {{mkdirs()}} is idempotent, that it does not fail if called repeatedly.

Which makes me think that {{RawLocalFileSystem}} is behaving according to its specification -that just doesn't match the expectations of where it is called, Marking as a duplicate of HADOOP-9438, as that is where the issue is being resolved]
