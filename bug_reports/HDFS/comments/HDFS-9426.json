[bq. NN might have to check the DN version and return different rollingUpgradeInfo.
In order to maintain the protocol semantics, it might be better to set the RU state to null and return another one in a new optional field for newer datanode to use., bq. After HDFS-7645, the namenode can return non-null rollingUpgradeInfo in heatbeat reponses. 2.7.1 or 2.6.x datanodes won't finalize the upgrade because it's not null.
I agree that 2.7.1 or 2.6.x datanodes wont understand finalize message.

But is that expected scenario, where cluster upgrade can be finalized without complete upgrade of all datanodes?, bq. But is that expected scenario, where cluster upgrade can be finalized without complete upgrade of all datanodes?
Yes. For larger clusters a rolling upgrade might take a while. If they don't have enough free space or there is huge churn of blocks, the remaining space will shrink quickly.  In that case users have to finalize the upgrade after enough number of nodes roll and no anomaly is observed.
, bq. Yes. For larger clusters a rolling upgrade might take a while. If they don't have enough free space or there is huge churn of blocks, the remaining space will shrink quickly. In that case users have to finalize the upgrade after enough number of nodes roll and no anomaly is observed.
In that case, what should/will be behavior of  datanodes, when remaining datanodes attempted for upgrade., The remaining datanodes should stop populating trash. Conceptually we could make it clear trash on upgrade or right away.  But the older version of datanodes can only do the latter., Attaching a proof-of-concept patch for design discussion., I've also noticed that when 2.7.2rc0 namenode does RU finalization first and a pre 2.7.2 datanode later upgrades, it deletes the ru marker file but does not clear the trash. As far as I can see it stops populating the trash. I haven't root-caused it yet., bq. The remaining datanodes should stop populating trash. Conceptually we could make it clear trash on upgrade or right away. But the older version of datanodes can only do the latter.
Yes, thats correct. But it should be made clear that, If some problem in upgrading those remained nodes, then data will not be recovered, since upgrade will be immediately finalized in first heartbeat itself.

IMO, proof of concept patch looks good., I don't want to stop progress on this, but I see that HDFS-7645 was later marked as incompatible change, so don't see why it should go into 2.7.2 at all.

I'm starting a discussion on HDFS-7645 to see if it should be reverted from branch-2, please watch it there. Thanks., Realized there was a follow-up HDFS-8656 to the incompatible change HDFS-7645, so now not entirely clear which way we should go. IAC, left a comment: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7645?focusedCommentId=15004464&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15004464., [~kihwal] / [~vinayrpet], any update on this?, I tested it with 2.7.2 namenode and 2.6 datanodes. The 2.6 datanodes deleted the marker files and trash directories. So we know the proposed patch is correct.
I am just wondering whether it will be worth doing more code changes to avoid introducing the redundant field in the new protocol. [~vinayrpet], what do you think?, bq. I am just wondering whether it will be worth doing more code changes to avoid introducing the redundant field in the new protocol. Vinayakumar B, what do you think?
I am thinking current patch is sufficient for the fix. At-least to resolve this blocker for 2.7.2.

Is there any other way, except this fix and  reverting HDFS-7645?

, The failed test cases pass when run on my machine.  One test case {{TestEditLogTailer#testNN1TriggersLogRolls}} failed once during multiple runs, but the failure was not related to this patch., [~vinayrpet], can you look at [~kihwal]'s patch and get it reviewed / committed? I am holding off 2.7.2 for this one, please let me know if this needs more time. Thanks., +1 for the patch,
