[Attaching patch.

This adds two DeprecationDeltas for dfs.nfs.keytab.file and dfs.nfs.kerberos.principal.

No unit tests added. I manually verified by starting a secure NFS gateway successfully using the older nfs kerberos configs., Good stuff, Stephen. Thanks a lot for catching this and providing a patch.

While you're looking at this code, would you mind also ensuring that we didn't goof and miss any other deprecations in HDFS-6056?, That's a good idea. Let me check for any other deprecations., Hi ATM, I went through HDFS-6056, which was fixed in 2.5.0.

The following configurations seem to not have DeprecationDeltas:

dfs.nfs.exports.cache.size -> nfs.exports.cache.size
dfs.nfs.exports.cache.size was added in HDFS-5136 (2.3.0)

They following were added in 2.4.0 in HDFS-6080:
dfs.nfs.rtmax -> nfs.rtmax
dfs.nfs.wtmax -> nfs.wtmax
dfs.nfs.dtmax -> nfs.dtmax

Shall I add them to this patch?, Yes please, that sounds great. When you do, make sure to hit "submit patch" so that test-patch will run on the patch.

Thanks a lot, Stephen., Thank you, Stephen, for finding issue and providing the patch!, Thanks, ATM and Brandon.

I updated the patch to include the other properties.

I built successfully, and successfully brought up a secure NFS gateway using the old nfs property names., Latest patch looks good to me. +1 pending Jenkins., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., No unit tests were added as this patch just adds new deprecated property translations. To manually verify the patch, I successfully started a NFS gateway using the deprecated NFS kerberos configs (without the changes, the gateway will fail to start)., +1, Thanks, [~brandonli]! Would you have time to commit? (not a committer), Sure., I've committed the patch.
