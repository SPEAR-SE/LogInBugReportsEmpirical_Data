[Thanks [~SouryakantaDwivedy] for putting up the issue.

We cannot simply remove the policy without checking whether there are any files using that policy or not and if we do so and if there are files using that EC policy we wont be able to read those files tooÂ 

HDFS-12405 is already raised to counter the problem of safely removing an EC policy.It will solve your purpose too.]
