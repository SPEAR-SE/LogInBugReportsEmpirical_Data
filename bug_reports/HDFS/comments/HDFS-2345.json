This message is automatically generated., This patch is for 23 branch..That is the reason for test-patch command failure., Uma, does this change not also need to be made on trunk? If so, it seems like we should make the change there and then back-port it.

Also, I'm a little surprised that this patch wouldn't apply cleanly to trunk., Hi Aaron,

 Thanks a lot for taking a look!
 This patch specific to 0.23 branch.
 See my first comment. When i investigate this issue , i found that this is already addressed in trunk. (HDFS-2258)

Thanks,
Uma, Whoops! Not sure how I missed your first comment, Uma. Thanks for pointing it out.

I'll take a harder look at this patch tomorrow, and why it presently won't apply to the 0.23 branch. I suspect it's the {{*Constants}} refactor., Thanks Aaron,

Yes, 23 branch has the constants file name as HdfsConstants.
, Hi Aaron, Can you please take a look?

Thanks
Uma, Aaron, if you some time, can you please take a look?, +1, the patch looks good to me. I'll commit this momentarily., I've just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #24 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/24/])
