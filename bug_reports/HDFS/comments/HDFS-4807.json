[Per Kihwal's suggestion, the patches use client.getConf().socketTimeout for the timeout (the same way as DFSInputStream does it) instead of client.getDatanodeReadTimeout(length). This changes only the createSocketForPipeline() method.
, The timeout used in {{setSoTimeout(timeout)}} after making connection needs to stay the same., Will submit new patches in which the setSoTimeout is correctly set., The new (v2) patches use the correct timeout after making the connection., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
