[Linking to HADOOP-9590, which tracks our use cases for calling the new file APIs introduced in JDK7.  With JDK7, we could potentially use {{Files#delete}}, which throws an exception with details if the delete fails.  This would reduce our native code footprint.

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#delete(java.nio.file.Path), Thanks for the linking and sharing, [~cnauroth]. Certainly a more systematic approach with JDK7 in HADOOP-9590. Haven't got to work on this one yet, good to know the other thread.
