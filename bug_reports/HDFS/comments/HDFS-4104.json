This message is automatically generated., +1 I wanted to make this change while redesigned the shell but was attempting to preserve backwards compat at the time.  If noone else objects, I'll commit tomorrow., I actually just noticed there are no tests included.  The precommit build was fooled since the file changed was {{fs/shell/Test.java}}.  Please add some tests and I'll commit., bq. I actually just noticed there are no tests included.

As I mentioned, I don't see any way in JUnit to verify that stderr is clean.  {{TestDFSShell}} passes with this patch applied, and manual testing verifies that the message no longer appears., You can add tests to the existing {{TestDFSShell#testErrOutPut}}.  It's already checking stderr for a number of commands., Thanks for the pointer to testErrOutPut, Daryn. It successfully unit tests this change (test fails without the fix, passes with the fix)., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
