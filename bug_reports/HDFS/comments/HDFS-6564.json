Yes, you are right. I will take care this.

The LOG variable is never used. And in terms of compatibility this should be fine from a practical point of view. There are no changes on the  members that actually hold the data., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~wheat9] for pointing out this, yes its never used. But I could see {{CachePoolInfo}} is marked as public interface, do we need to retain the {{LOG}} considering this?

{code}
@InterfaceAudience.Public
@InterfaceStability.Evolving
public class CachePoolInfo {
{code}, I think it is okay to get rid of the {{LOG}} member since it is a evolving interface. According to http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/InterfaceClassification.html:

{quote}
Evolving
Evolving, but incompatible changes are allowed at minor release (i.e. m .x)
{quote}, Whatever you decide to do about the LOG member, if it involves the class changing or it being removed please remember to flag the change and make a release note. That way downstream folks find out about it up front rather than by surprise when they are broken., Thanks [~busbey]. Below is the draft release note, any comments. If everyone agree with this then will update the jira.
{code}
Users may need attention for this change while upgrading to this version. org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.CachePoolInfo#LOG static member variable has been removed as it is not used anywhere. Users need to correct their code if any one has a reference to this variable.
{code}, Thanks [~wheat9] for the advice. Attached another patch by removing the {{LOG}} variable., You should include mention of how to get the same functionality. In this case, they can retrieve the named logger via the logging framework of their choice directly. Since the previous member was commons-logging object, that would be done via {{LogFactory.getLog(CachePoolInfo.class)}} or {{LogFactory.getLog("org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.CachePoolInfo")}}., I've modified the note, kindly review it again.

Users need to correct their code if any one has a reference to this variable. One can retrieve the named logger via the logging framework of their choice directly like, org.apache.commons.logging.Log LOG = org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory.getLogger(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.CachePoolInfo.class);
{code}, Please ignore the previous, small correction to the logger class.

{code}
Users may need attention for this change while upgrading to this version. org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.CachePoolInfo#LOG public static member variable has been removed as it is not used anywhere. Users need to correct their code if any one has a reference to this variable. One can retrieve the named logger via the logging framework of their choice directly like, org.slf4j.Logger LOG = org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.CachePoolInfo.class);
{code}, Since before removal the LOG was commons.logging, I would like to include how to get the member from that framework. Including how to do it in slf4j as well sounds fine., We have an example mentioned in the previous note.
{code}
org.slf4j.Logger LOG = org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.CachePoolInfo.class);
{code}
I think I can include link of slf4j manual in the note like below. Does this sound good to you ?
{code}
Users may need special attention for this change while upgrading to this version. Previously hdfs client was using commons-logging as the logging framework. With this change it uses slf4j framework.
