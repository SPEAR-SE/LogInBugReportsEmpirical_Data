[Patch against 0.20-append branch (only seen this there, haven't checked trunk yet, but will do so down the road), There seems to be many lines that have whitespace changes only., If you look carefully, those lines fix a spelling error. It's a private method so I figured it was worth fixing the typo in the method name., this looks good.

I checked trunk and I think it is needed there also, Patch attached for trunk.

No unit test as this is pretty trivial and difficult to isolate in a test., I will commit this to trunk as well as 0.20-append branch as soon as HadoopQA runs its tests on it.

BTW, the patch for 0.20-append branch does not apply cleanly. Todd: can you pl upload a new version of this patch? Thanks a lot once again., 0.20 is also affected, right? We should fix it there too., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
