[I've seen httpFs server not starting with the exactly same error. In my case, it was missing {{-Dhttpfs.home.dir}}Â setting., {{HttpFSServerWebApp}} implements {{ServerWebApp}}, which blows up with an {{IllegalArgumentException}} if "NAME.home.dir" is not set.  When it is initialized through jersey, it must be swallowing the runtime exception, causing no instance to be created. ]
