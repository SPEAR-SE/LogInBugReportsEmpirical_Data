[I think it may cause TestHFlush to fail.  Anyway, we definitely should fix the NPE., Patch attached. Use the xfer port rather than the IPC port in DataNode#getDisplayName. This was the behavior before HDFS-3171, and doesn't NPE because the xfer port is set statically by the tests rather than waiting for an IPC server to come up. Also, let's remove @VisibleForTesting from getIpcPort since it's used in non-test code paths., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Nice, this looks like the more appropriate port for {{toString()}}.  However, the metrics are also inited with the display name.  Does it matter for metrics collection as to whether the xfer or ipc port is used?, Thanks Daryn. This puts the behavior back as it was previously - metrics and toString previously used the xfer port. It would only matter if people care about the particular port value in the "DataNodeActivity-<hostname>-<port>" key. I suspect most people care about the hostname, the port is used to make it unique for the case of running multiple DNs on the same host., +1 Ok, thanks for the clarification!, +1, the patch looks good to me., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2292 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2292/])
