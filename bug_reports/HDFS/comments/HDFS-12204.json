[RefCount of Hdfs ShortCircuitReplica has an initial value of 2
That's because one is ShortCircuitCache, and one is HDFS BlockReaderLocal.
The problem I found here is that both hdfs and hbase need to be modified.
First, the ShortCircuitCacheCleaner of hdfs-client reports only the expireTime to purge(delete) the cache
However, ShortCircuitReplica has a Slot and I need the code to Pugrge (delete) it via Slot.
Secondly, It is lazy to check the status of HDFS client BlockReaderLocal in hbase.
So even if you purged the cache in ShortCircuitCacheCleaner, the refCount of the hdfs client is fixed to 1 if there is no access to the hfile.
I need to periodically check and close BlockReaderLocal on the HDFS client in Hbase.

I have added the following code to ShortCircuitCacheCleaner to solve this problem.
This solution is only available in specific Application(hbase) and is a very temporary fix.
This is because the hbase client retries if there is an error.

{code:java}
public class ShortCircuitCache implements Closeable {
...

	private class CacheCleaner implements Runnable, Closeable {
	...
	
	
	public void run() {
	...
				if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
					LOG.debug(this + ": cache cleaner running at " + curMs);
				}

				purgeStaleReplica();

				int numDemoted = demoteOldEvictableMmaped(curMs);
	...
	}
	
	private void purgeStaleReplica() {

			ArrayList<Waitable<ShortCircuitReplicaInfo>> lists = Lists.newArrayList(replicaInfoMap.values());

			for (Waitable<ShortCircuitReplicaInfo> i : lists) {
				ShortCircuitReplica replica = i.getVal().getReplica();

				if (replica.isStale()) {
					
					purge(replica);
					//In fact, BlockReaderLocal should be closed in Client, but in hbase, it works because hbase client retries.
					while (replica.refCount > 0) {
						unref(replica);
					}
				}
			}
		}
		...
	}
	...
}
