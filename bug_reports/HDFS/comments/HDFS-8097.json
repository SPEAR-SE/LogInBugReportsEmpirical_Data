[I could see many test cases are using the "/test" parent path. If any of these test case failed/missed to cleanup this "/test" parent path then would affect the {{cs.getSpaceConsumed()}} value.

{code}
 ContentSummary cs = fs.getContentSummary(parent);
    assertEquals("Bad disk space usage",
        cs.getSpaceConsumed(), newLength * REPLICATION);
{code}
I think {{cleanup}} before every tests would help to resolve this case. I've updated a patch to do the cleanups. Please review. Thanks!, Attached another patch to get the jenkins report., \\
