[TestGetGroups isn't failing because the client side (run in the same JVM) ends up correctly initializing WritableRpcEngine, which causes it to be registered on the server side as well., Here's a patch which addresses the issue. Note that this depends upon the patch posted on HADOOP-7931., Not marking this patch available since Jenkins will fail to build without HADOOP-7931. See my [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7931?focusedCommentId=13171168&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13171168] on that JIRA for what testing I did., Aaron, this patch should fix it without any need for change in common., Patch generated from the right root dir., Hey Suresh, the patch you provided does not fix the issue. The static initialization of {{WritableRpcEngine}} is still not running, and so {{org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server.registerProtocolEngine}} is never getting called for writable. I just tested this by applying your patch, recompiling, running an NN, and trying to run `hdfs groups'., +1 for your patch. I plan to cleanup this later. The way RpcEngines are initialized is not correct currently. Will clean it up later.
, Thanks a lot for your quick review, Suresh. I've just committed this to trunk., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1519 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1519/])
