[In LinkArgs, src and dst are both absolute paths so that it wastes a lot of memory to store the common directory prefix.  We should be able to break them into blockId, srcRelativeDir, srcRoot and dstRoot.  Then, we can compute src from blockId, srcRelativeDir and srcRoot, and dst from blockId and dstRoot.]
