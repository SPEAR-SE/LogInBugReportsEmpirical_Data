This message is automatically generated., This does fix the problem when you run the test from command line. But if I run it in debugger it still creates fetched-image-dir under hadoop-hdfs., Hi [~shv], how about the below change?
{code}
-     System.getProperty("build.test.dir"), "fetched-image-dir");
+     System.getProperty("test.build.dir"), "target/fetched-image-dir");
{code}, Sounds right., Thanks. Hi [~xieliang007], would you update the patch to include the above fix?
