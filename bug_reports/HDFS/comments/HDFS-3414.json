This message is automatically generated., The test failure was because the addition of fs.defaultFS potentially caused the client RPC address to be included for a given NN that had already had its service RPC address included in the set of NNs to balance. The attached patch addresses that issue, and adds a test for it at the end of {{DFSUtil#testGetNNUris}}., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I'm fairly confident the test failure is unrelated to the patch. It failed because the default DN HTTP port was in use. I just looped this test 10 times on my box with this patch applied and it always passed., Looks good to me. +1., Thanks a lot for the review, Todd. I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2314 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2314/])
