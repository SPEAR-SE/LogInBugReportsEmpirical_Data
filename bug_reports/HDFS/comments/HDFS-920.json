[I am guessing that the metric currently tracks the Namenode's internal concept of a transaction. For example, creating a file actually actually does two transactions, one for creating the name in the namespace and once when the file is closed and the list of blockids for that file are written out to the editslog. Creating a new block for a file does not result in a namenode transaction.

For example, if you create a file for writing and before closing the file you restart the namenode, you will see that the file will have no blocks associated with it.]
