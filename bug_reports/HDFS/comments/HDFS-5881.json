[As the comments added by HDFS-2834 along with the fix, {{this.offsetFromChunkBoundary}} shouldn't be set before reading to skip data, or it will end up skipping as many as {{this.offsetFromChunkBoundary}} bytes more.

{code}
    // We can't use this.offsetFromChunkBoundary because we need to know how
    // many bytes of the offset were really read. Calling read(..) with a
    // positive this.offsetFromChunkBoundary causes that many bytes to get
    // silently skipped.
{code}

Instead, a big skip() should do this:
- Set {{this.offsetFromChunkBoundary}} to 0.
- Call read() to read the new chunk offset bytes. This effectively skips chunk offset bytes in the internal buffer.

OR

- Set {{this.offsetFromChunkBoundary}} to the new chunk offset.
- Don't call read() in skip()., Since branch-0.23 does not have the ByteBuffer-based API change, the fix will be different from trunk., The second approach is simpler, but skip() won't fail when skipping beyond the block boundary. I will take the first approach., This bug is even more lovelier than I originally thought.  skip() has another bug of returning wrong value. In this case, DFSInputStream regards the skip failed and creates a new BlockReaderLocal for subsequent reads. So the effect of original skip bug was sometimes hidden and incurred unnecessary overhead.

This "bug-masking bug" is not effective when the remaining data in the internal 32KB buffer is none. I.e. the return value from skip() is correct and the same BlockReaderLocal instance is reused. So, after a chunk-aligned 32KB read and a skip/seek, followed by a read will hit the original bug, which returns wrong data.

The fix will make random reads faster and return correct data., The patch includes a test case that reproduces the returning of incorrect data, which is fixed similarly to branch-2/trunk.  It additionally fixes the skip() return value bug.

This message is automatically generated., Looks good, except I'd add a log warning in case it recreates a new block reader so this type of hidden error may be noticed if broken again in the future., Thinking about it further, this really should a hard exception.  In this particular case, the client happens to recover on "accident" from the bad seek logic when it falls over to another DN.  However I could envision future scenarios where a logic error causes it to seek to the wrong location and _not_ fail., Attaching new patches.

This message is automatically generated., Javadoc warnings are not caused by this patch. This is fixed in HADOOP-10325.
The test failure was not caused by this patch. Also I wasn't able to reproduce it with the patch.
, +1 Good catch for a very subtle bug!, I've committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-0.23.
