[Quick stab at correcting the sentence. Let me know what you think., But we are not explicitly saying that Namenode is not single point of failure. Is it intended?, Sorry. I have not seen second edited earlier. I have gone through it now. Comments are fine., I have not seen second edit earlier. I have gone through the complete patch and it seems to be fine. Please let me know when this patch is going to be deployed., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi, Please deploy this patch as early as possible to avoid confusion in reader's mind. Without this patch, readers of HDFS design article will think that HDFS name node is single point of failure in the system even though it's not a single point of failure. , Hi, Please deploy this patch as early as possible to avoid confusion in reader's mind. Without this patch, readers of HDFS design article will think that HDFS name node is single point of failure in the system even though it's not a single point of failure. , We don't update the documentation for a released version of Hadoop as it is part of the release artifact., When this patch will deployed?, When this patch will be deployed?, a) it needs to get reviewed and committed
b) when there is a new release, so it this patch reviewed currently? I see test report from Hadoop QA., No, it isn't reviewed.  You might find https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute#Contributing_your_work informative., Review this patch, Still I did not get the process. Can you please submit this patch for review?, The process is relatively simple:

a) contributor submits a patch
b) QA bot does static analysis to cover some of the review work
c) committer reads through patch after QA bot says it is good
d) committer gives a +1 if it is good, -1 or general feedback if it has issues
e) if good, committer commits against source tree for releases that the committer feels it should be in, etc
f) patch shows up in next release that contains that patch

So even if this were to get committed right this second, it likely won't show up on the website for a very long time.  Also keep in mind that there are literally hundreds of JIRAs in patch available state. It can take a while for someone to get to it., Current report of QA says -1 due to white space in the end. What's next? I did not see contributor of patch fixing the issue later from 18th August., I missed the -1, thanks for the heads up. I'll try to upload a new patch soon., New patch that fixes whitespace issue, \\

, Hi,

I have seen  one SUCCESS and multiple FAILURE notifications. 

Is the fix has been committed successfully?, bq. Is the fix has been committed successfully?
Yes. The fix has been committed. The FAILURE does not mean the failure of the commit but the failure of some unit tests., I think the fix is very important because users probably read this document at first and may misunderstand that NameNode is SPOF. Cherry-picked this to branch-2.7., Yes.  How to know which all unit tests have been failed and how to address them? Is there a way to get it deployed without addressing these failures?, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #9008 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/9008/])
Move HDFS-8914 from 2.8.0 to 2.7.3 in CHANGES.txt. (aajisaka: rev 2cb5afffc4c546e3d0d0f68a921905967047b0e0)
* hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/CHANGES.txt
, bq. How to know which all unit tests have been failed
Failed tests are listed in the following link, but the link will be expired in a few weeks. (This link is expired.)
bq. FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #2567 (See https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/2567/)

bq. and how to address them?
Usually the test failures have been already reported in jira. You can search the issue and fix the test. If you can't find the issue, you can create a issue to fix the the failing test.

bq. Is there a way to get it deployed without addressing these failures?
The tests are executed after the patch is committed, so the patch is applied to trunk/branch-2/... if the tests fail or not., This patch has not yet deployed.  Please let me know when it can be deployed., Still the documentation page contains "Single Point of Failure comment" in 

http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.1/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html

, It is deployed when Apache Hadoop 2.7.3 or higher version is released. I think Hadoop 2.7.3 will be released soon. Stay tuned!, Closing this again., Closing the JIRA as part of 2.7.3 release.]
