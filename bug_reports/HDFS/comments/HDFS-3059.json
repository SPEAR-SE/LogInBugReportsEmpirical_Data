[This is a first attempt. If this is OK then it should be ported to 1.0 as well, and maybe other tags / versions., Hey Evert, good find. The patch looks pretty good to me. I think it could be improved a little bit by having the error message include what actual config parameter(s) are missing from ssl-server.xml. Otherwise, users are still going to have to look at the code to figure out what they need to change. Do you agree?

Also, you mention that this patch would need to be ported to 1.0 as well, but it looks to me like this patch isn't written against trunk. What version of Hadoop was it written for? In general, we require that all patches first be provided for trunk, and then be back-ported to maintenance branches like branch-1.0., Second try, with better feedback, Second try, with better feedback, Added better feedback, this should work. The first patch was written for tag 0.20.205 - I'm on CDH3u3 and was assuming 0.20.205 is the version it is based on.

I have only tested it against CDH using the source RPMs, since I don't know how to set up a development environment for a DN in an environment with Kerberos enabled. Any tips about that are welcome, this was not a very comfortable way of debugging: editing the source, building it, copying the core jar to the datanode and namenode, and starting both; way to get RSI ;-), This one's against trunk, btw, I think this is a very useful feature. We just met the similar problem in both NN and DN when starting http server with https enabled. By applying the patch we can quickly identify the cause of the problem., Patch doesn't apply on trunk anymore :(, Here's a patch but it doesn't throw an exception. I think we should throw an exception though :(, I have attached a patch 04 trying to fix the NullPointerException.
* The initial patches looks great. Thanks for the contribution Evert, Aaron and Ravi!
* Even if all configurations in {{ssl-server.xml}} are right, if the keystores were not setup/passed in correctly, we would still end up with the NPE. This is because {{DFSUtil#getPassword}} silently sets the password to null. I added a warn message here, because throwing exception seems to be too strict, and Java KeyStore allows passing null when load. 
* When starting secondarynamenode from shell with security enabled, it unnecessarily checks for password and try to setup a web server, which then may end up in the same NPE. I checked for whether it's called from shell before firing up the web server.

I have only tested this manually, don't think unit testing is needed as this is more of a supportability issue., \\

This message was automatically generated., The test failures/release audit warnings are unrelated, and as described above no test is needed.

Updated patch 05 to address the checkstyle issue: since I touched {{SecondaryNameNode}}, I think it makes sense to make the changed part within 80 chars. {{DFSConfigKeys}} seems to be not following the 80 chars rule, so kept my original code.

Would someone please help review? Thanks in advance., \\

This message was automatically generated., HI [~xiaochen],

Thanks for working on this issue. I browsed it and have some comments/question:

{code}
     LOG.warn("IOException caught when getting password, setting password "
          + "to null. Exception:\"" + ioe.getMessage() + "\".");
{code}
to:
{code}
     LOG.warn("Setting password to null since IOException is caught when getting password", ioe);
{code}

2. Add comma to " is specified make sure it is a relative path" as "is specified, make sure it is a relative path"

3. Would you please explain why the following comments? maybe add the explanation as an addition to the comment.
{code}
   // This is only needed when starting SNN as a daemon,
   // and no need to run it if called from shell command.
{code}

Thanks.
, Thanks Yongjun for the comments. Attached patch 06 addressed your suggestions.

This is added because I met the same NPE described when running secondarynamenode (2NN). Running a command like {{hdfs secondarynamenode -checkpoint}} with kerberos enabled will fail with the same NPE thrown. The cause is that 2NN web server is needed when starting as a daemon, to show status/metrics etc., which needs to get credentials. When running from shell, the environment doesn't have the credentials and prompts for password. When the password is not correct, {{getPassword}} sets the password to null, causing the NPE. Note that clients are't supposed to know the password, but we should definitely allow them to checkpoint. Since the metrics etc. are not needed when running 2NN from shell, I think it makes sense to not start the web server at all.
I have updated the comments like below, to give more information.
{code}
  // The web server is only needed when starting SNN as a daemon,
  // and not needed if called from shell command. Starting the web server
  // from shell may fail when getting credentials, if the environment is not
  // set up for it, which is most of the case.

This message was automatically generated., Hi Xiao, code-wise looks functionally good, only stylistic comments:

* I'm not a fan of this conditional behavior buried in {{initialize}}; how do you feel about moving starting infoServer to a new function, and calling it before we do startCheckpointThread in main? This makes this behavior difference more explicit.
* The new DFSConfigKeys constants should end in _KEY like the other variables in this file., Hi Andrew,
Thanks a lot for the review.

{quote}
Great idea! Fixed. I think this should be the way to go - it's more straightforward, and we can save the nullity check for ops in main.

Good catch. Fixed.
