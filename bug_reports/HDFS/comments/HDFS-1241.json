[Just having a quick look at this,
 
LeaseManager.findPath() will be invoked by committBlockSynchronization,completeFile, updatePipeline, they are already aquired lock on fsNameSystem.

FSDirectory.unprotectedDelete will be invoked from FSNameSystem#delete api, whihc is already aquired the lock on fsnamesystem.
One more palce is loadEditsRecords, which should be at start.
I think dead lock may not be possible here.
Do you see any other problem here? am i missing some thing here?

Thanks
Uma


, Above comments were with respective to NameNode.
We have BackupNode based HA implementation internally. Also we have the implementation of sending the block reports from DNs to BackupNode. Here the possibility is that, when blockreceived command processing at Backup node side, it can invoke lease.findPath() api and at the same time if we receive the new journal call from active node to backup node, it can go into this situation.]
