[Please refer to Disk Fail Inplace Jira. Specifically DN related one.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7125.

I am not sure if you are running into this?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-1692

Did you set volumes tolerated? Check if this patch is part of 20.1. Once you set this option, DN will exit if you cross this threshold.

, @Brahma are you running the DN with no dfs.data.dirs configured?  When you say you "pulled out all the directory volumes", what exactly do you mean by that? Eg you removed the drives backing these volumes while the DN was still running?, This doesn't seem to be a problem on 0.23 given Bharath's work (see comments above).]
