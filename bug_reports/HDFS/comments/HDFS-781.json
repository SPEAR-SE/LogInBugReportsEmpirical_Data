[Attached patch fixes a bug in decrementing the metrics PendingDeletionBlocks., Hey Suresh, the attached patch looks unrelated, wrong one?, Attaching the right file., Would be good to replace the 4000 with symbolic constants, eg (NUM_PERIODS_PENDING_DEL + 1) * DFS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL, otherwise the patch looks great.

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good except that, if we're (correctly) improving the test directory name, we should also fix its writing directly to /tmp rather than using the build property ({code}System.getProperty("test.build.data","/tmp"){code}) (HADOOP-5916).
, Files created in tests were renamed to identify the test that is being run in the logs. Attaching a file that does not use /tmp for creating test files., Looks good.  +1, pending Hudson., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., With the change in the file path to incorporate "test.build.data" property, the filesTotal metrics calculation changes.  Previous patch passed on my system. However it fails on Hudson as the test directory path is different from test setup. Changing the test not to use hardcoded expected filesTotal; instead use the path of file being created to calculate the expected filesTotal metrics.

This message is automatically generated., Attaching patch for branch 20. This patch has one difference from the trunk version - in TestNameNodeMetrics.testFileAdd(), after deletion of the file, the metrics "blocksTotal" is not expected to be set to 0. In 21 and trunk block that belongs to a file is deleted immediately. In 20 this is done later on receiving block report from the datanode., +1 for both new patches., Earlier release 20 patch was created using git diff. Creating patch with git diff --no-prefix., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #130 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/130/])

    , There is a possibility that if the condition if (!it.hasNext()) is met in the method invalidateWorkForOneNode()
We are reducing the pendingDeletionBlocksCount twice
1.first time in the method removeFromInvalidates(firstNodeId);
2.second time as per the patch pendingDeletionBlocksCount -= blocksToInvalidate.size()]
