[This patch changes {{MiniJournalCluster#restartJournalNode}} so that it remembers the newly created {{JournalNode}} instance.  This guarantees that the node will get stopped later in {{MiniJournalCluster#shutdown}}.

With this patch, I get consistent successful test runs for {{TestQuorumJournalManager}} on all platforms.
