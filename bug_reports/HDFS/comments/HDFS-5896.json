[Hi [~ikeda]
Refer this JDK bug for setName/getName thread safe fix https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8010182
the methods setName and getName are synchronized and name is declared as volatile in Thread class. So, I think it will not be issue., Sorry I've left from Java for so long and I've forgotten many things.
I still feel that fix is a little ad-hoc but it seems enough to ensure its visibility.
I don't have source codes at hand but I feel it seems OK :), Hi Hiroshi,
That is not a problem.
We can see if any others reply on this to know if it is still an issue.
From my understanding, this is not an Issue as setName/getName are now threadsafe.]
