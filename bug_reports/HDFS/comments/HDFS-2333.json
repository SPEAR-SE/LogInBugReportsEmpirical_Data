[The warning is that, if DFSOutputStream is extended, the thread could start running before the class is fully constructed. Simple solution is to make DFSOutputStream final., Hi Ivan,

I did not realize that my patch 
triggered the findbugs warnings since it did not touch that part of the code.  Thanks for filing the bug.

I have the following patch to change DFSOutputStream back to package private but your solution also looks good.  Which one you like better?

h2333_20110914.patch: change DFSOutputStream back to package private, Ah, better if you just leave it private i think. I assumed you needed it public so I just changed it to final. Package private is better though., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I should mention that the two SC_START_IN_CTOR findbugs warnings were due to starting a thread in the constructors of DFSOutputStream.  The code starting a thread was there for a long time.  In HDFS-2284, DFSOutputStream was changed from package private to public but, surprisingly, the change triggered the findbugs warnings.  Even DFSOutputStream is package private, the class could still be extended and the same problem could occur.  The real fix is not to starting a thread in the constructors.

In this issue, DFSOutputStream is changed back to package private.

I have committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #905 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/905/])
    HDFS-2333. Change DFSOutputStream back to package private, otherwise, there are two SC_START_IN_CTOR findbugs warnings.
