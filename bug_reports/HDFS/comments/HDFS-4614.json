, A comment perhaps best addressed on another jira is the questionable utility of the overall permission checking for this method.  It's a recursive operation which only checks permission to the given dir, which means I can divine information about subdirectories for which I don't have permission.  OTOH, checking permissions of the entire tree probably isn't reasonable given how expensive the operation already is for large namespaces., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #1378 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/1378/])
