[Hi [~vincent cho]

This has been fixed as part ofÂ HDFS-5892

Now, in MiniDFSNNTopology, a method is added simpleFederatedTopology to take DFS_NAMESERVICES as input. dfs.nameservices set in the test are used in the MiniDFSCluster., Hi [~vincent cho]

Closing this one as duplicate of HDFS-5892.]
