[Attached the screenshot for UI report, Hello, any chance you can figure out an easier way to reproduce this? Running some prescribed workload for a total of 12 hours doesn't will make this tough to verify/fix., {quote}

  Iam working on that.Once i found out an easier scenario to reproduce this issue ill update it., Number of files in fsck and UI report are displayed correctly.

In UI report the total number of files and directories = 4243.
In Fsck report the total number of file and directories = Total dirs + Total files + Files currently being written, i.e ., 2 + 4226 + 15 = 4243.

, yes Ashish you are right, UI report displays the count of files+directories. Sorry that was my mistake. Thanks for clarifying., So shall we resolve this as "invalid" ?, Hi Aaron,
  Thanks for looking into this defect.
Actually i raised this defect pointing to following two issues 
(1) Number of Underreplicated blocks
(2) Number of files
displayed in UI and fsck report is different

But as Ashish has commented : Number of files displayed in UI and fsck report is proper and i too agree with that.

But still the number of underreplicated blocks are different in UI and fsck .Please let me know why this is happening.
