[Only considers a connection refused exception as "security disabled" since an insecure cluster does not listen on the secure port.  Note this prevents jobs from launching w/o tokens.

I spent the better part of the day debugging why an oozie launcher task was trying to get a hftp token.  Turns out AES was specified in krb5.conf which caused a SSL exception that was silently swallowed during job submission.  The job launched and the tasks failed with user not authenticated messages from the NN.

This message is automatically generated., It looks good to me.  I am not really an expert on HFTP, but this is a simple enough change that I feel OK to give it a +1, but please use your discretion before checking it in.

I am not sure why Jenkins ran the tests again and they failed, but when I run them with your patch they pass. except for TestHftpDelegationToken which is a known issue., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2667 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2667/])

, Hey Daryn,

With this change we no longer log the exception that caused us to fail to obtain a token. Intentional? 

We now get "cause:java.io.IOException: Unable to obtain remote token" but used to get..
{noformat}
12/09/26 18:33:10 DEBUG fs.FileSystem: error was 
java.io.IOException: Unable to obtain remote token
..
aused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NullPointerException
	at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getInputStream(HttpURLConnection.java:1137)
...
{noformat}
, I think it was being double logged, so it should be getting logged at a higher level...  I'm not sure why you aren't seeing the cause because the applicable line is {{throw new IOException("Unable to obtain remote token", e)}}.  It's rather disconcerting that a NPE is being thrown?, I'm saying we should re-introduce the "LOG.debug("error was ", e);" that was removed below. This debug statement is what gives us the full backtrace (only if debug is enabled). Make sense?

{code}
-            if(LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
-              LOG.debug("error was ", e);
+          } catch (IOException e) {
+            if (e.getCause() instanceof ConnectException) {
+              LOG.warn("Couldn't connect to " + nnHttpUrl +
+                  ", assuming security is disabled");
+              return null;
             }
