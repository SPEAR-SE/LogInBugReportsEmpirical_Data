{code}, Looks like this was introduced by HDFS-997., MiniDFSCluster overrides the data-node storage directories while the original config is till pointing to the default values.
Therefore the directory cannot be found.
The patch fixes the problem and two java warnings in MiniDFSCluster., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Though the current patch works for this case with only 1 datanode, pulling it from the DataNode is closer to the intent of the test and doesn't modify MiniDFSCluster., Forgot to include Konstantin's javac warning fixes, I agree, this looks better. Thanks.

This message is automatically generated., This patch no longer cleanly applies after HDFS-909. Also, I'm not getting the test failure anymore. That patch had two of the changes to MiniDFSCluster that are included in this patch., Resubmitting without {{MiniDFSCluster}} changes., +1 on H1101-0.patch, I've committed this.

This message is automatically generated., TestDiskError would fail in testLocalDirs due to "incompatible namespaceIDs" exception on subsequent runs in y20s branch. The attached patch fix the test cluster initialization a la trunk., Somehow missed half of the fixes for the y20s patch.]
