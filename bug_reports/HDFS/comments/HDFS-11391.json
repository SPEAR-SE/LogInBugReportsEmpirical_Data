    HDFS-11391 Numeric usernames do no work with WebHDFS FS

    In HDFS-4983, a property has been introduced to configure the pattern
    validating name of users interacting with WebHDFS because default
    pattern was excluding names starting with numbers.
    
    Problem is that this fix works only for read access. In case of write
    access against data node, the default pattern is still applied whatever
    the configuration is.
    
    This PR fixes the web handler running in data nodes.

, Hi [~pvillard],

Thanks for reporting the issue and patch. The patch looks good except line 114 is too long (expecte to be <= 80 chars).
{code}
    UserParam.setUserPattern(
        conf.get(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_WEBHDFS_USER_PATTERN_KEY,
            DFSConfigKeys.DFS_WEBHDFS_USER_PATTERN_DEFAULT));
{code}
BTW, would you please share what test you have done?

Thanks.
, Hi [~yzhangal],

No problem, I updated the PR.
