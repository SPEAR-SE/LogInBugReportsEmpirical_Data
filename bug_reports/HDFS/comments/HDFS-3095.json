[We should fix this in branch-1 as well right?, Yes. We should fix it in branch-1 too., I kind of disagree. Mount points should not be in directories that are writable by the hdfs user.... and making the user mkdir all of the storage dirs before running the NN format is pretty unfriendly., I agree with Todd on this one. I think that changing this behavior will cause more problems than it solves.]
