[I think it should behave like this attached diff., Hi matsuska,

Thanks for reporting this!  I think you are right that fuse-dfs should allow you to set the owner or group separately, without requiring both to be set at once.  I have a patch that fixes this and adds a unit test, which I'll post shortly., * fuse_impls_chown.c: handle the case where one or both of the uid/gid are -1, which FUSE uses to indicate "no change."

* fuse_impls_chown.c: be more verbose about error codes.  Avoid checking errno after potentially clearing it by doing something else.

* hdfsChown: don't treat owner == NULL &&  group == NULL (no change) as an error.  It just means no operation was requested, so return success.

* Do not call NewStringUTF on a NULL argument.  This is not guaranteed to work, although it may with some JVM versions.

* hdfs.h: fix header file documentation.  We never did anything special with the empty string in hdfsChown-- NULL was always the special value indicating "no change.", -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12536789/HDFS-1249.001.patch
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 1 new or modified test files.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    +1 eclipse:eclipse.  The patch built with eclipse:eclipse.

    +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    +1 release audit.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs:

                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestCrcCorruption

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

This message is automatically generated., the CRC test failure is unrelated, {code}
-    ret = (errno > 0) ? -errno : -EIO;
+    ret = errno;
+    ERROR("Could not chown %s to %d:%d: error %d", path, (int)uid, gid, ret);
+    if (ret < 0)
+      ret = -EIO;
+    else
+      ret = -ret;
{code}
the if test should be {{if (ret <= 0)}}, or even better,
{code}
if (ret > 0)
    ret = -ret;
else
    ret = -EIO;
{code}
otherwise we get the wrong answer when errno == 0.

Something went wrong with indentation on the prototype of hdfsChown.  Since the line isn't very long, just keep it on one line rather than rewrapping it.

Thank you for adding the testcase for "only change group"!

Please add testcases for "only change user" and "change both user and group".

, * handle case where hdfsChown fails with errno = 0 (although that's not "supposed" to happen)

* fix indentation on hdfs.h a bit (but still need to wrap due to 80-column limit, sorry)

* unit test: add test for set user only, set user+group, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
