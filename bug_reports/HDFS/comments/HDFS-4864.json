[fuse_impls_open.c: remove deadcode that was causing compiler warning messages

fuse_impls_rename.c: use hdfsRenameExt with HDFS_RENAME_FLAG_OVERWRITE

hdfs.c / hdfs.h: add hdfsRenameExt, which takes a flags argument.  This argument allows you to specify HDFS_RENAME_FLAG_OVERWRITE, to get the behavior that rename overwrites the destination if it exists as a file.

jni_helper.c: add getJavaEnum, to help with manipulating the {{Options$Rename}} enum

test_libhdfs_threaded.c: test hdfsRenameExt (actually, this is the first rename test we have in there), Awesome, thanks for the patch. I'd love to see this merged.]
