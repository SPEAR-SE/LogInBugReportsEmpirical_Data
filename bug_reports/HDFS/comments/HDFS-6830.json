Except for tests, BlockInfo.addStorage(..) is only called by DatanodeStorageInfo.addBlock(..).  Do you mean that DatanodeStorageInfo.addBlock(..) is the ONLY callee and the bug is that it does not remove the block from otherStorage's list?, If my understanding is correct, how about we do all the checks in DatanodeStorageInfo.addBlock(..) but not BlockInfo.addStorage(..)?  i.e. DatanodeStorageInfo.addBlock(..) will also check whether otherStorage == this and return false if it is; BlockInfo.addStorage(..) will blindly add storage to the list without any check?, Hi Nicholas, thanks for looking at the change. By callee I meant BlockInfo.removeStorage(). removeStorage() expects that the block is not in the blocklist of any DatanodeStorageInfo i.e. the removal from the blocklist has been done prior to removing the backlink from BlockInfo to DatanodeStorage.

DatanodeStorageInfo.addBlock was not doing the removal from otherStorage's list. The fix is to do so now. You can see this assert fire if you revert the code changes from my patch except the test case. Then the following assert fires.

{code}
  boolean removeStorage(DatanodeStorageInfo storage) {
    int dnIndex = findStorageInfo(storage);
    if(dnIndex < 0) // the node is not found
      return false;
    assert getPrevious(dnIndex) == null && getNext(dnIndex) == null : 
      "Block is still in the list and must be removed first.";
{code}, bq. BlockManager.addStorage fails when DN updates storage
You meant BlockInfo.addStorage(..) ?, Arpit. Have you seen this occuring?

Codewise, changes looks good.

but, is this really happening?

IMO, this can happen only if,
1. Block is present in multiple storages of the same datanode. DN will not allow this to happen through write flow.
2. Block is moved manually to some other storage and DN restarted., bq. Block is moved manually to some other storage
Yes this is indeed how I hit the issue. This should not cause the NN to assert.

Updated patch to perform the check in DatanodeStorageInfo.addBlock()., I see.  Thanks for the clarification.

+1 the new patch looks good., Thanks for reviewing [~szetszwo] and [~vinayrpet]. Will commit once Jenkins +1s., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6039 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6039/])

, Hi Vinayakumar, do you know how to reproduce or verify this issue? I had tested case 2, but it's not working. NN will not delete other unnecessary block , Hi Vinayakumar, do you know how to reproduce or verify this issue? I had tested case 2, but it's not working. NN will not delete other unnecessary block , Hi [~xingfengshen], 
According to case 2, block is not present in multiple storages, but its been moved from one storage ( which NN thinks) to another storage ( which NN need to know).
This Jira is about updating the NN's blocksmap with correct storage for the block.

Datanode itself will not load duplicate replicas into replicas map. It will try to resolve duplicates and retains the latest one during startup.]
