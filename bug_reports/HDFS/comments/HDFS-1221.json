[Shouldn't having multiple namedirs defined (i.e., following best practices) make this failure case high improbable?, Multiple namedirs defined may make this failure very rare. 
But in any case, namenode will fail stop if it faces some IO error
when reading edits log at boot time. It does not try to read 
another healthy edits log in different namedir.
We see from Google and Amazon's paper that rare failures do happen., If I understand it correctly, this is about name-node failure, when the image or edits files get corrupt, and when name-node detects that it fails even though there are other directories with good images and edits, right? I think this works as designed. We want the admins to know that something went wrong with those directories in bad conditions rather than silently starting the name-node. Admins may choose to manually change configuration, replace drives or something else, and restart the name-node again.
Did you check HDFS-955, which fixed similar issues I believe? Since you do not provide test cases it is really hard to understand what failure condition exactly you are talking about. Are you planning to contribute your Failure Testing Service framework?, I agree that this behaviour is by design. ]
