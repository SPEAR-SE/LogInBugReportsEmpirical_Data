[HDFS-7435 addressed this by removed the assertion., ??Won't Fix: The problem described is an issue which will never be fixed.??
Should be closed as Duplicate, if there is no problem any more.

As you noted correctly there is indeed a new replica state transition FINALIZED to RUR, which was not possible before truncate. The assert was an indication of that. So by removing it we may have pushed the problem further down? Could you please confirm there is no problem., I can confirm there is no problem.

Ran several times and did a review.
We are not hitting the assertion anymore and the BlockListAsLongs is not sending the block with a recovery id so the block is added as a FINALIZED block as expected. ]
