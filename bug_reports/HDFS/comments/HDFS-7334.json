[This test was setting the wrong config parameter. The result was that the second (now >= lastCheckpointTime) check in SecondaryNameNode#doWork() was never true and a checkpoint was never run. The test eventually timed out.

This message is automatically generated., I ran TestDataTransferKeepalive on my machine with the patch applied and it passed., Looks good to me.

{code}
     conf.set(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_CHECKPOINT_MAX_RETRIES_KEY, "1");
-    conf.set(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_CHECKPOINT_CHECK_PERIOD_KEY, "1");
+    conf.set(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_CHECKPOINT_PERIOD_KEY, "1");
{code}

I think that the code should call {{setInt}} instead. Can you use the jira to clean them up? Thanks., [~wheat9],

Thanks for the review!
