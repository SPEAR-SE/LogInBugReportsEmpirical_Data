[I should add that a 64-bit server VM will use atomic 64 bit read/write operations; the risk of a partial write being visible is one for 32 bit machines. 

The language spec section 17.4 says

"The load, store, read, and write actions on volatile variables are atomic, even if the type of the variable is double or long."

, I agree that both read and write of fields should be synchronized in general.

However, in the current NameNode implementation, all accesses (read/write) to INode have to first obtain the global lock, rootDir,  Therefore, there is no synchronization problem.

For this issue, we could possibly remove "synchronized" from INode.updatePermissionStatus(..) to avoid confusion., I am going to remove "synchronized" from INode.updatePermissionStatus(..) via HDFS-3350., Just have committed HDFS-3350.]
