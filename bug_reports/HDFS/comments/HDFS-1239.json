[if a client has written some data to a set of replicas for that block and then all the replicas go bad, then the client gets an IO error and stops writing any more data to that file.

what is ur proposed fix? can you pl explain, thanks., overall we see that the client-namenode protocol does not allow
the client to say to the namenode something like "hey, i tried to write to 
the datanodes you've given me, but it fails, could you give me other
datanodes please?"  the reason is the cloud should have more machines,
and maybe it makes more sense if the client could be given another set of datanodes, > client-namenode protocol does not allow the client to say to the namenode 
> "hey, i tried to write to the datanodes you've given me, but it fails, could you give me other datanodes please?"

This is incorrect. There is such logic. See {{DFSOutputStream.DataStreamer.run()}}. This is where the logic is implemented. If you are on 0.20 then it should be in DataNode.java. The client retries but the name-node does not have more data-nodes to assign the replicas to - there is only 2 in the cluster.]
