This message was automatically generated., change looks fine to me.
I think you can add one test case for this., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for reviewing the patch.
Have updated the patch with a testcase.
Please review., Latest patch and test looks fine.
Just small nits in test.
Here {{dfsDir}} is not actually referring to directory. Instead you might want to rename this variable to 'staleCkptFile' ?
{code}// Create a stale fsimage.ckpt file
      File dfsDir = new File(currentDir.getPath() +
          "/fsimage.ckpt_0000000000000000002");{code}

Add null check before shutting down for both cluster and snn. Otherwise, since both snn and cluster are started inside try block, if any actual problem in starting up cluster/secondarynamenode, that will be masked by NPE from finally block.
{code}    } finally {
      secondary.shutdown();
      secondary = null;
      cluster.shutdown();
      cluster = null;
    }{code}
, Thanks [~vinayrpet] for the review comments.
Attached an updated patch .
Please review., +1 for latest patch.
Waiting for jenkins , \\
