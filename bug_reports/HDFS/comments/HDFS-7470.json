This message is automatically generated., Update patch to fix test failure., Creating a new {{FSNamesystem}} instance without running the full shutdown sequence on the old one would create a risk of some dangerous side effects.

* A new namesystem lock instance would get created, and there would be no synchronization of multiple threads around this.  This could violate mutual exclusion.  Two different threads could hold the 2 different lock instances, and think that mutual exclusion has been enforced.
* We wouldn't reap background threads inside things like the {{BlockManager}} and {{CacheManager}}.  Over time, we'd slowly leak threads and eventually hit {{OutOfMemoryError}} conditions.
* I can't remember if we hold an open file descriptor on the edit log when running as SecondaryNameNode.  If we do, then discarding the old {{FSNamesystem}} without a proper shutdown would leak a file descriptor.

In general, there are widespread assumptions throughout the codebase that {{FSNamesystem}} is instantiated exactly once and retained for the entire process lifetime., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Upload a stack trace file for SecondaryNameNode.

Correct me if I'm wrong, from stack trace, I think there won't have two threads hold FSNamesystem.writeLock.
And SecondaryNameNode didn't start service like BlockManager and CacheManager.
For the edit log, SecondaryNameNode won't open it for write.

I'll check again whether I missed some risk or try to find out a more safer solution later., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
