[Might be related to HADOOP-7902, but I haven't checked thoroughly., Hey Ravi, can you please set the "affects" and "targets" versions fields appropriately? Thanks a lot., Hi Mithun,

Can you give some more information about the problem?  For example, could you attach an example FSImage that triggers the bug?

Also, does TestOfflineEditsViewer run correctly for you?, Sorry I've been missing the past few days because of the summit etc. It was good to finally meet you all in person

I believe any fsimage with security turned on should be able let you reproduce the problem. I investigated briefly and the problem is that the rules (on KerberosName.java:371) didn't get loaded. Its null. TestOfflineEditsViewer worked just fine.

In case you haven't had a chance to look at it yet, please assign the JIRA to me and I ought to be able to come up with a patch soon.

, Yeah, the summit was fun.

assigning to Ravi, at his request, This patch applies to 0.23. Please review it. I'll provide different patches for branch-2 and trunk., I should've remembered to check, but I didn't. Colin seems to have solved the 2nd issue in HDFS-3486 already for branch-2 and trunk., +1 Although I'd consider putting the annotation {{@VisibleForTesting}} on the method {{processDelegationTokens}} whose scope was relaxed for testing., Duped to HDFS-3486]
