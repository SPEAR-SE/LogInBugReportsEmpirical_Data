[Similarly to HDFS-5807[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5807], I suggest to set the TIMEOUT variable to be 60000 instead of 20000. If this test class is running on a busy server, the 20 seconds are not sufficient to setup a mini HDFS cluster, copy data to datanodes, start balancer, and balance data blocks. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Chen, you said this was similar to HDFS-5807. I see that the timeout in that patch was changed to 40. In this patch, I see the timeout is 60. Is there a reason behind keeping the timeout higher than the other one?, hmmm, That is because in HDFS-5807, each method has 60 seconds timeout period. In this class, it has 100 seconds. Then, I increase it from 40 to 60. I will double check this., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Can you check whether there was a balancer performance regression? You can pick 0.23 or earlier 2.x release and see how long each test case takes. If there is a significant difference, I suggest what made it run slow. It might be due to a bug, or might be legitimate., Hi [~kihwal]
Thank you for the suggestion. Here is my data.
TestBalancer takes:
50.33s   on 0.23 build
67.96s   on trunk build

Each value is an average of 3 sample runs., I just wanted make sure that the test timeout is not due to regression in the core code.  It looks like the trunk version has 3 extra test cases and {{testExitZeroOnSuccess}} accounts for most of the extra execution time. I did not see any sign of performance regression in the three common ones.

+1 for the patch., I've committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks for working on this, Chen., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5182 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5182/])
