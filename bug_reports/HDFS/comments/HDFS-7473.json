[Thanks for the report, [~keller-jason].
After HDFS-6102, setting the property to 0 is invalid. We should update the error message
{code}
    Preconditions.checkArgument(
        maxDirItems > 0 && maxDirItems <= MAX_DIR_ITEMS, "Cannot set "
            + DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_MAX_DIRECTORY_ITEMS_KEY
            + " to a value less than 0 or greater than " + MAX_DIR_ITEMS);
{code}
to 
{code}
    Preconditions.checkArgument(
        maxDirItems > 0 && maxDirItems <= MAX_DIR_ITEMS, "Cannot set "
            + DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_MAX_DIRECTORY_ITEMS_KEY
            + " to a value less than 1 or greater than " + MAX_DIR_ITEMS);

We should update hdfs-default.xml also., Attaching a patch to fix the documentation., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thank you for the patch, [~ajisakaa].  However, I think we actually need to allow 0, and the behavior is meant to skip enforcement of the max directory item check.  This was broken in HDFS-6102, which shipped in 2.4.0, so this is a regression from prior versions.  We need to restore the old behavior., Actually, I need to retract my prior statement.  There was a conscious decision to stop supporting 0 during HDFS-6102.  See this comment:
