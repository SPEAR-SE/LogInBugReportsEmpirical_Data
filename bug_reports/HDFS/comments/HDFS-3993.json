[This patch causes the kssl static block to only change the ssl ciphers if kssl is being used and enables a much wider range of ciphers., One nit, could you please add some documentation around where you got the list of ciphers from. Other than that, looks good., Is it possible to do this non-statically to avoid the problem altogether? eg when we make a connection which we expect to be SSL-authorized, use a connection Configurator which sets up the correct cipher suites? Not an expert in this area, but it seems preferable to the static side effects., Todd, It is possible, but it would substantially re-work this chunk of code that we are killing after 1.x, so I don't see the value. Setting the system property is a global action and using kssl is a deprecated option that was added for compatibility., I should also comment that it is effecting both client and server, so if you replaced it, you'd need to do it with a SSLSocketFactory that was always used in both contexts., I seem to recall there's a java 6 bug that prevents using of non-DES algorithms (something about padding in the header).  We've had to remove AES from krb5.conf files due to this issue, so are you sure this works with java 6?]
