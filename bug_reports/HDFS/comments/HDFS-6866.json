[I think the location documentation in the description is wrong again ... :/, Fix library pointer to $HADOOP_PREFIX/lib/native/libhdfs.so., Documentation fix submit for testing., It probably doesn't work because it doesn't know how to process HADOOPxxx- instead of HADOOP-xxx- .  

While I'm here, I've also moved this to HDFS, which is more appropriate in this modern day and age. ;) Please re-upload as HDFS-6866 and hopefully the submit patch works.  Testing locally works for me, but it'd be good to see what Jenkins thinks.

Thanks!

, Ah, good to know.

I will upload a patch under the new name., Renamed patch., Submit for testing., [~aw], I think I see what's happening.  Now that HADOOP-NNNNN bugs are 5 digits, it seems to need that dash between the project and number.  Any project still using 4 digits is working fine with and without the dash in the patch file name., Looks like this got fixed in HDFS-4852., Fixed as part of HDFS-4852.  Closing JIRA as duplicate.]
