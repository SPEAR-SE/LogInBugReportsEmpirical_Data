[Yes, a token is checked on connection establishment. If the connection stays up, token expiration won't affect on-going requests.Â 
Do you have a use case that require connection to be closed by server on token expiration?, I don't have this use case, but i think sink token has expire time, we should prevent the use of token to access services if it was expired. Is that right?]
