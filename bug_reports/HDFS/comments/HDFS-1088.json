This message is automatically generated., There are two variants of rename implementation (one of them is deprecated). Could you please add this check to both of them. Also please throw an exception instead of returning false. I know that the new FSDirectory#unprotectedRenameTo() with rename options is returning false in one of the cases (dst.equals(src)). I think we should change that to throw an exception as well. If you are not doing that in this patch, I will create a bug to track that., Thanks Suresh.

This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch., I am not able to check the test report to see which test failed. Eli, can you please comment on the failed test and if it is unrelated to this patch, when you can access hudson? I will commit the patch after that., Attached the same patch but this one doesn't override TestFcHdfsSymlink#unwrapException. That's needed to make the tests in HADOOP-6703 pass. I'll file a separate hdfs jira just to add this override. Splitting the tests (core class and hdfs class) across projects is a pain. , -1 overall.
