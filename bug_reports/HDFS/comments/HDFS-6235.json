[The easiest thing to do here is simply to make sure that each test in the suite uses a unique storage directory.  That way, there is no chance of collision on locked files between multiple tests in the suite.  At the end of the test suite, all of these file handles will get released automatically during process exit.  I'm attaching a patch that changes the storage directory names to match the names of the individual tests., +1 pending Jenkins., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
