[I agree that we should have used hdfs script for these two services from the beginning. 
Since in 2.x, users are already using hadoop script to start portmap and nfs3, we can update the user guide to use hdfs script starting from 3.0. , Even in hadoop 2.x the bin/hadoop script spits out that this is deprecated.  There is no reason to keep pointing users to a deprecated option.  The docs should be updated in both places., You are right. Uploaded the patch., +1 for the patch., Thank you, Arpit. I've committed the patch., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6088 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6088/])
