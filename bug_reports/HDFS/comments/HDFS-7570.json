[Juan, this is deliberate to allow the DataXceiver to transfer the file descriptor to other parts of the code.  This is used in short-circuit., Thanks Colin. This is red herring. sorry about the noise., Hi [~jyu@cloudera.com] and [~cmccabe], thanks for looking into this. I think it'd be nice to add some comment such as what Colin commented, to avoid future confusion. Maybe we can use this jira for that purpose? Thanks.
