[I assume you saw this in 2.4. Have you tried branch-2 or release-2.5.*? There have been multiple fixes around the UI since 2.4., This issue is not present in current trunk code. Resolving as invalid.

Feel free to re-open if required., There could be one possibility. 
Are you seeing non-zero Decommissioned nodes count next to live nodes count in overview tab?
"Live Nodes" tab only shows non-decommissioned nodes where as "overview" tab includes this count in total Live nodes and displays decommissioned nodes count among these live nodes.

Other than this possibility I am not seeing any other code change related to this.
Feel free to re-open if you face the issue again,( with screen shots if possible)
Thanks]
