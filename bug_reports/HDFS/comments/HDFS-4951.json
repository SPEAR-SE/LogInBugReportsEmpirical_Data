[Instead of essentially redoing the delegation token renewer (and related) code from WebHDFS for HttpFS, and because the server is using WebHDFSFileSystem anyway, I think the best and simplest solution is to make HttpFS use the same delegation token kind as WebHDFS is using.  

The patch simply changes the token kind that HttpFS's DelegationTokenIdentifier is using from "HTTPFS_DELEGATION_TOKEN" to "WEBHDFS delegation".  I manually verified that using the FsShell with HttpFS now works properly.  , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Test failure is unreleated; TestHttpFSFWithWebhdfsFileSystem fails even without the patch due to a NPE.  I've created HDFS-4969 for that.  , shouldn't we remove the HttpFSKerberosAuthenticator.TOKEN_KIND constant then?, That's a good idea; it will prevent anyone from accidentally using it.  The new patch also removes the HttpFSKerberosAuthenticator.TOKEN_KIND., +1 pending test-patch report, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Again, the test failure is unrelated as it happens without the patch and is to be addressed in HDFS-4969., Thanks Robert.
