This message is automatically generated., +1 for the latest patch. I could successfully bring up a single node HDFS cluster using the common patch and the one at HADOOP-6461., Marking this as blocking HDFS-1150 since that patch will involve changes to the script that will get trampled by this patch.  Hoping this one can go in soon.  Tom, do you want a review on the latest patch? Do you expect more changes?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
