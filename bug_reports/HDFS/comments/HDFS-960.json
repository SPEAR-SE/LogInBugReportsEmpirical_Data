[> It breaks programs that assumes DistributedFileSystem#listStatus paths always have the same form

The notion of a default port implies that a given file may have two, non-equal, unambiguous URIs, one that specifies the port and one that does not.  A given file may have other non-equal URIs too.  For example, one may use a hostname, a second an IP address, and a third an HFTP uri.

However, like HTTP URLS, whenever possible we try to elide the default HDFS port from URIs.  We could alternately try to always insert them, but eliding seemed more user-friendly, and, regardless, both versions are unambiguous URIs for a single file.

One improvement might be to change Path#equals() to use a registry of default ports per scheme, so that the Paths could be equal in this case.  Alternately we could abandon the idea of a default port.
, That would be reasonable. We should also rename this function--making a path qualified doesn't mean stripping out the port to most people. Agree that not seeing the port in web UIs is more user friendly though I'm not sure it's worth special casing code in the core file system.]
