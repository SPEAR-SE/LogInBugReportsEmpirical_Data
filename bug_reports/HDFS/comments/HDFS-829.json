This message is automatically generated., This failed due to the flaky gridmix test i think., Looks good. libhdfs doesn't need to include error.h.

, This should ideally be applied to 0.21 and 0.20 also, but HDFS-712 was not committed to 0.21 so libhdfs is still in the MAPREDUCE subproject. While this fix could be applied to the mapreduce subtree, it would be cleaner if it could be applied in the correct project., It looks like libhdfs is in the hdfs tree in trunk.  So this can get committed now, right?  Can we get this in prior to the 0.21 cut over?, +1  Looks good to me for 21., +1.  I verified that this patch allows libhdfs to compile on OSX (although build was still not successful, I had to manually chmod +x on ./src/c++/libhdfs/install-sh to get a full build.  We should open a JIRA for this).  I've committed this.  Resolving as fixed.  Thanks, Allen., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #383 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/383/])
