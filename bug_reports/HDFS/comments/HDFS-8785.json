[Thanks [~arpitagarwal] for reporting this, I will take a look at it., Possibly related to HDFS-7608? [~cmccabe] thoughts?, Based on my local tests in a loop, the write timeout happened between 1003~11xx ms. The timeout range allowed in the original test (900~1100ms) is too tight to accommodate different test environments.

Attach a patch that relaxes the upper bound of the timeout range allowed with additional debug logs in case it fails again in the future. , \\

This message was automatically generated., I agree that the test timeout is too tight.  Can we change it to 2x the expected timeout time?, Does it make sense to really fix the issue through mocking instead of counting on the timings?, \\

This message was automatically generated., LGTM. One minor comment:
{code}
      // Write 1 MB to a dummy socket to ensure the write times out
{code}
1MB should be 10MB., Thanks [~ajisakaa] for the review. I've updated the patch based on your comments. , \\

This message was automatically generated., I am +1 on the latest patch.  I think it might be even better to simply write in a loop until we get stuck (rather than assuming some fixed upper limit on socket buffering), but this is certainly an improvement.  The test succeeds for me with this patch., Thanks all for the review. I will commit the latest patch to fix the Jenkins for now and will open separate JIRA to improve timeout related tests via Mock or loop until timeout., Commit to 2.8., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8225 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8225/])

, Hi [~xyao],

Thanks for your earlier work here. FYI. I found this jira was only committed to trunk even though the fixed version is said to be 2.8. I just committed to both branch-2 and branch-2.8. Thanks.

, [~yzhangal], Thanks for committing this to branch-2/branch-2.8!, Welcome Xiaoyu!
, [~yzhangal], in addition to (or earlier instead of?) committing to branch-2.8, you ended up creating a new branch named _brachn-2.8_. Given the ASF wide branch related lock-down, that branch can now not be deleted, atleast for a while *sigh*.]
