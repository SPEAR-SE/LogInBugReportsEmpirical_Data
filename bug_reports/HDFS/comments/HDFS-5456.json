[I saw this happen in an HA setup using QJM.  The backup namenode continually loads new edits and ends up creating new startup progress steps under the "Loading edits" phase., Here is a patch that fixes the problem.  I also expanded the existing unit test that checks that startup progress is frozen after startup completes.  This test fails without the patch and passes after the patch is applied., +1 for the patch. Thanks for adding a test to catch it!
