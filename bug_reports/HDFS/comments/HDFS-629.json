This message is automatically generated., I committed this to trunk., Druba, could you please put a note on why there's no new tests were developed for the fix?, Sure, this removed a few "import xxx" lines from source files to prevent Eclipse warnings, and does not need targetted unit tests. Successful compilation of the source code is a test by itself., Thank you! We are trying to have a way of tracking the changes and their testing. It might be not that easy to find our in a few months why a patch with -1 was committed and why no tests were delivered. I appreciate your help., Thank you!
