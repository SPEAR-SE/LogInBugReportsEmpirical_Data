[Following are the possible configurations for include/exclude lists as mentioned in the javadoc. 
# Host must have been in the include hosts list and the include hosts list must not be empty.
# Host is decommissioned by remaining in the include hosts list and added into the exclude hosts list. Name node is updated with the new information by issuing dfsadmin -refreshNodes command.
# Host is removed from both include hosts and exclude hosts lists.  Name node is updated with the new informationby issuing dfsamin -refreshNodes command

In this list one more important and default possible condition is not considered.
Which is *Include List is not configured ( i.e. *, allow everyone) and only exclude list is configured, where decommissioned node is present.*

In the condition checks, #2 is missed, where host is present in both lists.

I think following changes will do 
{code}
  private void removeDecomNodeFromList(final List<DatanodeDescriptor> nodeList) {
    // If the include list is empty, any nodes are welcomed and it does not
    // make sense to exclude any nodes from the cluster. Therefore, no remove.
    if (!hostFileManager.hasIncludes() && !hostFileManager.hasExcludes()) {
      return;
    }

    for (Iterator<DatanodeDescriptor> it = nodeList.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
      DatanodeDescriptor node = it.next();
      if ((hostFileManager.isExcluded(node) || !hostFileManager
          .isIncluded(node)) && node.isDecommissioned()) {
        // Include list is not empty, an existing datanode does not appear
        // in both include or exclude lists and it has been decommissioned.
        // Remove it from the node list.
        it.remove();
      }
    }
  }{code}

BUT, After the above fix, Since the node decommission done based these checks already, and if node is included again, node would not be decommissioned state.
*So I think its Okay to remove entire hostmanager checks and just remove decommissioned nodes directly from list*

[~andrew.wang], Do you think this is fine?, Updated an initial patch.

, Would be good to port this to branch-2.7., Patch for branch-2.7, Committed to branch-2.7., [~shv], the 2.7 patch that you committed here breaks TestHostsFiles.testHostsExcludeInUI. The failure is consistently reproducible and the associated stack trace is shown below.

{noformat}, Please investigate 2.7 unit test failure, Yup, that was the porting problem. Fixed., Thanks, [~shv]! I just confirmed that this fixes the test failure on branch-2.7]
