[Thanks for reporting this [~tianyin]. It has been fixed in trunk already., Thanks, [~zhz]! 

wow, it's hard to believe the report was 6 months ago, and the error still hasn't been fixed even now... (2.6.3 is just released yesterday)... :-S, Hmm I'm not sure why it wasn't included in 2.6.3. You can see the target version of that JIRA is 2.7.2., Sorry, 2.7.1, because 2.7.* and 2.6.* are in different branches?, Correct., :-S, wait... so for any bugs fixed in trunk (or Branch 2.7), they still occur in the Branch 2.6?, wait... so for any bugs fixed in trunk (or Branch 2.7), they still occur in the Branch 2.6?
, Whenever committing a patch we are supposed to determine the target version. For example if a bug fix is valid for trunk and version 2.8, the it should be committed to trunk and {{git cherry-pick}}'ed to branch-2 and branch-2.8., make sense! Thanks a lot, [~zhz]!!]
