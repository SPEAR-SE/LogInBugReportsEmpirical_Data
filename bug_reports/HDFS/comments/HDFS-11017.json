[Thanks [~xiaobingo] for reporting this. Can you update the ticket with the hadoop version that repro the issue? I just did a quick try on hadoop-2.7.1 but can not repro it. 

{code}
[hdfs@c6405 vagrant]$ hdfs dfsadmin -setSpaceQuota 100M -storageType ssd /tmp
[hdfs@c6405 vagrant]$ hadoop fs -count -h -q  -v -t  SSD /tmp
    SSD_QUOTA     REM_SSD_QUOTA PATHNAME
        100 M             100 M /tmp
{code}, It seems there's a flaky error in my script. It's not an issue anymore, thank you [~xyao] for the check.]
