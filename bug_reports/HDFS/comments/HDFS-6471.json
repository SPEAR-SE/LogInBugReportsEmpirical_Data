[Working on this., A couple of things fixed here:

- overall consistency within moveFromLocal and with the rest of the test
- organization of directories in fs; clean-up
- disruptiveness fixed, I have validated the test by moving DFSadmin test cases to the end of the list to be executed after moveFromLocal ones. Everything works fine.

Please make sure to remove the comment from DFS admin section referring to this ticket., Comment removed., +1 - patch looks good. Thanks you! I will commit it in a bit., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5688 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5688/])
