This message is automatically generated., +1 Ideally, it would be nice to log the actual state instead of "this or that" but I don't know how hard that would be., Thanks for the review, Daryn. There's no easy way that I can see to know if the DN's block contents were considered stale due to startup or having been made active, as we only store a boolean in the DatanodeDescriptor indicating stale or not. Though I agree it would be nice to have that log message differentiate the reason for staleness, doesn't seem worth it to me to introduce a more complex state system just to improve the log message.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks again for the review, Daryn., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3548 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3548/])
