No new test as is output text change., submitting patch, btw, test-patch technically failed:
{noformat}
BUILD FAILED
/private/tmp/ps5/hdfs/build.xml:1078: exec returned: 2{noformat}
but this is unrelated to the patch and I'm looking into it., Could you please also fix some more cosmetic things here related to OIV.
# JavaDoc warnings:
#- ImageLoader.java:68: warning - @param argument "imageVersion" is not a parameter name.
#- ImageLoaderCurrent.java:155: warning - @param argument "numINUC" is not a parameter name.
#- LsImageVisitor.java:77: warning - Tag @throws cannot be used in field documentation.  It can only be used in the following types of documentation: constructor, method.
# {{enum ImageElement}} should be in all capital letters as constants.
# {{"test.build.data"}} in testOIV should not be set to "/tmp", but rather to something relative to the current path say "build/test/oiv", like in {{TestHDFSServerPorts}}, so that clean build could automatically removed it.

This message is automatically generated., Oy.  The failing contrib test is unrelated.  Hudson is currently broken for core tests, as it's looking for a target, " Target "create-c++-configure" does not exist in the project "Hadoop-Hdfs". ", which doesn't exist (as determined by Gary).  I ran the unit tests locally and they all pass.  Patch is good to go., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Not sure why Hudson ran again.  Failing contrib test is unrealted. Patch is still good to go., I just committed this. Thank you Jakob., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #23 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/23/])
    , Hi Konstantin, should this belongs to BUG FIXES, instead of NEW FEATURES, in CHANGE.txt?, My mistake. I meant to add it to the IMPROVEMENTS section. It is definitely not a new feature. Not a bug either. Thanks., I have moved the message to the IMPROVEMENTS section.]
