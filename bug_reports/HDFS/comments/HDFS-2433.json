[The complete set of logs for all of the failures. (It is rather large), my hunch is that this is related to HDFS-1172., That could be true, but it does not seem to fit.  

testAppendSyncReplication[012] brings up a mini DFS cluster writes some data to a file.  Kills off one of the datanodes and then appends some more data to the file.  It then closes the file, shuts down the cluster.  Brings up a new cluster in safemode, and tries to verify that the expected number of replications are there.  

It is showing too few replications.  It could be that there is a race condition on startup of the second minicluster where not all of the datanodes have finished their full block reports before we ask how many replicas there are., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2., I don't think I've seen this fail in a long, long time. Going to close this out. Please reopen if you disagree.]
