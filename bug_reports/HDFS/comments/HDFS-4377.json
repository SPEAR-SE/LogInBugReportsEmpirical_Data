This isn't right -- the value of the map is itself a set, not a map.

-     * It is considered extermely rare for all these numbers to match
-     * on a different machine accidentally for the following 
-     * a) SecureRandom(INT_MAX) is pretty much random (1 in 2 billion), and
-     * b) Good chance ip address would be different, and
-     * c) Even on the same machine, Datanode is designed to use different ports.
-     * d) Good chance that these are started at different times.
-     * For a confict to occur all the 4 above have to match!.
-     * The format of this string can be changed anytime in future without
-     * affecting its functionality.

I think those comments were useful. Probably worth leaving them as '//' style comments.

Otherwise seems fine, Thanks for the review Todd. Updated patch attached.

#1 Good catch, I just noticed the type changed recently and updated the comment naively. I re-wrote it now. Related, I filed HDFS-4378 to make StorageID a class so the types are more readable and the code is less error prone.

#2 I rewrote the implementation comment to fix spelling mistakes/grammar and hopefully improve the explanation., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
