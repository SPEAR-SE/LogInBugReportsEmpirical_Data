[It appears to be intermittent too., It appears to be an issue with my version of the JDK.  I upgraded to java version "1.6.0_26" and the problem went away., The code was introduced by HDFS-2317 but not HDFS-2316.  Updating the summary although this is not a problem., I feel we should support java 1.5 onwards, from runtime as well as compiletime compatibility perspective., I disagree.  Java 1.6 reached stability in 2009.  There's no reason not to allow ourselves to use its features.  Furthermore, Hadoop wiki has documented the requirement for Java 1.6 since at least April, 2010:  see [HadoopJavaVersions|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HadoopJavaVersions] and it's [Revision History|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HadoopJavaVersions?action=info].]
