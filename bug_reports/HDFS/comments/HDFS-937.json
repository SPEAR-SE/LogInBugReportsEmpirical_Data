[A patch for review. This patch is very similar to the one submitted to HDFS-101 for 0.20., Hairong, it seems like the test for this fix has been posted separately in HDFS-564. Do you think it makes sense to accompany this patch with the test from HDFS-564?, HDFS-564 uses the fault injection framework which is introduced in 0.21., Isn't the fault injection framework available in ydist? Might be worth posting a patch that uses it, for those who have applied the ydist patch., I have 0.20 for fault-injection framework backport attached to HADOOP-6204. It's ready to be committed any time now :-), Well then I will port the tests into 0.20 as well.]
