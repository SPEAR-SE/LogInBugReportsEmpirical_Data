[Patch for updating HDFSHighAvailabilityWithQJM.md. No major changes except updating the example to use 3NNs in the configs, rather than two and some nits to indicate you can use 2+ in HA., Hey Jesse, patch looks pretty good to me, except that we should probably also amend {{HDFSHighAvailabilityWithNFS.md}} similarly as well.

+1 pending addressing that and a clean Jenkins run., \\
