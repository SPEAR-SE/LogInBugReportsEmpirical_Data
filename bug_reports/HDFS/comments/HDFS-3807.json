[If I'm not mistaken this is by design. AFAIK, user filters are meant web ui servlets/jsps, ie to add you own authentication mechanism. webhdfs/hftp/shuffle/fsimage/... servlets sure sure don't need that.

Said this, the HttpServer setup become a big spaghetti, and it is very difficult to figure out, given a servlet/jps, what filters is has. It would be nice to have something a bit more declarative where you can see the composition of filter(s)/servlets., I agree its very difficult to understand what is supposed to be with what.  If it was by design, then I propose this jira be converted to document what the filter.initializers config is supposed to apply to.  ]
