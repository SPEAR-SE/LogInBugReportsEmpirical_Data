This message is automatically generated., The failed test is not related and is traced in HDFS-5936. The fix is simple, if the reviewer do think it needs tests, I could try to provide one. , Hi Binglin, was this causing any unintended behavior? I am not familiar with this code., If i understand correctly, this field intends to be used in recovery scenario, skip over the sender/receiver, finally it's used inside FsDatasetImpl.recoverRbw() for doing a sanity checking only. see:
{code}
    // check replica length
    if (rbw.getBytesAcked() < minBytesRcvd || rbw.getNumBytes() > maxBytesRcvd){
      throw new ReplicaNotFoundException("Unmatched length replica " + 
          replicaInfo + ": BytesAcked = " + rbw.getBytesAcked() + 
          " BytesRcvd = " + rbw.getNumBytes() + " are not in the range of [" + 
          minBytesRcvd + ", " + maxBytesRcvd + "].");
    }
{code}

so current impl is not strict enough. Probably need a recovery expert to confirm above:), still a nice finding per my current understanding, [~decster] !, Thanks for the comments, Liang Xie:)
Correct, if bytesSent is not reset, it will make this sanity check useless.
