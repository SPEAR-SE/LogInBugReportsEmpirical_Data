[Marking it as a blocker since WebHdfsFileSystem should remain compatible.  {{toLocatedBlock()}} should use a different version of constructor if cached location is null., You can blame me for this one. I don't remember why that precondition check is there; all we're trying to enforce is that {{this.cachedLocs}} is not null. I think we should just weaken it to set cachedLocs to EMPTY_LOCS if the input parameter is null or empty., Thanks for the comments guys. 

I favour the solution of relaxing the constructor to handle null "cacheLocs" parameter. Since the same constructor also handles null "locs" parameter. I just uploaded a patch to handle "cachedLocs" in a similar fashion as "locs" parameter. Thanks for reviewing.

This message is automatically generated., release audit warning is a pid file-- not relevant.  committing., Thanks a lot Colin! 

I planned to take a look at the -1 javadoc thing. Will update later when I find something.
