[HDFS uses UTF-8 encoding., This particular JIRA is focusing on the macro to convert char* to NewUTF8String may have bugs in the serialization.  I think the example setlocal should use "ja_JP.UTF-8" to ensure the passing char* is UTF8 encoded string., Moved to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0-rc1.
Also moved from fixVersion to targetVersion, since it isn't fixed yet., JNI specification doc says:

 "There are two differences between this format and the "standard" UTF-8
 format. First, the null byte (byte)0 is encoded using the two-byte
 format rather than the one-byte format. This means that Java VM UTF-8
 strings never have embedded nulls. Second, only the one-byte, two-byte,
 and three-byte formats are used. The Java VM does not recognize the
 longer UTF-8 formats."

that's why some Japanese character cannot be translated. like ð €‹ which is 4 bytes,\xF0\xA0\x80\x8B
