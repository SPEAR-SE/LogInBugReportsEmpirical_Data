[After analysis i found that the cause is 

{code:title=NNHAServiceTarget.java|borderStyle=solid}
 public NNHAServiceTarget(Configuration conf,
      String nsId, String nnId) {
    Preconditions.checkNotNull(nnId);
    
    if (nsId == null) {
      nsId = DFSUtil.getOnlyNameServiceIdOrNull(conf);
      if (nsId == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
            "Unable to determine the nameservice id.");
      }
    }
......
{code}


Here, by using {code:} getOnlyNameServiceIdOrNull(conf) {code} to determine the nameserviceID, when configured in a Federated setup which has multiple nameservices, returns null. This was updated as part of HDFS-3084 
I am thinking to change it to {code:} getNamenodeNameServiceId(conf) {code}  

Please suggest, You need to specify the nameservice with which you want to interact. For example, if you have ns1 and ns2, and you want to failover from nn1 to nn2, then you would:

haadmin -ns ns1 -failover nn2 nn1, Thanks for the comment Dave. But i think the -ns option is somehow got removed after HDFS-7808 and HDFS-7324, This is a 2.7 blocker., Submitting the patch. (reverted the changes in HDFS-7808) and (corrected HDFS-7324). Please review the same , Thanks for the issue update, Thanks for the issue update, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
