[Here is the test that fails with current implementation.
{{DFSInputStream}} should be fixed to take into account the actual file length and not try to read beyond it.
{code}
- realLen = (int) Math.min(realLen, locatedBlocks.getFileLength());
+ realLen = (int) Math.min(realLen, locatedBlocks.getFileLength() - pos);
{code}, The LocatedBlocks returned from getLocatedBlocks(..) has a blocksize of the current block,
 while the file length is the length at the time of the snapshot.  

Current tests use the pread(..) path which uses the file length and position, however readWithStrategy(..) incorrectly allows reads 
beyond the file length of the snapshotted file., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Tao, looks good. Seems like TestFileCreation actually succeeded, something went wrong with reporting.
Could you check on the Java warnings. I couldn't find new warnings, but I may missed it., Good catch and thanks for fixing it!  I wonder what if the file remains open for append.  Would reading from the snapshot file be able to read the extra bytes?, I think you may be right Nicholas. I'll add a test to verify this. Thanks, Actually, BlockManager.createLocatedBlocks(..) always sets isLastBlockComplete to true,
so reading from the snapshot won't read the extra bytes., The newer patch includes a test for reading from a snapshot while the underlying file is still being appended., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I can't reproduce these unit test failures locally. I don't think they are related to the patch. 

[~cnauroth] is seeing a similar occurrence of phantom javac warnings and test failures:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7291?focusedCommentId=14187457&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14187457, I coudn't see the test failures or patch related java warnings locally with or without the patch.
I have one nit. In the test you added for append you create a new snapshot2. This is not necessary for this particulare test case.
Could you also add a comment that you are testing snapshot read of a file opened for append. , Simplified the test per Konstantin's review., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, This wasn't originally in 2.6.1, must have been committed to 2.6, which was already 2.6.2. I just committed this to 2.6.1 taking [~sjlee0] cherry-pick, which must have come from branch-2.6.

Ran compilation and TestSnapshotFileLength before the push.]
