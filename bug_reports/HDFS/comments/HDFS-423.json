[Here's a work in progress patch.

fuse_dfs_wrapper.sh could do with knowing where the libhdfs lib is - perhaps we need to have fuse_dfs_wrapper.sh built from a template at make time?, Made a minor fix to the earlier patch, this one works for me. 

Built fuse-dfs with:
- {{ant compile -Dcompile.c++=true -Dlibhdfs=true}}
- {{ant compile-contrib -Dlibhdfs=1 -Dfusedfs=1}}

Note that sun.arch.data.model is not supported on all platforms, doesn't seem to be an easy platform agnostic way to set that property. , bq. fuse_dfs_wrapper.sh could do with knowing where the libhdfs lib is - perhaps we need to have fuse_dfs_wrapper.sh built from a template at make time?

We could also link the libhdfs build dir to build/libhdfs after building libhdfs., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Here's an updated patch that gets fuse dfs building on trunk and fuse_dfs_wrapper.sh working post-project split. I tested basic operations (read, write, creat, rm etc) manually on a fuse mount. TestFuseDFS no longer runs, I filed HDFS-780 to revive it, but let's do that as a separate checkin and get the code compiling first., Ran patched version of HDFS on a Linux machine

have ran into this issue:

{noformat}

Also, it seems that running 
{{% ant test-contrib -Dcompile.c++=true -Dlibhdfs=true -Dfusedfs=true }}
doesn't detect the problem above. Won't it make sense to have {{test-contrib}} to depend on {{compile-contrib}} ?, Do you have the fuse-dev package?  

bq. Won't it make sense to have test-contrib to depend on compile-contrib ?

That seems reasonable.    Btw I run the libhdfs test with  {{ant compile -Dcompile.c\+\+=true -Dlibhdfs=true test-c++-libhdfs}}
, Right, installing fuse-dev helped a lot :-)
Another problem: I've ran the command line with the patch in place two or three times in a row. I got this:
{noformat}
     [exec] make[1]: Nothing to be done for `install-data-am'.
     [exec] make[1]: Leaving directory `/homes/cos/work/Hdfs.trunk/build/c++-build/Linux-i386-32/libhdfs'

{noformat}
Symlink creation has to be conditional or it might break the build. Seems to be working otherwise., Thanks Cos. Uploaded a patch with a fix and tested with back to back runs of the libhdfs test., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
