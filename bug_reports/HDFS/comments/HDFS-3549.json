[The problem only occurs on a build from a clean tree.  If one builds without -Dtar it succeeds, and then subsequent builds with -Dtar will succeed since hadoop-hdfs-raid-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT will exist from a prior build.

It appears to be an issue of ordering during the package phase.  I thought Maven was supposed to preserve the relative order of plugins within a phase as they appear in the pom, but [this comment on MNG-2258|http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2258?focusedCommentId=299149&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-299149] implies the ordering can still be wrong sometimes even after the fix in Maven 3.0.3., Patch to work around the issue by moving the assembly to the prepare-package phase which ensures the assembly is completed before tar tries to pick it up., +1 the change looks good to me, but I am not an HDFS committer so you are going to need someone else to +1 and commit it., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The javadoc warnings and findbug failure were introduced in MAPREDUCE-3868, which also introduced the dist tar build failure.  Attaching an updated patch which adds a stub findbugsExcludeFile.xml to fix the findbugs build failure.

Given the nature of the change, I don't believe the TestRaidNode failure is related., Updated patch to remove need for stub findbugsExcludeFile.xml.  Also removed the dist tar config since we can inherit it from the hadoop-project-dist parent.  That simplifies the pom a bit and fixes a malformed XML issue due to the use of '2> /dev/null' which was already fixed in the parent pom.
