[Looks like datanodes are registering with IP address as the name in registration instead of host name. I in suspect o.a.h.net.DNS, {{InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName()}} is returning the IP address. Not sure if this is due to some java SecurityManager issue., If this happens on a cluster that speaks IPV6, will the colon characters be escaped?]
