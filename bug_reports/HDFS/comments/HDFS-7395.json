[Thanks for the catch.

This is broken by HDFS-7381 during the refactoring. The v1 patch is a simple one-line fix., HI [~wheat9],

Thanks for addressing this issue quickly. Since I was able to reproduce it locally, I tested your patch and saw it fixed the issue. 

I reviewed the patch, and have a small suggestion here. Can we introduce a new private method  {{resetGenerationStampV1Limit()}} (or initGe...) with no argument, which does
{code}
generationStampV1Limit = GenerationStamp.GRANDFATHER_GENERATION_STAMP;
{code}
 so it can be shared by the constructor of BlockIDManager and methods {{clear()}}?

Thanks.

For HDFS-7381 / HDFS-7395 I want to focus purely on refactoring, that is, keeping the code as close as the original code as possible and to unblock jenkins -- but please feel free to file a follow-up jira if you're interested. Thanks., The fix looks good to me. +1

[~wheat9], could you also do some extra check to make sure all the other code is consistent with the original implementation?, I checked the patch of HDFS-7381 and the test results again and I did not find any inconsistency. I moved the code with IntelliJ directly, it looks like the IDE is going a little bit too smart. :-)

[~yzhangal], does it look okay to you? I want to commit this quickly to unblock jenkins run, we can do the clean up in a follow-up jira., Hi [~wheat9],

I think a follow-up jira is fine. Thanks again for addressing the issue quickly.
, BTW Haohui, I have one question, somehow the original jenkins test before committing HDFS-7381 patch doesn't have this failure, do we have an understanding why this happens more consistently now?

Please feel free to commit the change here, because  it's the same as before your refactoring work in HDFS-7381. 

Thanks.

HDFS-7395. BlockIdManager#clear() bails out when resetting the GenerationStampV1Limit. Contributed by Haohui Mai. (wheat9: rev 1a2e5cbc4dbed527fdbefc09abc1faaacf3da285)

, HI Guys,

I tried to run locally the same test with the HDFS-7381 patch on the base where the HDFS-7381 jenkins test was run, I can reproduce the issue reported here. It's interesting that the HDFS-7381 jenkins test did not fail this testcase. There might be some intermittent reason to watch out.

Thanks.
