[Hi, [~tassapola].  Thanks for filing the bug.  I think we're just going to need to change this code from the {{CacheAdmin}} class:

{code}
      // If there are no results, we return 1 (failure exit code);
      // otherwise we return 0 (success exit code).
      return (numResults == 0) ? 1 : 0;
{code}
