["Last Contact" column does not work either. Need to check all columns.
To me it looks like the sorting is done but in blocks, as if the UI reads a part of data and sorts it, then reads another part and sort is independently, and so on., The problem with Last Contact (and this can happen with other columns also) is due to the time lag between sorting and printing sorted data. All the datanodes are sorted based on the sort criteria. Then reference to datanode object is used for fetching and printing the data. Printed data has discrepancies, if the datanode data is changed by then., Currently not working on this, Some sorting works, the sorting by Admin State does not work - a mix of "Decommission In Progress" and "In Service" do not sort as expected.]
