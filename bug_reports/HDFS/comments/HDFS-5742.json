[+1 Patch looks good to me., Thanks for the quick review Jing! Trivial update to patch to fix a typo in {{SimulatedStorage}}.

Will commit once I have a Jenkins +1., Withdrawing the patch for now. There are other bugs in DatanodeCluster.

Will submit a combined patch later., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., It looks like DataNodeCluster has not been used with Hadoop 2.0 in a while since I ran into numerous issues. I think I got most of them and I can now bring up a simple test cluster with a real NN and simulated DNs.

Attaching a patch with the following fixes:

# MiniDFSCluster now handles null configuration when starting simulated Datanodes.
# {{MiniDFSCluster#injectBlocks}} accepts an optional {{BlockPoolId}}. If none is supplied then it tries to query it from the in-process NameNode i.e. existing behavior.
# DataNodeCluster accepts {{BlockPoolId}} on command line and passes it to {{injectBlocks}}
# DataNodeCluster optionally accepts {{SimulatedDnCapacities}} on the command line and passes it to {{startDataNodes}}. If none is supplied then it uses the existing default from {{SimulatedFSDataset}}.
# DataNodeCluster must wait after starting the DNs and before injecting blocks to allow the storage initialization to complete.
# BlockPoolId is printed when formatting NN., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch.  Thank you, Arpit., Rebase to resolve conflict with HDFS-5318 which was just committed. The conflict was fairly trivial, requiring the NN index to be passed to {{cluster.injectBlocks}} in {{TestReadOnlySharedStorage}}.

{code}
     // Inject the block into the datanode with READ_ONLY_SHARED storage
-    cluster.injectBlocks(RO_NODE_INDEX, Collections.singleton(block));
+    cluster.injectBlocks(0, RO_NODE_INDEX, Collections.singleton(block));
{code}, +1 for the rebased version too, pending Jenkins run on v5., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
