[duplicate with [HBASE-10029|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10029?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel], In NameNodeProxies#createProxy, it creates a proxy with interface ClientProtocol which is not Closable, and a RetryInvocationHandler, for the HA case.  However, ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider doesn't have field "h", the InvocationHandler, which is the problem.

I think this is a valid bug we need to fix., Looked into it and found out that it is an HBase issue actually. HDFS is good.]
