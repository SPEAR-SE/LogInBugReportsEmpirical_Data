[Actually I now advocate a -2 error code for usage issues -independent of any other error message. 

why? Stops you having to grab the output and do a regexp search to verify that the error code is a usage message from the inner java code, not some failure of java or the shell script to get that far: {{if [[ ${usage} =~ *Usage* ]];}}, patch for branch-1 that returns -2 on a usage; 254 to a bash script that invokes it, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
