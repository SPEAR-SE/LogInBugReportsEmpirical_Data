[This infinite retry loop might be cased by the same problem reported in HADOOP-5311. The infinite retry got fixed in HADOOP-3998. Runping, could you please check the dfs client log to provide us more information?, I am using, 20.1 version.
I am trying to debug this issue but I could not replicate this issue.
Is this problem exists in 20.1 version also?, This is probably stale.

Also, "Infinite Loop of Logging" is a terrible band name but probably a great religious text if you wanted to create a cult.]
