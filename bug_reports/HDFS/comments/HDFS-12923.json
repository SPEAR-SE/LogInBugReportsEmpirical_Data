[Resolved as not an issue., [~eddyxu], could you elaborate on why is not an issue?, [~elgoiri] yes, sure.  In {{FSDirConcatOp#verifySrcFiles()}}, it has already checked the EC policy ID between files, so a {{HadoopIllegalArgumentException}} will be thrown.

{code:title=FSDirConcatOp.java}
private static INodeFile[] verifySrcFiles(...) {
....
 if(srcINodeFile.getErasureCodingPolicyID() !=
          targetINode.getErasureCodingPolicyID()) {
        throw new HadoopIllegalArgumentException("Source file " + src
            + " and target file " + targetIIP.getPath()
            + " have different erasure coding policy");
      }
}
