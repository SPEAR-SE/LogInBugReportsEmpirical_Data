[Hi [~jaoki],

bq. When upgrading hdfs, say from 2.0.5 to 2.2.0, users will need to start namenode with "upgrade" option.
From where you have seen this.?  As I have seen, all error messages prior to rollingUpgrade feature tells "-upgrade" option itself. So you need to start namenode with "-upgrade" option only, not just "upgrade"

bq. I haven't tried the trunk but it seems to return "UPGRADE" (all upper case) 
Yes, this is a slight issue with error message. {{StartupOption.UPGRADE.getName()}} should be used while printing the error message. Are you planning to post a patch for this?
, Hi [~vinayrpet], I got the error message when I executed
{code}
sudo service hadoop-hdfs-namenode start
{code}

Then I found that I'd have to execute
{code}
sudo service hadoop-hdfs-namenode upgrade #(1)
{code}
Note that this does not have a hyphen e.g. "-upgrade"
I also have found that users can execute hadoop-daemon.sh. I've never tried it this way but something like
{code}
hadoop-daemon.sh --config /etc/hadoop start namenode -upgrade # (2)
{code}
Then this will require a hyphen.
I thought (1) is a preferred way thus this ticket, but if I'm wrong and (2) is equally or more preferred, please let me know.


, Hi [~jaoki], what distribution of Hadoop are you using?
AFAIK, service scripts are not provided in Apache Hadoop itself, so (2) is preferred if you are using community version., Hi [~ajisakaa], thank you for clarifying. I'm using bigtop.
