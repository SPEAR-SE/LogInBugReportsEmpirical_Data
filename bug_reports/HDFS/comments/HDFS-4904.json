This is pre-compiling the JSP files under hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/webapps/journal into class files for the distro/deployment.  Those JSP files don't appear to be doing anything, so I think the whole directory can be removed as a part of this change, and we can remove the <execution> from pom.xml., Thanks for the confirmation Chris.

This message is automatically generated., No new tests should be needed since we are just removing unused code., Sorry, Arpit.  I think I led us astray.  Those JSP pages are still in use.  Running "hdfs journalnode" launches {{JournalNode}}, which creates {{JournalNodeHttpServer}}, which creates an {{HttpServer}} with name "journal".  This causes the {{HttpServer}} to load the JSP pages from webapps/journal.

I said earlier that these JSP pages don't do much, but there is one thing:

{code}
<b><a href="/logs/">Logs</a></b>
{code}

If a user looking for the journal node logs points a browser at the root, then they'll get a friendly link to the correct URL for logs.  Therefore, I think the JSP pages need to stay in place.  This means that your first patch is good.  So sorry for the churn.

+1 for the first patch.  I'll commit that soon.
, Thanks, good to learn!, Setting Affects Version/s and Target Version/s to 3.0.0.  The unused code only exists in trunk.  It does not exist in branch-2 or branch-2.1-beta.  (Presumably it was never merged from trunk.), I committed this to trunk.  Arpit, thank you for the patch!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3926 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3926/])
