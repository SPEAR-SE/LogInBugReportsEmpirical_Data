, There are two ports - one for client (dfs client) and the other for the hdfs service itself (ie datanodes).
The 2nd one was called "serviceRpcServer" and hence to be consistent I called the first one clientRpcServer., Addressed the line count., +1 for the patch., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Can this issue be resolved? Was it only committed to trunk, or also to 0.23?, Thanks Aaron for the reminder.

Just have resolved this.  0.23 does not need this., I have merged this to 0.23.]
