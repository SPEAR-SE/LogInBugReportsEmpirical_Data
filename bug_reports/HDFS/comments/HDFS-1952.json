This message is automatically generated., Some nits:
- the new closing brace '}' is indented incorrectly (before addNewEditLogStream in FSEditLog.java)
- in testFailedOpen there are a few commented-out assignments of {{fileSys}} -- please remove these lines


Otherwise looks good to me!, Agree.  Maybe change the exception message to "Failed to initialize edits log in any storage directory."

The test-patch failures are recurring issues unrelated to this patch.

This message is automatically generated., Used --strip-prefix this time. Tested application to trunk with "patch -p0 < hdfs-1952.patch", hopefully Hudson likes it., Sorry I missed this the first time.  It's minor, so you don't have to re-spin the patch just for this, but for future reference:
Per the coding guidelines (http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute#Making_Changes) please add { } after if statements, even single-line ones.  Thanks.

This message is automatically generated., Committed to trunk. Congrats on your first patch, Andrew!

I believe this bug also effects 0.22, but this patch doesn't apply as-is. Would you mind checking out the 0.22 branch and uploading a patch that applies against that code? (it's only slightly different), Andrew, if you want examples you can check out the diffs between v23 and v22 patches for HDFS-1505 and HDFS-1921., Patch against 0.22 branch. Testcase is more ugly but idea is the same., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

    , Hudson automated QA only handles patches against trunk.

Confirmed compiles successfully, and new unit test fails before the FSEditLog change, passes after., Resolving this, since it was committed to trunk., This still needs to be committed to 0.22., Committed to v22.  Thanks, Andrew!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-22-branch #70 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-22-branch/70/])
