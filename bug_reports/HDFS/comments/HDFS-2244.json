[Allen, datanode RPC protocols InterDatanodeProtocol and ClientDatanodeProtocol are used rarely. The datanodes for the cluster you have posted may not have seen any activity over Datanode RPC. Could that be the case here?, I'd be surprised, but maybe that is the case.  I've been running teragen and terasort so I'd expect that to trigger something?]
