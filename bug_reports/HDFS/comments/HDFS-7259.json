[Uploaded a patch.
The basic idea is to provide a configurable property "nfs.large.file.upload". It's turned on by default:
1. if client asks to commit non-sequential trunk of data, NFS gateway return success with the hope that client will send the prerequisite writes.
2. if client asks to commit a sequential trunk(means it can be flushed to HDFS), NFS gateway return a special error NFS3ERR_JUKEBOX indicating the client needs to retry. Meanwhile, NFS gateway keeps flush data to HDFS and do sync eventually. 

The reason to let client wait is that, we want the client to wait for the last commit. Otherwise, client thinks file upload finished (e.g., cp command returns success) but NFS could be still flushing staged data to HDFS.
However, we don't know which one is the last commit. We make the assumption that a commit after sequencial writes may be the last., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
