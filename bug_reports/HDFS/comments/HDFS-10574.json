[[~bobhansen] I wrote a test case and test it on Hadoop-trunk and Hadoop-2.7.0. Unfortunately I did not encounter this issue. Have you ever installed Knox in your cluster?, Ah, it appears that my test cluster was running an old version of HDFS.  My reproducer also succeeds on trunk.

Thanks, [~yuanbo], for looking into it and setting me straight.  I apologize for adding to the noise floor.
