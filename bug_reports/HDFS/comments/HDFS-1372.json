[With HADOOP-6938 committed, I verified this test is now passing., Please do not post large portions of the logs into description field of JIRAs. Description needs to be short and self-explanatory; the details of error messages and such should go to a comment ;)

Eli, is there a way to make sure that HADOOP-6938 has fixed this issue and close the JIRA if so?, Confirmed this is fixed on trunk now., To leave a trace in case of future regressions.]
