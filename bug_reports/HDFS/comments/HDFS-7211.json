[[~tlipcon] We just encountered an issue where a DN is being decommissioned with a large number of blocks (10,000s). Those block invalidation requests are inserted into the unordered {{node2blocks}}. Therefore some blocks are "flushed around" in the set and are not invalidated for a long time. Are you aware of an ordered (and lightweight) collection type that we can use? , Maybe LightWeightLinkedSet?]
