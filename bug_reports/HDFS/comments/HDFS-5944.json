[This patch is very simple, if prefix ended with '/', just minus 1 from srclen, so p.charAt(srclen) could handle path correctly., [~zhaoyunjiong], thanks for the patch. It would be nice if you can also add a unit test.

Maybe I missed something, but how could Client C opens file for write after its parent directory is deleted. Do we have another bug here?
{quote}
Client B deleted /XXX/20140206/04_30/
Client C open file /XXX/20140206/04_30/_SUCCESS.slc.log for write
{quote}, {quote}how could Client C opens file for write after its parent directory is deleted{quote}
My bad. Please ignore this part., Upload a unit test for branch-1, which can reproduce the bug. 

Since the error will crash 2NN JVM, you need to run the test like the following to print the 2NN error to console to validate:

$>ant test -Dtest.output=yes -Dtestcase=<testname>
, In branch-1, if the directory is deleted by a FileSystem object (e.g., fs.delete(...)), the ending "/" will be trimmed before the delete request gets to NN. However, as in the uploaded unit test, using DFSClient can send ending "/" to NN to trigger the error.

That is, as long as the HDFS users(e.g., Mapreduce) use FileSystem object, they should not encounter this problem. Comments?, Brandon, thanks for your time to review this patch.
I don't think the user use DFSClient directly.
Even use DistributedFileSystem, we still can send path ending with "/" by passing path like this "/a/b/../".
Because in getPathName, String result = makeAbsolute(file).toUri().getPath() will return "/a/".

About unit test, I'd be happy to add one. I have two questions need your help:
1. Is it enough for just writing a unit test for findLeaseWithPrefixPath?
2. In trunk, there is no TestLeaseManager.java, should I add one?, {quote}1. Is it enough for just writing a unit test for findLeaseWithPrefixPath?{quote}
Please feel free to include the unit test uploaded yesterday. You can also add more test steps, such as using FileSystem object to delete path (e.g., "/a/b/../.") as you mentioned. 
{quote}2. In trunk, there is no TestLeaseManager.java, should I add one?{quote}
You can add the unit test to TestLease.java., Update patches with unit test., Good job in finding and fixing this bug, [~zhaoyunjiong]. 
Would there be multiple trailing "/"  ? If so, removing the last one character may not be enough., Multiple trailing "/" is impossible., +1.
