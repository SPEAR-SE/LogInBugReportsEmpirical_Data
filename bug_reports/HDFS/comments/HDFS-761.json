This message is automatically generated., Not updating the counts seems to be the design intent. At the end of loading edits log, the counts are being updated in FSDirectory.updateCountForINodeWithQuota(). I would like to retain this and not change it., Then does it make sense to make the "ready" check in the beginning of verifyQuotaForRename?, Added the check to verifyQuotaForRename() instead of relying upon the check in verifyQuota()., +1 The patch looks good., -1 overall.
