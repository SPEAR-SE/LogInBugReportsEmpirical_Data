[I took the liberty of editing the description. This is the expected behavior. Not sure what is the bug/solution you are pointing to in this jira?, Closing this jira as Invalid. The behavior in the description is the expected behavior. When storage directories are in inconsistent state, invalid or stale directories are expected to be cleaned manually, before restarting a datanode.

If you disagree, feel free to reopen the jira. Please justify why you think it is a valid jira, when you reopen the jira.]
