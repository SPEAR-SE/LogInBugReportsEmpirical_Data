[I have not seen any build issues on a Trusty-based system.

Try adding the "install" target to your build command. You can also try asking on common-dev@hadoop.apache.org., +1 Will take a look., I have seen similar build failures with the message "Exit code: 137". It always turned out that there is not enough memory. I'm closing this as "not a problem". Please reopen if this still reproduces.]
