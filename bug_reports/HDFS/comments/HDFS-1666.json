Also, it seems that orders of assert parameters was reversed thus the error messages are highly misleading., Bumping it up to Blocker since it fails 0.22 builds as well, I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but no luck. I can't even get log messages out of the test cases because of the obscenely complicated cactus/cargo/tomcat framework.

I'd like to disable the hdfsproxy tests until someone can come along and fix this. Can I get a +1?, I will try asking around and see if anyone knows how to fix it.  Could you hold for a few days?, Here's a patch which disables the tests.

I emailed the dev list a few days ago, and this test has been failing for over a month. I think we should turn off the tests now and try to get to a green build - if someone wants to fix it, they can revert this patch at that time. Does that sound reasonable?, There is another test, TestFileConcurrentReader, which keeps failing.  So we still won't get a green even the hdfsproxy test is disabled.

How about at least we wait until TestFileConcurrentReader is fixed?, +1 for disabling the test for now., +1 to take it off for now. If a maintainer will surface it can be easily switched back on later., Committed the patch to disable the hdfsproxy tests on 0.22 and trunk.

Leaving this open against both versions, though - before 0.22 release we either need to address this or formerly mark hdfsproxy as having known issues in the release notes., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #643 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/643/])
    HDFS-1666. Disable failing hdfsproxy test TestAuthorizationFilter. Contributed by Todd Lipcon
, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #600 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/600/])

    HDFS-1666. Disable failing hdfsproxy test TestAuthorizationFilter. Contributed by Todd Lipcon
, This was committed to trunk., This was deliberately left open since we need to either address theunderlying issue, or mark hdfsproxy as broken in any future release., No longer valid since we're removing hdfsproxy (HDFS-2210).]
