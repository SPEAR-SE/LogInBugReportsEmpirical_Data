[Maybe one simpler message could be "Received an empty response", catching that EOFException before bubbling it up., Attached the patch please review, As i observerd all the callers are using for response processing only,hence changing in utility itself, please review and let me know, \\

This message was automatically generated., Changes are on changing exception message hence no tests included.Trunk failure is not related to patch changes., Thanks Jagadesh, that message change was just a small idea to make it carry slightly more sense. Do you have any ideas also to improve the situation such that users may be able to self-figure out whats going on? I've seen this appear during socket disconnects/timeouts/etc. - but the message it prints is from the software layer instead, which causes confusion., I think it will be very difficult to make out diagnostic message from just an EOF to show to client.

Message can be slightly altered to give a different look, ex: "Unexpected EOF while trying read response" ?

Agree ?, Thanks [~vinayrpet] for your review, The message looks good and opt for all situations . Adding the same., \\

This message was automatically generated., As there is only change in Message, no test cases involved ,[~vinayrpet] ,[~qwertymaniac] ,please review, Sorry on delay here!

Perhaps it could be fixed to:

s/Unexpected EOF while trying read response/Unexpected EOF while trying to read response from server

(With hope that it would get some users to look above it and spot the server/block identifiers to investigate forward.), Thanks [~qwertymaniac] , Updated the message please review , \\
