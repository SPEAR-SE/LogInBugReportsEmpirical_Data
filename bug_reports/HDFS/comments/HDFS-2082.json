[Patch which fixes the issue. I manually verified that the web UI again displays the correct information., Seems reasonable. Would it be possible to add a simple test which just fetches the page and checks for some kind of simple string? See TestFairSchedulerSystem#checkServlet in MR for an example of the sort of simple test I mean., Updated patch which adds a test.

Todd, would you like me to run TestDFSIO as well?, Updated patch which shuts down the mini cluster upon finishing.
