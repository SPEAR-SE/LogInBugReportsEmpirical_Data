thank you.

, 2gschen: afaik, just click "Watching" link in the upper right corner of this page., Linking the two together, There seems to be a lot in this patch that is not in the original.

It looks like you pulled in Time.java so that you could also update GenericTestUtils.waitFor, which is something that is not related to HDFS-3582.  In fact it looks like GenericTestUtils does not need to be updated at all.  Please revert it and Time.java so if we ever do decide to port HDFS-3641 and others it will not be so confusing or difficult.

The same goes for DFSConfigKeys.java.  None of the changes in there are used at all.

Also the isActive method inside FSEditLog.java looks like it can still be marked as private.

Other then that the port looks good.
