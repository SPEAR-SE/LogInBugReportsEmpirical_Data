[There are a couple of problems:

1. The scripts refer to "bin/hadoop-daemons.sh" not "sbin/hadoop-daemons.sh".
2. The secondary namenode should not be started at all since it's not configured to, but the script tries to start it since the test for "0.0.0.0" fails due to a trailing space.

This patch fixes both of these., To ran a pseudo distributed HDFS cluster I ran 

{noformat}
mvn clean package -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests -P-cbuild
{noformat}

from the top level, then from another directory

{noformat}
mkdir hadoop
cd hadoop
tar zxf ~/workspace/hadoop-trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/target/hadoop-hdfs-0.24.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz --strip 1
tar zxf ~/workspace/hadoop-trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/hadoop-common-0.24.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz --strip 1
export HADOOP_COMMON_HOME=$(pwd)
export HADOOP_HDFS_HOME=$(pwd)

cat > $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml  << EOF

This message is automatically generated., +1, the patch looks good to me. I reviewed the code and also tested the script per Tom's instructions, and it worked like a charm.

It might be worth noting somewhere that even with this patch, the start-dfs.sh script will not work without first overlaying the Common and HDFS target directories., > the start-dfs.sh script will not work without first overlaying the Common and HDFS target directories

Yes, this is because the scripts assume that there is a single HADOOP_PREFIX directory containing bin, conf, etc. It might be a good idea to loosen this at some point, but this bug fix isn't the place to do it., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #958 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/958/])
