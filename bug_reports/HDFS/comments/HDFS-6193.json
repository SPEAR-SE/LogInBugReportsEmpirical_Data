[linking to HADOOP-9361 and FS semantics.

Failing on the open if a file is not found is a core expectation of filesystems.

We could optimise any of the web filesystems by not doing that open (e,g, S3, s3n, swift) and waiting for the first seek. But we don't because things expect missing files to not be there.

Interesting that FileSystemContractBaseTest doesn't catch this, [~stevel@apache.org], thanks for following up. 

bq. Interesting that FileSystemContractBaseTest doesn't catch this

FileSystemContractBaseTest does not have a test for {{open}} on a non-exisisting path. Neither did {{TestHftpFileSystem}}. {{TestWebHdfsFileSystemContract.testOpenNonExistFile}} had incorrect implementation that relied on {{read}} to fail.

Note that a seek for WebHdfs/Hftp is a client-only operation as well. Deferring real open to a stream operation is misleading because the application presumes an open stream when issuing a stream operation.

This message is automatically generated., is HftpFileSystem missing from trunk now? Please correct me if I get wrong., Hi [~ozawa], yeah Hftp was recently kicked out with HDFS-5570, Thanks for the pointing, [~jira.shegalov]! Now I could apply your patch against branch-2.4.0. However, some compilation error occurs with the patch.

In HftpFileSystem, RangeHeaderInputStream cannot call the super constructor as follows:
{code}
static class RangeHeaderInputStream extends ByteRangeInputStream {
   RangeHeaderInputStream(RangeHeaderUrlOpener o, RangeHeaderUrlOpener r)
        throws IOException {
      super(o, r, true);
    }
{code}

FileDataServlet: the method ExceptionHandler.toHttpStatus is missing:
{code}
      response.sendError(ExceptionHandler.toHttpStatus(e),
          StringUtils.stringifyException(e));
{code}

Can you check them? Thanks!, Will upload a fixed version shortly., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thank you for updating! +1 for the patch(non-binding).
* Compilation works correctly.
* Confirmed that WebHdfsFileSystem.open() and HftpFileSystem.open() throw FileNotFoundException when files are missing. Test cases covers it., Let's wait for review by HDFS experts., I don't think this is a blocker since hftp / hsftp have been deprecated and been superseded by webhdfs. It looks to me that the performance impact is still up to debate (the same fix has been applied to webhdfs in HDFS-6143, see the comments for the details).

I'm moving it out to unblock 2.4.1. Feel free to move it back you think it is essential for the release., \\
