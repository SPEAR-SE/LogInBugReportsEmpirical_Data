[Hi [~tedyu],

We cannot take the stream lock in pread without introducing some big performance regressions.  See HDFS-6735 for why we stopped taking the lock here... basically, it's because we wanted {{pread()}} to be able to proceed independently of {{read()}}.

Let's make this an {{AtomicBoolean}} instead.  Then, we can just check it with {{AtomicBoolean#get}}.  In {{DFSInputStream#close}}, we can do {{AtomicBoolean#compareAndSet}} to ensure close happens only once, even if there are concurrent calls., Thanks for the suggestion, Colin.

Please take a look at patch v1., {code}
665	    if (!closed.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
666	      DFSClient.LOG.warn("DFSInputStream has been closed already");
666	    }
{code}

We should return here, not keep going
