[Should bufferSize parameter be saved in a field so that we can use it in the createSocketForPipeline() ?
{code}
    sock.setSendBufferSize(HdfsConstants.DEFAULT_DATA_SOCKET_SIZE);
{code}, The value of HdfsConstants.DEFAULT_DATA_SOCKET_SIZE is 128KB, and in DFSClient#create(String, boolean, short, long, Progressable), dfsClientConf.ioBufferSize (default value is 4096) is used as value of buffer size. So I guess the buffer size is used for creating BufferedOutputStream instance? I.e., in DFSOutputStream.DataStreamer#createBlockOutputStream and DFSOutputStream.DataStreamer#transfer, we should use the given buffer size for creating BufferedOutputStream instance., Duplicated with HDFS-4070]
