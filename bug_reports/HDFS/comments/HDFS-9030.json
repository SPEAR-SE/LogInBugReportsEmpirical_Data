[Merging HDFS-9029 into this.

Digging into this today, I realize what an INCREDIBLY short sighted thing we've done.

Basically, libhdfs and libwebhdfs are interchangeable at link time since they expose the exact same APIs.  On the surface, this appears like a great, convinent feature:

* hdfs.h is the same header for both libraries
* API calls are the same so documentation is the same.

However:
* Users CANNOT (effectively) link both libraries in the same program

So your program either does HDFS RPC or WebHDFS REST.  It cannot do both.  Worse, neither library actually exposes all of the APIs that have been declared public.  (I'm looking at you, snapshots).

It might be a blessing in disguise that this hasn't been exposed very widely due to libwebhdfs not actually showing up in the tarballs., I'm leaning towards:

* Making the hdfsX calls webhdfsX calls
* Add the missing routines into webhdfs
* Adding a libwebhdfs2hdfs library that does the interposing for those that still need it.

(Altho for my current project, just go use something else, because this is just a mess.), So even better: libwebhdfs *STILL* has JNI in it.  Which makes it useless., At this point, I'm leaning heavily towards just deprecating this library in branch-2 and removing it from trunk.  It isn't part of the package, it isn't documented, it's missing functionality, and doesn't even meet it's original goal of being pure C.   It's basically a disaster., I've opened HDFS-9047 to kill it. I'll leave this open just in case. ;), libwebhdfs has been removed. closing as won't fix.]
