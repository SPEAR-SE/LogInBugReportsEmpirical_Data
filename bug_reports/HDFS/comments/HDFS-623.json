[Is there any information on the sources of the problem? Was it a fix of some other issue or what?, when we copy the latest common jar file from trunk build and use it with hdfs ant jar-test target fails.

I doubt these two issues which would have caused this.
HDFS-617.
HADOOP-6246

, This could be related to HDFS-385. Can you pl provide more details on how I can reproduce this compilation problem?, To reproduce:
copy the latest trunk builds common jar's to hdfs-trunk lib folder and execute ant jar-test


, I followed ur steps, and it works for me:

svn status lib
M      lib/hadoop-core-test-0.21.0-dev.jar
M      lib/hadoop-core-0.21.0-dev.jar

ant test-jar
