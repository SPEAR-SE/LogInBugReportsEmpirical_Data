[Hi [~linyiqun]

I will work on this and upload the patch.

Can you please assign this to me?

Rahul, Hi [~rahulp], I am planning to assign this JIRA to you. But I found you aren't a contributor of HDFS ann cannot do this assignment. I didn't find a way to add you as a new contributor. Anyone can help or providing doc reference for adding new contributor?, I have added [~rahulp] to the contributor's role and assigned this JIRA to him. You should be able to assign Jira's to yourself after this.

, Thanks [~anu]
