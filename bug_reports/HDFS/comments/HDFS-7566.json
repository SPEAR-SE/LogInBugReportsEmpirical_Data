[What I've found so far:

dfs.https.enable
- Removed in HADOOP-10348

dfs.namenode.edits.journal-plugin.qjournal
- Needs an exception in the unit test.  Can find references in code like:
  DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_EDITS_PLUGIN_PREFIX + ".bookkeeper"
  DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_EDITS_PLUGIN_PREFIX + "." + uriScheme
  DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_EDITS_PLUGIN_PREFIX + ".dummy"

dfs.namenode.logging.level
- Was this ever actually used?

dfs.ha.namenodes.EXAMPLENAMESERVICE
+ Make an exception even though it's not used.

dfs.support.append
- Removed in HDFS-6246
