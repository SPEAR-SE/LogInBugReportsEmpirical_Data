[This is by design. It is the same as setting space quota value smaller than the total sizes of files on existing directories. 
For example, before setting space quota on /noez directory, there is a file of size 6591 bytes. If you set the space quota to 4000 bytes, you will find the same negative value of quota -count output (Replication factor of 3).

{code}, Issue 2 - The negative quota is by design. 
Issue 1 - This is an interesting issue. Mover should not move blocks when storage types quota is exceeded.  , Mover is similar to replication -- it should not care about quota.  Even quota is exceeded, under replicated blocks will still be replicated.  Similarly, mover should keep moving blocks., Thansks [~xyao] and [~szetszwo] for comments..

bq. Issue 1 - This is an interesting issue. Mover should not move blocks when storage types quota is exceeded.

So what is the conclusion, do we need to fix Issue 1??, Thanks [~szetszwo] for providing the context information about Mover. [~archanat], I'm resolving this issue as by design. Let me know if you think it differently.]
