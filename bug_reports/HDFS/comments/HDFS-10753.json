[Hi [~chenfsd]

Just a suggestion, given that these are relatively smaller changes (like in HDFS-10752 as well), I think it might be a good idea to file one jira for several of these suggestions per project? Perhaps one jira for HDFS, one for MAPREDUCE, one for YARN. 

thanks

, Hi [~vrushalic], Thanks for the suggestion! That's fine by me.

I will merge HDFS-10752 and HDFS-10753.
, Yes, sounds good thanks! , Pasting a patch for this jira here:

{code}, Hi, I made the HDFS-10753, HDFS-10749 superceded by HDFS-10752. 

For others(e.g. mapreduce, yarn, hadoop-common), if needed, I will create a jira issue for each project which supercedes every related issues 

Please let me know if you have any comments., Hi [~vrushalic], just want to make sure, I saw the HADOOP-13484 and HADOOP-13485 already in status "Patch Available", for these issues, should I merge them or not?, GitHub user albericliu opened a pull request:
