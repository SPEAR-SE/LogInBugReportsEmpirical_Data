[Hey [~yeshavora], I am not able to reproduce this issue on latest hadoop trunk. Following are some outputs:

{code}
abutala@abutala-vBox:/mnt/hdfs$ mount | grep hdfs
127.0.1.1:/ on /mnt/hdfs type nfs (rw,vers=3,proto=tcp,nolock,addr=127.0.1.1)
abutala@abutala-vBox:/mnt/hdfs$ ls -lh
total 512
-rw-r--r-- 1 abutala supergroup 12M Jul 19 11:36 abc.txt
drwxr-xr-x 3 abutala supergroup  96 Jul 19 12:10 temp
abutala@abutala-vBox:/mnt/hdfs$ cp ~/work/hbase/hbase.tar.gz abc.txt
cp: cannot create regular file `abc.txt': Permission denied
abutala@abutala-vBox:/mnt/hdfs$ cat ~/work/hbase/hbase.tar.gz >> abc.txt
cat: write error: Permission denied
{code}

Am I missing anything? Or perhaps the issue got fixed recently? Let me know if you can still reproduce it. Thank you!, [~abutala], The issue was not tested for trunk. It was tested with Hadoop 2.2.0. [~brandonli], do you have any idea if this Jira is fixed recently?, [~yeshavora], I think this problem is fixed by HDFS-6411. Please verify. Thanks!, I believe this problem has been fixed by HDFS-6411. The error message is the same now:

$ cat namenode-metrics.out >> /tmp/mnt/abcd
cat: stdout: Permission denied

$ touch /tmp/mnt/t
touch: /tmp/mnt/t: Permission denied
