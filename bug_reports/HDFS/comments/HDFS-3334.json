      case SEEK:
        if (in != null) {
          in.close();
        }
        in = openInputStream();
        status = StreamStatus.NORMAL;
        break;
{code}
I think the SEEK case can be simplified as above.  Otherwise, the are unnecessary status transitions: SEEK -> CLOSE -> SEEK -> NORMAL., Sure, I simplified it.  I had originally done it that way, but thought it would be better to not directly manipulate the underlying stream outside of the method intended to do the delegation., +1 patch looks good.  Since the change is minor, I will run some test and then commit the patch without waiting for Jerkins again., I have committed this.
