[I think Datanode is supposed to remove the read only directory from its list of data directories and continue with the rest.
, The problem is that the constructor of BlcokReceiver does not check if the disk is readonly or not as what is done in receiveChunk when an IOException is thrown., Although there is a check in BlockReceiver<init> now for disk errors upon IOE, it seems to be limited to errors that only go like:

"Possible disk error on file creation:"

I guess this is hence still not covered today.

Should we get rid of this check, and simply issue disk error checks each time we plainly hit an IOE? Other places do this directly, but perhaps for the constructor here its too expensive to., Fairly confident this has been fixed.]
