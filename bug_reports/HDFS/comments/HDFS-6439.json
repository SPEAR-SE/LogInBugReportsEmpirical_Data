[I've uploaded a file for the captured network trace: mount-nfs-requests.pcapng
I used root user on a VM as the NFS client. The VM has the OS CentOS 6.4 x64. The VM has NFS gateway export mounted on ~/tmp already:

start capture-
1. first umount the mount point ~/tmp
2. mount the hdfs export again
end capture.

In the trace, we can see that the NFS client used privileged port for most calls except that sometimes it uses non-privileged port to do MOUNT NULL and NFS NULL calls.  
, Here's a preliminary patch (not intended for commit) that changes the port monitoring to not be used in the case of the NULL procedure.

Brandon, does this approach look correct to you? Could you perhaps re-run your test with this patch applied?

In the patch, we return a RPC response(no NFS response encapsulated) with error status. I suspect traditional NFS server returns an NFS response with error status. There is nothing I can find from the protocol spec for which kind of response we should return, just a RPC head or an NFS response. I guess this is up to the implementation. 

I am trying some tests with UNIX NFS server to see how it responds. From that, we may be able to tell what the most NFS clients except., By default Linux NFS server denies request from nonsecure port. I've collected the network trace while I tried to mount a Linux export from a MacOS NFS client.  Since MacOS NFS client uses nonsecure port by default, the mount request failed with error "Operation not permitted". 

I've uploaded the trace file linux-nfs-disallow-request-from-nonsecure-port.pcapng. From wireshark(filter "rpc"), we can see the NFS GETATTR request failed with NFS3ERR_PERM.

To have the same behavior, we can add one more check in RpcProgramNfs3#checkAccessPrivilege: if request is from non-secureport and port monitoring is enabled, we return false. This change requires ChannelHandlerContext to be passed from handleInternal() to each request handler such as read()/write()/getattr()....

This message is automatically generated., Definitely don't let me hold you up if you'd like to work on a patch, [~brandonli]. It'd be much appreciated, and I'd be happy to review it., Thank you, [~atm]. I've rebased your patch and uploaded a new one.
Basically, the new patch does the port monitoring in each NFS handlers. If we deny the request at RPC level, some NFS client might keep sending the same NFS request(e.g., GETATTR). For mountd, it only does the check for MNT request since some utilities (e.g., showmount) sends EXPORT request using non-privileged port which we don't want to fail. 
I also used the opportunity to do a cleanup for the NFS3Interface. 

Port monitor is by default disabled to not make the gateway easier to use, especially for Windows/MacOS NFS client and developers. 

Please review.

This message is automatically generated., The unit test failure is not introduced by this patch., Latest patch looks pretty good to me, and I agree that the test failure is not due to this patch - it's due to a quirk of the way test-patch chooses to build the native libs or not.

Two small comments:

# It's fine to change the name of the config setting, but please add a deprecation delta for the old one so that this change will be backward compatible in that respect.
# The documentation addition is using the wrong name for the config setting. You need to remove the leading "dfs."

+1 once these are addressed.

Thanks, Brandon., Thank you, Aaron, for the review!
