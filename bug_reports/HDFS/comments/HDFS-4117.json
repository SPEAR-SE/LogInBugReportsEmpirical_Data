[changed "(checkpointAge > checkpointPeriod * 1000) to "(checkpointAge > checkpointPeriod), Not sure this is right -- checkpointPeriod is in seconds, so we have to multiply by 1000 to compare against the checkpointAge which is in milliseconds, right?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The code treats checkpointAge "as if it were in milliseconds" because it *is* in milliseconds.

Check the documentaton for {{Time.now()}} and {{File#lastModified}}, used to calculate checkpointAge.
{code}
  /**
   * Current system time.  Do not use this to calculate a duration or interval
   * to sleep, because it will be broken by settimeofday.  Instead, use
   * monotonicNow.
   * @return current time in msec.
   */
  public static long now() {
    return System.currentTimeMillis();
  }
{code}

So basically the code does not need to be changed.

To avoid this kind of confusion in the future, it would be a good idea to add a comment specifying that {{dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period}} is in seconds., I agree - the code is indeed correct as-is.]
