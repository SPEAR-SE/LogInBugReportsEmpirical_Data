[Attaching the patch. 

Simple fix, the test fails because a line ending does not match.

Also adding timeout annotations to all test cases. testFederation takes consistently 254s to run on my machine, so I set the timeout to 300., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi, Ivan.  This patch for fixing the newline issue looks good, but I found it quite strange that {{TestGetConf#testFederation}} took so long.  In fact, the 300s timeout used in this patch wasn't even sufficient time for me.  On my Windows VM, it takes more like 400s.  When running on Mac, this test completes in less than 1 second.

Digging into the issue, it appears to be a problem of slow response trying to resolve an unknown host name.  The test generates multiple bogus host names of the form nn1, nn2, nn3, etc.  Each call to {{TestGetConf#setupAddress}} ends up iterating through each of 10 such addresses, ultimately calling {{InetAddress#getByName}}.  The same thing happens again later for each call to {{TestGetConf#verifyAddresses}}.  On Mac, this comes back nearly instantaneously with host not found.  On my Windows VM, each host name takes ~2.25s before responding with host not found.  Simply running "ping nn1" on the command prompt confirms this behavior.  Do you know if we're experiencing a Windows network misconfiguration?

If the solution isn't obvious, then I suggest that we remove the timeout from {{testFederation}} for now and file a follow-up jira to address the test sluggishness later.
, Attaching updated patch that addresses Chris' comment., Thanks a lot Chris for testing this out on Mac. I agree, we should understand why the test is taking so long. I attached the updated patch. testFederation now consistently fails on Windows with a timeout, so we won't forget about the problem. Will file a Jira and investigate the timeout problem separately. , +1 for the current patch.  Thank you, Ivan., bq.

Thanks Chris. I also looked deeper into the issue. I don't think we can do anything here, and actually, I am not sure if this as a problem. It should be OK for unknown host resolution to take a few seconds (please correct me if needed, I am no expert here :)). I have an idea of how to fix this such that the test runs faster on Windows, but will do this via a separate patch to avoid randomizing this fix., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

I agree.  Mostly it's just an annoyance that it makes the test run longer.  Thanks!
, I have committed this.  Thanks, Ivan!
