I did some back of the envelope math when implementing txids, and
determined that overflow is not ever going to happen... A "busy" namenode
does 1000 write transactions/second (2^10). MAX_LONG is 2^63. So, we can
run for 2^63 seconds. A year is about 2^25 seconds. So, at 1k tps, you can
run your namenode for 2^(63-10-25) = 268 million years.

Hadoop is great software and I'm sure it will be around for years to come,
but if it's still running in 268 million years, that will be a pretty
depressing rate of technological progress!

After 200 million years, spacemen manage the earth, they also know Hadoop,
but they cannot restart it, after a hard debug they find the txid has been
overflowed for many years.
