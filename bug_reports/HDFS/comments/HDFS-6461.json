[Hey James, nice find here. One review comment though, I think we should also switch the now -> monotonicNow lower down where the duration is actually computed, else this will be wonky. Looks fine besides that though, thanks for the contribution!, Thanks for the review, updated the patch., Hey, one more real nitty comment: we like to keep lines to max 80 characters. I use this Eclipse formatter (works in IDEA too) to do it for me: https://github.com/cloudera/blog-eclipse/blob/master/hadoop-format.xml

Another minor comment, we also typically name our patches something like "HDFS-6461.2.patch" with a version number so it's easier to download the right one.

This message is automatically generated., I ran these locally, and TestBPOfferService flaked 2 out of 6 runs. I filed HDFS-6470 with this, but I think both failures are unrelated to this patch.

+1 LGTM, will commit shortly., Committed to trunk and branch-2, thanks for the contribution James!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5625 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5625/])
