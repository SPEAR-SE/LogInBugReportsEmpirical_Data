[up, good, This patch includes:
1., This patch includes:
1.GetNameServiceUris from config in DFSUtil.java adds functions to ignore the "/" in the end of uris.

2.Add corresponding test to make sure that an HA URI and the default URI whose difference is ending with or without "/" doesn't result in multiple entries being returned.

Actually speaking,this problem comes from my own not so well config. I use "hdfs://haCluster/" for "fs.defaultFS" in core-site.xml. I can easily avoid this problem by make this config value to be "hdfs://haCluster", but someone else may give the similar value, so I propose this patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
