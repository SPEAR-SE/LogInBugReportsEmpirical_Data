This message is automatically generated., I can't re-produce this bug on my local box. The log showed RPC client was using "SIMPLE" authentication, which is not the expected setting. The test tried to use a static initialization block to set the authentication to Kerberos. Apparently, it failed on Hudson. By doing that inside @Before method, it seems working., A patch to make krb5.conf available for unit tests. I took the easy way of copying krb5.conf from common to hdfs. If you have a better way of doing it, please let me know., TestBlockToken sometimes fails because of HADOOP-6913. We need to make krb5.conf available for this test. Previously, it wasn't needed because we never actually did initialize KerberosName class with security turned on due to the circular initialization bug in HADOOP-6913., h1284-03.patch is ready to be submitted as soon as HADOOP-6913 is committed., -1 overall.
