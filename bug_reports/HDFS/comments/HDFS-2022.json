[It sounds reasonable for the bin-package depend on the compile-c++-libhdfs.
, Modifies binary target to depend on compile-c++-libhdfs target., Nit: perhaps rename "set-compile-c++-flag" "set-c++-libhdfs" since it just sets islibhdfs.

Can we remove "check-c++-libhdfs" entirely? It looks like it doesn't do anything since it's used in the depends attribute of the target, and the if attribute already checks islibhdfs.
, Rename: {noformat}set-compile-c++-flag{noformat} to {noformat}set-c++-libhdfs{noformat}

Remove {noformat}check-c++-libhdfs{noformat}, as long as libhdfs is defined, then it will compile libhdfs libraries., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

TestBackupNode failure is unrelated. This doesn't need a test since it's a build change. I built locally and verified the binary tarball contains libhdfs., I've committed this.
