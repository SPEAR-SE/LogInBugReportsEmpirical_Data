Findbugs warnings are not related to this patch., patched a secure hadoop 1.1.0 deploy with the patch and now the secondary namenode is able to log in.

Let me know and i can log a different jira for it., +1, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3036 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3036/])
