This message is automatically generated., I ran this test a few times and it didn't repro, so I think it's a new flake. I filed HDFS-5912 to track that.

Will commit shortly based on Colin's +1 though, thanks Colin., Thanks for fixing this, Andrew.  Thanks also to Tassapol for finding and reporting the bug., Committed to trunk and branch-2. And yes, thanks Tassapol for the nice find!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5131 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5131/])
