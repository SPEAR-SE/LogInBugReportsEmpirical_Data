[Found two issues:

1. HttpFSAuthenticationFilter#getConfiguration doesn't set the AUTH_TYPE property to the name of the corresponding auth handler class; 
2.  We need to set the TOKEN_KIND in HttpFSAuthenticationFilter , I choose to do it in HttpFSAuthenticationFilter#getConfiguration.

Submitted patch 001 to address them, and verified that it works in a real cluster.

Hi [~tucu00] and [~asuresh], 

Many thanks for the help when I investigated this issue. Would you please taking a look at the patch I just submitted? Thanks!

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~tucu00],

Thanks again for your earlier help. Would you please help taking a look at rev 003? Thanks much!
, [~yzhangal], thanks for looking into this. After digging a bit in the code, I think the intended way for this to work is that HTTPFS authentication filter should do the following in its {{getConfiguration()}} method (KMS does exactly this):

{code}
    String authType = props.getProperty(AUTH_TYPE);
    if (authType.equals(PseudoAuthenticationHandler.TYPE)) {
      props.setProperty(AUTH_TYPE, PseudoDelegationTokenAuthenticationHandler.class.getName());
    } else if (authType.equals(KerberosAuthenticationHandler.TYPE)) {
      props.setProperty(AUTH_TYPE, KerberosDelegationTokenAuthenticationHandler.class.getName());
    }
    props.setProperty(DelegationTokenAuthenticationHandler.TOKEN_KIND, WebHdfsConstants.WEBHDFS_TOKEN_KIND.toString());
{code}, Hi [~tucu00],

Thanks for looking into.

If you look at rev 003, you can see that I exactly did that, except I I introduced some code sharing. Would you please take a look? Thanks a lot.
, I'll look. BTW, a workaround until there is a release with this fix is adding the following to the {{httpfs-site.xml}}:

{code}
  <property>
    <name>httpfs.authentication.type</name>
    <value>org.apache.hadoop.security.token.delegation.web.KerberosDelegationTokenAuthenticationHandler</value>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>httpfs.authentication.delegation-token.token-kind</name>
    <value>WEBHDFS delegation</value>
  </property>
{code}, Many thanks [~tucu00]! 

Good to know this workaround, and hope we can commit the patch soon!

, HI [~tucu00],

Thanks for your help earlier, would you please help doing a review here? thanks.
, Thanks for the patch [~yzhangal]

The patch looks good to me.
I understand unit testing this might be non-trivial. Can you please describe the manual testing you've done to confirm things are fine.
+1 pending that, Many thanks for looking into [~asuresh]!

I tested in real cluster with latest HttpFSAuthenticationFilter to see the exception stack reported here. And I tested that the fix works. (with the Foo.java provided in the jira description.)

I also tested plain httpfs with curl command, to see that it works before and after the fix.
, Created/Committed HADOOP-12103 for the hadoop-common portion of the change. 

Submitted rev004 for the hdfs portion here.
