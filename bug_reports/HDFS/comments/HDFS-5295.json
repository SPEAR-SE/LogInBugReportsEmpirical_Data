[What does the NN log show?, I believe that this is due to when canceling the token, the tokenrenewer gets the wrong address., [~wheat9] you are right that the cancellation call is using the wrong URI.

This patch includes porting remaining changes from HDFS-3461 to use a different token kind for hsftp and wrap delegation token fetcher connections with doAs(). I verified the fix on a single-node secure cluster with https.

I haven't looked at your patch for HDFS-5392 yet, will do so and we can update this patch to make your refactoring easier if needed.
