[Hudson QA has been dead recently, but ran this manually:
    [junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.TestBlockRecovery
    [junit] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 3.676 sec
(this is on a machine where a DN is running, where it failed previously), +1 I just tested this and it fixes the problem I was seeing., I've just committed this. Thanks Todd!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #643 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/643/])
