[- The command `bash -c groups` is used to obtain group information and the NameNode cannot be started if group information is not available.

- We certainly should have some better error messages., I have a similar problem running hadoop in the Sun Grid Engine, but this occurs when I'm using the CLI.  It is as (Nicholas) said, that the command `groups` fails.  In SGE, you get assigned an effective gid when your task submission runs, which doesn't map to a name.  I've created a patch which uses only real gid's and ignores effective ones.  Ultimately it uses `id -rgn` instead of `groups`

        at org.apache.hadoop.security.UnixUserGroupInformation.login(UnixUserGroupInformation.java:250), Replaces the `groups` command for getting groups names with `id -rgn` which uses only real groups, ignoring effective id's., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., {{id -rgn}} should be {{id -rGn}}

After the replacement, it works for Cygwin and GNU/Linux but not sure about Solaris and Mac., bq. id -rgn should be id -rGn

So Hudson can apply the patch, could you generate it from the root? It should apply cleanly with {{patch \-p0 < _file_}}, Fixed indirectly via HADOOP-4656's change set. The 'id' command is now used instead of 'groups' when looking up user memberships.]
