[I believe the change is truly as simple as changing to a read lock.

The lease manager methods are synchronized and other callers into the lease manager are under the write lock.  My main concern was issues with the lease monitor thread but it too is acquiring the fsn write lock.  There should not be race conditions., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., +1. Because of the synchronizations in LeaseManager, it won't make lease renewals to be concurrent. However, switching to read locking allows other read ops to be served. Since fsn write locking is disruptive to NN's parallelism and the lease renewal is one of the most frequently called write ops, this change will certainly improve the performance of heavily loaded NNs., I've committed this to branch-2 and trunk. , SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4924 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4924/])
