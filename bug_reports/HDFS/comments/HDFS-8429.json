[[~cmccabe]  Should we stop DN in this condition?
, It's very surprising that you managed to run out of memory there.  The number of readable file descriptors is unlikely to be more than a few thousand at most, and therefore you failed to allocate a < 4kb memory region.  Either that, or you somehow got a very large number of readable file descriptors all at once for some reason.  We could cache this memory to avoid doing repeated malloc/free cycles, but I am surprised that this is an issue.  I suspect that even if this is fixed, you will have many other unrelated issues that will make the system unusable if memory is truly exhausted.

{code}
JNIEXPORT jobject JNICALL
Java_org_apache_hadoop_net_unix_DomainSocketWatcher_00024FdSet_getAndClearReadableFds(
JNIEnv *env, jobject obj)
{
...
done:
  free(carr);
  if (jthr) {
    (*env)->DeleteLocalRef(env, jarr);
    jarr = NULL;
  }
  return jarr;
}
{code}

This should be calling {{(*env)->Throw(env, jthr)}}, Colin, thank you for the great comments.  In this case, I think the bottom line is that the death of the watcher thread should not block other threads and the client side should be indicated to fall through to other ways as quick as possible.
I created a patch trying to resolve the blocking. Besides that, I also changed the native getAndClearReadableFds method to throw exception as Colin mentioned.  Please feel free to post your thoughts and comments. Thank you., Test following cases  : TestDomainSocket,TestDomainSocketWatcher,TestParallelShortCircuitRead,TestFsDatasetCacheRevocation,TestFatasetCacheRevocation,TestScrLazyPersistFiles,TestParallelShortCircuitReadNoChecksum,TestDFSInputStream,TestBlockReaderFactory,TestParallelUnixDomainRead,TestParallelShortCircuitReadUnCached,TestBlockReaderLocalLegacy,TestPeerCache,TestShortCircuitCache,TestShortCircuitLocalRead,TestBlockReaderLocal,TestParallelShortCircuitLegacyRead,TestTracingShortCircuitLocalRead,TestEnhancedByteBufferAccess, \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks.  We shouldn't need to modify {{DomainSocketWatcher#add}} and {{DomainSocketWatcher#remove}}, since the finally block clears {{toAdd}} and {{toRemove}} prior to calling {{signalAll}}.  The modifications to the finally block look reasonable.  I think we are going to need a unit test for this as well.  Perhaps simply send an interrupt to a thread in the unit test., Yes, the modification of DomainSocketWatcher#add and DomainSocketWatcher#remove is not needed.  I changed the patch accordingly and added a unit test case as suggested.  The code of the test case is almost borrowed from the testStress() in the same file. Thank you., Tested cases include TestParallelShortCircuitLegacyRead, TestParallelShortCircuitRead, TestParallelShortCircuitReadNoChecksum, TestParallelShortCircuitReadUnCached, TestShortCircuitCache, TestShortCircuitLocalRead, TestShortCircuitShm, TemporarySocketDirectory, TestDomainSocket, TestDomainSocketWatcher, \\

This message was automatically generated., One thing that I am concerned about is that we could double-close something in toAdd if the code fails in this block:
{code}
            if (!(toAdd.isEmpty() && toRemove.isEmpty())) {
              // Handle pending additions (before pending removes).
              for (Iterator<Entry> iter = toAdd.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {
                Entry entry = iter.next();
                DomainSocket sock = entry.getDomainSocket();
                Entry prevEntry = entries.put(sock.fd, entry);
                Preconditions.checkState(prevEntry == null,
                    this + ": tried to watch a file descriptor that we " +
                    "were already watching: " + sock);
                if (LOG.isTraceEnabled()) {
                  LOG.trace(this + ": adding fd " + sock.fd);
                }
                fdSet.add(sock.fd);
                iter.remove();
              }
{code}

to prevent that, let's move the iter.remove() in this block up to right after the {{Entry entry = iter.next();}}.

+1 once that's done, Tested cases include TestParallelShortCircuitLegacyRead, TestParallelShortCircuitRead, TestParallelShortCircuitReadNoChecksum, TestParallelShortCircuitReadUnCached, TestShortCircuitCache, TestShortCircuitLocalRead, TestShortCircuitShm, TemporarySocketDirectory, TestDomainSocket, TestDomainSocketWatcher, Colin, thank you for pointing out this issue.  I've changed and uploaded the patch accordingly., \\
