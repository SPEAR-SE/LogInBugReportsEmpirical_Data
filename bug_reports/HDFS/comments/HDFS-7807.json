This message is automatically generated., Hi Colin.  This looks good.  A few small comments:

# {{round_up_to_power_of_2}} does not return a power of 2 for i == 0.  However, we don't need it to, because we separately enforce {{HTABLE_MIN_SIZE}} of 4.  Maybe just drop a quick comment here to prevent confusion?
# On Windows, the compiler spews a bunch of type cast and loss of precision warnings on the test code.  This is really just a side effect of manually setting void pointer values to stub the keys and values for the tests.  I think it's acceptable to stifle the warnings by adding the following right before {{main}}:
{code}
// Disable type cast and loss of precision warnings, because the test manipulates
// void* values manually on purpose.
#ifdef WIN32
#pragma warning(disable: 4244 4306)
#endif
{code}

Thanks!, Thanks for the review, Chris.

bq. round_up_to_power_of_2 does not return a power of 2 for i == 0. However, we don't need it to, because we separately enforce HTABLE_MIN_SIZE of 4. Maybe just drop a quick comment here to prevent confusion?

Hmm, good call.  Let me just add a special case for i == 0 so that the function does what it says.  Always good to keep things simple, and this doesn't need to be super-optimized since it only runs once. :)

thanks, added, +1 for patch 002 pending Jenkins.  I verified that the compiler warnings on Windows are gone.  Thanks, Colin!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
