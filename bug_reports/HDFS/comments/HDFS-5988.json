[{{FSImageFormat#Loader}} was incorrectly basing the decision to populate the {{FSDirectory#inodeMap}} based on if the old fsimage layout version supported inodes. We only see the error with the new PB-based image, since it iterates through {{inodeMap}}, while the old fsimage saver would traverse the directory structure instead.

I also added a bunch of trace/debug logging to OIV, which was helpful in tracking down this issue. Trust me, lot of effort for a one-line fix :), Hi Andrew, I think you're right: getLayoutVersion() returns the layout version of the old fsimage, but we should update the current inode map any way.
