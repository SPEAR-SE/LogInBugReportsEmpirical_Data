[The long usage does mention the -replication parameter.  The problem is limited to just the short usage.  This was probably just a minor oversight from HDFS-5358., Here is a trivial patch to update the short usage string.  I also updated testCacheAdminConf.xml so that it tries passing -replication.  [~andrew.wang] or [~cmccabe], does this look good?, +1 thanks Chris, Thanks, Andrew.  I've committed this to the HDFS-4949 branch.]
