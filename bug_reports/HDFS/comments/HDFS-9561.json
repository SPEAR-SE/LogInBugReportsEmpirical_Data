[Thanks for reporting this Kihwal. It seems {{addDatanode2ExistingPipeline}} has logic to process last packet in a block:
{code}
    } else if (stage == BlockConstructionStage.PIPELINE_CLOSE
        || stage == BlockConstructionStage.PIPELINE_CLOSE_RECOVERY) {
      //pipeline is closing
      return;
{code}

Did you see this error in tests / production?, {{recoverClose()}} itself works fine. If a block is already finalized, its gen stamp is bumped up and another IBR is sent to the NN. This happens when the client didn't get an ack for the very last "end of block" empty packet. 

If the client wrote everything but didn't get the second to the last ack (actual last packet containing real data) for example, the data packet and the end of block packet will be resent after recovering pipeline.  If the client decides to add more nodes to the pipeline at this point, there can be a problem.  If the existing nodes actually finalized the block, block copy will fail because it is not in the rbw state.]
