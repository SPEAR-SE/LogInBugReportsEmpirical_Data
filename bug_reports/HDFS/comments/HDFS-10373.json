[And I find the RpcQueue and RpcAvgTime is very normal.


, Hello [~piaoyu zhang].  This doesn't look like a bug.  If ZKFC cannot contact its peer NameNode for a successful health check RPC, then an HA failover is the expected behavior.  This looks like an operational problem in this environment that needs further investigation.  "Connection reset by peer" means the remote end (the NameNode) closed out the socket before sending the expected response data.  I recommend looking at the NameNode logs to see if anything unusual happened during the timeframe of the HA failover.  If you need further assistance, then consider sending an email to user@hadoop.apache.org.  I hope this helps., Thank you very much  [~cnauroth].  I  will  sending an email to user@hadoop.apache.org.  I wonder to konw i set the network config right for the namenode. I have no  experience in operating system network.  
By the way is it we can use the  hdfs-audit.log by real time parse to see there has the  abnormal job? Thank you once again]
