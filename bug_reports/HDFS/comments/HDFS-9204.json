[The v0 patch:
# Calls the {{DatanodeDescriptor#incrementPendingReplicationWithoutTargets}} when {{ReplicationWork}} is constructed.
# Renames {{PendingReplicationWithoutTargets}} to {{pendingReplicationWithoutTargets}}
# In unit test, asserts that {{pendingReplicationWithoutTargets}} should be non-negative., The patch looks good to me. Some minors:
# We can add an assertion here to make sure there is exactly one element in srcNodes.
{code}
getSrcNodes()[0].incrementPendingReplicationWithoutTargets();
{code}
# We can use Whitebox to access {{pendingReplicationWithoutTargets}} instead of changing its access label.

+1 after addressing the comments., Thanks [~jingzhao] for useful comments. The v1 patch addresses above comments., Thanks Jing for noticing this and Mingliang for the work. I might have overwritten the HDFS-7128 in git merge., \\
