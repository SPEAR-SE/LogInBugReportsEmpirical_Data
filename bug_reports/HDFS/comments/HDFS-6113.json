[Hi Fengdong, thanks for testing. But hadoop 2.3 does not support rolling upgrade... And HA upgrade support only starts from 2.4. Also, please check the document for rolling upgrade detailed steps., [~jingzhao],  I know RU is start from 2.4, but HDFS-5535 has been merged with the trunk.
my target version is built from trunk, but, do you mean,  both the new and the old version should all support rolling upgrade? , continue above, if your answer is yes, then we'd better add some addtional text in the HDFS-5778, [~szetszwo] , do you think so? , Live upgrades from 2.x to trunk is not supported.  This has nothing to do with the rolling upgrade feature.  Whenever there is incompatible changes, live upgrades may not work.

The rolling upgrade feature provides a safe mechanism to upgrade or downgrade and also minimizes impact on service and data availability while doing live upgrades. In order to take advantage of it, both new & old version of software must have this feature. Also, the two version should be compatible. For more details on the compatibility between versions, please refer to the design documentation of HDFS-5535., > ... then we'd better add some addtional text in the HDFS-5778, ...

For the user guide, it is only available in the new version so that I think there should be very little confusion -- users running an old version software should not expect a new feature described in the new version software documentation working in the old version., Based on Kihwal and Nicholas's comments, let's close this jira first. Fengdong, thanks for the testing, and please feel free to open new jiras if you think there are other issues.]
