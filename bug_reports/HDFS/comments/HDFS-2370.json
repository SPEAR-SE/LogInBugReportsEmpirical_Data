[Rajit it is working for me.
 
when the distcp code runs it tries to add the $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-tools-0.20.205.0.jar to the class path and that is where distcp code is. Can you check if the hadoop tools jar is present under your HADOOP_HOME

If you find it can you run the following command


jar tvf $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-tools-0.20.205.0.jar | grep -i distcp and see if the distcp classes are in the jar.


If you do not find the hadoop tools jar check your build to see if it generated the tools jar or not., Hi Arpit, 
Thanks , I am facing this issue with 0.23, for .20.205 distcp is working fine., Just found DistCp is moved to $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/lib/hadoop-mapreduce-tools.jar in .23. So probably build and deploy needs some changes so that classpath includes $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/lib/hadoop-mapreduce-tools.jar, Hi Rajit,

Distcp command will run as Mapreduce job. 
I remember in 22 branch this class was present in mapreduce project. 
Did you check from Mapreduce project to run this command?


Thanks
Uma, Thanks Uma, I will check on that, As Uma mentioned this is a general problem with hadoop-0.21 and beyond.

bin/hadoop is in Hadoop Common and we need to ensure we deploy correctly so that MapReduce jars are in the CLASSPATH., Thanks Arun, with a little change in deployment [ creating softlink of $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/lib/hadoop-mapreduce-tools.jar to a place where from CLASSPATH picks up all the jar ] resolved the issue., As the resolution is deployment related , I am closing this bug]
