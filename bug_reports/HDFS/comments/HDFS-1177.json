This message is automatically generated., +1, although we may as well delete that previous, commented out version of ivy as well.  Common's already been moved to this version; we should open a corresponding JIRA for MR.  It's best to have all the kids using the same toys., Comment is removed. Also, Ivy 2.1 is there for some time, so I took the liberty to make this to be upgraded to the official 2.1 instead of a RC1.
Will open similar JIRA for MR and Common because the latter still has 2.1.0-rc1 for Ivy version., Although the change in patch is insignificant I'd prefer to verify it once more. The review is still valid though., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
