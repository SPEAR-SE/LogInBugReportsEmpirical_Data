[Updates the versions to:

commons-logging = 1.1.1
commons-logging-api = 1.1
aspectj = 1.6.5, +1, I just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #123 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/123/])
    . Upgrade some libraries to be consistent with common and 
mapreduce. (omalley)
, As I've meant elsewhere the such called inconsistency of AspectJ libraries was caused by the MapReduce's contrib project's wrongful use of newer jar version, which was _inconsistent_ with other subprojects in the first place., Integrated in Hdfs-Patch-h5.grid.sp2.yahoo.net #127 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hdfs-Patch-h5.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/127/])
