[I can't get it to fail locally, but here are some fixups which might fix it:
- switch to making the namedir inside the build target dir instead of /tmp
- switch to ephemeral ports for the test case that has been failing
- add missing NameNode.stop calls

, Eli, can you add link to where this test is failing. I do not seem to find at least in precommit builds failures of this test?, Google "hdfs TestValidateConfigurationSettings", turns up lots of examples, recent ones are  HDFS-3120, HDFS-3094, HDFS-2834.., Cool.
