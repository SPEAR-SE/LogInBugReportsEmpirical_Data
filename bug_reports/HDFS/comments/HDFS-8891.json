This message was automatically generated., Thanks for working on this, Yong! Agree we should keep the srcs order. For the fix, maybe we only need to replace "HashSet" to "LinkedHashSet"?, Thanks [~jingzhao] for review.
Upload 2th path base on [~jingzhao]'s comment. But also need to change UT code., \\

, Does this issue exist in 2.6.x? Should this be backported to branch-2.6?, Hi [~chris.douglas] and [~jingzhao], shall we cherry-pick this fix to 2.6.4 as well? Thanks!, bq. shall we cherry-pick this fix to 2.6.4 as well?

Yes, it [looks like|https://git1-us-west.apache.org/repos/asf?p=hadoop.git;a=blob;f=hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/FSNamesystem.java;h=bd4f555110f9abdd4583041a4e7c8f0670cdc844;hb=branch-2.6#l2039] this is also in branch-2.6., bq. shall we cherry-pick this fix to 2.6.4 as well?
No. I don't think this fix should be cherry-picked to 2.6.4 because this bug is not in branch-2.6., The regression test passes in branch-2.6. Attaching a regression-test-only-patch for branch-2.6.

I looked into the source code and I don't see the srcs are into {{HashMap}} and then converted to an array in branch-2.6. In branch-2.6, the order or the srcs is kept., Akira is right; this isn't in 2.6, Thanks Chris. Removing target version 2.6.4., Thanks [~ajisakaa] and [~chris.douglas] for confirmation.]
