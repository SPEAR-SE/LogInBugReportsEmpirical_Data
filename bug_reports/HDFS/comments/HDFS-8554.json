[Here is a patch correcting the 2 problems:
# The test code built the test data directories using string concatenation.  It used {{File.separator}}, but at this point, {{test.build.data}} has forward slashes instead of back slashes.  Passing through a {{File}} instance converts the slashes.  Then, calling {{toURI}} gives a result in URI format, which avoids spurious warnings in the logs about not following proper URI syntax.
# The test works by unpacking a tarball containing blocks from an HDFS version before the use of block ID-based layout.  On Windows, we don't call the {{tar}} utility and instead unpack tarballs in Java code.  {{FileUtil#unpackEntries}} was not coded to be aware of hard links, so it would incorrectly handle them by creating a 0-byte file., Patch LGTM +1, (non binding)., \\
