[I notice one comment of isGoodBlockCandidate() in Balancer: 
{noformat}
"3. doing the move does not reduce the number of racks that the block has"
{noformat}
Does this constraint looks too strong so that slightly in-consistence with BlockPlacementPolicyDefault? In BlockPlacement, I think we only care if some replicas are crossing the rack.  , > Does this constraint looks too strong so that slightly in-consistence with BlockPlacementPolicyDefault?

Yes, Balancer has a stronger constraint.  Let's keep it like this so that it can easily support a different BlockPlacementPolicy., Resolving as not-a-problem.  Please feel free to reopen if you disagree.
