[I am not sure, how this is related to BK here. Please select the appropriate project.
For issue clarification, look at the API categorization in HDFS-2393, which are marked as idempotent., Uma,failure reason is that create file marked as not idempotent.

org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolPB.ClientNamenodeProtocolTranslatorPB.create. Not retrying because the invoked method is not idempotent, and unable to determine whether it was invoked


here is not related to BK.

log:

Not retrying because the invoked method is not idempotent, and unable to determine whether it was invoked

when client create file,the client will connect the first NameNode,but client don't connect to the first NameNode,because machine of first NameNode is shutdown.the create function mark as not idempotent,and create file op don't retry.so the create file op is failure. I think that when client don't connect to namenode,not idempotent will be retry. do you think,uma?, this issue is hdfs issue., [~ewenpower] if it was an hdfs issue, should it be moved to hdfs project?, Create API did not mark as idempotent. That is working as per the design here. For your ref: HDFS-2393, Also look at the discussion in mailing list recently related this: [see|http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-user/201211.mbox/%3CCABbGW3w7nH+c5o_mOu7zp=+Acx-wtp4xXnv+YfZeN3C71v8ZCw@mail.gmail.com%3E], Yes, you are right. Currently ConnectException only handled while connecting to NN. This is duplicate of HDFS-4404.]
