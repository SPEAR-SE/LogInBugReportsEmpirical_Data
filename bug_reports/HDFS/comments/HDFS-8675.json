[The solution isn't as simple as replacing the IOE with UnregisteredNodeException.  The DN will commit suicide.  Handling the exception will require buffering the IBR (or any other calls this may affect), registering, resending the rejected message.  Issue might be related to network issues or defects that stall BPOfferService like the synchronous clearing of the trash after RU finalize., NN declares a DN DEAD
-->DN sends an IBR
-->catch Remote IOException, sleep 1s
-->DN sends an IBR
-->catch Remote IOException, sleep 1s
-->DN sends an IBR
-->catch Remote IOException, sleep 1s
-->heatbeat due, DN sends an heatbeat
-->DN get DNA_REGISTER
-->DN registered
-->successfully sneds an IBR

I think it's not an issue, is it?, IMO, For the deadnode case, analysis of [~walter.k.su] seems reasonable.
But if, some other Exception (ex: NPE) which repeatedly comes for every blockreport ( may be until restart of NN), will be a problem., Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3., 2.7.3 is under release process, changing target-version to 2.7.4., Moving target version to 2.7.5 due to 2.7.4 release., Moving target version to 2.7.6 due to 2.7.5 release., Looks like not a problem.]
