[Apparently the test case fails when my laptop is connected to wifi and passed if connected via ethernet.
So closing as invalid., There is still an intermittent failure, tracked in HDFS-9911, which I haven't been able to resolve., Thanks for mentioning this jira.
The same test case failed in HDFS-10348 also.]
