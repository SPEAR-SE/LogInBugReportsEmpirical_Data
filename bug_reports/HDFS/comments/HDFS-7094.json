[[~schu] will you look..? 

Approach for Correction can be done any of the following way

I) Document updatation
2) Code

If it is from code, I can give patch.. orelse can you please look..?  

and which will be good..?

, Hi, [~brahma].

The documentation (which corresponds to version 2.5.1) is actually correct because in HDFS-6056 (which went into 2.5.0), the NFS configs were changed from {{dfs.nfs.keytab.file}} to {{dfs.nfs.keytab.file}}. Note that in the patch, DeprecationDeltas were added, so users can use the {{dfs.nfs.}} prefix for some configs.

If you look at {{org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.nfs.conf.NfsConfigKeys}} on branch-2, you'll see the up-to-date NFS config names.

Thanks,
Stephen

, Sorry, made a typo above. I meant the NFS configs were changed from, for example, {{dfs.nfs.keytab.file}} to {{nfs.keytab.file}}., [~schu] is correct. Resolving this JIRA., Okie..I got it..I did not check in 2.5.0.., Closing tickets that are already part of a release.]
