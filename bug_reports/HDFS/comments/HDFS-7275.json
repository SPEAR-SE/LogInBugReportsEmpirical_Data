[Hi Robert,
I have tested this code change in my local and it works fine. I am attaching the patch for everyone's review and feedback. Please let me know in case of any suggestions, I will complete those changes.
For now the change involves modifying file hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-httpfs/src/main/tomcat/ssl-server.xml.conf to include entries for TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 on line 73.
This patch is required for couple of clients as they have their clients running curl on ubuntu or RHEL7 that offers clients to specify tls level while fetching data from httpFs.

Please provide feedback if any.
The code snippted change looks as follows:
{code:ssl-server.xml.conf|borderStyle=solid}
<Connector port="${httpfs.http.port}" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
               maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="false" sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,+*TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,*+SSLv2Hello"
               keystoreFile="${httpfs.ssl.keystore.file}"
               keystorePass="_httpfs_ssl_keystore_pass_"/>
{code}
 , The formatting did not work typing code snippet without formatting.
