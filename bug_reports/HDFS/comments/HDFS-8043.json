This message is automatically generated., [~brahmareddy] thank you for taking this issue. I think we should fix MiniDFSCluster itself since NullPointerException occurs in MiniDFSCluster class instead of test class. IIUC, base_dir in MiniDFSCluster is null but base_dir.delete() or base_dir.deleteOnExit() is called. Could you check it?, [~ozawa] Thanks for taking a look into this issue.. Yes , you are correct..Now I covered both...Kindly review.., [~brahmareddy] thanks for your updating.
{code}
-    if (deleteDfsDir) {
+    if (deleteDfsDir && base_dir != null) {
         base_dir.delete();
     } else {
+      if (base_dir != null) {
         base_dir.deleteOnExit();
+      }
     }
{code}

The condition statements look complex. Could you fix it not to use nested if-else statement?, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., you can reorder the condition to say

{code}
if (basedir != null) {
 if (deleteDfsDir) { delete-now } else {delete-later} 
}

It'll be less confusing that way
