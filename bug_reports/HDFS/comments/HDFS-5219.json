[This patch also introduces new configuration keys that are going to be used by HDFS-5122., +1 pending Jenkins., Added one more configuration key, HDFS-5123/HDFS-5221 are addressing the same issue for hftp, and they may use a similar retry mechanism. Since these retry operations are all over http, will it make sense to let them share the same retry configuration properties? In that case, we can rename the new configuration from *_WEBHDFS_* to something like *_HTTP_*?, Address Jing's comments., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
