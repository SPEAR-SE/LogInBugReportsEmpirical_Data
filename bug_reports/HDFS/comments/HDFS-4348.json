[I don't believe this has been fixed, the documentation for 1.0.4 (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.0.4/hdfs_user_guide.html#Backup+Node
) still has the wrong statements., Luciano,

The more recent 1.x release is 1.1.2, whose documentation has it fixed via HADOOP-7297. The live docs for a release usually is unchanged (they are a 1:1 copy of the docs included in the released tarball) so you'll not see it reflecting that.

Reopen know if you are still seeing it at http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.1.2/hdfs_user_guide.html or in later releases.]
