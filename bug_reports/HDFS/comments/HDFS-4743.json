[This patch corrects 2 problems with this test:

# It was iterating over a {{HashSet}} and expecting results in a certain order.  To enforce deterministic iteration order, I've switched these to {{LinkedHashSet}}.
# Test paths specified with '/' were getting converted to '\', causing assertion failures.  To fix this, I've changed the test to store test paths as {{File}} instead of {{String}} and then convert to URI paths for the assertions.  This is guaranteed to be separated with '/'.

I tested successfully on Mac and Windows.
