* Maybe we should exclude decommission_inprogress node as well given the balancer excludes them.
* Any reason it changes to call fetchDatanodes with parameter {{removeDecommissionNode}} set to false?
* In test code, you can use {{JSON.parse}} to convert String to Map.
* In test code, can you remove {{System.out.println}} statement?
, Thanks [~mingma] .

I have updated the patch as per your review comments.

bq.Any reason it changes to call fetchDatanodes with parameter removeDecommissionNode set to false?
Seems there is an issue in the logic for removing  decommission node from live/dead node list .I have raised a separate jira for the same (HDFS-8780).

Please review the patch.

This message was automatically generated., Testcase failures are not related to this patch., Thanks [~andreina]. Overall it looks good.

The two test cases have quite amount of overlaps. It seems the only differences between decommissioned test case and decommission_inprogress test case are the number of datanodes and the expected decommission state the test cases wait for. Maybe these two test cases can call a common function that takes number of datanodes and expected decommission state as parameters?, Thanks [~mingma] .
Have updated the patch as per your comments. 
Please review., \\

This message was automatically generated., Patch looks overall good.

have some nits in test, 
1. use try-finally after starting cluster and shutdown cluster in finally block.
2. Since DECOMMISSIONED and DECOMMISSION_INPROGRESS are enums, they are static, '==' also can be used for comparison instead of {{equals(..)}}.
, Thanks [~vinayrpet] for the review comments.
 I have updated the patch .Sorry for the delay. Please review. , \\
