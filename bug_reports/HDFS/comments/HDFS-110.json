[Does the fsck utility need to write to the dfs data directory? Perhaps it could point someplace else by default. Is this behavior actually unreasonable? Perhaps fsck should be hard to run if you don't have the right set of permissions., To some degree this is a configuration issue.  A dfs data node stores data under the value of dfs.data.dir.  The dfs client code also writes temporary files in the directory dfs.data.dir.  Probably these should instead be different properties.  But there's also no reason that a client needs to have the same value for this property as a datanode.  So, in short, this can be fixed by changing the value of dfs.data.dir in the client's configuration to an alternate location for temporary files.]
