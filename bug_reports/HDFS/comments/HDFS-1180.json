[Attaching a patch that fixes the missing ivy dependency. Not for commit on trunk; only affects 0.21. No new tests since successful compilation is all this attempts to fix., Actually, things are more complicated than they first seem.

If I check out branch-0.21 of the hadoop-common.git repository and run `ant veryclean jar mvn-install` it actually does build hadoop-common-0.21.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.

But looking at https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common/ it only produces a 0.22.0-SNAPSHOT artifact. 

https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-core/ does contain an 0.21.0-SNAPSHOT artifact (which is why I filed this patch) -- but it seems to have not been updated in a week.

I think this is actually a Hudson issue more than an Ivy deps issue. But since I can't examine the Hudson build for hadoop-common, I don't know how to go about resolving this. Can one of the committers look into the issue?, HDFS-1173 fixed the version number and artifact name, but the Hudson build to publish to the repo has not been working. I just fixed http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Common-21-Build, and it has now published the artifact correctly., Thanks Tom, HDFS builds correctly now.]
