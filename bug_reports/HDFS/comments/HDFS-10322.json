[May call The native method doPoll0 had got stuck......, Hello [~chenfolin].  In addition to HADOOP-11802, there have been multiple other bug fixes in this area in the past year: HADOOP-11333, HADOOP-11604, HADOOP-11648 and HDFS-8429.  The affects version here is listed as 2.5.0.  If that's the version you are running, then it doesn't have all of these fixes.  I recommend reviewing those to see if they look relevant to what you're seeing.  HADOOP-11333 in particular looks relevant.  If it turns out this is already fixed, then please resolve this as a duplicate.  If you still think there is an unfixed bug remaining, can you please provide additional details?  Thank you., Hello Chris Nautoth
Thanks for your reply.
I see  all bugs (HADOOP-11333, HADOOP-11604, HADOOP-11648 and HDFS-8429) are not the same with me., It is the same as HADOOP-11802 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11802.
I am not sure first, because i saw a runnable DomainSocketWatcher thread. 
Now, I have known that runnable DomainSocketWatcher thread  provide the webhdfs service, because if enable webhdfs, the datanode process may contains two DomainSocketWatcher threads. And now, I am sure another thread was done.  , [~chenfolin], thank you for investigating this further.  I'm just updating status on this issue to indicate it's a duplicate of a prior issue.]
