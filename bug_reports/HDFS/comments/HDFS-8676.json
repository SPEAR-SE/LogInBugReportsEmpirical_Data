This message was automatically generated., The patch looks good in general. There is a potential problem, which was part of the original code.  There is a precondition check that can throw {{IllegalStateException}}, which is a {{RuntimeException}}.  This can cause offerService() to blow up in the middle of heartbeat response processing. For example, important command like {{DNA_ACCESSKEYUPDATE}} can be dropped.  Instead of blowing up in the middle, it should log {{ERROR}} and move on.  I suggest changing it to a combination of {{assert}} and conditional statement. {{assert}} will make sure it blows up in testing, so we will know if something is obviously broken. In production, the conditional statement will log the error message and simply skip the deletion., Thanks Lee for reviewing. I'm on holiday. I'll update it soon., Sorry for late update. Your concern is valid. Upload 02 patch to address that., pre-commit is having problem cleaning up the garbage from previous builds.
We fixed a similar issue before... I guess it's broken again., \\

Since the deletion is executed by the actor thread synchronously, incremental block reports are blocked while deletion is in progress.

, Does this issue exist in 2.6.x? Should this be backported to branch-2.6?, bq. Does this issue exist in 2.6.x? Should this be backported to branch-2.6?
yes & yes, imo. HDFS-7645 is also related., Thanks for the reply [~kihwal]. Does this patch depend on HDFS-7645 in any way, or can it be committed as a standalone fix?

It sounds like HDFS-7645 should be included along with HDFS-8656 and HDFS-9426 (which is still open)., Hi [~walter.k.su] and [~kihwal], I tried to cherry-pick this patch to branch-2.6 but it seems to have conflicts. Would you help to commit the patch to branch-2.6 or provide a patch against branch-2.6? Thanks!, Move it out of 2.6.4 to 2.6.5 as this jira haven't update for a while.]
