You may need to call following hsync method with UPDATE_LENGTH flag to update the length in the NameNode.
{code}
((HdfsDataOutputStream) fos).hsync(EnumSet.of(SyncFlag.UPDATE_LENGTH));
{code}

Can you please try this and let us know the result., HDFS-4213 implemented an API change to allow the file-size to be updated on hsync()., Thanks Vinay - I'm currently using 2.0.0 so can't test this yet, which was introduced in 2.0.3.  It looks like it will do the job though., Duplicate of HDFS-4213.  Only question is whether a normal hsync() or hflush() should update this by default and without needing to cast-down, or whether that is too expensive to happen by-default., bq. Duplicate of HDFS-4213. Only question is whether a normal hsync() or hflush() should update this by default and without needing to cast-down, or whether that is too expensive to happen by-default.
If we call update length by default, it will be expensive as every sync call goes to namenode to update length which. So its better to keep it to user's interest to update the length whenever required. , Closed, duplicate, fixed in 2.0.3, solution requires {{FSDataOutputStream}} to be cast to {{HdfsDataOutputStream}} to call an overloaded {{hsync}} method.]
