[I have not seen any comment on this. I propose making the transceiver count = number of readers + number of writers. Reporting number of readers and number of writers from datanode to namenode and counting the number of transceivers by adding them together, as proposed in HDFS-4893 seems like a better solution. I plan on closing this and addressing this issue as part of HDFS-4893., Hello Sir,
Can you please let me know where is the formula of transceiver count? I could only get that currently datanode gets the total Xceiver count from threadgroup.getActiveConnections(). I was unable to find the formula mentioned above. I would highly appreciate your help.
Thanks,
