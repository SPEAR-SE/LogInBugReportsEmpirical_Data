[Same test as in HDFS-2434, but a different metric this time., maven and stdout from a failed test run. Some kind of race between the BlockManager and the FSN metrics, since BM thinks it's 1 and FSN metrics thinks it's 0., Turns out the race is between the call to {{BlockManagerTestUtil#getComputedDatanodeWork()}} in the test and the {{BlockManager#ReplicationMonitor}} (which also calls {{#getComputedDatanodeWork()}}. The {{ScheduledReplicationBlocks}} metric reports the number of blocks scheduled for replication the last time {{BlockManager#getComputedDatanodeWork()}} was called. If the {{ReplicationMonitor}} runs after the call to {{BlockManagerTestUtil#getComputedDatanodeWork}}, {{ScheduledReplicationBlocks}} is correctly reported as 0, since the corrupted block was scheduled for replication last time.

The fix is simply to remove this assert. I also removed an unnecessary call to {{#updateState()}} (which is called in {{#getComputedDatanodeWork()}}, and fixed a typo in a nearby comment., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Test failure looks unrelated, it's flaking on other testruns too., +1, the patch looks good to me. Good investigation, Andrew. I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk.
