[Upload the patch for branch-2., Hi Jing,

I think we also need to update the links in hadoop-project/src/site/site.xml.

{code}
<item name="High Availability With QJM" href="hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithQJM.html"/>
<item name="High Availability With NFS" href="hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithNFS.html"/
{code}, Ahh, yes. Thanks Arpit! Let me update the patch., +1 for the updated patch, staged site and verified links work as expected., Thanks very much to Arpit for the review! I've committed this to branch-2 and branch-2.4.0.]
