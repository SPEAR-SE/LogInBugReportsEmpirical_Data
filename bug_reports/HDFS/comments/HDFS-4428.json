[Hi Colin,

This looks like it will be very helpful.  I applied the patch locally on an Ubuntu VM and ran {{TestNativeIO}} successfully.  Here are a few questions:

1. It appears that the rename function can also fail with ENOTEMPTY.  Can we add that to the errno mappings?

2. In {{NativeIO.c}}:

{code}
if (rename(src, dst) < 0) {
  throw_ioe(env, errno);
}
{code}

I've seen references for rename that say "On failure, a nonzero value is returned" rather than specifically guaranteeing a negative number gets returned.  Maybe it's safest to change this to check for != 0?

3. In {{TestNativeIO}}:

{code}
// Test attempting to rename a nonexistent file.
try {
  NativeIO.renameTo(nonExistentFile, targetFile);
} catch (NativeIOException e) {
  Assume.assumeThat(e.getErrno(), equalTo(Errno.ENOENT));
}
{code}

I think all of the assume calls were supposed to be assert calls.  With assume, if the condition is not true, then JUnit marks the test skipped instead of failed, and it does not cause a build failure.  For example, in the above test, I hacked my local copy to look for the wrong errno: EIO instead of ENOENT.  JUnit reported a skipped test, but not a failure.

Also, the test would pass even if the {{NativeIOException}} was not thrown.  We'll need to add fail calls in the try blocks after the rename calls.

4. Also in {{TestNativeIO}}:

{code}
File sourceFile = new File(TEST_DIR, "source");
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(sourceFile);
fos.write(101);
fos.close();
{code}

It appears that the contents of the files aren't important for the test, so this could simplify to {{File#createNewFile}} instead of a {{FileOutputStream}}.

5. In {{FsDatasetImpl}}:

{code}
try {
  NativeIO.renameTo(blkfile, newBlkFile);
} catch (IOException e) {
  if (!newmeta.renameTo(oldmeta)) {  // restore the meta file
    LOG.warn("Cannot move meta file " + newmeta + 
        "back to the finalized directory " + oldmeta);
  }
  throw new IOException("Block " + replicaInfo + " reopen failed. " +
                          " Unable to move block file " + blkfile +
                          " to rbw dir " + newBlkFile);
                          " to rbw dir " + newBlkFile, e);
}
{code}

Do you want to use the native call for restoring the meta file too?  Then, we could log the exception and see the errno from that call.
, thanks for the thorough review, Chris.  This should address those points., +1

Version 2 of the patch addresses everything I mentioned.  I applied it locally and ran {{TestNativeIO}} and {{TestRBWBlockInvalidation}}.  Thanks, Colin!
