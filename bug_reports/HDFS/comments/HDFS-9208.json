[Hello [~kihwal].

I had filed HADOOP-12390 related to this problem specifically for {{hdfs dfs -put -p}}.  I proposed fixing it at the application layer by supporting additional flags for preserving specific attributes.

Instead of fixing it in applications, I think I prefer your option #3 here to allow explicit changes to atime at the NameNode layer.  I don't see any harm in allowing that.  A single fix at the NameNode layer would help all applications that might suffer from this problem., I also like option #3., Really #3 is the only option. I was wrong about atime being 0. When {{INode}} is created, the atime and mtime are set to identical value. option 1) and 2) are not possible., [~liuml07] Are you actively working on this?, Hi [~kihwal], this is on my list this week but I'm not working on this actively. Sorry for the delay. I need more context for the options.

I assign it back to you in case you're blocked., The {{setTimes()}} call through {{getBlockLocations()}} does not force update, while explicit call does. So it is a simple matter of removing the check.  The behavior of {{getBlockLocations()}} is not changed., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~kihwal], thank you for the patch.  I am +1 for making this change.

The test failures look unrelated, and I can't repro them locally.  I also manually tested {{hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal -p}} and {{hadoop distcp -pt}} with a NameNode that has atime disabled.  You can remove the now-unused import of {{DFS_NAMENODE_ACCESSTIME_PRECISION_KEY}} to fix the Checkstyle warning.  After that, I think the patch will be ready.
, Thanks for the review, Chris. Attaching a new patch that removes the unused import., \\
