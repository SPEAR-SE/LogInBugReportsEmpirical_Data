[Should this be targeted to 2.6.2? We're trying to release 2.6.1 soon. Let me know., Unless the patch is ready to go and the JIRA is a critical fix, we'll defer it to 2.6.2. Let me know if you have comments. Thanks!, A combination of errors occurred.  Pipelines were frequently breaking because the cluster erroneously "thought" it was full.  Mis-accounting bugs in the RBW reserved space and storage report contributed to the problem but almost full clusters will exhibit the same problems.  A thread leaks and continues to renew the lease on a defunct file.

Didn't seem like a big deal until we saw it in long running daemons.  Then it was the NMs.  Consider log aggregation pipelines breaking, NMs leaking dozens or hundreds of renewer threads, over thousands of nodes, NN has an insane number of open connections nearing your "this will never happen" fd limit, clogging it with worthless renewals.  Now it gets good.  The renewer threads won't abort until the token expires.  Oh, you don't have security enabled?  Better restart your NMs, hdfs proxies, oozies, DNs (webhdfs writes), hbase region servers, etc...

I'm swamped and if you want to wait till 2.6.2, I'm ok., Targeting 2.6.3 now that 2.6.2 has shipped., Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3., Hi, can we move this out of 2.6.3? Thanks!, Move it to 2.6.4 as the JIRA haven't been update for a while., Hi [~daryn], is this issue related to HDFS-9294? Thanks!, Move it to 2.6.5 as the JIRA haven't been update for a while., 2.7.3 is under release process, changing target-version to 2.7.4., Moving this issue to 2.6.6. Please move back if you feel otherwise., Initial patch that moves {{endFileLease}} to {{setClosed()}}. Includes a simple test for this move., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Test failures are unrelated. TestPermission is broken by  HDFS-10455. TestDataNodeRollingUpgrade is passing locally and the error in the precommit is a bind exception which is not related to this fix.

Requesting [~kihwal], [~daryn] and others for more reviews/comments and suggestions. Thanks a lot!, +1 The patch looks good., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.8. 
Do you have a patch for 2.7 and 2.6?, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10840 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10840/])

, I'm going to resolve this issue for now, please reopen if you want to backport to 2.7 and 2.6 for precommit runs.]
