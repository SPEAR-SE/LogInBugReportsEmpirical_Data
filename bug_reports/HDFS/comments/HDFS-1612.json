I'd be happy to create a patch.  I did a quick look over the hdfs design doc, and there seem to be a few new features of 0.21 (e.g. append, symbolic links) as well as some older features (e.g. quoatas) that aren't documented correctly.  I'd be happy to update those, too, either as part of this patch or separately., +1 for updating append/sym links as well., > I'd be happy to create a patch.

It would be great if you can update the doc.  See also HDFS-1612., First pass at an update to the hdfs_design doc.

Changes:
* "scale to hundreds of nodes" -> "scale to thousands of nodes"
* Changes to reflect append and hflush features.
* Mention support for user quotas.
* fixed a typo -- stray gg/
* Mention checkpoint and backup nodes.

There are a few other things that might be updated:
* "HDFS does not currently support snapshots but will in a future release" -- but HDFS-233 hasn't been updated since June, 2010.
* "Work is in progress to expose HDFS through the WebDAV protocol" -- either reference https://github.com/huyphan/HDFS-over-Webdav or remove this? HDFS-225 hasn't been updated since August 2009.
* It's unclear to me if the rebalancing section needs to be updated. The hadoop balancer is a manual process, AFAIK, so what is there is technically accurate., Note that this patch will get a -1 from hudson because it doesn't include any new tests.  It's just a document update, though, so no new tests are expected., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The test-patch script actually is able to detect documentation changes.  So it won't get a -1 from not adding tests.

Obviously, the -1 core and contrib tests are not related to this.

+1 patch looks good., > It would be great if you can update the doc. See also HDFS-1612.
I mean to say HDFS-1388 but not HDFS-1612., I have committed this.  Thanks, Joe!

That's strange, when I ran test-patch locally, (from the hdfs project), I got a -1 for failing to add new tests.
