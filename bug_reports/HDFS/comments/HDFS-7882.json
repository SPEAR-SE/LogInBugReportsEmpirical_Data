[Thanks for reporting this jira.. Did you enable  hdfs audit logger..? ( Need set log4j.additivity.org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSNamesystem.audit and  hdfs.audit.logger) ..?

can you please confirm same..?, Seems you had enabled the audit logs and getting startRollingUpgrade and finalizeRollingUpgrade from the description..

Yes, there are no audit logs for rollback and downgrade., Rolling upgrade: *start and finalize are RPC requests and these are edit transactions*
bq. For rollback and downgrade also audit logs should be added.
Anyway downgrade is no more available.
And rollback is *NOT available via RPC and its not an edit transaction* which can be applied. Its a NameNode command to be executed on the namenode installed machine itself to reset the files to earlier status. 
So IMO there is no need of audit log for rollback., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for the clarifications.
Resolving the issues as not a problem.]
