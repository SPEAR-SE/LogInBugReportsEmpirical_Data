[This is mostly caused by improper host resolution environments (I see this cause disallowed exceptions a lot of time on Cloudera's scm-users list, for example, where the users have badly formed /etc/hosts files [FQDN second instead of first, etc.]).

The most easy fix is to fix your environment to have saner resolution that does not lead to this, than having the code resolve it.

I do not see this problem with consistent host resolution setups.

Resolving as Won't Fix, but do reopen if there's a strong point of argument here, of why the workaround _has_ to be necessarily done. Patches would be welcome in that case too :)]
