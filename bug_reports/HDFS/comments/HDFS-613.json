[This is the assertion:
{{AssertionError: Mismatched number of datanodes}}

It is in {{Balancer.chooseNode()}} method wthout parameters., Hi Konstantin, is it possible to run all unit tests with asserts on? If so, what is the exact command that I can run on the command line to run all unit tests with assert's switched on?, They're on by default now.  I didn't see this one when enabling asserts in hdfs because in the tests it gets reported as a junit assertion error instead of a java.lang one:

Mismatched number of datanodes
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Mismatched number of datanodes

Here's the assert that's firing:

{noformat}
   assert (datanodes.size() ==
      overUtilizedDatanodes.size()+underUtilizedDatanodes.size()+
      aboveAvgUtilizedDatanodes.size()+belowAvgUtilizedDatanodes.size()+
      sources.size()+targets.size())
      : "Mismatched number of datanodes";
{noformat}, TestBlockTokenWithDFS fails for the same reason., I think the assert itself is at fault here. It assumes that after datanodes have been moved to the sources/targets list, they're not left in the underUtilized list. This isn't necessarily the case, with rounding error - they might have excess "move quota" so still be in the list.

This patch changes the assert to simply check that the sum of sources and targets doesn't add up to more than the number of DNs. This fixes both TestBlockTokenWithDFS and TestBalancer., Looking into this separately I have came to the pretty much the same conclusion: the assert in question is incorrect. 

+1 on Todd's patch., I have just committed this to trunk and 0.22. Thanks Todd!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #643 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/643/])
