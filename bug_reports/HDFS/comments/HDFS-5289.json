[Here's a patch which addresses the issue by catching the exception and retrying the check in this case, instead of assuming that the check will return null. I tested this by adding a {{Thread.sleep(1000)}} in {{TestRetryCacheWithHA#testClientRetryWithFailover}} in the thread to execute the operation. The test fails reliably without this patch, and passes reliably with it., +1, looks right to me., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
