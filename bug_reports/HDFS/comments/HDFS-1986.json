[Comments:
# TestDFSUtil.java - {{InetSocketAddress is = new InetSocketAddress(1234);}} I am not clear how this maps to namenode address?
# DFSUtil.java - {{checkSecurity}} could be named {{httpsAddress}}. @param checkSecurity needs to be reworded. The method returns an address and not port. @return needs to be reworded too.
