[Currently on the MAPREDUCE-945 we have made the corresponding classes which {{ProgramDriver}} uses to extend {{Configured}} and implement {{Tool}}. Also the configuration used to launch job are construced not by {{new Configuration()}} rather thro' {{getConf()}} method which is implemented in {{Configured}} and we use {{ToolRunner.run()}} method to launch program taking care of generic options., List of test files for the test in description (some of them do not match test mentioned in description exactly):

, This patch is for 0.20 (pre-split), also brings in junit-4.5 (see change in ivy/libraries.properties) because this issue requires classes to extend Configured and implement Tool so they cannot extend TestCase as required by junit-3.8.1

Unit test (ant test) runs with same results with both 3.8.1 and 4.5 versions of junit, the only failed test is TestHdfsProxy in contrib which relies on a library that does not exist anymore (not related to junit)., Note: my comment above (posted 04/Oct/09 05:51 PM) applies to jira.HDFS-587.branch-0.20-internal.patch

The jira.HDFS-587.branch-0.21.patch is for branch 0.21, before the MR tests in HDFS were moved to MR (they are being moved right now, thats why no patch for trunk at the moment)., As long as the results don't change from 3.8.1 to 4.5 and it makes back ports easier, +1., +1 Seems Ok from JUnit standpoint., +1 to the attached patches., HDFS-587 is blocked by HDFS-641 because HDFS-587 is related to the same set of test that are (probably) being moved to mapreduce in HDFS-641, Reuslts of ant test-patch on revision 820532:

, /home/steffl/jira.HDFS-587.branch-0.20-internal.1.patch is a new patch for 0.20 that does not have the two tests in TestLoadGenerator.java that use -scriptFile option of loadGenerator (that functionality is missing in 0.20 version of LoadGenerator)., How to run these test from command line:

./hadoop/bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-hdfswithmr-test-0.21.0-dev.jar TestDFSIO -Dmapred.job.queue.name=anotherQueue -write

./hadoop/bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-hdfswithmr-test-0.21.0-dev.jar DFSCIOTest -Dmapred.job.queue.name=anotherQueue -write

./hadoop/bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-hdfswithmr-test-0.21.0-dev.jar DistributedFSCheck -Dmapred.job.queue.name=anotherQueue -write

This test is not part of this bug, it did use Configured and Tools already (i.e. no need to run it): ./hadoop/bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-hdfswithmr-test-0.21.0-dev.jar filebench

./hadoop/bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-0.21.0-dev.jar org.apache.hadoop.fs.loadGenerator.StructureGenerator -maxDepth 10 -minWidth 1 -maxWidth 10 -numOfFiles 5 -avgFileSize 2 -outDir /homes/steffl/tmp -seed 1000 # doesn't use queue, no mapreduce

./hadoop/bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-0.21.0-dev.jar org.apache.hadoop.fs.loadGenerator.TestLoadGenerator # doesn't use queue, no mapreduce

./hadoop/bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-hdfswithmr-test-0.21.0-dev.jar nnbench -Dmapred.job.queue.name=anotherQueue -operation create_write

./hadoop/bin/hadoop jar ./hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-hdfswithmr-test-0.21.0-dev.jar  NNBenchWithoutMR -Dmapred.job.queue.name=anotherQueue -operation create_write


Version 0.20 specifics:

  - different jar: hadoop-0.20.2-dev-test.jar

  - as far as I can tell there is no way to run NNBenchWithoutMR in 0.20, even in 0.21 it had to be added to HdfsWithMRTestDriver.java (don't know how it was ran before), Patches for 0.22 added:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12425362/jira.HDFS-587.mapreduce.branch-0.22.patch
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12425361/jira.HDFS-587.hdfs.branch-0.22.patch

Most of the Tests were moved to mapreduce, except of TestLoadGenerator.java which remains in hdfs, that's why there are two patches for 0.22.

Note: DFSCIOTest error: ot complains that $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop/libhdfs/libhdfs.so.1 does not exist, it's a bit weird, the test needs libhdfs.so.1, hdfs_read and hdfs_write in $HADOOP_HOME/libhdfs so you might want to touch those files (it copies them to /tmp/DFSCIOTest and uses them as data files, it does not load libhdfs.so.1 as a library).

You need to add queue (name anotherQueue) to $HADOOP_HOME/conf/mapred-queues.xml (OR $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/mapred-queues.xml if you have a separate config dir), Committed the HDFS part of the patch to trunk. Thank you Erik., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #168 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/168/])
    . Add support for specifying queue name in mapreduce tests. Contributed by Erik Steffl.
, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #199 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/199/])
    . Add support for specifying queue name in mapreduce tests. Contributed by Erik Steffl.
, Integrated in Hdfs-Patch-h2.grid.sp2.yahoo.net #96 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hdfs-Patch-h2.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/96/])
    , +1 to the patch.

Opened MAPREDUCE-1377 to run the patch thro' hudson on the MAPREDUCE branch.  Also, since this is fixed on HDFS trunk can we close this JIRA as resolved fixed?

@Erik, can you assign yourself the JIRA : MAPREDUCE-1377
, Integrated in Hdfs-Patch-h5.grid.sp2.yahoo.net #196 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hdfs-Patch-h5.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/196/])
    , This issue was resolved and committed to 0.22 from an HDFS perspective; it should be marked as such.

Changes to MapReduce will be tracked in MAPREDUCE-1377.]
