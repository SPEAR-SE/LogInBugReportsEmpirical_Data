[Removed test case for clearUGI under TestProxyUtil as this is no longer a valid url and also fixed the port number for param hdsproxy.https.address.

This fix was already included in the patch for HDFS-481. Will revised patch for HDFS-481 to exclude this., +1 patch looks good.

I tested the patch manually.  It worked fine., I have committed this.  Thanks, Srikanth!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #229 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/229/])
