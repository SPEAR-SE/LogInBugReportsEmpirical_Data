[In a secure setup the user names must match a Unix user name. [a-z_][a-z0-9_-]*[$] with a min/max of 1/31

The correct thing to do would be the USER_PATTERN to enforce the same pattern as UNIX, both in HttpFS and in WebHDFS, That makes sense and is also more relaxed than the current matcher I think., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, I see a lot of webhdfs test failures ever since this was committed. Looking at the precommit build which +1'ed for everything, it actually failed. , Filed HADOOP-9037 to address the precomit build issue., If the failures are related, please revert the patch from this Jira. , Look at last night's build:
  https://builds.apache.org/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1226/

All test failures were coming from webhdfs.
I sampled a couple of test cases. If I reverse HDFS-4171, they don't fail., I think it may be as simple as making the regexp case-insensitive with (?i).  I'll quickly test otherwise we should consider reverting the patch., It runs deeper.  Let's revert for now.  It looks like the tests might be failing because of debris from other tests because if I run some of the failing test cases in isolation they pass just fine.  It seems wrong that the client isn't getting a meaningful error from the failures other than null response.  I wonder if an exception from the new checks is killing the connection., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3016 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3016/])

, Why was there a limit of 31 characters placed on this?  , AFAIK that is a Unix limitation in usernames. In case it does not apply to all modern Unixes we can remove it. If this is an issue for you, please verify and open a JIRA if that is the case., I've opened HDFS-4236 to fix this regression., Posting my comments from HDFS-4236:
This jira is essentially makes comments on the changes of HDFS-4171. Ideally, if it was made at the right time, HDFS-4171 could not have been committed. Given no follow up has happened on this jira for several days. I am going to revert HDFS-4171 by the end of the day, if there are no further activity in this jira., Cross-posting with HDFS-4236:

--------
Suresh, without HDFS-4171 usernames containing '_', '-' & '.' don't work. I think that is a bigger issue than the length limitation. I'd say it would be more common to have one of those chars in the username than a username with length greater than 31. Your opinion is against a config option. I'll take care of adding the release notes incompatible changes today or tomorrow. Sounds good?
