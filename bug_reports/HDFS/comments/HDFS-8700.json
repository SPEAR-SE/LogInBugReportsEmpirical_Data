[I found an issue before:
{code}
cluster = new MiniDFSCluster.Builder(conf).numDataNodes(capacities.length)
  .hosts(new String[]{"localhost", "localhost"})
  .racks(new String[]{"rack0", "rack1"}).simulatedCapacities(capacities).build();
{code}
It will cause 2 DNs both located in "rack1". Actually we should not create 2 DNs with the same hostname.

This jira blocks me fixing TestBalancer#testBalancerWithPinnedBlocks(). That's why I create this jira., And Pinning depends on favoredNodes., \\
