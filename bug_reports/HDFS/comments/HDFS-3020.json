Since you are touching this part of the code, can you please remove throwing unnecessary IOException from FSEditlog#getEditLogManifest, FSEditlog#releaseBackupStream.

This patch should be committed to 0.23.2., bq. Does this mean that the editlog is being synced only during rolling of editlogs?
Nope, it's being synced OK for any operations that call {{logSync}}. It's just that the functionality of HDFS-1112 isn't working -- so, for example, if you start a NN and then only perform getBlockLocations calls, it may fill up the log buffer until the NN is entirely out of RAM.


I'll update the patch against trunk - the previous patch was against HA branch but I forgot that the APIs have been changed a little bit, so the test didn't compile., Updated patch against trunk (changed FSEditLog.openForWrite() to FSEditLog.open()), +1 update looks good, +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Suresh, mind if I address those unnecessary IOEs separately? I want to keep this patch tightly targeted to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts, etc (applying across 23, trunk, HA), Sounds good, The spying I did on trunk didn't work for branch-23. Updated patch spys on metrics instead of the stream itself, which applies to both 23 and trunk. The code's otherwise the same., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, - Why there are no Jerkins report for the latest patch?

- It looks like the patch introduced [a findbugs warning|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/1933/artifact/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/patchprocess/newPatchFindbugsWarningshadoop-hdfs.html].  If it is the case, please revert it., The latest patch was against a non-trunk branch so it didn't apply quite cleanly.
I fixed this findbugs error already on the HA branch which we will merge soon., > The latest patch was against a non-trunk branch so it didn't apply quite cleanly.
