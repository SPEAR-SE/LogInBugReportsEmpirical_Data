, Just saw the jenkins test finished, this test didn't fail. I think the fix for
{quote}
2. miniDFSCluster is not shutdown after each test.
{quote}
indeed fixed the issue I reported in HDFS-6683. I'm marking it as duplicate.
, The other test failure
{{org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.TestPipelinesFailover.testPipelineRecoveryStress}} failed in other test runs (e.g., for test HDFS-6588 I worked on), with different symptoms. It doesn't seem to be related to this patch. I filed HDFS-6694 for it.

, +1 for the patch.  I confirmed it in my Windows VM.  Thanks for fixing this!, Thanks Everyone for the review.
