This message is automatically generated., Hey Stephen, looks like this patch doesn't apply cleanly to trunk. Mind updating the patch so it applies cleanly? Also, looks like the patch uses 4 spaces for indentation, instead of the standard 2., Moving the comment in the release note to an actual comment:

bq. Very minor change, simple added a check to ugi.isSecurityEnabled() before trying to getDelegationToken, This is not a problem anymore in branch-2/trunk, given the move to use of WebHDFS in the UI for FS work.]
