[Not urgent., I think this check should occur only for files that are not under construction. For blocks that are being actively written to, it is better for lease recovery to decide which blocks to delete and which to keep. More discussion on this via HADOOP-5027., I'm going to close this as a dupe of HDFS-2251.]
