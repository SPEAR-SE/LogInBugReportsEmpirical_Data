[This patch should fix that. But this is not clear whether this is a bug or not. It could be that the JavaDocs are out of date and that umask'ing the permissions was a valid operation.

Anyway, here is the patch to set DFSClient's .mkdirs() method use the parameter permissions and NOT umasking them., > DistributedFileSystem.mkdirs(dir, dirPermission) calls DFSClient.mkdirs(dir, dirPermission) to create directory and then set permissions to (dirPermission & ~umask)
This is the intended behavior right!

Read http://linux.die.net/man/2/umask

The umask for HDFS is set in the configuration file. It is being applied as permission & ~umask correctly both by DFSClient#mkdirs() and DFSClient#create(...). Perhaps the documentation of mkdirs() and create() should be changed to mention how umask is obtained from configuration and applied to the permission that is passed by the user., As Suresh commented, this is working as designed.

If you don't want your permissions to be altered by the umask, you can set your client's umask to 0 using this code:
{code}
conf.set(CommonConfigurationKeys.FS_PERMISSIONS_UMASK_KEY, "0");
[... create FS using conf ...]
{code}

Try {{man umask}} for more information about umask., Shouldn't we update the javadoc to be clearer, as Ravi mentioned?, reopening as a doc change
, * update documentation for {{DistributedFileSystem#mkdirs}} to reflect umask., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
