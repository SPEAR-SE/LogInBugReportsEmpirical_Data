[Lovely as the new format is, I think this JIRA major scope is invalid.

The reason is that, {{haadmin}} was not supposed to be HDFS specific while the subclass {{DFSHAAdmin}} is. Option {{-ns}} is part of {{DFSHAAdmin}} instead of  {{haadmin}} command. The current documentation for {{DFSHAAdmin}} is correct if you check the version from 2.7.

A few related JIRAs can be checked at [HDFS-8067], [HDFS-7324] and [HDFS-7808].

[~brahmareddy] and [~szetszwo] to chime in? Thanks,]
