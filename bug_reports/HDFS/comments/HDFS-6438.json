This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good.  Some minor comments:
- In the public delete(..) method in NamenodeWebHdfsMethods, pass the snapshotName parameter to init(..).

- In the private delete(..) method in NamenodeWebHdfsMethods, reuse np for the DELETE case. 

- The following should "a HTTP DELETE request".
{code}
+** {Delete Snapshot}
+
+  * Submit a HTTP PUT request.
{code}, Thanks for the review, Nicholas! Update the patch to address your comments., Some more minor comments on the doc:
- In CREATESNAPSHOT, the snapshotname is an optional parameter so that we should add [ ] in the curl command example.
- In RENAMESNAPSHOT, it should be oldsnapshotname=<SNAPSHOTNAME> since the < > is used to enclose the variable type.  Both oldsnapshotname and snapshotname have the same type <SNAPSHOTNAME>.
- The HTTP Query Parameter Dictionary is in alphabetical order so that the new Snapshot Name and Old Snapshot Name tables should be relocated accordingly.

+1 once these have been addressed., Thanks again for the review, Nicholas. Update the patch to fix doc., +1 patch looks good., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
