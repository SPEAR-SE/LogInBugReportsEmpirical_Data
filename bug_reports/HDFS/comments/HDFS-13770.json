, Thanks [~knanasi] really good finding!
HDFS-10999 pertains to erasure coding, so no way to backport it in branch-2.

That said, because HDFS-10999 is a huge internal refactor, have you run the same test (without some modification) and verified the test is not reproducible in 3.x?, [~jojochuang], I ran the same tests and 3.x does not have this bug., Thanks Kitti for identifying this and providing a fix! Patch looks pretty good, some minor comments:
- We can extract a method {{decrementBlockStat}} in {{UnderReplicatedBlocks#remove}} for less duplication.
- We can tidy up the new 3-param {{remove}}: make it private, and point its javadoc to the 2-param one. Some thing like:
{code}* For details, see {@link #remove(BlockInfo, int)}....  {code} and explain the difference only (i.e. how oldExpectedReplicas is used).
- Original javadoc had a typo: s/attmpted/attempted/g.
- Test should have a timeout
- Do you think it's helpful to add a few other sanity tests in the same test case? For example, oldExpectedReplica of 2 doesn't trigger a counter decrease. From code it's pretty clear, so this is really just adding some extra coverage. Up to you. :), Thanks for the comments [~xiaochen]! I fixed them in patch v002 and added some sanity tests to make sure that the counter is not incremented/decremented in cases when the condition does not apply., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Hi [~knanasi],

Thanks for working on this and thank you for the latest patch. Your changes seem to be fine for me.

I've checked, the test does fail without the fix and passes with the fix applied.

I found a few checkstyle issues for UnderReplicatedBlocks line 265 and TestUnderReplicatedBlocks line 164, 175 and 186.

Best regards,
Zsolt, Thanks [~zvenczel] for the findings! I fixed them in patch v003., Thanks for the update [~knanasi], patch v003 looks good, +1 (non-binding) from me., Thanks Kitti for the new rev and Zsolt for reviewing!

+1 on patch 3 pending 1 final thing:

Sorry I didn't make it clear - in general the test timeout is to prevent a stuck test to block the jenkins job. But because the jenkins slaves could be slow, the test timeout is better to be conservative so we don't get false negatives. So I suggest we bump the timeout to 60 seconds.

 

Since branch-2's pre-commit is pretty much broken... could you clarify what tests you have run for the latest patch?]
