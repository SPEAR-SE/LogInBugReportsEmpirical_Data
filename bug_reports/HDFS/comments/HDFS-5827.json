{noformat}, Hi [~cnauroth], Could you take a look at this.
This I found while writing xml tests. 
Please correct me if I am wrong., Thanks, Vinay.  You're right that this is incorrect behavior.  This is happening because default ACL handling hasn't been implemented on the NameNode side yet.  This is tracked in HDFS-5616, and I'm planning on getting it done in the next few days.  Until then, this particular test won't pass.

Do you mind if we resolve this as duplicate?  For HDFS-5702, I think we can just commit the failing tests, and then I'll verify later that my HDFS-5616 patch fixes them.  We're isolated on a feature branch, so having a couple of failing tests for a few days won't harm anyone else.  Sound good?, Assigning to myself for verification as part of working on HDFS-5616., This will be implemented in HDFS-5616
And tests are already added as part of HDFS-5702.
So closing this as duplicate.

Thanks Chris for the update]
