[Hello [~kihwal]

I think I added DN links in HDFS-10493, I can work on this one if you don't mind., sure go ahead., The build master is down at this moment., Thanks [~kihwal]. I was waiting on the jenkins job result, I have tested the patch locally, both non-secure and secure setup worked fine. Will trigger a jenkins job later when the server comes back., Upload the patch again to trigger the jenkins job, v2 file is just a copy of v1 patch. I tried to "Cancel Patch" then "Submit Patch" over again but it did not trigger the job somehow., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for the contributions [~cheersyang] and [~kihwal]. I added a link to HDFS-10440., HI [~xiaochen],

Per offline discussion, it seems HDFS-11198 breaks "NameNode UI Datanodes tab" which is fixed by HDFS-10440, in that case, we can make the link "broke" instead of just "related to".

Thanks.
, Re-added the link as 'is broken by' HDFS-10440 per Yongjun suggested. Thanks.]
