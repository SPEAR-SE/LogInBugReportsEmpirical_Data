This message is automatically generated., Hey Jim, patch looks pretty good. Just a few small nits:

# The method to check the configs is called "VERIFYConfigurationSettings" whereas the test is called "TestConfigurationVALIDATIONS". I think these should be consistent, and I prefer the word "validate" in this context.
# No need for the StringBuilder in the case of this error - just break up the message onto a few lines, e.g.:
\\
{quote}
"This is an " +
"error message.";
{quote}\\
# Rather than "HttpServerAddress Port" and "RPC Server Address Port" in the error message, I'd recommend using the actual config keys, which are defined in the {{DFSConfigKeys}} class.
# In the test, I'd recommend catching IOException explicitly, and maybe even verifying the contents of the message string a little bit. We wouldn't want this test to pass if a {{NullPointerException}} or an unrelated {{IOException}} were thrown.
# The indentation is off throughout the patch. The Hadoop code base uses 2-space indentation, no tabs., Adding in Aaron's comments regarding the formatting and coding guideline changes, thanks for the info Aaron, those are all definitely reasonable requirements and I should have caught those on the first round. Let me know if this patch takes care of those issues.

This message is automatically generated., Hey Jim, latest patch is almost there. Two tiny nits:

# I should've been more clear, but I think the error message should include the *values* of those config options. i.e. I think the error message should end up including "dfs.namenode.http-address" and "dfs.namenode.rpc-address" since those are what are actually put in the config files. Users won't know what {{DFS_NAMENODE_HTTP_ADDRESS_KEY}} and {{DFS_NAMENODE_RPC_ADDRESS_KEY}} mean.
# In {{testThatDifferentRPCandHttpPortsAreOK}}, there's no need to catch the exception and explicitly call {{Assert.fail(...)}}. If an exception gets thrown by a test method, that will indicate failure to the testing framework automatically.

+1 after these issues are addressed., 4 times the charm? :)
ok Hopefully addressed your last two issues, the assert fail was removed from the test and the logline now reads as: 

"dfs.namenode.rpc-address (localhost/127.0.0.1:9000) and dfs.namenode.http-address (/127.0.0.1:9000) configuration keys are bound to the same port, unable to start NameNode. Port: 9000", +1, the patch looks good to me. Will commit pending clean Hudson results., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
