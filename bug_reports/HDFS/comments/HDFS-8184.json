This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~andreina] for reporting and working on the issue. I think the correct fix is to add storageType as an OptionWithValue so that CommandFormat.parse() can recognize the option correctly.  

{code}
     ClearSpaceQuotaCommand(String[] args, int pos, FileSystem fs) {
       super(fs);
       CommandFormat c = new CommandFormat(1, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
+      c.addOptionWithValue("storageType");
       List<String> parameters = c.parse(args, pos);
       String storageTypeString =
           StringUtils.popOptionWithArgument("-storageType", parameters);
{code}, Hi Xiaoyu Yao, {CommandFormat} has bug, i have fixed in HDFS-8205., This one shares the same root cause as HDFS-8205. The right fix should be in CommandFormat#parse().]
