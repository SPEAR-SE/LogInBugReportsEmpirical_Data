[Uploaded a patch for this issue. Basically, the patch provides a new method in NN. This new method is used for error injection tests only, which closes the edits stream(thus the file is released by NN) and replace it with a mocked stream. The mocked stream can inject edits log access errors. , +1 for the patch., I committed the patch. Thank you Brandon.]
