[note: I think the exception-handling mechanism needs more work.  {{exception.c}} expects exception names in the format {{java/io/FileNotFoundException}}, but the webhdfs JSON data returns them as {{java.io.FileNotFoundException}}.  We probably need to replace the dots with slashes.  This is in addition to the other changes.  Will post a patch shortly.

note2: I think we should require all URIs for libwebhdfs to be in the form {{webhdfs://nn:port}} (port optional).  We definitely don't support {{hdfs://}}, {{file://}}, or any of the other protocol types, so let's make that clear., * Since the API is the same between libwebhdfs.h and libhdfs.h, we only need one header file.

* move private implementation details of libwebhdfs to hdfs_http_client.h, a private header.

* use full exception class to identify exception.  Actually, the previous way *did* happen to work, since we'd take the short exception name and search the exception class names for it, but I think comparing the full exception name makes more sense., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., fix CMakeLists.txt, Thank you for the cleanup patch, Colin!

A few other issues you may want to address, sorry that this reads basically like a post-hoc code review of HDFS-2656.  And, apologies if I cite any issues you've addressed in the attached patch, I'm just reading SVN commit 1382836.

* nearly all uses of strcat should be replaced by strncat or similar bounded copy routines.
* {{sizeof(char)}} is defined to be 1, so code like {{u = malloc((uriLen + 1) * (sizeof(char)));}} should be {{u = malloc(uriLen++ 1);}}
{code}
+int checkIfRedirect(const char *const headerstr, const char *content, const char *operation) {
...
+    if(headerstr == '\0' || strncmp(headerstr,"HTTP/", 5)) {
{code}
Comparing a pointer {{headerstr}} against the character constant {{'\0'}} is probably wrong.  I can't tell if the coder intended to handle {{headerstr == NULL}} or {{headerstr[0] == '\0'}}.
{code}
+    while (DnLocation && strncmp(DnLocation, "Location:", strlen("Location:"))) {
+        DnLocation = strtok_r(NULL, delims, &savepter);
+    }
+    if (!DnLocation) {
+        return NULL;
+    }
+    DnLocation = strstr(DnLocation, "http");
{code}
Using strstr here will not correctly handle a URL like "ftp://http.foo.com".  It should skip whitespace and check the beginning of the word for "http", or something like that.
{code}
+        des = pthread_cond_destroy(&buffer->transfer_finish);
+        if (des == EBUSY) {
+            fprintf(stderr, "The condition transfer_finish is still referenced!\n");
+        } else if (des == EINVAL) {
+            fprintf(stderr, "The condition transfer_finish is invalid!\n");
+        }
{code}
Please use strerror and consistently handle all errors, rather than silently discarding unexpected error values.

{code}
+            newAddr[strlen(bld->nn) - strlen(lastColon)] = '\0';
{code}
That assignment is terrifying, it would be very easy for a nonobvious bug to cause this calculation to end up outside of the buffer and overwrite other memory.  In general libwebhdfs has way too much "clever" (dangerous) string processing code.

{code}
+        absPath = (char *)malloc(strlen(path) + 1);
{code}
No need to cast the return value of malloc in C code.

{code}
+int hdfsExists(hdfsFS fs, const char *path)
+{
+    hdfsFileInfo *fileInfo = hdfsGetPathInfo(fs, path);
+    if (fileInfo) {
+        hdfsFreeFileInfo(fileInfo, 1);
+        return 0;
+    } else {
+        return -1;
+    }
{code}
Boolean functions in C should return 0 for false and 1 for true.  This returns 0 for true and -1 for false.

{code}
+static void *writeThreadOperation(void *v) {
+    threadData *data = (threadData *) v;
{code}
No need to cast from void* to threadData*.
{code}
+            fprintf(stderr, "Error (code %d) when pthread_join.\n", ret);
{code}
Please use strerror.
{code}
+    fprintf(stderr, "To clean the webfilehandle...\n");
{code}
Remove this debugging printf.
{code}
+    if (!hashTableInited) {
+        LOCK_HASH_TABLE();
+        if (!hashTableInited) {
+            if (hcreate(MAX_HASH_TABLE_ELEM) == 0) {
+                fprintf(stderr, "error creating hashtable, <%d>: %s\n",
+                        errno, strerror(errno));
+                return 0;
{code}
This early exit leaves the LOCK_HASH_TABLE locked.  I'm glad this fprintf uses strerror, but the formatting is inconsistent hroughout the patch; we should have a common way of formatting the error messages in libwebhdfs.

{code}
+        char jvmArgDelims[] = " ";
{code}
There are many examples of this pattern in the patch, where a local array copy of a string is made unnecessarily (the array is never written to).  Nearly every initialized char array should be a string instead: {{const char *jvmArgDelims = " ";}}.

{code}+        switch(permissionsId) {
+            case 7:
+                perm = "rwx"; break;
+            case 6:
+                perm = "rw-"; break;
+            case 5:
+                perm = "r-x"; break;
+            case 4:
+                perm = "r--"; break;
+            case 3:
+                perm = "-wx"; break;
+            case 2:
+                perm = "-w-"; break;
+            case 1:
+                perm = "--x"; break;
+            case 0:
+                perm = "---"; break;
+            default:
+                perm = "???";
+        }
+        strncpy(rtr, perm, 3);
{code}
This should be something like
{code}
   int perm = permissions >> (i * 3);
   rtr[0] = perm & 4 ? 'r' : '-';
   rtr[1] = perm & 2 ? 'w' : '-';
   rtr[2] = perm & 1 ? 'x' : '-';
{code}

{code}
+        exit(-1);
{code}
exit(1) is the normal way to indicate failure.

{code}
+    const char* writePath = "/tmp/testfile.txt";
{code}
Tests should generate a test-specific filename and should use TMPDIR appropriately.  mktemp(3) or similar is helpful.
{code}
+static int decToOctal(int decNo) {
+    int octNo=0;
+    int expo =0;
+    while (decNo != 0)  {
+        octNo = ((decNo % 8) * pow(10,expo)) + octNo;
+        decNo = decNo / 8;
+        expo++;
+    }
+    return octNo;
+}
...
+    mode = decToOctal(mode);
+    sprintf(permission,"%d",mode);
{code}
This can be replaced with a simple {{sprintf(permission, "%o", mode);}}.

ok, will fix

[snip headerstr, strstr, strerror comments]

Good suggestions.  Jing just filed HDFS-3920, so let's address these suggestions there so that this patch doesn't get too large.

bq. [about hdfsExists] Boolean functions in C should return 0 for false and 1 for true. This returns 0 for true and -1 for false.

This is actually part of the libhdfs API.  When the file doesn't exist, we're supposed to return -1 and set {{errno}} = {{ENOENT}}.  Actually, I notice we're not setting {{errno}} here (which is wrong), but the return value is actually part of the API (unfortunately.)  (And before you ask, we probably will come up with a nicer v2 API some day, but for now let's be compatible) :)

bq. This early exit leaves the LOCK_HASH_TABLE locked...

Good find, will fix.

bq. [test comments]

Let's address these in a separate JIRA.  We're going to need an automated test for libwebhdfs anyway, so we might as well do the cleanup as part of that JIRA, rather than bundling it into this one., * don't need to typecast result of {{malloc}}, {{calloc}}
* {{hdfsPread}} must not change the position in the file
* {{hdfs_web.c}}: fix cases where we weren't setting {{errno}}
* {{hdfsAvailable}} should always return 0, since every read currently blocks.  It should *not* return the remaining length of the file.
* {{hdfsHflush}}, {{hdfsFlush}}: return *EINVAL* if these are called on a file not opened for write.  Add a comment about implementing these by flushing the local write buffers, which we should implement later.
* {{initFileInfo}}: we don't need this function, since {{calloc}} already initializes everything to 0.
* always set {{workingDir}}, so we don't have to check it against *NULL*.  It currently starts as the root directory.
* add a comment referencing HDFS-3917
* split *OUTPUT* file handling into a separate function, since it is very long and doesn't relate to *INPUT* files at all., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

the malloc is one byte short, it should be +2 as well.  I'd make an explicit target-size variable rather than repeating this computation (which leads to bugs, as we see)., * address Andy's comments.

Other than that, this looks great.  Let's go ahead and get this checked in so other cleanups that depend on it can make progress (HDFS-3920 primarily).

I've build tested -- debian unstable amd64, needed libjansson-dev and libcurl4-openssl-dev packages but then it built just fine., +1 looks good

I noticed the following nits, none are due to your change. I'll fix them (and Andy's request for the extra space) commit since they're trivial:
- webhdfsBuffer in hdfs_http_client.h has mixed c and c++ comments
- "syscronization" is misspelled
