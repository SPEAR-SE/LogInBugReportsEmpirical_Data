Hi [~cnauroth] and [~wheat9], Can you take a look at the patch? thanks, Hi [~vinayrpet],
I think there's a bug in your patch:

You shouldn't change the logic for the group; just changing the user logic is enough. Otherwise, if a user USR1 belongs to several groups (e.g., GRP1 & GRP2, with ACL  entries: group:GRP1:----, group:GRP2:rwx), the user will be denied from accessing, but he/she SHOULD have., Oops! Yes. You are right. I will update the patch rightaway. Thanks, Attached updated patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

[~vinayrpet], the patch looks good.  It looks like 2 Jenkins runs interfered with each other, something that I've seen causing trouble lately.  I've triggered a fresh Jenkins run here:
