This message is automatically generated., +1 (i'm not a hdfs committer, just the original contributor of HDFS-5637), good catch!  I ported the orignal HDFS-5637 patch into trunk from our internal branch which is based on community 2.0.0 codebase, there's no any "legacy" related code path:)  Thank you [~kihwal], +1. Thanks, Kihwal. Since 2.4.0 is already in RC, I will commit this to trunk and branch-2.

jeagles, HDFS-5810 fixed it by adding a proper check.]
