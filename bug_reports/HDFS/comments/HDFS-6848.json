[Note: the only caller of DataStorage#format() is the synchronized method addStorageLocations. So we should be fine without any changes. 

If this going to be called by other non-synchronized method in future, it is better to call the synchronized method setDatanodeUuid() instead of the direct assignment as Ted reported above in DataStorage#format().

{code}
private synchronized void addStorageLocations(DataNode datanode,...)
{

 format(sd, nsInfo, datanode.getDatanodeUuid());

}  
{code}, bq. it is better to call the synchronized method setDatanodeUuid()
