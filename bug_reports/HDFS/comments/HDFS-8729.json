This message was automatically generated., The patch passes lots times locally. The tests failed because HDFS-8642. I'll trigger jenkins again after HDFS-8642 fixed., To trigger block report or not before restarting DataNodes may test different code paths: if DNs send report to NN before restarting, it is very possible that the truncate can be done before the restarting. Otherwise the recovery process may happen after DN restarts. In these two scenarios the block replicas reported from DN, and the block info stored in NN, can have different states when the restarted DNs send their first block reports to NN.

In my test looks like the reason of the timeout is a race scenario in the block recovery process: the second dn sends block report after the block truncation is finished thus its replica is marked as corrupted. However the replication monitor cannot schedule an extra replica because there are only 3 datanodes in the test. So maybe a quick fix is to change the total number of DN from 3 to 4. What do you think, Walter?, bq. In my test looks like the reason of the timeout is a race scenario in the block recovery process: the second dn sends block report after the block truncation is finished thus its replica is marked as corrupted. However the replication monitor cannot schedule an extra replica because there are only 3 datanodes in the test. 

You are right. I knew one is corrupted, didn't know it's the second one. Thank you for thorough analysis!

What I'm doing in 01 patch is to trigger the *second* time blockReport so the corrupted block can get deleted on dn1. So ReplicationMonitor can schedule copying the block to dn1.

bq. To trigger block report or not before restarting DataNodes...

That's not what I do. In the 01 patch, checkBlockRecovery(p) will make sure truncation is completed. triggerBlockReports() is for *second* time blockReport.
{code}
    cluster.waitActive();
    checkBlockRecovery(p);
    ...
    assertEquals(newBlock.getBlock().getGenerationStamp(),
        oldBlock.getBlock().getGenerationStamp() + 1);

+    cluster.triggerBlockReports();
     // Wait replicas come to 3
     DFSTestUtil.waitReplication(fs, p, REPLICATION);
{code}

bq. it is very possible that the truncate can be done before the restarting.
That's very unlikely, because fs.truncate(p, newLength); is non-blocking.
{code}
    boolean isReady = fs.truncate(p, newLength); // non-blocking
    assertFalse(isReady);

    cluster.restartDataNode(dn0, true, true); // shutdown, restart and sends registration
    cluster.restartDataNode(dn1, true, true); // shutdown, restart and sends registration
    cluster.waitActive(); // wait until dn0,dn1 got response from NN about the registration
// dn0 or dn1 got DNA_RECOVERY command
{code}

bq. So maybe a quick fix is to change the total number of DN from 3 to 4.
It works too. I prefer my approach. Even though with my approach the time spending on DFSTestUtil.waitReplication(..) is 4-6 seconds longer. (waiting deletion and copy)
It worth it. Because the purpose of the test case is to schedule block recovery to dn0/dn1, which got restarted. Increasing the number of DNs will lower the chance.

Uploaded 02 patch. add {{Thread.sleep(2000)}} to make sure it's the second BR., \\

This message was automatically generated., Findbugs is broken recently. The time out test not related., bq. That's not what I do. In the 01 patch, checkBlockRecovery(p) will make sure truncation is completed. triggerBlockReports() is for second time blockReport.

Ahh, I missed the location of the new "triggerBlockReports" call. +1 for the 02 patch. I will commit it shortly., I've committed this to trunk and branch-2.
