, Hi Suresh,

Thanks for reviewing it.

I did not change the long line since it is minor style issue.  I think the 80 character line limit is an out-dated style since the screen resolution nowadays is usually large and wide-screen are very common.

, bq. - reverts the change in HttpFs since the simple fix won't work and I am not able to spend much time on it.

Nicholas, doesn't this imply webhdfs and httpfs are now incompatible? Maybe you could at least file a jira so we do fix it if you don't have time to fix it here?, > Nicholas, doesn't this imply webhdfs and httpfs are now incompatible?  Maybe you could at least file a jira so we do fix it if you don't have time to fix it here?

The specification does not specify the Content-Type for empty responses.  So the Content-Type could be anything, provided that he response is valid.  For HttpFs, It is very likely that it has such bug.  Filed HDFS-3018 as a task to check it.]
