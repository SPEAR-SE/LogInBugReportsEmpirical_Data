[Umm, doesn't this basically defeat the purpose of safe mode?, I think the minimum replication factor enforced for block allocations and replications can be separate from the factor used for calculating safe block count. We can make it use {{dfs.namenode.replication.min}} if the new config is not set., Thanks [~aw] and [~kihwal] for providing opinions on this issue. I updated my patch according to kihwal's suggestion., If we are going forward on it, this needs to have in the description that:

a) this is an expert level setting
b) that setting this lower than the min replication is not recommend and/or dangerous for production setups

, [~aw] thanks for providing valuable review. Those descriptions are added to the latest patch., Those need to go into the hdfs-default.xml.  (which this patch will likely fail in unit tests since there is a check for that now), Thanks [~aw] for pointing out the problem. I have added the new config into hdfs-default.xml, \\
