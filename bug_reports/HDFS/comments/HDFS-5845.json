[[~andrew.wang], I am marking this as blocker for 2.3.0., Patch attached. This was pretty simple, but requires taking the FSN writelock on the 2NN since we have a bunch of write lock asserts in CacheManager. I think this is okay since we already do this in the SbNN, but someone should weigh in if this isn't okay.

{{diff -w}} helps with reviewing the test change, since I needed to indent a test by one., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I'll also note that I bumped the timeout on that seemingly unrelated test since it flaked twice for me at 30s., Looks good to me.  +1, Thanks Colin, I committed this to branch-2.3, branch-2, and trunk., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5063 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5063/])
