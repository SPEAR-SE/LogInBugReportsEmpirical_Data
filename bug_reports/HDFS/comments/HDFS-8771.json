[In my view, all the write related calls are handled in single thread to ensure order of request from NN. So, journal node can perform purge operation in a separate thread instead of blocking the caller.

Please correct me if any other suggested approach is better., I'm agree with you. I think we can use parallelExecutor instead of singleThreadExecutor. Does it make sense to you?, [~tfukudom], as it is still a write based request journal node should check the validity of caller. I meant instead of submitting to {{parallelExecutor}} at NN side, Journal Node can handle purge operation with out blocking the RPC call , [~kanaka], thank you for the clarification. It sounds good to me., Attached a patch to handle the {{purgeLogsOlderThan}} calls at {{JournalNode}} in a separate single threaded executor service so that edits are not blocked for the purge log completion., \\

This message was automatically generated., I think its a good idea to make purge asynchronous to unblock write requests.

Some comments about the patch.
1. {{void purgeDataOlderThan(final long minTxIdToKeep) throws IOException {}}
Here no exception will be thrown from this method now, so now can remove {{throws}}.
2. {{setUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandlers.systemExit())}}
I think, shutting down entire JN on IOException during purge may not be good. During purge only call which results in IOE is {{FileUtil.listFiles(dir)}}, which might be due to disk error. Since this exception cannot be propogated back to NN, I feel it would be better to handle inside {{call()}} and log a WARN. Let further synchronous write requests handle the IOE as required. For any other exceptions let JN shutdown, its okay.

[~andrew.wang] / [~jingzhao], do you want to take a look here. ?, Seems okay to me, few quick comments:

* Can we name the thread "JNStorageEditLogPurger"? We normally do something camel cased and based on the classname if possible.
* Let's avoid having sleeps in tests, instead let's add some test hooks for notification.
* I like the new log messages, mind also adding the duration and # files deleted to the "end" log message? Would be good to do this separately for the CURRENT and PAXOS dirs too.
* Since purges are cumulative, there's no point running a purge for txid 100 if there's a queued purge for txid 200. Let's do some coalescing to avoid unnecessary repeated directory scans., Other note is that we probably should update javadoc in LogsPurgeable and elsewhere to indicate that this is now best-effort and async, depending on the implementation.]
