While waiting for the two bad replicas, the blocks were fixed. So waitCorruptReplicas() only saw < 2 in each loop. Moreover, the first corrupt block was reported by DFSClient while this method was reading the file and got fixed (rereplicate/invalidate) before it looped, without involving BlockScanner. 
, Closing this jira. Likely already fixed.]
