[BTW this test may also fail on 64 bit VMs, given 2G is written and read to verify. If this takes a long time on a machine, the Junit could timeout., If this test fails because of the timeout it means that a test machine has some serious problems with its disks... (e.g. 4Gb of IO takes > 15 minutes)., Sorry, didn't see this one in time., When HDFS-1527 is committed TestLargeFile needs to have the following line of code
{code}
+    assumeTrue(ALLOWED_VM.equals(System.getProperty("sun.arch.data.model")));
{code}
removed. Imports needed to be updated accordingly., Closing is dup of HDFS-1527]
