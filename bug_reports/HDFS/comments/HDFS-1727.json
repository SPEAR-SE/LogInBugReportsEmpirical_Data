This message is automatically generated., I have verified, these test failures are not related to this patch., A few comments:
- I think the {{null == dir}} check needs an {{else}} clause that prints an error that only one path may be passed. That is to say, if you run "hadoop fsck /foo /bar", it should print an error rather than ignoring /bar.
- To make the tests run faster, I think it would be better for the two test cases to be combined and share the same MiniDFSCluster.
- The test case would be easier to follow if you used an argument like "-asdfjisadfijs" or "-thisIsNotAValidFlag" instead of "-listcorruptfileblocks".
- The error message could be formatted nicer. Instead of "Invalid arguments passed 'foo'" I would use the same formatting as the FsShell errors - ie "fsck: Illegal option 'foo'"

, One more comment: please remove the "@throws Exception" from the test javadoc. It doesn't give any extra information, so just clutters the code., Hi Todd,

I have verified the logs the system test framework compilation failure is also not related to my changes. This is the Hudson report when I ran the patch verification locally in my CI.

, Sorry, The above comments are given by me but Umamaheswara Rao has logged in my machine i did not check that. :), Thanks for updating the patch. In the case that you pass two paths, though, it should print a more informative error -- e.g "fsck: can only operate on on path at a time", rather than the same "Illegal option" error., -1 overall.
