[Not sure if it's the same - {{testMaxCorruptFiles}} fails if the block pool slice scanner runs too soon, before the test is able to remove the block files. The test just loops waiting for the corrupt block count to go to 100., The test appears to have a couple of bugs:
# It needlessly reduces the directory scanner interval. If the directory scanner detects the missing block before the {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}} then the test will fail. Fix removes this setting.
# The {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}} could run before we remove the files, in which case it won't run again for a long time. The fix restarts the DN after removing files to trigger it once more.

I ran a few hundred iterations of the test in a loop and the flakiness is gone with this fix., +1 patch looks good., Thanks Nicholas, will commit once I get Jenkins +1.

I am still not sure if this is the same issue hit by [~kihwal], so we can reopen later if needed?, bq. I am still not sure if this is the same issue hit by Kihwal Lee, so we can reopen later if needed?
