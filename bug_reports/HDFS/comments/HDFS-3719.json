[Can you set Affect Version/s field please., Set affects version to 2.0.0-alpha, thanks Suresh., Looking at this in more detail, these two tests have been disabled since the initial commit in HDFS-1057. Since I suppose append has been fixed in the two years since, I simply re-enabled them and tried running each of them a few times and they passed.

, It seems like this tests have been failing a lot since getting re-enabled.

Andrew, do you have time to take a look? Otherwise I think we should revert this., Eli filed HDFS-3770 to address the test failure, and has some good analysis for what the root cause may be., I'm fine with reverting this until a fix emerges for HDFS-3770. I'll take a look, but based on the amount of discussion surrounding the fix for HDFS-1057, things might not be simple., OK, since it appears there's more to these failing tests than a simple fix, I'm going to go ahead and revert this change to re-enable the tests., I've just reverted this., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2637 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2637/])
