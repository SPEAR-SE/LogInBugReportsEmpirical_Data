[Test fails on Windows because it assumes certain unix local paths (like {{/dev/null}} and {{/proc/does-not-exist}}).

While working on the fix I noticed that logic under JournalNode#validateAndCreateJournalDir uses java.io.File#canWrite() which does not work as expected on Windows. To address that I replaced the majority of the logic under validateAndCreateJournalDir by calling into DiskChecker#checkDir. I think this gets us the behavior we want here. Please comment if this sounds good.

Just to add, there is one incremental improvement we can do in the patch. Currently, the patch assumes certain exception strings back from the DiskChecker. If someone changes those strings, it can break HDFS test patch by accident. , +1 for the patch.

I verified that the fix works on Mac and Windows.  I agree with changing the logic to use {{DiskChecker}}.  Thank you, Ivan., +1 for the patch. DiskChecker code adds additional checks, but it is correct and is a good change.
