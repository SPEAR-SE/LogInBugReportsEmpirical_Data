[I am interested to work on this. Below is my initial analysis.
The access privilege check seems to be missing in the 'remove' implementation in RpcProgramNfs3.java. This check is available for 'rmdir' as shown below
{code}
      if (!checkAccessPrivilege(client, AccessPrivilege.READ_WRITE)) {
        return new RMDIR3Response(Nfs3Status.NFS3ERR_ACCES, errWcc); 
      }
{code}

Any thoughts? I will analyze further and will update soon., Sure [~usrikanth]! Feel free to submit a patch when you are ready. The fix should be on similar lines to what you have proposed., Thanks for finding the problem and the fix, guys. , Attached a patch. Please review., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
