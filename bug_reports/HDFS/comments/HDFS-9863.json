[I have two questions.
* one is that datanode exiting without logging
* the other is why that datanode restarting cause cms gc

And this case was also happened in Nodemanager, thanks answering., [~linyiqun] Jira to track the issues.. Kindly post your query in user [mailing list|https://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html]..
, It's most likely killed by a signal. DN does not have a shutdown hook, so for example, when it receives SIGTERM, it simply exits.  If it's not the system's OOM killer, someone must have shut it down. Timing of CMS varies a lot by config. Please move further discussion to a mailing list as Brahma said., Thanks all for comments.]
