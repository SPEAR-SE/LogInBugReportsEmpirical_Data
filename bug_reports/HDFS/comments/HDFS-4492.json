This message is automatically generated., Hi Chu, the patch looks pretty good to me. Would you mind writing a little test for this, so as to ensure that the issue never regresses? We generally prefer that all bug fixes have a test associated with them, hence why the pre-commit test run mentioned that no tests were included., Ah, I just noticed this issue was resolved as a dupe. My bad. I'll go look at the associated JIRA now., yea, HDFS-4505 is used to fix the real bug behind the balancer problem.]
