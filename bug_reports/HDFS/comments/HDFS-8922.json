This message was automatically generated., +1, Test Failure seems to be unrelated to this patch., I have to admit, I do find it kind of strange that IBM's {{libjvm.so}} doesn't depend on {{libdl.so}} itself, if it needs to make use of that library.  However, given that this only affects test programs, and it seems like a trivial fix, let's just do it.  I agree that the test failures are unrelated., committed to 2.8, thanks, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8330 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8330/])
