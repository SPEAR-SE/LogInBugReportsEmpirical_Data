[Attached a patch to address the findbugs and release audit warnings.
Changes are as follows:

1) Added to excludes list for EI_EXPOSE_REP,EI_EXPOSE_REP2 type comments as as already added them in hadoop-hdfs-project.After moving to hfs-client project we should add file names explicitly.
 
2) DFSOutputStream#currentPacket inconsistent synchronization because enqueueCurrentPacketFull is package scoped and a non synchronized method, here it is accessing currentPacket. This is the concern for findbags. Currently enqueueCurrentPacketFull called only in writeChunk which is already synchronized, so logically there is no issue. But to exclude such comments options to mention the field name which can avoid the comment, but the issue is it may suppress future warnings as well. So to make windbags happy I just made enqueueCurrentPacketFull synchronized, I think its ok.

3) Merged the HDFS-7285 related CHANGES.txt to main CHANGES.txt.
I also took chance to place two of the issue entries in CHANGES.txt, which was placed wrongly like HDFS lira entry in Common and vise versa.
 Following 2 are such type: 
  HADOOP-11921. Enhance tests for erasure coders. (Kai Zheng)
  HDFS-8557. Allow to configure RS and XOR raw coders (Kai Zheng)

This message was automatically generated., Thanks for all the fix, [~umamaheswararao]! The patch may need some rebase. Other than that looks good to me., Attached rebased patch, Thanks Jing, for review! , The patch looks good to me too. Thanks [~umamaheswararao] and [~jingzhao].
Since the patch is straight, and also need to rebase if any committer commits a new patch, so how about running a local test-patch at the meantime, and attach the local report, if the Jenkins still fails, we can refer to the local report and rebase/commit it directly if the local test-patch successes?, \\
