[Hi, I am new to HDFS dev and I would like to take this issue as my first. It may take a while because it's my first issue and because of my schedule but I will do my best to be as prompt as possible. Thanks!, Hi, I've emailed the reporter of this issue with this question but I figured I could post it here as well in hopes of getting my answer faster. In order for me to understand this problem I need to know what exactly "servicerpc-address" "fs.defaultFS" and "rpc-address" refer to. Insight into this would be most helpful. Thanks!, Hi [~eli] and [~josephkniest] , i would like to work on this issue.
Will soon update on this issue., Closing as Cannot reproduce as the issue does not persist in latest trunk code. 
2NN is able to start with only rpc-address been configured. ]
