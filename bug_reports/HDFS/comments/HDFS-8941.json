This message was automatically generated., It seems the test case failures are not related to the patch. Let me try to trigger the jenkins again for a clean report!, Hi Rakesh, thanks for picking up this issue. One question, why do we cast to DFS in next()? Symlinks can be cross-filesystem, and other filesystems could implement this API. Most of the time you want to leave this as just a FileSystem without casting.

Otherwise looks good though, thx again., Thanks a lot [~andrew.wang] for the comments and the explanation. Attached another patch addressing the same., \\
