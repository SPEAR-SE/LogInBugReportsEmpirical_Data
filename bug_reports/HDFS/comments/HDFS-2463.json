[here are the steps

1. create a file on hdfs
2. set permission of the file to 400
3. use the create api to overwrite the file as the same user

Actual: Allowed to overwrite the file that was readonly.

Expected: We should not allow that, Are you using a superuser account?, It is the same user that is running the services so i would assume it is the super user. But the file is owned by the super user and is read only for that user., For HFDS superuser, all permission checks are by-passed.  This is the HDFS implementation but nothing to do with webhdfs., resolving as invalid based on Nicholas's comments, Closed upon release of version 1.0.0.]
