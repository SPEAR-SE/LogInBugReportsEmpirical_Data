 , These test were broken by HDFS-8905. HDFS-8905 moved {{DFSInputStream$ReadStatistics}} to {{ReadStatistics}} but hdfs.c was not updated accordingly., Thanks [~aw] for the candidate list., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~ajisakaa] for the fix! The patch LGTM. A question:

How to trigger the ctest invoking the failed test cases? I'm wondering if the Jenkins building had verified them or not, by default. It would be great if someone could run the tests and provide the output here additionally., bq. How to trigger the ctest invoking the failed test cases?
{code}
$ cd hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-native-client
$ mvn test -Pnative
{code}
In HDFS-8905, Jenkins did not pick up the tests because the patch did not change hadoop-hdfs-native-client module. Here is the output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/16657/artifact/patchprocess/patch-unit-hadoop-hdfs-project_hadoop-hdfs-native-client.txt
All the tests passed.
, Thanks Akira Ajisaka and Allen Wittenauer for all the effort to narrow down the issue and create the patch!   
I reviewed the patch and verified it. The previous failed test cases all passed with the new patch.

Great Job!, Thanks Akira for the insights and info, and Sammi for the verifying!

+1 on the patch., This is really a symptom of the kind of nonsensical divisions of modules that are in HDFS and MapReduce.  Ideally, all of this native code would be hdfs-client. Then when a change is made to to that code, this code will also get tested.

This does, however, underscore that committers really really really need to pay attention to the qbt report after they do a commit.  If tests that weren't failing before are now consistently failing, it's likely because there was a side effect of a recent change. , Committed this to trunk. Thanks [~Sammi] and [~drankye] for the review.

bq. Ideally, all of this native code would be hdfs-client. Then when a change is made to to that code, this code will also get tested.
Agreed. Filed HDFS-10848., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10408 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10408/])
