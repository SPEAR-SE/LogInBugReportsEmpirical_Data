[I don't think Hadoop scripts really handle that much, it mostly was handled by higher level management providers, such as ambari. So this is not a bug. This is good to have, as a more general task than just namenode., Yes, Hadoop management providers can start dfs gracefully, but the script start.sh is for the people who don't use Hadoop management software., What is "start.sh"?  Is this trunk or branch-2?  , It's "start-dfs.sh" in trunk., It's important to recognize that the shell scripts can only tell if something failed under very specific circumstances due to the way the code works inside Java.  There are still many cases where a process like the NN will return success on launch but still fail later.  So just because the shell code would report that it is running doesn't necessarily mean that it is.]
