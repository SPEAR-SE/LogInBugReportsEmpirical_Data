[FYI, [~kanaka], [~vinayrpet], [~arpitagarwal], [~stevel@apache.org] since you all have reviewed HDFS-8953 originally., 001 takes the route of just moving the test utilities that rely on Mockito to an altogether different class. This should prevent MiniDFSCluster from pulling it in inadvertently., \\

This message was automatically generated., Mockito has been used for a long time by DataNodeTestUtils. Had the test worked before HDFS-8953 came in?

According to MNG-1378, dependency of test-jar is not transitive by design. Dependencies other than Mockito are possible to have same problem. Should we add explicit dependency to pom.xml of hadoop-minicluster rather than fixing test code every time the issue rises?, RAT is a false positive and the test failure appears sporadic (passed locally anyways), but the whitespace was all me. Fixed in 003.

The patch did fix the Accumulo unit tests (as outlined in the description)., Thanks for taking a look, [~iwasakims].

bq. Mockito has been used for a long time by DataNodeTestUtils. Had the test worked before HDFS-8953 came in?

I didn't explicitly track it down, but I can say with confidence that it does work with <=2.8.0-SNAPSHOT.

bq. dependency of test-jar is not transitive by design

Precisely. That is the root of the issue described here.

bq. Should we add explicit dependency to pom.xml of hadoop-minicluster rather than fixing test code every time the issue rises?

While there's the long-term maintenance worry here in Hadoop, adding in Mockito is also a scary consideration as it's yet another forced dependency on clients for something that, personally, looks extremely minor. I have to imagine that there are ways we could catch that in the future too. I'm also open other suggestions to future proof things :), \\

This message was automatically generated., Hmm... Though [test artifacts are intended to be internal|https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Compatibility.html#Build_artifacts], MiniDFSCluster seems to be exception and annotated as LimitedPrivate.

{noformat}

If MiniDFSCluster alone is used by downstream projects, it should not depends on artifacts only depended by test-jar of hadoop-* as far as possible but there is no guard for this now. Maybe we can add test checking it to hadoop-minicluster as follow-up.

Anyway, I have some comments on the patch.
* There is no guard to keep someone from adding code using InternalDataNodeTestUtils to MiniDFSCluster.
* The class name {{InternalDataNodeTestUtils}} is not clear because test artifacts are originally internal. It should be DataNodeMockUtils or something?
, bq. There is no guard to keep someone from adding code using InternalDataNodeTestUtils to MiniDFSCluster.

Please ignore this one.This is not a comment for the patch... I have one more comment instead.
* imports added to TestDataNodeMetricsLogger are not used., bq. The class name InternalDataNodeTestUtils is not clear because test artifacts are originally internal. It should be DataNodeMockUtils or something?

I am very open to name suggestions. My only concern was naming it something that wasn't specifically tied to Mockito. {{DataNodeMockUtils}} works for me.

Let me get a new patch up. Thanks again, Masatake!, \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks for the update, [~elserj]. Though the patch looks good to me, I would like opinions of another developers opinion about which option is better.
* fix DataNodeTestUtils as this JIRA proposes
* add mockito as compile scope dependency to pom.xml of hadoop-minicluster
* add comment/documenation about dependency for downstream projects and leave the code as is, bq. adding in Mockito is also a scary consideration as it's yet another forced dependency on clients for something that, personally, looks extremely minor.

hadoop-minicluster is intended to be used in tests. Adding mockito as test scope dependency does not affect users of your artifacts and it would be quick fix for this issue., bq.  hadoop-minicluster is intended to be used in tests. Adding mockito as test scope dependency does not affect users of your artifacts and it would be quick fix for this issue.
I agree with this. Adding mockito as dependency would be better. Every other changes in hdfs tests need not verify for transitive dependencies.
bq. Dependencies other than Mockito are possible to have same problem
Exactly. IMO, HDFS-8953, just exposed this existing problem., bq. I agree with this. Adding mockito as dependency would be better. Every other changes in hdfs tests need not verify for transitive dependencies.

I still disagree with you both -- claiming ignorance of the used dependencies your code needs is a smell to begin with and keeping the dependencies as minimal as possible always desirable. The maven-dependency-plugin's [analyze mojo|https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/analyze-mojo.html] would be a way to automate this check.

But, since two of you are leaning this way, let me try that and see what else breaks :), Well, I thought this would be simple, but it seems like I might be running into some fallout from HDFS-9166:

Looks like META-INF service definition isn't getting picked up correctly. I'll have to dig into this more tonight and figure out what the heck is going on. Pulling in Mockito at least doesn't appear to be causing more immediate problems. Let me attach a patch for that meanwhile., \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. Every other changes in hdfs tests need not verify for transitive dependencies.

Not for other changes in tests but only Mini(DFS|YARN)Cluster is desirable to work by just adding hadoop-minicluster as dependency. I filed HADOOP-12477 addressing this., Anything else that needs to be done here? This at least fixed the problem I was seeing in Accumulo tests against 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT., Hi [~elserj], thanks for taking this up. I must confess I don't understand how HDFS-8953 introduced this. DataNodeTestUtils already had a prior dependency on Mockito., bq. I must confess I don't understand how HDFS-8953 introduced this. DataNodeTestUtils already had a prior dependency on Mockito.

I'd have to go back and look at the commit, but I think it was just MiniDFSCluster calling a method in DataNodeTestUtils which it didn't previously. Once that import was added, DataNodeTestUtils got loaded due to MiniDFSCluster's import, and then failed because of that Mockito import. Would have to dbl check to be certain :), {code}
277	    Mockito.doAnswer(new Answer<DatanodeRegistration>() {
278	      @Override
279	      public DatanodeRegistration answer(InvocationOnMock invocation)
280	          throws Throwable {
281	        return (DatanodeRegistration) invocation.getArguments()[0];
282	      }
283	    }).when(namenode).registerDatanode(Mockito.any(DatanodeRegistration.class));
{code}
[~arpitagarwal], this code added to DataNodeTestUtils by HDFS-8953 seemed to make Mockito loaded on loading DataNodeTestUtils. Though Mockito has been used for a long time by DataNodeTestUtils, on demand class loading of JVM had not needed it in the code path of MiniDFSCluster before HDFS-8953 came in.

Test in HADOOP-12477 suceeded without mockito dependency by commenting out above.
, Thanks [~iwasakims], we should eliminate the new dependency i.e. I'd be +1 for  [~elserj]'s v4 patch. I see Josh also moved over the existing Mockito uses in {{DatanodeTestUtils}} so this removes the current ambiguity., .006 This one came across my radar again today, so here's a rebase on top of master. Best as I can tell this approach works (I believe my original downstream test is passing)., bq. so here's a rebase on top of master.

Oh my. {{master}} is not what I thought it was.. let me try again., .006 Rebased .004 on top of the correct "trunk" branch :), +1 pending Jenkins. Thank you [~elserj]!, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Hrm, let me take a look at these unit test failures and checkstyle. I can fix these., Test failures were not caused by the patch (verified all tests passed for me locally with the v06 patch applied). The checkstyle warnings were not introduced by your patch either.

I will commit this shortly., Committed to trunk through branch-2.8.
