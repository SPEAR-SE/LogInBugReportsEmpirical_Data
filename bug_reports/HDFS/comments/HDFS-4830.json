[Here's a patch which fixes the issue. It also takes the liberty of changing the actual setting name from ".percent" to ".fraction" per [~tlipcon]'s suggestion in [this comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4804?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=13653282#comment-13653282]. Given that there's so far no release which includes this feature, there's no need to add a deprecation for the old setting name., Change the constant name, too?, Good point, Turbo. I also noticed that I failed to change the constant names after addressing [~qwertymaniac]'s feedback to change the config setting names in the original JIRA. This patch fixes that as well., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1, sorry I forgot to observe this the last time.

On a partially related note, can you update HDFS-1804 with a release note for this new feature (now that the config is also fixed)? That should help get some exposure on it.
, bq. +1, sorry I forgot to observe this the last time.

No apology necessary! It was my bad.

Thanks for the +1.

bq. On a partially related note, can you update HDFS-1804 with a release note for this new feature (now that the config is also fixed)? That should help get some exposure on it.

Sure, will do., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
