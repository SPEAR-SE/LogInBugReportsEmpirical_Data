[Marking this as blocker for 205., I would also like to point out that build.xml for fuse-dfs needs to be modifies in order to pick up libdhfs.so from its new location (build/c++/<arch>/lib)., Attaching patch for brach-0.20-security and 0.20.205. The API was changed in HDFS-1000. This patch changes fuse_connect.c to follow the new API. It also includes the suggested build.xml change., The localtion of library can be different if the core build used different build directory. Since fuse-dfs build is kind of disconnected right now, it is hardcoded as "build" and no attempt is made to obtain it automatically. If a custom directory is used, it can be specified by "-Dlibhdfs.lib=/path/to/libhdfs.so"., The API issue is already fixed in trunk, but the build is not working. I think it can still be manually configured and built. This issue will be addressed in HDFS-2097., Kihwal, thanks for tackling this!
+1 for code review.
Committed to 0.20-security and 0.20.205.
