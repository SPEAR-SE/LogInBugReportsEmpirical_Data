[I want to use "svn move" command to make this change to preserve the history of the file. However the generated patch does not have details of new file. I would like to commit this change without generating patch., Makes sense.

+1 on the 'svn move' patch :-), I committed the change., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #194 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/194/])
    . Rename fault injection test TestRename.java to TestFiRename.java to include it in tests run by ant target run-test-hdfs-fault-inject. Contributed by Suresh Srinivas.
, Simple 'svn move' breaks tests compilation:
{noformat}
compile-fault-inject:
     [echo] Start weaving aspects in place
     [iajc] error at public class TestRename {
     [iajc]              ^^^^^^^^^

{noformat}

class has to be renamed as well., I have attached a new patch renaming the class to match the file name. Thanks Cos., Have ran all fault-injection tests: the problem is gone.
