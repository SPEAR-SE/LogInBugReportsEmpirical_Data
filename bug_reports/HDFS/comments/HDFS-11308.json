[I don't have a CentOS 7 box available. But it looks like a platform issue.

The same bug was reported here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtradb-cluster/+bug/1349384

Looks like the workaround is to use nmap., Ok, thank you ~ [~jojochuang], Hi [~jojochuang], Do you think we should judge the return value is 1 to avoid this problem?
, Since "nc -z" is used to check that the process is still alive after failing to kill process by "fuser -k", you should check the reason of the failure. SSH user must be the user running namenode or root in order to make fuser work., nc is alias of ncat which does not have "-z" option in CentOS 7. There seems to be some replacement by using bash.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4922943/test-from-shell-script-if-remote-tcp-port-is-open, I don't know if there's standard/specification for command switches in Linux.
But I am inclined to use a configuration property to replace the hard coded "nc -z" command, so that this kind of issue is easier to workaround., ok, thank you for your commentsÔºÅ, (and more portable), bq.nc is alias of ncat which does not have "-z" option in CentOS 7.
Even Suse also same issue..Please have look at HDFS-3618., Thanks [~brahmareddy]. I didn't realize there's a jira open. Let's move there since you already have a patch pending., Thanks [~tangshangwen] and [~iwasakims] for filing the jira and commenting. Let's resolve this one as a dup of HDFS-3618, since a patch is pending there.]
