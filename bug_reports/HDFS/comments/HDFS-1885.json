[The following tests have failed on all or most PreCommit-HDFS-Build builds since #408 and #410, as far back as Hudson has retained data:

org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestFileConcurrentReader.testUnfinishedBlockCRCErrorNormalTransfer 410-446
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestFileConcurrentReader.testUnfinishedBlockCRCErrorNormalTransferVerySmallWrite 408-446

No, this one is NOT related to HDFS-1052 :-), Sam Rash was looking at this before in the context of some other JIRAs. It seems this is tracked by HDFS-1401 and HDFS-1679, and the issue (and test case) was introduced in HDFS-1057, Duplicate of HDFS-1401]
