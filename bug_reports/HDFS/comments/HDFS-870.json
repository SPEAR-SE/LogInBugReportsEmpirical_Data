[Does your network topology change so frequently?
, No, but there should be a way to flush it when it does other than restart (== grid down time) when it does, esp. considering we can dynamically add/remove nodes (to some degree)., If we're going to add this, please make it optional.
Without HADOOP:5059, Namenode would hang 2-3 seconds for each expired/new datanode when it calls topology script in our environment.
(or you can use java topology code)

It's ok at start up time since heap is relatively small and namenode is usually not out of the safemode.
, Hi Koji, we do not use a external script to map Ip address to network topology. Instead we have java code to map IP address to rack location. Don't you folks have jave code too?, Just for the records, we use topology script written in Java to avoid the problem listed in HADOOP-5059, Sites should implement their own Java class that duplicates the current script method but implements caching.  Closing as won't fix.]
