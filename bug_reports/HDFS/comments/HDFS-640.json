[Changing TestHDFSFileContextMainOperations to use new {{FileContext.mkdir()}} instead of removed method {{FileContext.mkdirs()}}, +1 patch looks good.

I tested the patch manually.  TestHDFSFileContextMainOperations can be compiled and it ran successfully by "ant test -Dtestcase=TestHDFSFileContextMainOperations"., submitting the patch again to trigger hudson tests, Hudson does not seem working.  :(, Cannot run test-patch due to build error (previous build does not compile).,  Committing the to both release 21 and trunk. , Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #98 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/98/])
    , Integrated in Hdfs-Patch-h2.grid.sp2.yahoo.net #20 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hdfs-Patch-h2.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/20/])
