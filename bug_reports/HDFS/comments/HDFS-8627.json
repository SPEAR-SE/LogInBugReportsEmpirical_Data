This message was automatically generated., Patch looks almost okay.

Small Nit in test.
Instead of trying to read and expecting IOException as below, can directly check for the existence of the token file. Token file should not get created in case of null token.
{code}+    Credentials.readTokenStorageFile(p, conf);{code}, Thanks [~vinayrpet] for reviewing .
Attached an updated patch.
Please review., +1
Will commit shortly, \\
