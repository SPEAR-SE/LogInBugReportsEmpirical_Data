[In the abovementioned situation HDFS system was having 4 physical copies of same data block (blk_1727421609840461376) accross the cluster , 1 datanode was having 2 copies and another 2 different datanodes were having other 2 different copies. Now if I remove the file with -rm -skipTrash option only 3 copies of the data block is getting deleted. Only one copy (latest one , which was copied manually ) got deleted  from the datanode (which had 2 previously) , I checked in 0.23.3 (d60e9678bbc4d52fb9ab5d65363d452cc5926cff) and copying a block (and meta) file from one disk to another does not show up in fsck. The DirectoryScanner does detect the extra block which is not present in the memory map e.g. (here I had only 1 file = 1 block in HDFS and then made a copy)
{noformat}2012-04-06 15:49:50,958 INFO  datanode.DirectoryScanner (DirectoryScanner.java:scan(389)) - BlockPool BP-1909597932-10.74.90.105-1333745027872 Total blocks: 2, missing metadata files:0, missing block files:0, missing blocks in memory:1, mismatched blocks:0{noformat}

When I deleted the file from HDFS, I did see that the copied block (rather than the original block) got deleted. I retried this experiment, and corrupted the original block, restarted HDFS. On cat-ing the file, the original uncorrupted data was displayed from the copied block. When I corrupted the copied block, and restarted HDFS, it was not able to serve the data from the uncorrupted original block. This is a bummer. ]
