[Whenever in write pipeline if the datanode detects any checksum error while transferring the block to target node, that particular block is added to first position in the blockInfoSet with setting the lastScanTime to 0.
This will make the BlockPoolSliceScanner to pick this block first since that data structure is sorted by lastScanTime.
In this way, we will scan this corrupt block first and will report it to namenode.

There is already a jira filed for org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.TestDataNodeVolumeFailureToleration test failure :  HDFS-7547



, Requesting all the members to review the patch and comment., The patch appears to mostly duplicate existing code just to prevent {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#addBlock}} from updating the {{lastScanTime}}.  Since this method is only called in one place, I'd suggest adding a "scanNow" boolean.  Update the current caller to pass false, the new try-catch can pass true.

Regarding the new try-catch, why catch IOE and re-throw if not ChecksumException versus explicitly catching ChecksumException?, I think we need to handle the java.io.IOException: Input/output error case as well since this is what we'll see if having trouble reading from disk., Thanks Daryn for the review.
Cancelling the current patch to address Daryn's comments.
Will update the patch shortly.

@Nathan: What action needs to be taken if java.io.IOException: Input/output error occurs.
, - I think we need to prioritize a scan for that block.

- Also, some comments on addBlockToFirstLocation().
  - imo, WARN should be INFO. 
  - If this block has been scanned in the last 5 minutes (or some reasonable time frame), then maybe we shouldn't add it back to the list of blocks to be scanned. If all IOExceptions are going to re-prioritize the scan of a block, having a minimum delay between scans would avoid corner cases where a network glitch or badly behaving clients are causing IOExceptions that don't really warrant rescans., Attaching a new patch addressing Nathan's and Daryn's comment.

This message is automatically generated., Talked offline with Daryn. He uncovered a potential bug.
So cancelling the patch., Attaching  a new patch addressing Daryn's offline comments., # In {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#updateBlockInfo}}, you should update the nextScanType else the verification logs will never be able to change the value.  Probably something like set last to next, update next to normal verification when updating the scanner.
# In {{BlockSender#sendPacket}}, I think you should only check the block in the else clause.  If the client socket closed then that doesn't imply a local error.
# I'd suggest following coding style of adding spaces after "if"
# You should add @VisibleForTesting to {{DataBlockScanner#setLastScanTimeDifference}} or make the delta interval a static and poke it., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
