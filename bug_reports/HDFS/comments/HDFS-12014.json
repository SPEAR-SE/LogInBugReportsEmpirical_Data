[I also could not figure out how submit patch works :(, I have now discovered this belongs in HDFS, but do not have permission to move. I didn't realize HDFS was separate from HADOOP., Hi [~alanj_impala_5a78],

Thanks for working on this. I added you to the contributor list and assigned the jira to you. You can refer to
https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute
for how to contribute.
, Do you have a suggestion for a good way to test this? Can you point me at a good example front-end test if those exist?]
