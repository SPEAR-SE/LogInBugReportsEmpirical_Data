[Here's a patch which addresses the issue by simply removing the check which is now overly-restrictive.

No tests are included since to test this adequately one needs multiple hosts and security to be enabled. I tested this patch on a secure 2-node HA cluster where each NN is configured itself to bind to 0.0.0.0, but is configured with an actual address for the other node. I confirmed that everything started up and checkpointing works as expected., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Does this present any issues for kerberos authentication on the multiple interfaces?  I think we'd need principals for each canonical hostname of all interfaces, which I'm not sure the security infrastructure will support?  Although perhaps I'm misunderstanding the issue., That's a great point, Daryn, and I agree with your analysis. Even though this patch will allow the NNs to start and function properly when bound to the wildcard address, clients (or DNs) will not in fact be able to connect on any interface not contained in the principal name used by the RPC server of the NN. A proper fix for this is thus somewhat more involved than I had originally anticipated., [~daryn], [~atm] It looks like after HADOOP-9789 , clients can be configured with *dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern* to make it accept a SPN that is different from the connecting namenode address.

But NN still complains when starting up due to this check, which is now clearly not required. I plan to rebase and commit this within a day if there are no objections., Rebasing against trunk.., \\

This message was automatically generated., No tests were included since as [~atm] had mentioned, Tested this manually on a 4 node secure-cluster and ensured both NNs came up and DNs were able to talk to them., +1
