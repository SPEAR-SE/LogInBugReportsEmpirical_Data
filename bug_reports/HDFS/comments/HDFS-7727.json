This message is automatically generated., Thanks Tianyin for the patch! I think it makes sense to move argument sanity check earlier. A few questions:
# Assuming there's a bad key file and a few good ones, is the current ssh fencing logic (without the patch) able to skip the bad file?
# Since the logic of handling these 2 config parameters are outside of the {{SshFenceByTcpPort}} class, I think it's worth testing the behavior (like the above) without the patch first.
