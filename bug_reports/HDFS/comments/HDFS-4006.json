[Here's the relevant NPE, looks like getFsImageName is returning NULL because the file was purged after the upload.

{code}
LOG.warn("Checkpoint done. New Image Size: "
             + dstStorage.getFsImageName(txid).length());
{code}
, This may be related to HDFS-3519 or HDFS-3806, Hey Eli. Do you happen to still have logs for this? I've been trying to repro the failure but can't seem to. I tried adding a sleep before the line in question, but that didn't provoke it., Actually in this test case, we don't start the checkpoint daemon thread at all. So it must be that we have some earlier test case which isn't joining on the checkpoint thread -- then the thread keeps running and fails during this test case when the setup() method blows away its storage underneath it. Will look at the other test methods to see if one of them is leaking a checkpointer thread., Actually managed to find an instance on our internal jenkins where this had failed. As suspected above, the error actually occurred on testSecondaryFailsWithErrorBeforeSettingHeaders and then ended up showing up as a failure for testSecondaryHasVeryOutOfDateImage.

The log is from a CDH4 branch but the code should be nearly identical to upstream, so still useful to help debug., I think this patch will fix the issue.

The issue was the following:
In testCheckpointTriggerOnTxnCount we were setting up a thread to run the SNN's checkpoint work loop, but not joining on it in the completion of the test. This was causing a race where the snn.close() call caused SecondaryNameNode.storage.close() to get called, which cleared the list of storage directories. Hence the getFsImageName() call was returning null if it raced with the completion of a checkpoint. I was able to reproduce this reliably by adding a sleep before the getFsImageName call, and then adding a join on the thread at the end of the test.

The fix is to actually make the checkpointer thread a member of the SecondaryNameNode, so that it can be properly shut down.

I also added code to the test that checks for any leftover checkpointer threads between tests as an extra safeguard against this kind of test bug., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
