[I'm uploading a patch that trims the response Content-Length to the maximum actual available content in the file, based on the request offset and length parameters.  I've added 2 new tests to cover a length parameter larger than the file length and also a combination of offset and length parameters that exceed file length., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
