[Quasi +1.  I really don't understand the JS magic but it looks straightforward.  All I know is sorting has been completely broken ever since it was added to the new ui.  I clicked around on a test NN and certainly seems to work.

Any other web experts want to review?  Otherwise I'll commit in a few days., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Reattaching the patch to kick the trunk precommit build.  Unfortunately the 2.8 patch naming caused to build branch-2.8.1, which still tried to download jdk7 from Oracle. It should be named to not match other existing branch unintentionally.   In any case, the build does not build or test the UI change., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
