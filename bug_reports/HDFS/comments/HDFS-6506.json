[Look at the log and code more throughly. The reason some block replica is invalidated is:
1. balancer round 1: move blk0 from dn0 to dn1, at this time block map haven't updated yet(so dn0 still have blk0)
2. balancer round 2 starts, and try to move blk0 from dn0 to dn2
3. dn2 copy data from dn0 
4. dn0 heartbeat and get cmd to delete blk0
5. try to move blk0 from dn0 to dn2 , it canot find dn0, but it has to delete a replica, so it delete dn1

To prevent this, balancer need to wait some time to make sure the block movements in last round is fully committed, otherwise the movements in last round may be invalided.

, Balancer already sleep 2*DFS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL seconds between rounds, but in TestBalancer.java:
{code}
    conf.setLong(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_KEY, 1L);
{code}
replica state update speed is related to DFS_NAMENODE_REPLICATION_INTERVAL too, which is 3 by default.
TestBalancer only change heartbeat interval(which changes heartbeat interval and balancer iteration sleep time), but doesn't change ReplicationMonitor check interval, so the sleep time is too small to wait for movements getting committed.
The other thing is 2*DFS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL still seems a little dangerous. maybe change it to 2*DFS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL + DFS_NAMENODE_REPLICATION_INTERVAL

This message is automatically generated., Unfortunately, it appears this patch has gone stale.  [~decster], would you mind updating the patch?  [~djp], would you mind +1'ing a new patch quickly if you don't have any other feedback?  I'm happy to take care of the commit if you're busy.  It would be nice to get this in and hopefully put an end to the spurious failures in the balancer tests.  Thanks!, Rebase patch to lastest trunk, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
