[I think this is easy to fix just by changing the PB namespace that the QJournal stuff is in.  This doesn't alter what gets sent over the wire, and I think (although I have not confirmed) that it won't alter the generated java code much (or at all?)., Hi, Colin.  Did you come across this while working on the new C client code?  Is this a duplicate of HDFS-4909, which reports duplicate symbols during link while trying to compile our protobuf specs to C?

A nice side effect of this change is that we'll no longer need to split our protoc calls into multiple Maven executions in the pom.xml files., Yeah, I encountered this when working on the C client code.  And I suppose it is a dupe, thanks for finding that!]
