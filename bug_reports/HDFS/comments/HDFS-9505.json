[I haven't done a full read, but here are a few of the problems:

"There is a plan to support appending-writes to files in the future."

"HDFS does not yet implement user quotas or access permissions"

"Currently, automatic restart and failover of the NameNode software to
another machine is not supported.", bq. "There is a plan to support appending-writes to files in the future."
This sentence was fixed in HDFS-8852. The rest should be fixed., I would like to start working on this. If someone is already on this, ping me please., bq. "Currently, automatic restart and failover of the NameNode software to another machine is not supported."

This was fixed by HDFS-8914.
, The statement that "all blocks in a file except the last block are the same size" is not always true after HDFS-3689., I attached 001.

* fixed description about quota and permission.
* fixed description about variable block size (HDFS-3689).
* added description  about stale state of datanodes (HDFS-3703).
* fixed description about snapshot support.
* fixed description about client-side buffering.
* added hyperlinks.
* fixed formatting nits.
, I reattached the patch to fix formatting issue., Long lines in markdown documentation is side effect of conversion from APT format. I added line breaks to rerevant lines of this jira for ease of future editing and diff tracking.

Please use {{git diff --word-diff}} to see the change of contents.
, Thank you [~iwasakims] for refleshing the document! Mostly looks good to me. Two comments from me:
1. hadoop fs -expunge actually does not delete all the files in trash. Please see HADOOP-12374 for the detail.
bq. Work is in progress to expose HDFS through the WebDAV protocol.
2. There is a jira for WebDAV (HDFS-225) but there have been no updates for more than 6 years. Instead, we should document that HDFS now supports NFSv3., Thanks for the review comments, [~ajisakaa].

bq. hadoop fs -expunge actually does not delete all the files in trash.

I'm going to move relevant part to "FileSystem Shell" guide and fix the description because trash is (basically) the feature of hadoop-common and could be relevant to other file systems.

bq. There is a jira for WebDAV (HDFS-225) but there have been no updates for more than 6 years. Instead, we should document that HDFS now supports NFSv3.

Yeah. I agree.
, I attached updated patch as 002.

* made it clearer that moving files to trash is a feature of FS shell.
* moved contents of "HDFS Trash Management" section to under "File Deletes and Undeletes" section.
* moved part of contents about trash feature to FileSystem Shell guide.
* removed description about WebDAV and added NFS gateway instead.

, +1, thanks Masatake., Committed v2 patch to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.8, and branch-2.7. Thanks [~iwasakims] for the contribution!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #9007 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/9007/])
HDFS-9505. HDFS Architecture documentation needs to be refreshed. (aajisaka: rev fa544020f6f71ee993f047c9b986c047a25ed84c)
* hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/CHANGES.txt

, Thanks, [~ajisakaa]!, Closing the JIRA as part of 2.7.3 release., FYI, I have filed HDFS-11995 for another inaccuracy in the HDFS Architecture documentation that remains even after this patch was committed.]
