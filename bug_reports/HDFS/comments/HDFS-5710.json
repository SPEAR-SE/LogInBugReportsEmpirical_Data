[Test output from Jenkins., I remember I have fixed this issue HDFS-4482 and merged to branch-2 also. Let me check if this issue is same., Looking at latest code, NPE is still possible. , {code}
 /** Return the full path name of the specified inode */
  static String getFullPathName(INode inode) {
    INode[] inodes = getFullPathINodes(inode);
    return getFullPathName(inodes, inodes.length - 1);
  }
{code}
Yes, here NPE is possible. getFullPathINodes may return null in file deletion race, so, here in next line it is getting length on that., Just returning empty string in case if inodes become null when its called with out holding global lock. getFullPathName called many places. Instead of retuning null and checking evrywhere null, returning empty string may be ok.
