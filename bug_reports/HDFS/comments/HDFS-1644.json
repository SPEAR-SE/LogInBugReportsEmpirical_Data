[There was an issue in common - HADOOP-6970.
The fix was to disable creating of SecurityAudit.audit file in all cases except when starting a server(running hadoop-daemon.sh).
Do you have this patch applied?
, This bug exists in branch-0.20-security branch.  It appears this is resolved in trunk.  I will close this as duplicated.  Thanks Boris., Resolved by HADOOP-6970.]
