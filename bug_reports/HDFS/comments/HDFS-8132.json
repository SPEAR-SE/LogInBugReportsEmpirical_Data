15/04/13 22:30:54 INFO namenode.NameNode: STARTUP_MSG: , [~tlipcon] any pointers to this issue..?, Hello [~brahmareddy].  I don't really know anything about JCarder, but it looks like the tool couldn't interpret some bytecode.  I wonder if the tool is tied to the Java 6 class format.  Hadoop 2.7.0 is our first release that compiled Java 7 class files.  Hadoop 2.6.0 was compiled as Java 6., Yea, I'm guessing the same issue -- probably getting confused by some Java7 bytecode.

I'm guessing that jcarder needs to be updated to use a new version of the 'asm' dependency - it's on a very old one (asm 2.2.2). The ASM changelog indicates that 4.0 was the first version with "full support for Java 7"., [~cnauroth] and [~tlipcon] thanks a lot for your pointers.. Seems to be Jcarder needs to update..Going to close this issue..any further comments ..?, Nope. Feel free to send me a pull request for https://github.com/toddlipcon/jcarder/tree/lockclasses (this is the branch we were using internally until we switched to java7), Thanks [~tlipcon].. I am closing this Jira... I will create pull request and try to fix in Jcarder.., [~brahma], Is this issue resolved? Where can I access the latest Jcarder that works with Java7?, [~vijaykalluru] JCarder need not to update its build for attaching to Hadoop version. You can download existing JCarder-2.0 build and attache to hadoop. While attaching agent, make sure to add *-noverify* flag i.e {{-noverify -javaagent:/jcarder.jar=outputdir=/jcarder/rm}}, [~rohit12sh], Thank you for helping me get unblocked here. I could get jcarder to run successfully with -noverify flag.]
