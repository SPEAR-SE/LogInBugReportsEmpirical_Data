[interesting. But at least it failed...a bigger risk would be if the file was changed to a new file of the same size...if the read crossed a block boundary, you could end up with a mix of the old and new data. You'd be hard pressed to safely identify the problem, other than by comparing the source checksum before the upload began with the source checksum after it had finished

# I think the first step here would be to document what you must not do while an upload is in progress: append/replace files
# longer term: if, after an upload, identify when the source has changed, warn and maybe repeat the upload. That'd be with a checksum on HDFS; modified timestamp elsewhere
