This message was automatically generated., Testcase failures are unrelated and raised jira to track (HDFS-8692).., Hi [~brahmareddy], thanks for submitting this fix.

We should remove the line {{ToolRunner.printGenericCommandUsage(System.err);}} instead. Looks like removing printUsage will only print the generic options., [~arpitagarwal] thanks a lot for taking a look into this issue..

Yes, you are correct..Updated the patch..Kindly review..
, Thanks for the updated patch.

+1 pending Jenkins.
