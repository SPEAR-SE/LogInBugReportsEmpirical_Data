This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~zhz]. Just few minor comments:
# Could you change {code}/** Set the blocks. */{code} to {code}/** Clear the blocks. */{code}.
# There is one minor checkstyle warning, please fix the same.

+1 (non-binding) once this is addressed., Thanks Rakesh for reviewing the patch! Updating the patch to address the the wrong comment message and checkstyle issue. The test failure and timeout are unrelated and pass fine locally. The new patch also corrects a mistake in the new test., +1 pending Jenkins., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks Jing for reviewing! {{testDatanodeRestarts}} is unrelated to the patch (the only non-formatting change is to replace all {{setBlocks(null)}} with {{clearBlocks()}}, and it passes locally., I've committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks Zhe for the contribution!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8149 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8149/])
