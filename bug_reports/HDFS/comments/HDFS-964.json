This message is automatically generated., Hi [~aw], this seems a good idea, why is it marked as "Won't Fix"? 
any reason, does it cause incompatibility issue? , HI [~aw], would you please share your thoughts about why this jira is marked as "Won't Fix"?  Thanks a lot.


, I closed it because 

a) I opened it, so my jira
b) it's my patch
c) I got tired of waiting for some other committer to actually bother to look at *a one line patch*, despite all the followers.
, Thanks [~aw].
