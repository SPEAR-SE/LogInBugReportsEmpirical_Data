[It really weird that FileSystem.getCanonicalServiceName() is calling SecurityUtil.buildDTServiceName() to get the canonical service name. SecurityUtil.buildDTServiceName() tries to create a socket by the passed URI. Since it is a logic URI, it fails the job submission. 
, Looks like we need to override FileSystem.getCanonicalServiceName in DistributedFileSystem so that the canonical name is just the logical name, for the case of HA HDFS file systems., A patch for the issue: overriding getCanonicalServiceName() at DistributedFileSystem. 

After this patch gets applied, I can have a mapred job running with ha + security. , Thanks for the patch, Mingjie! A small formatting nit: can you change the // comments for the new test case to be a javadoc-style comment, and move the @Test annotation to be on the line just above the method? This way it will match the style used elsewhere., New patch addresses Todd's comments. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Commit r1401158 | suresh | 2012-10-22 21:34:49 -0700 (Mon, 22 Oct 2012)
incorrectly attributed this bug to a fix in release 1.2.0, in both CHANGES.txt and svn log.
The correct reference should have been HDFS-4062 not 3062.  Fixed CHANGES.txt.]
