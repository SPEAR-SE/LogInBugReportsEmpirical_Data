[Is this a dupe of HDFS-10763 ?, another version -  2.7.1.2.3.0.0-2557,  the same bug, I think it is fixed in 2.7.4 and 2.7.1.2.3.0.0-2557 is before 2.7.4
I wouldn't expect the fix would be there unless you cherry-picked it in your internal builds., I am wondering if a different bug caused the same error as HDFS-10763. We found the same error on a CDH version with HDFS-10763 patched (CDH 5.13.1). No full logs as NN log was rotated.

 

The client application is Flume. The NameNode had a failover. The version of Flume we have would abort when a close() times out due to the failover (it does not retry), and then invokes recoverLease().

 

But I think, since the reporter is on a version with no HDFS-10763, we can close this out. I'll file a new one when I gather more information.]
