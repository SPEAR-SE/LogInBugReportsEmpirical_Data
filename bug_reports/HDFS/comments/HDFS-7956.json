[Otherwise it is hard to identify DNs when they register, send reports or heartbeats. Because the main DN port is not printed anywhere in DatanodeRegistration.
Current:
{code}DatanodeRegistration(127.0.0.1, datanodeUuid=532f1c1f-fe09-4ad4-8d7d-c58f7b8b32b0, infoPort=35614 ...){code}
Desired:
{code}DatanodeRegistration(127.0.0.1:46044, datanodeUuid=532f1c1f-fe09-4ad4-8d7d-c58f7b8b32b0, infoPort=35614 ...){code}
The fix is to simply print {{DatanodeID}} via {{super.toString()}} instead of {{getIpAddr()}}, Attaching patch to address Konstantin's comment., +1. Lets trigger Jenkins, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
