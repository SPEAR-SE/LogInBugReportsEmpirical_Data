[I've added an initial patch., Hey Kousuke, Colin's been working on improvements to FSShell related to symlinks at HDFS-4019, and I think meets your use case. See:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4019?focusedCommentId=13717784&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13717784

If you find this satisfactory, we can dupe this JIRA to HDFS-4019.
, Andrew, thank you for letting me know.
I got it and close this jira as a dupulication of HDFS-4019.]
