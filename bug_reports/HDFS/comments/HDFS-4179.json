[The patch 
- makes BN accept read commands, but not CN. 
- Checkpointer first uploads all files then loads them in memory.
- Safemode on BN should be set to unreachable threshold. Also there was an assert triggered by doConsistencyCheck() for BN.
- Added a test case that verifies reads for BN and CN., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Could anybody please review this., I plan to commit this over weekend if there are no suggestions. Need to make progress in the evolution as Eli suggested in HDFS-4114., As you know, the policy for trunk is review-then-commit. Unless there is someone willing to +1, I don't think you can commit it without an exception to the policy. If you think an exception is warranted, we should discuss it on the mailing list first in order to set out some guidelines for when you don't need RTC on trunk., You were complaining that I am not maintaining BackupNode code. 
Are you willing to help my maintenance effort by reviewing this trivial patch?, I was complaining that the general community doesn't seem interested in maintaining the code. If only a single committer is interested in the code, that doesn't seem like enough justification -- isn't that part of the reason we do code reviews? It ensures that the bus factor on the project is greater than 1 -- if you end up winning the lottery and retiring to Hawaii, there should be at least one other committer who thinks the BackupNode is a good idea and wants to help maintain it., > I was complaining that the general community doesn't seem interested in maintaining the code.

Just to remind, this is the exact wording you used:
["Konstantin: ... Even if you are using the BN in an older version or a private fork, it is clear that you aren't maintaining it in current releases."|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4114?focusedCommentId=13488914&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13488914]

I disagree with you on both issues of a single committer contribution and the reasons we do code reviews. But I would rather stick to the essence of the jira that is fixing the BackupNode.
You did not answer my question. But if you are not interested in helping, then what are these lottery and Hawaii all about., OK, to be clear: I'm not interested in reviewing it, because I don't see what the BN offers aside from other already-existing approaches. So, I can't personally devote time to it.

And I don't think "no one wants to review this" is valid reason to commit without a review., +1 patch looks good. Tests are passing on the trunk., I just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3048 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3048/])
