This message is automatically generated., Hi Anu.  Nice work tracking down this bug.  The patch looks mostly good.  I have just a few comments on the tests.
# I think we can get the tests running on Windows.  To do that, we'd remove the {{assumeTrue}} calls and add cmd scripts equivalent to the bash scripts.  In the calls to your helper function, you can use {{org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell#appendScriptExtension}} to set it up to call either the sh or the cmd file, i.e.: {{HelperFunction("/" + Shell.appendScriptExtension("topology-script"))}}.
# Instead of using a script that is syntactically broken, can we have a script that is hard-coded to do {{exit 1}}?  We're about to add ShellCheck static analysis of the bash code into our pre-commit runs.  I can see that ShellCheck will flag an error in this script, so I'd like to avoid false notifications.

Thanks!, update the patch to run on windows, and fix the script to return exit 1 in case of a broken script. Thanks to chris for writing the windows part of scripts., Removing Fix-version. Please use Target-version for the intended release and let committers set the fix-version at commit time., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch v002 looks good.  I have just one more small request.  The import of {{SystemUtils}} is now unused in {{TestDatanodeManager}}, so let's remove it.  I'll be +1 after that.  Thanks!, +1 for the v002 patch. Holding off committing so Chris's feedback can be addressed., remove unused import, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
