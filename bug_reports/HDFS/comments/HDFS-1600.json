Created HADOOP-7120., As explained in HDFS-1448 (test-patch comment) editsStored.xml should not be changed, it is a reference file for tests (test results are compared to this file). I did not know where to add it for it to be ignored (asked around but it seemed that the test-patch warning can be just ignored, there are other files that also miss the licence)., here's a patch which just updates the excludes for rat, -1 overall.
