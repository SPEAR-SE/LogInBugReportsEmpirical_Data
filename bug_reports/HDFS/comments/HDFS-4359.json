[attached "dn.jstack" is the DN's thread dump, Just one line change:), Hi Liang Xie. I noticed that there isn't a deadlock on this node alone, but the thread holding the lock is stuck in a 'versionRequest()' RPC. Any idea why this RPC is taking a long time hearing back from the NN? See the thread "DataNode: [file:/home/work/data1/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data2/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data3/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data4/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data5/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data6/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data7/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data8/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data9/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data10/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data11/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode,file:/home/work/data12/hdfs/lgprc-xiaomi/datanode]  heartbeating to /10.2.201.14:11200" daemon prio=10 tid=0x00007fd34c8e4800 nid=0xa2d in Object.wait() [0x00007fd2db3e0000]", Yes, the root cause is at namenode side,  this issue is just against to datanode,  we can remove the "synchronized" keyword safely per thread dump and source code,  though it didn't help for the whole hung accident:)


bq. the thread holding the lock is stuck in a 'versionRequest()' RPC. Any idea why this RPC is taking a long time hearing back from the NN?
yes, we've figured it out several days before, one of DNS servers is in accident, but the thread dump is really interesting, i've uploaded the NN thread dump for you enjoy it:)   btw, the JUCL lock is not easy to find the lock-holder, which make us difficult to analyis..., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., emmm, the jenkins picked attached dump files as patch:-P, Looks like the root cause was HDFS-3990?, really thanks for the valued info, [~tlipcon], i'll look into it deeply, seems very very similar at first glance, I agree that the synchronized keyword here is unnecessary, given that the underlying list is in fact thread safe. I also manually verified that removing this synchronization allows for publication of the metrics to proceed even if the DN's BPOfferService is blocked because of a slow NN.

I'm +1 on this change. Unless I hear any objections, I'm going to commit this tomorrow., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
