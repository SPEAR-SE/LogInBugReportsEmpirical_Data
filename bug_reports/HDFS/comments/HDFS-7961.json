[Trigger a full block report after hot swap DataNode volumes. 
Added a test to verify the full block report is sent., maybe {{testFullBlockReportAfterHotSwappingVolumes}} should be named something like {{testFullBlockReportAfterRemovingVolumesViaHotSwap}} ?

This message is automatically generated., TestTracing failure is unrelated, see HDFS-7965.  TestMover failure is unrelated... it passed for me locally.

However, I ran this locally and I got:
