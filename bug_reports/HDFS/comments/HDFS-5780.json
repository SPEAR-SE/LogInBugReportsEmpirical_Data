[Attaching the patch.
We need to change the conditions in the test because the test failure is due to the Replication Monitor coming and making the changes to the corrupted block before the test checks for it. The test will than keep on waiting for the change to happen., Thanks for reporting and fixing this [~mitdesai].

If 60 seconds was too short as the test timeout I suggest increasing it to 5 or 10 minutes instead of just 70 seconds. It is okay for these timeouts to be conservative.

Coding style nitpicks:
# There should be spaces around the = sign in {{liveReplicas=countReplicas}}
# Spaces around the + sign in {{"+liveReplicas}}.
# Space after the {{//}} for comments.

The patch looks good otherwise., Thanks Arpit. I will address your concerns and post another patch., Attaching the new patch with the addressed changes. I have increased the timeout to 10minutes and I had to make few other timing related changes., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
