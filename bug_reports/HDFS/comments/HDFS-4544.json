[Looking FSDataSet.invalidate code, I see all the errors could be following :
# The blockinfo not found in volumeMap
# The block not found in blockMap
# There is not volume corresponding to the block
# The parent directory does not exist

Also the delete itself happens asynchronously. So none of the errors above could be because of disk errors. I propose we go ahead remove check the checkDiskError() call from the above try catch loop., +1. This seems like a good change., It looks like no patch is needed for trunk., Reattaching the correct patch., +1 for the patch. It seems like a trivial change to not check for disk error. I am going to commit this change shortly., I think this also applies to trunk. Some of the code is reorganized in trunk.
