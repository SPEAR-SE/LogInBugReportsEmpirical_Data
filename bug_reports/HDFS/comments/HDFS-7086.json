[This behaviour is consistent with HDFS and other implementations of {{FileSystem}}, because {{create(Path)}} defaults to overwrite
{code}
/**
   * Create an FSDataOutputStream at the indicated Path.
   * Files are overwritten by default.
   * @param f the file to create
   */
  public FSDataOutputStream create(Path f) throws IOException {
    return create(f, true);
  }
{code}

Looking at the filesystem.md and {{AbstractContractCreateTest}}, I don't see where this is explicitly called out or tested for. Doing both of these would ensure that when someone got round to doing contract tests for WebHDFS its consistency with HDFS can be validated.
