[I've attached a patch for this issue., Thanks for filing a JIRA. I noticed this when I was looking the JIRA HDFS-5728.
Actually validate integrity check not necessary when it is set to NULL. It should consider full file length as is.
I think  the below array becomes 0 length array when checksumSize 0? 
{code}
byte[] buf = new byte[lastChunkSize+checksumSize];
{code}

So, how about just considering blockFileLength when crc type is NULL? Because crc is null now, so we need not care about integrity check with CRC file at all right., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

At first, I thought same as you.
I thought it's good to branch the logic depending on whether checksum type is NULL or not.
But, on second thought, BlockPoolSlice should not have logic which depends specific checksum algorithm.
How to verify is responsibility of each checksum algorithm.
