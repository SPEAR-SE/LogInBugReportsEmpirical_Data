[This is similar to HDFS-5122, Fork-lifting comment https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5221?focusedCommentId=13770133&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13770133

from HDFS-5221 over here to keep the discussion in one place.

We're thinking of two approaches:
1) Fixing the hdfs-client when the hftp is used to use a retry mechanism to fail over to the active NN
2) Use URL re-direction from the standby to the active NN.

Advantage of 1) is that it will work even if the (previously) active NN host is completely down, or if the NN process is not running at all.

Advantage of 2) is that it will give some benefits / resilience, even if Hadoop 1.0 clients are not modified.
, [~andrew.wang] saw your comment in HDFS-5221.
Seems approach 1) is great, but not enough to solve ability to copy Hadoop 1.x cluster to a Hadoop 2.x cluster. For that we need approach 2)., hftp is deprecated and removed in Hadoop3. Resolve it as won't fix.]
