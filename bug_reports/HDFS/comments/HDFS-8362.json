This message was automatically generated., Thanks for reporting this, [~mohammad]. Maven seems to work fine even if sources are placed in the directory mismatching to the package. IDEs such as Eclipse may complain about this.

Though moving files to relevant directory has smaller effect, I think it is OK to change the package names because they are not imported from anywhere in hadoop and [compatibility guide|http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Compatibility.html#Build_artifacts] states that tests are strictly for internal use.

I'm +1(non-binding) for this.

As patch is modifying test cases, checkstyle is not applicable here

These test case failures are not because of this patch. 
hadoop.tools.TestHdfsConfigFields is failing because properties "dfs.htrace.spanreceiver.classes" and "dfs.client.htrace.spanreceiver.classes" are not added in org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSConfigKeys.
hadoop.tracing.TestTraceAdmin is failing because of recent changed in TraceAdmin file.
similarly hadoop.hdfs.TestDatanodeDeath has other reason for failure.

{color:blue} I think it would be more appropriate to commit this patch and let the test case failures be handled as part of other jira or the jira which caused these failures.{color}
 
, Hi [~arshad.mohammad],
can you separate the patch for HDFS and Mapreduce ?
For HDFS changes you can use this Jira, and MapReduce changes can you re-open  MAPREDUCE-6360 and submit patch there?, Thanks [~vinayrpet]
Separated HDFS and Mapreduce portions and submited HDFS-8362-2.patch for this issue, \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks for finding this error.  Two comments:

1) I'm fine with moving the file to the right location or changing the package.  Either will give the correct test run.

2) I've created HDFS-8371 for the new .xml properties.
, I'm fine with integrating HDFS-8371 into this patch and marking it as a duplicate, or getting the other JIRA submitted separately., HDFS-8371 is the result of the test. (which is why test was added), so better to be in separate jira.
Let this jira target only compilation error fix., +1 on latest patch to just to rename the package in file., Committed to trunk and branch-2.
Thanks [~arshad.mohammad] for the contribution.

, From CI link, not getting reason why Compilation failed. I compiled locally it is passing. can anybody suggest me actions i shall take to correct the compilation error?, Thats not compilation failure. Thats some enforcement check failure.
