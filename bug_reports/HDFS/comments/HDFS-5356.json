This message is automatically generated., I don't think {{FileSystem#closeAll}} is what we want to call here.  That will close all filesystems, regardless of whether they relate to the {{MiniDFSCluster}}.  Remember that {{MiniDFSCluster}} is not a singleton.  Multiple instances can exist.

We might be able to do something smarter here that would close just the {{FileSystem}} objects that pertain to the {{MiniDFSCluster}}.

However, have you considered just fixing the metrics tests to close the {{FileSystem}} objects they create?  That seems like the simplest thing to do., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~cmccabe] I've replaced {{FileSystem#closeAll}} with another approach. Kindly look at the latest patch when you get some time. Thanks!

I think, the test failures are unrelated.
{code}
Tests in error: 
  TestFSImageWithAcl.setUp:52 java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/io/IOUtils$NullOutputStream
  TestFSImageWithAcl.tearDown:58 NullPointerException

, Can we just change TestFileCreation.java and TestRenameWithSnapshots.java to call FileSystem#close manually?  This seems simpler., Thanks [~cmccabe] for the reply. Yes, that would be fine for these two test cases. But as the the defect says, should we have a generic way of closing all the {{filesystems}} during minidfs#shutdown?., Hi Rakesh,

That's a very fair question.  I agree that it's nicer in theory to have {{MiniDFSCluster#shutdown}} call close on every FS.

What happened in practice is that almost all the long-lived resources have moved out of FileSystem (and its delegate DFSClient) and into ClientContext.  This happened because the FileContext API doesn't have a close function, and a lot of the code is shared.

FileSystem#close has also created a lot of problems over the years because while we give out the same FS instance to multiple caller of FileSystem#get, we don't reference count it (meaning that one thread which calls close on it can shut it down even if there are other users).  This shouldn't be a problem in unit tests, but it is one reason hadoop FS closing doesn't happen that often in real systems.

All that being said, I would be OK with the change you have now if you checked whether the FS was in the fileSystems list prior to adding it.  Currently it appears like we may call close twice on the same fs if MiniDFSCluster#getFileSystemInstance was called more than once., Thanks [~cmccabe] for the explanation and helps to understand it more.
bq.I would be OK with the change you have now if you checked whether the FS was in the fileSystems list prior to adding it. Currently it appears like we may call close twice on the same fs if MiniDFSCluster#getFileSystemInstance was called more than once.
Yeah, thats good point. I think making the datastructure to {{java.util.Set}} instead of {{java.util.List}} would be sufficient to avoid the duplicates. Could you please have a look at the new patch when you get some time., Hi [~rakeshr], thanks for the patch.
Here are some comments.

Here need to passdown {{deleteDfsDir}}
{code}   public void shutdown(boolean deleteDfsDir) {
+    shutdown(false, true);
+  }{code}

I Don't think below change are necessary in TestFileCreation.java.
{code}+    DistributedFileSystem fs1 = null;{code}
in-fact you can remove the original re-assignment code after cluster restart. That should ideally work as the NameNode restarted with same ports and data. I have verified ;)
{code}fs = cluster.getFileSystem();{code}


Changes in TestRenameWithSnapshots.java are not at all required as {{hdfs}} is re-initialized everytime cluster is restarted. Let it close the FS during shutdown., Thanks a lot [~vinayrpet] for the comments.

bq. Changes in TestRenameWithSnapshots.java are not at all required as hdfs is re-initialized everytime cluster is restarted. Let it close the FS during shutdown.
I could see {{TestRenameWithSnapshots#testAppendFileAfterRenameInSnapshot}} is failing in my environment and with my changes in {{TestRenameWithSnapshots.java}} this  is passing. Could you run and see the result., For me all tests in TestRenameWithSnapshots are passing even without the complete patch., bq. For me all tests in TestRenameWithSnapshots are passing even without the complete patch.
Above one was my other account. ;)
, It is failing when comparing {{SnapshotTestHelper.compareDumpedTreeInFile(fsnBefore, fsnMiddle, compareQuota);}}. fsnBefore and fsnMiddle differs in their {{storagespace}} values.

{code}, bq. It is failing when comparing SnapshotTestHelper.compareDumpedTreeInFile(fsnBefore, fsnMiddle, compareQuota);. fsnBefore and fsnMiddle differs in their storagespace values.
This seems unrelated to closure of filesystem.
OK now I got. If you are closing the filesystem, then open files are being closed which results in diff in these image sizes.
I didnt check that image file sizes were being checked in the test. I just told about the functionality., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
