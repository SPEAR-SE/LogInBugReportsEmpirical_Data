This message is automatically generated., [~wheat9], Jenkins only runs the submitted patch against trunk. There is no need to submit a patch, if it is for non-trunk., testPatch result:

-1 overall.  

+1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

-1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
                    Please justify why no tests are needed for this patch.

+1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

+1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

-1 findbugs.  The patch appears to introduce 223 new Findbugs (version 2.0.2) warnings.

I manually looked into the results of findbugs. The results before and after the patches are identical, thus the -1 from findbugs might due to a bug in the test script or my configuration on the test machine.
, The patch looks good to me. Only one nit: now with the change some shouldRetry methods no longer throw exception, thus we can remove "throw Exception" from their definition. 

Besides, could you please also post the "ant test" results?

+1 after the above addressed., After some discussions it seems the most reasonable way to accomplish this task is to simply silent the warnings., +1. Will commit it shortly., Test locally., Thanks [~wheat9]! I've committed this to branch-1.]
