[There are 2 components to this patch:

# I'm providing a new copy of hadoop-22-dfs-dir.tgz, attached to this issue.  It's equivalent to the old one, but does not contain links.  As a side effect, the file is bigger, because bytes are duplicated where previously they were shared via hard links.  Before: ~170K compressed, ~40 MB uncompressed.  After: ~310K compressed, ~80 MB uncompressed.  The compressed version is what's stored in the repo, so this doesn't really make the source tree much bigger.
# While investigating, I noticed a code path in {{TestDFSUpgradeFromImage}} where we could fail to shutdown a {{MiniDFSCluster}}.  In practice, this isn't an issue, but I'd like to clean it up.

To the committer: please download and commit hadoop-22-dfs-dir.tgz independent of the patch file.  It's a binary file, so I couldn't include it in the patch file.  It needs to go in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/resources and overwrite the existing file.

I tested this successfully on Mac (bsdtar), Ubuntu (GNU tar), and Windows (commons-compress).
