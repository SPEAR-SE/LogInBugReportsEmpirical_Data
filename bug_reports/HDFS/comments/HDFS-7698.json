[* It is not necessary (or useful) to synchronize {{HdfsDataInputStream#getReadStatistics}} on the {{HdfsDataInputStream}} lock.  getReadStatistics is synchronized inside {{DFSInputStream}} already, and the methods modifying the statistics are not synchronized on {{HdfsDataInputStream}}.

* Add a {{ReadStatistics#clear}} method which clears the stats.

* Add {{libhdfs}} support for clearing the read statistics.

* The {{ReadStatistics}} need to be synchronized on {{infoLock}}, not on the positional lock.  {{pread}} modifies these statistics, and it shouldn't have to take the positional lock to do that.  This could have resulted in lost updates or incorrect read statistics being read when doing {{preads}} (but not when doing regular reads under the positional lock)., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Colin for the patch.
It looks good to me, just few comments. +1 after addressing.
# In DFSInputStream#tryReadZeroCopy, we should also hold the {{infoLock}} for {{readStatistics}}.
# For HdfsDataInputStream#getAllBlocks, we could remove the {{synchronized}} too., bq. In DFSInputStream#tryReadZeroCopy, we should also hold the infoLock for readStatistics.

good catch

bq. For HdfsDataInputStream#getAllBlocks, we could remove the synchronized too.

good point, let's do that
