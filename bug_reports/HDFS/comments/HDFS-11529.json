[We added a "hdfsGetLastError" call using thread local state like you're proposing in the C API for libhdfs++ (HDFS-8707).  It's been very useful in practice for HDFS stuff that doesn't map directly to posix errnos., [~James C] It looks like libhdfs++ hasn't been pushed to master yet. Is that right? I'm not able to find this 'hdfsGetLastError' there:
https://github.com/apache/hadoop/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=hdfsGetLastError, [~sailesh] You're correct, it hasn't been pushed to master yet though I'd like to get the ball rolling on that in the next few months once a handful of known issues are resolved (cleaning up docs, exporting headers in the distribution build etc).

The hdfsGetLastError function is on line 82 here: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/HDFS-8707/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-native-client/src/main/native/libhdfspp/lib/bindings/c/hdfs.cc and was added with HDFS-9627.  It'd be very cool to see libhdfs implement something similar., [~James C] Thank you very much for the pointer! And yes, as users of libhdfs, we increasingly see it becoming a necessity., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Hadoop QA doesn't seem to track native tests. Tests have been added to test_libhdfs_threaded.c, Hi [~sailesh], it'd be good to document the memory ownership/lifetime of the strings returned by the two new functions hdfGetLastException*(). i.e. the caller doesn't know from the description whether:
1) it needs to free the memory returned. i.e. is the string copied and ownership passed to the caller?
2) if not copied by libhdfs, when does the returned string become invalid?
Also, in the documentation comment, maybe be more specific about what "on this thread" means., Thanks for the comments [~dhecht], I've addressed them in the next patch., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Nice improvement.

{{printExceptionAndFreeV}}: This function is intended to print exceptions and then free them.  If you are overloading it to set thread-local data, you should change the name to reflect that.  Something like {{handleExceptionAndFree}} would work.  You also need to document this information in the function doxygen, found in {{exception.h}}.

It seems to me that the thread-local exception should be set regardless of whether {{noPrint}} is true or not.  {{noPrint}} was intended to avoid spammy logging for things we expected to happen, but not to skip setting the error return.  The thread-local storage is essentially an out-of-band way of returning more error data, so I don't see why it should be affected by {{noPrint}}.

{code}
    /**
     * Get the last exception root cause that happened in the context of the
     * current thread, i.e. the thread that called into libHDFS.
     *
     * The pointer returned by this function is guaranteed to be valid until
     * the next call into libHDFS by the current thread.
     * Users of this function should not free the pointer.
     *
     * @return           The root cause as a C-string.
     */
    LIBHDFS_EXTERNAL
    char* hdfsGetLastExceptionRootCause();
{code}
You need to document what a {{NULL}} return means here.

{{getJNIEnv}} should free and zero out these thread-local pointers.  Otherwise the exception text from one call may bleed into another, since there are still some code paths that don't set the thread-local error status.

It is not related to your patch, but I just noticed that {{hdfsGetHosts}} doesn't set {{errno}} on failure.  Do you mind fixing that?, {quote}

, Thank you [~sailesh] for working on the patch. Here is my review for patch 002.

exception.c
#149: Why rename? Doesn’t the function still print it? This touches off so many one-line changes.
#178: Double space

exception.h
#23: Please update the javadoc:

expect.h
#168,169: Even though other places have done it, but I still find double-underscore prefix wrong because variables with double-underscore prefix are supposed to be reserved.
#168-181: Replace “str” and “substr” in macro body with “(str)” and “(substr)”

posix/thread_local_storage.c
#32: Any reason to remove the javadoc?

Testing
I tried the patch on Centos 7.2. Unit tests passed.
Any testing done on Windows?, Thanks [~jzhuge]!

{quote}
This was a comment left by Colin. The reason for the name change is that it now does more than just print the exception. It also handles it by updating the TLS, so leaving the name as printExceptionAndFree() would have been a little misleading.

{quote}
Unfortunately I do not have a Windows setup and I've been told by a PMC member that Windows is not supported. Also, there was a bug in there (on trunk) for Windows that would have made it unusable, which means that no one is using it, looks like. I just modified the code to work with the new changes as best effort., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, bq. This was a comment left by Colin. The reason for the name change is that it now does more than just print the exception. It also handles it by updating the TLS, so leaving the name as printExceptionAndFree() would have been a little misleading.

Guess we are in pretty subjective territory. Just hate to see many one-liners, maybe keeping {{printExceptionAndFree}} as a wrapper of {{handleExceptionAndFree}}? My 2 cents. [~cmccabe] Could you comment?

bq. Unfortunately I do not have a Windows setup and I've been told by a PMC member that Windows is not supported. Also, there was a bug in there (on trunk) for Windows that would have made it unusable, which means that no one is using it, looks like. I just modified the code to work with the new changes as best effort.

[~cnauroth] Could you please comment and review the Windows changes?, {quote}

After pondering it more, the wrapper is not a good idea. I am leaning a little bit towards staying with {{printExceptionAndFree}} but don't object to {{handleExceptionAndFree}}., Thanks for the follow up.
