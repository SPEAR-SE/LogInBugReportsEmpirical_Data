[Hey Brahma,
 Is it reproducing for you reliably? 
 By looking at the trace, it seems to me that, the initialization order could cause the problem. DataXicever servers are getting initialized first than BlockPoolsManagers. So, FSDataSet might not be initialized but your are able accept requests. Since you restarted the Node in 10mins itself, NN would have not detected your DN shutdown. So, NN still give this deadDN adress to your clients. When it is trying to write the block, it is throwing the NPE at replicaInfo = datanode.data.createTemporary(block);.
Is this is the case for you?, As per my understanding there should not be any major impacts to the users due to this error. If so, could you please mark this as minor?, HI Uma,

Thanks for analysis.Seems to same happening.

It's always able reprodcue by executing mentioned scenario.., Simple patch to avoid NPE. Instead throwing IOException]
