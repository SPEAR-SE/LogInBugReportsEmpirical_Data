[New patch fixes the build and also verified the TestRename runs successfully., I tested this patch local and it worked fine.   It would be good to get this commited soon so that the build gets up broken., This fixes the complie error, but build is still failing with
{code}
BUILD FAILED
hdfs/build.xml:335: hdfs/build-fi/compile-fi.log doesn't exist
{code}, Can you try "ant injectfaults", looks like that is the target to trigger compilation of fault injection, which sets up all the build dependencies., +1
May be we should add a comment that "compile-fault-inject" target should not be called directly., Cannot run test-patch due to build failure. TestRename unit test passed., Committed the patch to trunk., bq. May be we should add a comment that "compile-fault-inject" target should not be called directly. 

"compile-fault-inject" shouldn't be called directly - it isn't a top-level target. Actually, to _prevent_ people from running it directly we can rename it to "-compile-fault-inject". How about this?, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #96 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/96/])
