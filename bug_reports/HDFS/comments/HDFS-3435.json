[attached a patch.
This patch doesn't include a new test because this patch only changes a message string.

test output:

{code}
$ ./hdfs dfs
Usage: hdfs dfs [generic options]
{code}, Thanks Sho. Patch is good enough. Are there any other changes/improvements to hdfs CLI command you'd like to roll into this same JIRA itself?, Hey Sho,

This is the intended behavior, hdfs dfs is just an alias for "hadoop fs", eg this change will cause the hadoop fs usage to display "hdfs dfs" which doesn't make sense since hadoop fs might be run on non-hdfs file systems.
, Ah good catch Eli. I didn't notice he'd edited common's FsShell. My bad :), No there is nothing to change for other part of the command.
, Sorry the last comment is reply for Harsh's first comment.

Thanks Eli, your comment makes sense.
Please close out this JIRA.]
