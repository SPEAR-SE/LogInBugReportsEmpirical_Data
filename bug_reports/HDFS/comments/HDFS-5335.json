, Hey Haohui Mai, in the future, when posting a patch it's very helpful to post a little explanation of what the problem was and what the fix was. Not a huge deal, but this will facilitate understanding for those who come across the issues you fix., It'd also be good to update the summary/description of this JIRA to describe what the problem was, what triggers it, etc., [~atm], thanks for the reminder. I've updated the summary / descriptions based on the analysis on our sides.]
