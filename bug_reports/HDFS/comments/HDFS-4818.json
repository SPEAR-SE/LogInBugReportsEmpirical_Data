[This patch fixes the problems by setting more restrictive permissions.  This works for both Linux and Windows, so no special-casing for Windows is required.

While working on this, I also found a few other small platform-specific issues that I rolled into this patch:

{{NNStorage}} - Switched to using platform-specific file separator.  This had been causing a test failure in {{TestFileJournalManager}}.
{{TestCheckpoint}} - On Windows, we cannot read the lock file, so the log message won't contain the JVM name.  (See HDFS-4572.)
{{TestFileJournalManager}} - Reordered some statements so that the directory is restored to writable state first before checking the assertion.  This way, even if the assertion fails, the directory's permissions get restored to the correct state.  Also cleaned up some file handle leaks.
{{TestFsck}} - Switched to using platform-specific line ending to assert on fsck output.

I validated this patch by running the following tests successfully on Mac and Windows: {{TestCheckpoint}}, {{TestEditLog}}, {{TestFileJournalManager}}, {{TestNNStorageRetentionFunctional}}, {{TestNameNodeMXBean}}, {{TestFsck}}.
