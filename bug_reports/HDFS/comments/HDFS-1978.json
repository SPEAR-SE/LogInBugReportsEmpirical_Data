[Actually I think strtok changes the original string so the above diff does not represent a solution. The problem remains the same., The patch attached works on my system (builds and tests) and respects multiple arguments.

Should be be calling free(optHadoopClassPath); as we are passing that into the VM? This code is nearby but is unchanged in my patch., Updated patch attach. Add missing free to hadoopJvmArgs and uses reentrant strtok., I tested this patch by {{export LIBHDFS_OPTS="-Xms64m -Xmx128m"}} before mounting fuse-dfs and verified that both the arguments for min and max heap size were respected., +1, looks good to me., -1 overall.
