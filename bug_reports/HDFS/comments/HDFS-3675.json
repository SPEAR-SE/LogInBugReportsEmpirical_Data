I think that should be "errno = EINTERNAL"?  It doesn't make sense to assign to the local variable "ret" immediately before returning.

Other than that, this looks fine.  I'm not sure moving the "ret=0" down from around line 1872 to around 1889 is a win, but it's not a problem either., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Thanks!, +1  lgtm as well.  Marking as an incompatible change since this technically changes the API (not that I expect people were depending on these particular error codes)., I've committed this and merged to branch-2.
