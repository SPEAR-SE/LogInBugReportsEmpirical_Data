[Just ran into this bug. Is anyone currently working on fixing it?, I'm going to close this as Not a Problem.

fs test works exactly like test and the shell test built-ins work:  0 for success, any other value for failure.  If you want to know whether it exists, or is a file, or is whatever, then you need to specifically test for those conditions.]
