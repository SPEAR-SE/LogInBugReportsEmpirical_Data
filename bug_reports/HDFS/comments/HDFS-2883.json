[The following was noticed.

namenode is running with trash feature enabled.

1. run bin/hadoop dfs -Dfs.trash.interval=0 -rm /path/to/file

the file gets deleted and is not moved to trash (even though trash is on in the namenode)

2. run bin/hadoop dfs -Dfs.trash.interval=10 -rm /path/to/file

the file gets deleted and is moved to trash

3. now if you run  command bin/hadoop dfs -Dfs.trash.interval=1 -rm /path/to/file

the file gets deleted and moved to trash but is not removed from trash after 1 min as the namenode actually deletes is based on the setting that has been set when it was started.


So for delete calls the client side configs can be used, but trash clean up is only server side. The trash settings should be only server side and if the client wants to skip trash they should only be able to use -skipTrash option.


This was noticed in 1.0 and 0.23, This was fixed by HADOOP-8689, if you enable trash on the server side the client will never be able to disable it. ]
