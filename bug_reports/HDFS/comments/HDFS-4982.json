[Attached patch should fix the issue. I haven't verified on a real cluster, but this is the same issue we saw with the 2NN in the past, so I'm pretty confident in the fix.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/4642//console

This message is automatically generated., The release audit and eclipse errors are unrelated - this patch only adds 3 lines of code to one file.

There are no unit tests added because we don't have any test infrastructure for krb5 testing. But we will be deploying this soon and I'll report back if it doesn't solve the problem as anticipated.

I'll commit this later today., Jenkins -1s are due to some Jenkins machine that needs cleanup. 

+1 for the patch. Todd, can you also please merge it to branch-2.1., committed to branch-2, branch-2.1, trunk, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4077 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4077/])
