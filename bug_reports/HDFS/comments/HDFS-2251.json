[Hi Brian,

 In which version of Hadoop you faced this?

 Did you observe any recovery (or) write failures?


Thanks
Uma, Hi Uma,

This is actually a super old ticket (Hadoop 0.18).  I have no clue if it is still applicable to the existing code base (it might have gotten added in the last 3 years).  However, it's a really easy way to detect a common corruption case - the advice still applies.

Won't be offended if you just wanted to close it out until I see the issue again.

Brian, Despite Brian saying that we could close this out, it'd be good if we could verify that this is fixed. ]
