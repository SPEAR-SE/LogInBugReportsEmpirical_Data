[This bug was reproduced using the test in HDFS-11056.
But it is reproducible every time, due to its race condition nature., This bug is similar in nature to HDFS-10512., Upload a trivial fix to remove the possible race condition. This fix uses block id instead of ExtendedBlock to get FsVolumeImpl object., The race condition is introduced by HDFS-7496.]
