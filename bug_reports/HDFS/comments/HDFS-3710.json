The only thing that could make it better is adding a line or two to the unit test at:
./hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/native/libhdfs/test_libhdfs_threaded.c

testing that passing mode = 0 to hdfsOpen is no longer incorrectly accepted., er, meant to write "passing mode = 3 to hdfsOpen is no longer incorrectly accepted.", Add a test that invalid flags value is disallowed.

Also tweak errno on invalid flags; return EINVAL rather than ENOTSUP., +1 lgtm, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
