[Does the information show up on the new Web UI? Just checking the code, it looks like that the information no longer exists.

Can you please provide a screenshot to better illustrate the issue?, they are in {{hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/webapps/hdfs/dfshealth.html}}, My bad, I though you meant secondary NN. Thanks for the explanation., [~wheat9]: I have an initial patch, but I'm not sure how to unit test a html/js code.
Could you shed some lights on how you developed and test it? Thank you very much., Rev01:
SbNN will not show corrupted blocks, under-replicated blocks, missing block. In addition, it should also not show blocks that are pending deletion, according to {{TestStandbyBlockManagement}}.

I tested this patch on a CDH cluster with HA and works as expected., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
