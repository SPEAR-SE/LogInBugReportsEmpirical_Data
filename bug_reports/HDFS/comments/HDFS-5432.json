This message is automatically generated., +1. Patch looks good Chris.
I ran the test with and without fix. Its working. :-), +1 for the patch.

Verified results with and without your patch on Windows., Thanks for the reviews, but I'm uploading a new version.  I think we can avoid the Windows-specific conditional by pulling the correct host name out of the {{InetSocketAddress}}.  I re-tested this successfully on Mac and Windows.

Does this still look OK?, +1 for the updated patch also., Re-uploading the same patch to try to inspire Jenkins., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
