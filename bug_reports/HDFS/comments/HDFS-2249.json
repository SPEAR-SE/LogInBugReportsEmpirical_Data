[Brian,

This would be same for any long-running Hadoop process in general. It's not specific to fuse-dfs. Its possible the case that fuse-dfs processes are most long running., I agree that this is not fuse-dfs specific.

I looked at Groups.java, and it seems that we expire the groups cache after a certain length of time.  The timeout is configurable as {{hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs}}, which defaults to 5 minutes.  I don't think anyone is planning on changing this behavior, so should we close this JIRA?, Yes, we should close it.  This is the nature of caches.]
