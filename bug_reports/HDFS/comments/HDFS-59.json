[I think the problem might have been less severe with fix HADOOP-1955 (it still does not explain quite a few things about this case). What % of clients do think were stuck like this?, Number of clients that got stuck were about 5%., this has been open for a very long time.
should it be fixed or closed?, This has gone stale. We haven't seen this lately. Lets file a new one if we see this again (these days it errors out with 'Could only replicate to X nodes' kinda errors).

Also, could've been your dfs.replication.min > 1.]
