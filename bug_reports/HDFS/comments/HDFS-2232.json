[Attaching the log of failed test., Changed the regex based on Konstantin's log of failed tests. Changed to accept a hyphen in the host name., Changed patch to work from root rather than specifically the testHDFSConf.xml file., Pretty good! Out of 183 previously failing tests there is only 4 remaining. Attaching the new log., 4 tests remained unfixed. Until now..., +1 works for me, {noformat}
