[Here's a patch for 20. Before resolving we should write a unit test and also double check that this bug doesn't show up in trunk., oops, correcting slight error in previous upload, Looks like this was fixed in HDFS-2379., Yea, fixed it in 20 with HDFS-2379, but might still need a small fix in trunk., Cool.. using our new fancy fix/target scheme to indicate this was fixed in 206 but needs a fix in 204., Since this patch was not applied (from this jira) to 1.0, changing "fix version" usage to clean up release notes for 1.1.0., I believe this is "Not A Problem" anymore.  Please feel free to reopen it if it is not the case.]
