[With the attached patch, the test suite consistently passes in all of the environments I could find.  We need to be careful not to touch the entries in the cache while we're waiting for expiration.  If we did, then that would reset the clock on expiration for those entries.  Instead, I needed to use {{VisibleForTesting}} to poke at some internals from within the test.

[~xyao], would you please code review?, Thanks [~cnauroth] for fixing this! Patch LGTM, +1 pending Jenkins., +1 (non-binding) pending on Jenkins., +1.
Thanks [~cnauroth] for fix. 
Could you put your comment with awaitCacheEmptyDueToExpiration to make follow-up persons aware of the potential pitfall?

{code}, [~xiaobingo], that's a good idea.  Here is patch v002, just adding a comment on {{awaitCacheEmptyDueToExpiration}}., +1 002
Thanks., I am holding off on committing this, because HDFS-8855 has been reverted.  [~xiaobingo], please feel free to sweep this into a revised HDFS-8855 patch.  Thank you., Closing as duplicate of HDFS-8855]
