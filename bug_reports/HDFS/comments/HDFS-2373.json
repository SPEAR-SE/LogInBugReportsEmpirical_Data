This message is automatically generated., - There are quite a few System.out.println(..) in DelegationTokenFetcher.  I think all of them should change to LOG.debug(..).
- Should check LOG.isDebugEnabled() before calling LOG.debug(..).
- Need a patch for trunk., Thanks for the input Nicholas. I have made the changes and attached a patch for trunk. I added an additional debug statement which was there in 20 security but not in trunk., Updated the patch one of the braces was not aligned, updated patch for 20 security, -1 overall.

, Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0, Good candidate for merging to branch 23., in case someone goes back and spelunks on this issue like I have been:  this was never committed to 0.23 or any of its descendents.  parts have been incorporated via other patches, but not everything.  so yes, this patch has been sitting committed in trunk but unreleased for ~4.5 years...
