This message was automatically generated., I feel this is okay.. as the expected and target sizes are same. There is no error here to fail., > ... Cannot truncate to a larger file size. Current size: 2, truncate size: 2

No, 2 is not larger than 2.  Truncate should success.  [~shv], do you agree?, As confirmed by [~szetszwo], this is not a problem.
Resolving as Invalid. Feel free to re-open if anybody strongly feels otherwise.

Thanks, [~vinayrpet] and [~szetszwo] thanks for taking a look into this issue..

[~vinayrpet] he did not confirmed it's not a problem.. he given his pointer and he is asking [~shv] to check same.. , I did not understand, why we want to success ( Even which will not do any change) in this scenario.. As 2 is not greater than 2,just we can fail.this is what I feel.., bq. I did not understand, why we want to success ( Even which will not do any change) in this scenario..

For user, whats matters is the final length of the file, which is already as expected, So I dont think this should be failure.
FYR, I also checked {{truncate}} command on linux with same size as the file length, it didnt fail for me saying file already have the same length. Though, linux version of {{truncate}} will not fail if you pass bigger size, instead of truncating, it will extend file with 0 bytes.

bq. No, 2 is not larger than 2.  Truncate should success
For me this looked like he agrees existing behaviour is correct. 
bq. he is asking Konstantin Shvachko to check same.
[~brahmareddy], If [~shv] disagrees, then you are free to re-open

Thanks., Guys, I think this works as designed. Documentation says:
??Fail if newLength is *greater* than the current file length.??
And I think it should be that way. Less restrictions is better.

, And resolution should probably be "Not a problem" rather than "Invalid", Resolved as 'Not a Problem' as suggested.]
