This message is automatically generated., Hi Alejandro,

 Thanks for the patch!
If we skip downloading itself, then how jsvc file will be copied to release?

Thanks
Uma, For Windows it is not, AFAIK none of the native code works on windows, I got your point.
Actually our build machines are in windows and we will make use of that builds normally in linux to run our clusters.
in this case, this will create problem right? we are mandating that builds also should happen in target OS. am i missing something here?
, well, you won't have any of the native code, thus you'll be running the cluster with reduced functionality. But it depends if this is an issue for your one, if not you are good., patch still applies cleanly, +1, the patch looks good to me. I ran {{`mvn -DskipTests clean package'}} and verified that without this patch the HDFS build fails on Windows in cygwin, but with the patch the HDFS build succeeds just fine.

The MR build still fails with some error about {{saveVersion.sh}} not working, but that's not the subject of this JIRA.

Alejandro, you owe me big. :), Thanks ATM, yes I do. Still I won't rename my son to Aaron., committed to trunk, in a few days it will be committed to 0.23 in a combo with other maven related patches., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1036 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1036/])
