[Uses the {{Server.getRemoteUser}} call in place of {{UGI.getCurrentUser}} for logging edits.

Streamlined the audit logging so the same redundant conditions and parameters aren't checked in every method.  Notably every audit logging call doesn't have to pass the ugi.

I also found a couple places where the file stat for the audit log was being done outside the namespace lock - which can lead to race conditions where the wrong stat is logged because another operation has taken place between lock release and audit logging., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The patch itself looks good, but there is one thing I am not sure about in the existing code.
Do isExternalInvocation() and FSNamesystem.getRemoteIp() work correctly when Hftp is used?, Other than the same concern as Kihwal:
# Minor - indentation in logAuditEvent()
# In a future jira, it would be good to standardize on "method" calls "methodInt". Only "methodInt" performs required locking. Permission checker is initialization, logSync, logging of edits is done in "method". I will follow up on this.
, @Kihwal:
Good questions, and a cursory scan of the code appears that hftp is not handled correctly.  The servlets attempt to get the rpc proxy from the servlet context, and if it does it directly invokes methods on the server-side proxy.  This patch doesn't aggravate that issue.

@Suresh:
Oops, will fix the indent.  I fully agree on the standardizations, and had similar thoughts while creating the patch.
