[* fix bad calls to fprintf

* fix bad format strings

* fix const warnings

* move hdfsDisableDirectRead into hdfs_test.h (it's not intended for library consumers, just testing)

* test_libhdfs_read: remove unused variable

* test_libhdfs_threaded: need to include string.h, {code}

{{printf(3)}} says we should use z instead of Z:
{noformat}
       z      A following integer conversion corresponds to a size_t or ssize_t argument.
              (Linux libc5 has Z with this meaning.  Don't use it.)
{noformat}

+            fprintf(stderr, "pthread_key_create failed with error %d\n", ret);
{code}
Should probably include the function name, or maybe {{__FILE__}} {{__LINE__}}, in the error message., bq. [fs to jFS change]

Using fs in this context generates a type mismatch warning.  This is one of those cases where we do a type conversion from the publicly exposed (opaque) datatype to the "real" datatype, in this case simply a JNI pointer.  We don't want to expose the jobject pointer to the library user, hence the typecasts.

bq. [use z instead of Z]

Good catch., bq. Using fs in this context generates a type mismatch warning.
Ah, {{DeleteGlobalRef}} takes a {{jobject}} not a {{void *}}.  OK, then changing that one is good, but please preserve the NULL test as using {{fs}} not {{jFS}}., * test fs rather than jFS, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
