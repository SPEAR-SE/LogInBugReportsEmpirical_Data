[Attached a new patch., Correct. Could you please make a patch from the project root rather than just a diff of the Checkpointer.java.
You will also need to run ant test and test-patch targets. If Hundson build was up you would get it by clicking on "Submit Patch", but as it is down we have to run the tests manually and report the results in the jira., what happens if the current checkpoint fails, Will the next checkpoint be after one hour? , I'm sorry about that, I attached a new patch., This was fixed in HDFS-1572.  Resolving.]
