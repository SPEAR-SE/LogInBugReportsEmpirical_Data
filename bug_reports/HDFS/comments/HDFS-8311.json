[[~kiranmr] is ok for you if I reassign the JIRA to me? I have an initial patch that re-uses the existing write timeout in the OuputStream and seems to be fine., Added correctly timeout for both DS.createBlockOutputStream() and DS.transfer() and now it relies on DFSClient.getDatanodeReadTimeout() (both usually should be the same, but now is semantically correct), Thats fine, reassigned, Thanks, [~esteban].  +1 pending jenkins, \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~esteban],

Thanks for addressing my verbal comments. 

I found that there are other places that might need similar handling, like 
{{DataXceiver#replaceBlock}}
{code}
        OutputStream unbufProxyOut = NetUtils.getOutputStream(proxySock,
            dnConf.socketWriteTimeout);
        InputStream unbufProxyIn = NetUtils.getInputStream(proxySock);
{code}

{{DataXceiver#writeBlock}}
{code}
          OutputStream unbufMirrorOut = NetUtils.getOutputStream(mirrorSock,
              writeTimeout);
          InputStream unbufMirrorIn = NetUtils.getInputStream(mirrorSock);
{code}

{{DataNode#run}}
{code}
        OutputStream unbufOut = NetUtils.getOutputStream(sock, writeTimeout);
        InputStream unbufIn = NetUtils.getInputStream(sock);
{code}

And some other places.

I know that [~esteban] has verified the uploaded patch solve one real issue, so maybe it's ok for us to address the remaining places in separate jiras. 

What do you think [~cmccabe]?

Thanks.
, Good catch, [~yzhangal].  We should fix those other cases as well.  I think we should do those in separate JIRAs, if that's more convenient for you.  Also, it would be nice to have unit tests for these timeouts at some point, to ensure that they don't get removed.

+1 again for the patch.  Thanks, guys., Thanks [~cmccabe]. +1 and will commit soon.

, Thanks [~esteban] for reporting the issue and the fix, thanks Colin for the review, I committed to trunk and branch-2.
, Thanks [~yzhangal]!, [~yzhangal]

Separate is logged for following..? If not, can I file jira and fix..?

        InputStream unbufIn = NetUtils.getInputStream(sock);{code}, HI [~brahmareddy],

Thanks for your interest, I was about to check with [~esteban], so I will let you guys decide who will fix it. Thanks.

, [~brahmareddy], [~yzhangal] I've created HDFS-8359. Depending what we might find down the road we can move that jira as an umbrella jura and this jira as a subtask of HDFS-8359.
