This message is automatically generated., Just a question: since only the short names are being compared, does this mean that same user in two different realms are considered to be equivalent?, That's correct. It is assumed that short-names will be unique across users. 
KerberosAuthenticationHandler sets only the short name in the request, therefore only short name is available in JspHelper#getUGI in case of kerberos spnego authentication., Does this weaken the security of hadoop?  Are there other safeguards to prevent a user in one realm from accessing the files of an identically named user in a different realm?  If not, is it correct that multiple-realm installations now have a vulnerability due to what I believe you are saying is a spnego limitation?, Would it be better to change this to not use {{getShortName()}}?

{code:title=KerberosAuthenticationHandler}
KerberosName kerberosName = new KerberosName(clientPrincipal);
String userName = kerberosName.getShortName();
token = new AuthenticationToken(userName, clientPrincipal, TYPE);
{code}

There is a comment in the code: "The realm can be omitted from the principal as the JDK GSS libraries will use the realm name of the configured default realm".  It would appear that this jira may be due to an arbitrary, and maybe unnecessary, implementation decision?,   It is not a spnego implementation. KerberosAuthenticationHandler is one example where we use shortnames. There are other places as well in hadoop, where it was assumed that it is sufficient to use shortnames, for example proxy user configuration, in checking file permissions etc., > It is not a spnego implementation.
Correction: It is not a spnego limitation.

That said, it can be debated (and has been debated before) whether we want to switch to long names consistently in hadoop. But that requires revisiting, all the contexts where we assumed shortnames were sufficient., +1 on HDFS-2361.trunk.2.patch, The patch was manually tested on a secure cluster in branch-0.20-security.
This issue showed up only in a secure cluster, and the code change in the patch takes effect only if security is enabled. Therefore, tests require a secure setup., This is committed., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1052 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1052/])
