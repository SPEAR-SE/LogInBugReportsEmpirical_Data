[[~cnauroth] and [~vinayrpet] any pointers to this issue.., Hi [~brahmareddy].  From the stack trace, it looks like the process is blocked waiting to read output from the ssh connection to run fuser to stop the old active.  I can think of 2 possible theories:

# Passwordless ssh is not configured, so the connection is hanging indefinitely prompting for a password.  This would require configuration of {{dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.private-key-files}} to specify the ssh key file.
# The ssh connection to run fuser is hanging indefinitely.  This could be caused by a lot of different kinds of failures at the old active, making it unresponsive.  This can be mitigated by configuring a timeout on the ssh connection ({{dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.connect-timeout}}).

This documentation page has more details:

http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithQJM.html#Configuration_details, Thanks a lot for look into this issue..

AFAIK 1) password less ssh is configured..And Even it was not prompting for password..
      2) deafult value of {{dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.connect-timeout}} is 30 sec's..after this it should come out..

Anyway let me retry this scenario once.., [~cnauroth] you are correct, it is prompting for that password.. Hence Closing this issue as "not a problem", Thanks for the update, Brahma.  Glad to hear you found root cause.]
