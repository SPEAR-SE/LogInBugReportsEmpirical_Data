[bq. The faulty (slow) node was not detected correctly. Instead, the 2nd DN was excluded. The 1st DN's packet responder could have done a better job. It didn't have any outstanding ACKs to receive. Or the second DN could have tried to hint the 1st DN of what happened.

Fixed by HDFS-9178. Absence of heartbeat during flush will be fixed in a separate jira by [~daryn]

bq. copyBlock() could probably wait longer than 3 seconds in waitForMinLength(). Or it could check the on-disk size early on and fail early even before trying to establish a connection to the target.

If the node stuck in I/O is correctly taken out, this will happen far less. Also, HDFS-9106 will make this kind of failure non-fatal.

bq. Failed targets in block write/copy should clean up the record or make it recoverable.

Fixed in HDFS-6948.]
