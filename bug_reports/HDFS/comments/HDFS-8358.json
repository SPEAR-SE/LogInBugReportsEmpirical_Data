[@Masatake Iwasaki, would you started working on this..?, not yet., Thanks for reporting this, [~kihwal]. I uploaded the patch., [~iwasakims] Patch ,LGTM,+1 ( non binding), Moved to hdfs since the fix is in hdfs only., Thanks for finding this and filing the JIRA, [~kihwal].

Intuitively it seems like I should be able to set  "\-Clocal-file-span-receiver.path=/tmp/foo", not "\-Cdfs.htrace.local-file-span-receiver.path=/tmp/foo".  We always want to be modifying the {{dfs.htrace}} config keys with the {{\-C}} options we pass, right?  So maybe let's just prefix anything we get via {{\-C}} with {{dfs.htrace}} to avoid the extra typing., bq. So maybe let's just prefix anything we get via -C with dfs.htrace to avoid the extra typing.

I would like to make TraceAdmin able to handle other config prefix such as "yarn.htrace.". I think {{SpanReceiverHost#addSpanReceiver}} is the right place to deal with the configs without prefix. Anyway we should file a new JIRA for that., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hmm... {{TestHdfsConfigFields.testCompareXmlAgainstConfigurationClass}} failed due to entries added to hdfs-default.xml by HDFS-8284. The test implies that configuration properties in hdfs-default.xml must have concrete definition in DFSConfigKeys too., There are options such as
1. reverting the change of hdfs-default.xml: TestHdfsConfigFields does not require the properties in DFSConfigKeys to be in hdfs-default.xml.
2. moving the entries from hdfs-default.xml to core-site.xml: There is no equivalent test for core-default.xml.
3. adding "dfs.htrace." and "dfs.client.htrace." to the skip list of TestHdfsConfigFields.
, I attached the patch taking option #3., \\

This message was automatically generated., The failure of {{TestLazyPersistFiles}} is not related to the patch. The patch only fixes tests not relating to {{TestLazyPersistFiles}} and the test succeeded on my local env., The failure of TestHdfsConfigFields will be fixed in HDFS-8371. It should be addressed as separate JIRA and I will update the patch once HDFS-8371 is committed., I attached 003 which only fixes the failure of TestTraceAdmin., bq. I would like to make TraceAdmin able to handle other config prefix such as "yarn.htrace.". I think SpanReceiverHost#addSpanReceiver is the right place to deal with the configs without prefix. Anyway we should file a new JIRA for that.

Yeah.  The user should be able to set "-Clocal-file-span-receiver.path=/tmp/foo" on the YARN daemons and have it apply the relevant YARN htrace properties.  There isn't any need to require the user to send '-Cyarn.htrace.local-file-span-receciver.path=...' We know that YARN tracing is what we want to configure, by virtue of the fact that the \-host argument was for a YARN host.

bq. The failure of TestHdfsConfigFields will be fixed in HDFS-8371. It should be addressed as separate JIRA and I will update the patch once HDFS-8371 is committed.

OK.

+1 for v3, can you file a follow-on JIRA to talk about the prefix issue?, \\
