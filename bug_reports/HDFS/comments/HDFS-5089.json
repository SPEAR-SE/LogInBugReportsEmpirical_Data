This message is automatically generated., The javadoc warnings was introduced by HADOOP-9848 but not related to this., +1 for the patch.

Verified the new test passes with the fix to {{LayoutVersion}} and fails without., Why does RESERVED_REL_1_3_0 support SNAPSHOT? I haven't seen any discussion about backporting snapshots to branch-1, and I'd be pretty strongly against it. Maybe this should be a discussion on the dev list?, We actually do not plan to backport snapshots to branch-1., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
