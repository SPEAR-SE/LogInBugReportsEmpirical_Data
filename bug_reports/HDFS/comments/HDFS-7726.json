[Good catch [~tianyin]. It makes sense to catch config errors at initiation time.

# I think we should check {{rpcTimeout}} is positive as well
# Shouldn't we use {{Preconditions.checkArgument}}?

This message is automatically generated., The refined patch, Thanks a lot, Zhe! I refined the patch based on your feedback.

1. rpcTimeout could be negative. It's passed to the RPC protocol (org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RPC.java) which does not explicitly define the range of rpcTimeout. I tested negative values and it works fine.  Let me know if you wanna check rpcTimeout to be positive. 
2. Yes, the new patch uses  Preconditions.checkArgument
3. Fixed!
4. Removed the line.
5. Now it ends with .patch :), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Tianyin for the rev. It looks good in general. Just one minor issue:
# In the error message "" property value should be positive and non-zero", positive already implies non-zero

Non-binding +1 pending this., It would also be great to add or extend a simple test., Thank you so much, Zhe!
I will do that ASAP this week.]
