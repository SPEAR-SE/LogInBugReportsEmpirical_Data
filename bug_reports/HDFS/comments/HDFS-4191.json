[This patch allows logSync() to be invoked without any side effect (e.g. incorrectly incrementing the batched sync counter) even when there is no transactions logged by the calling thread.  This allows calling logSync() outside the namespace lock, after returning from a journey through a call tree, at which point the caller is not sure about occurrence of transactions., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

-    TransactionId(long value) {
+    TransactionId(long value, boolean needToSync) {
       this.txid = value;
+      this.hasTransToSync = needToSync;
{code}

Given this is only constructed with needToSync == false, I think we can just have the constructor set it to false, rather than taking in the argument.

{code}
+  void setHasTransToSync(boolean sync) {
{code}
Can you rename to {{setHasTransToSyncForTests}} so that we're careful not to use this elsewhere? The @VisibleForTesting annotation is good but it's easy to miss it and end up using these types of functions in the production code.


Otherwise looks good to me.
