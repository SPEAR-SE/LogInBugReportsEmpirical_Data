[Patch attached., +1, Patch for y20.  Not for commit.  I'd like to stick with 1.0.2, since that's the version we're using in production and have verified it works., Eli, with Hudson missing at sea, can you run test-patch?  It should be fine, but we should double check.  Tests don't need to be run...  After that I'll commit it., Hm, looks like there's no test-patch in hdfs, does this need to be modified to use HADOOP_COMMON_HOME?
 
{noformat}
hdfs3 (trunk)$ ant-test-patch  temp.patch 
...
test-patch:
     [exec] bash: /home/eli/src/hdfs3/src/test/bin/test-patch.sh: No such file or directory
{noformat}, HDFS uses svn:externals to fetch the test-patch script from Core, but doesn't support svn:externals.  So you either need to run tp from an svn checkout or (what I do) just manually copy the script over to ./src/test/bin/test-patch.sh
, ^but doesn't support^but git doesn't support

... sigh., Note, since the build failure is caused by an external change in an external dependency, the test-patch would fail due to trunk build failure.
+1 for committing this patch, as all other hdfs patches depend on this one., Verified manually.  Going to commit., I've committed this.  Resolving as fixed.  Thanks, Eli.  Now that 1.0.2 has been archived, its location won't change again and this shouldn't re-occur., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #374 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/374/])
