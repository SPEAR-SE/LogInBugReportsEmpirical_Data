, PR is ready, please kindly review., hi [~xiaochen], sorry to disturb you.
Would you mind reviewing this patch?, +1, [~vincent he] I added you a HDFS contributor role so feel free to assign the jiras that you are contributing to yourself.

Thanks., Thanks for adding me to the list, [~jojochuang].

BTW,  
anything shall I do to carry the work a step forward? 
Should I attach a patch corresponding to PR-237? or the PR link from github is enough for committing?

I read this in "HowToContribute": 
bq. If there is a corresponding pull request, you don't need to attach a patch in this issue because the precommit job always runs on pull request instead of the attached patch.

but I am not very sure about this., No, you are good. I will commit the patch shortly., Committed the patch to trunk. Thanks for contributing the patch. Would you please close the pull request?, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #11896 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/11896/])
