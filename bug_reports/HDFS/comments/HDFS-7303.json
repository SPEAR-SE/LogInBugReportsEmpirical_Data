[Attaching patch which does the following :

1. If there are multiple datanodes on the same host, host:port displayed.
2. If there is a single datanode on the host, only host is displayed.

This is done for live nodes, dead nodes and decommissioned nodes., I suggest for simplicity let's export both host and port in JMX -- the UI can strip out the ports if desired., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The JMX output could be consumed by different tools. If the key is changed from _hostname_ to _hostname:port_, these tools may throw errors. To avoid this, If there is a single data node on a host, _hostname_ is still used as the key.

But since the value was part of the JSON output, we should be mindful of compatibility issues.

 As an example, if any external tool was using the hostname based on the JSON output to construct a URL as http://<datanode-host-name-from-JSON>:someport/blah, then that will fail if we add port to JSON output. It will become http://<datanode-host-name-from-JSON:datanodeport>:someport/blah

That's why I am trying to keep the same behavior if there is only one data node on a host (which is the normal case). , Attaching the patch which removes the javac warnings, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
