This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me. +1.
Maybe we can also use this chance to update the java comment in {{testRetainExtraLogsLimitedSegments}}? Looks like the existing two comments are out of date thus the numbers are not correct., +1 from me as well. Thanks for fixing this Vinay!, Updated the Java comment in {{testRetainExtraLogsLimitedSegments}}.

Please review, +1. Thanks Vinay!, Committed to trunk and branch-2. 
Thanks [~jingzhao] and [~umamaheswararao] for the reviews., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5965 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5965/])
