[It appears what is happening is fileContext.mkdirs calls into hdfs.mkdirs, which calls the DFSClient.mkdirs. DFSClient is applying the umask from the conf.  I think hdfs.mkdirs needs to call primitiveMkdir, although primitiveMkdir is missing the create Parent flag, so I believe a new primitiveMkdir function should be created which has the extra createParent boolean flag.

I'm attaching a patch with these changes that I tested in my usecase.  It still needs unit tests but folks can look at it and see if its the right things to do.

, Looks good me.  This mimics the behavior of other FC methods like create whereby it applies the umask of the context, and then uses a primitive method to avoid {{DFSClient}} re-applying the default umask., Looks good, good catch, but needs a unit test., Thanks Todd and Daryn. Since it the approach sounds reasonable to you here is the complete patch with unit tests., A couple unit tests were failing because it was unwrapping different exceptions. Fixing that., +1 overall.
