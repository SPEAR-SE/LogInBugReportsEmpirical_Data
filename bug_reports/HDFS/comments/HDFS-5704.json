[Early patch just for review. 

Currently several calls can trigger an UPDATE_BLOCKS operation: ClientProtocol#abandonBlock, ClientProtocol#fsync, ClientProtocol#addBlock, DatanodeProtocol#commitBlockSynchronization, and clientProtocol#updatePipeline. This patch adds a new editlog op OP_ADD_BLOCK for ClientProtocol#addBlock. Specifically, since FSNamesystem#getAdditionalBlock can update the original last block of the file (i.e., updating its length and changing its state), the new AddBlockOp records both the new block and original last block.

Besides, looks like getAdditionalBlock already handles the retry scenario thus I think we will not meet repeated AddBlockOp in editlog.

Will add more unit tests in the next patch., Comments on the early patch:
# Changes in DFSTestUtil, TestOfflineEditsViewer seem unnecessary. If you are removing unused import, can you please only make that change in DFSTestUtil instead of large set of changes that it currently has?
# " current persisted block size is" -> " total block count ". Also move the debug log out of writeLock.
# AddBlockOp class members should be private. Why implement BlockListUpdatingOp, especially given getBlocks() returns only the last two blocks?
# Is blockOffset better name than oldBlkOffset? Adding a javadoc for the parameter will help. Also the local variables from offset to blockOffset used where the updateBlocks() method is called. I also feel that just having a variant of updateBlocks() with addBlock() would make code easier to understand, even if duplicated a bit of code.
, Thanks for the review Suresh! Update the patch to address your comments. Also add two unit tests to cover some basic scenarios., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I have seen many users running into large editlog sizes because of this issue. We should fix this in 2.3 release., Thanks for the review, Suresh!
