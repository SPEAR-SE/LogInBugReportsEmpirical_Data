I've merged the patch to branch-2. 
2.1.0 has been released. It is an incompatible release with previous ones, and in this case this changes is compatible with 2.1.0., > ... 2.1.0 has been released. It is an incompatible release with previous ones, and in this case this changes is compatible with 2.1.0.

2.1.0 is still in the voting phase.  If it does not pass the vote, we should merge this to 2.1.0.

You are right that this only changes the default value.  It is not an incompatible change., We should also merge this to branch-2.1-beta.  Then, this will be available in 2.1.1 (if we cannot merge this to 2.1.0.), Sure. In 2.1.1 now., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4212 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4212/])
