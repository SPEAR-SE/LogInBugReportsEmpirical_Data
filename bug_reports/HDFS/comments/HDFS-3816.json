, Good find, Jing.

One suggestion: perhaps in DFSUtil#getInvalidateWorkPctPerIteration we should also check that the configured value of this config is not greater than 1.0f? If I'm reading the code correctly, it doesn't make any sense to set this value to anything outside of the range 0.0f-1.0f. Jing, if you agree with this, mind filing another JIRA? I'd be happy to review it if you post a patch. If not, I'll take care of it.

Also, Suresh, did you commit this to branch-2.1.0-alpha as well as branch-2? If not, I believe the fix version should be set to 2.2.0-alpha. Do you agree?, Thanks very much for the suggestion, Aaron. I will file another JIRA for it., Aaron, you are right. Update the Fix Versions field., Cool. Thanks guys.]
