This message is automatically generated., Since nfs is in another project, do we still want to move all the configuration keys to hadoop-common and hdfs? Maybe in this jira we can first make the conf names more consistent and unified, and consider the moving part in a separate jira?, bq. Since nfs is in another project, do we still want to move all the configuration keys to hadoop-common and hdfs? Maybe in this jira we can first make the conf names more consistent and unified, and consider the moving part in a separate jira?

Higher level question here - why is any of this code in Common? It's all to support HDFS NFS access, so I don't really see how this could be used by YARN/MR, or independently of HDFS. Given that, my suggestion would be to move all the NFS-related code into the hadoop-hdfs-nfs project, and put all the relevant configs there.

Having several of the configs in Common (and therefore with different prefixes than the rest of the configs) only seems like it will cause user confusion, and not really serve to help anything, given the above., I am working on the new patch here, which will move most of the NFS related configurations into hadoop-hdfs-nfs project. In term of the code organization, the code in HDFS project is a specific NFS implementation only for HDFS. The code in Common is mostly ONCRPC and NFS protocol spec related class definitions(along with file system independent utilities), and can be used to implement NFS access to different Hadoop compatible file systems.

The code in Common is mostly ONCRPC and NFS protocol spec related class definitions(along with file system independent utilities), and can be used to implement NFS access to different Hadoop compatible file systems.

Right, but is anything going to use ONCRPC besides NFS? Are there any plans to create an NFS Gateway that works with other Hadoop FileSystem implementations? If the answers to both are "no" then seems like all of this could reasonably be moved into the hadoop-hdfs-nfs project., The RPC  and XDR code could be extended/refactored for MSRPC and thus CIFS use.
I know of some ideas of NFS access to blob store based Hadoop file system., OK, I'm still a little skeptical that we'll see any actual use of that code outside of the HDFS NFS Gateway, and if we do we could always move it back, but up to you., Thanks Aaron. 
I will upload a new patch to consolidate the related configurations. , +1 on moving combining hadoop-nfs and hadoop-hdfs-nfs.

In my personal experience separating hadoop-nfs and hadoop-hdfs-nfs creates quite a few of obstacles during development. It forces many classes to be publicly available and making hadoop-common bigger. It also leads to issues like this jira.

I'm with [~atm] that ideally we can always refactor the code of ONCRPC into a separate package when someone really starts to implement another NFS server, but it's up to Brandon., bq.

It forces many classes to be publicly available and making hadoop-common bigger. It also leads to issues like this jira.

+1, exactly my thinking as well., As mentioned above, there is some effort using the common code. If we don't see any progress later, we can always reorganize the code. I will keep you guys updated. :-), {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I agree with [~atm] and [~wheat9] that it will be better to put hadoop-nfs and hadoop-hdfs-nfs into the same project. But I also agree with [~brandonli] that we can revisit it in future jiras.

The latest patch looks generally good to me. The main remaining issue is that we need to update a couple of property names in core-default.xml and hdfs-default.xml. For example, we still have "nfs3.server.port" and "nfs3.mountd.port" in core-default.xml, while they have been renamed to "nfs.server.port" and "nfs.mountd.port".

We may also need to update the description of this jira, to summarize what changes have been made. Besides, do we need to mark this as incompatible since we change the name of the configuration properties?, [~jingzhao], thanks for the review. I've update the jira description and marked it as incompatible change.

This message is automatically generated., This patch looks a lot better. Two small comments:

# While we're fixing up the config property names, can we switch "hadoop.nfs.userupdate.milly" to be '.millis' instead of '.milly'? The word should not have a 'y' since it's short for 'milliseconds', I've never seen 'milly' used anywhere but here, and if you grep the code base I think you'll find that most of the config settings which are set in milliseconds use '.millis' as their suffix.
# I noticed while reviewing this patch that it looks like the above config setting isn't actually read except in tests. This is because there are two constructors in the {{IdUserGroup}} class, one which takes a {{Configuration}} object and one no-arg constructor, but the no-arg one doesn't call the other. The one which takes a {{Configuration}} is called by the tests, but the other one is the one actually used in the HDFS NFS Gateway daemon.

Thanks, Brandon., Thanks for the review, Aaron. I've uploaded a new patch.
{quote}..use '.millis' as their suffix.{quote}
Fixed. I trust your English. :-)

{quote}...the above config setting isn't actually read except in tests. This is because there are two constructors in the IdUserGroup class,...{quote}

This message is automatically generated., Hey Brandon, latest patch looks pretty good to me. Two comments for you:

# Seems like we should move {{IdUserGroup#NFS_STATIC_MAPPING_FILE_KEY}} out of {{IdUserGroup}} and put it with all the other config names.
# I still find it unfortunate that we now have some configs which just start with "nfs." and others which start with "dfs.nfs.". From the user's perspective, there's no good reason for this, since they'll only be using NFS to access HDFS, so I would anticipate user confusion of which configs do and do not start with "dfs."
# I think there may be a bit of a problem with having the {{NfsConfiguration}} class in the hadoop-hdfs-nfs project, since it is also responsible for adding the {{DeprecationDeltas}} for NFS config settings which only exist in the hadoop-nfs (Common) project. This means that, though no such project exists today, if there were some other project which only depended upon the Common hadoop-nfs project, the config deprecations would not be loaded. This seems like it might be another argument in favor of moving all of this code into the single hadoop-hdfs-nfs project., Thanks, Aaron. 
{quote}move IdUserGroup#NFS_STATIC_MAPPING_FILE_KEY out of IdUserGroup and put it with all the other config names{quote}
Sure.
{quote}...so I would anticipate user confusion of which configs do and do not start with "dfs."{quote}
OK. Let's further simplify the config for HDFS. Other NFS implementations can add their own prefix if they need.  
{quote}...if there were some other project which only depended upon the Common hadoop-nfs project, the config deprecations would not be loaded. {quote}
I am actually not very concerned about the deprecation of keys in Common hadoop-nfs. The reason is that, 1) most of them are hdfs-nfs related, 2) the rest of them are all hidden keys and used for debug purpose except "dfs.nfs.exports.allowed.hosts". 
Even for "dfs.nfs.exports.allowed.hosts", we can add the deprecation declaration into Configuration#defaultDeprecations and remove it from Configuration after a couple releases. I will update the patch if this sounds ok to you., bq. OK. Let's further simplify the config for HDFS. Other NFS implementations can add their own prefix if they need.

Seems fine to me. Consistency of the HDFS configs/docs is really all I'm concerned with.
