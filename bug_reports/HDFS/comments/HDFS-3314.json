[Change looks good, but better to define this problem away via code sharing right? Also, shouldn't the compat test have caught this?, This was not caught by the compat  test in HttpFS because the WebHdfsFileSystem implementation of getHomeDirectory() does not make web service call but resolves the value locally -via the default implementation of FileSystem.getHomeDirectory().

After adding support for delegation tokens to HttpFS (HDFS-3113, patch coming soon), we'll have function parity between HttpFS and WebHdfs, then it will be easier to tackle code sharing (HDFS-2645).
