This message is automatically generated., code used for -ldl detection is copied from hadoop common cmake., seems reasonable.  +1, +1 from me too.  I spun up a FreeBSD VM, confirmed that libhdfs won't build, and then confirmed that it will build with this patch applied.  I also checked that libhdfs still builds on Linux with this patch.

I plan to commit this later today., {quote}

No tests required, because this fixes a build problem., I committed this to trunk and branch-2.  Radim, thank you for contributing the patch.  Colin, thank you for helping with code review., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4628 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4628/])

, bq. can be this merged to branch-2.1-beta ?

branch-2.1-beta is closed.  Now that release 2.2.0 is GA, there won't be any more releases from branch-2.1-beta.  However, we can merge to branch-2.2 for inclusion in the 2.2.1 release.  I'll do that later today., I've merged this to branch-2.2 and updated attribution to release 2.2.1 in CHANGES.txt.

, can be this merged into 2.2 branch?, Hi Radim,

Unfortunately, this can't be merged to branch-2.2.  AFAIK, there are not any additional 2.2.x releases on the schedule, and the plan is to proceed with 2.3.x forward:

https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Roadmap

Therefore, if we committed code to branch-2.2 now, then it wouldn't actually go into a release.

I have confirmed that your patch is in branch-2.3 for inclusion in the 2.3.0 release, currently targeted for mid-December.  If the plan changes and we decide to add another 2.2.x release on the schedule, then you could nominate this patch for inclusion and we'd commit it at that time.  It seems unlikely at this point though.
