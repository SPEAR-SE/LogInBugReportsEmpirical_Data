[The test failure cannot be reproduced in my local machine, but it happened several times during the past several days in both the trunk build and snapshot branch build. According to the log the NPE is thrown when the replication thread tries to access the BlocksMap#blocks. Thus we may need to set BlocksMap#blocks as final, and/or remove "blocks = null" from BlocksMap#close(). , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Seems we still need to set blocks to null in order to release memory when closing the BlocksMap. To guarantee the replication thread can see the change (i.e., null to non-null) of BlocksMap#blocks, we may add the volatile keyword instead of final., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
