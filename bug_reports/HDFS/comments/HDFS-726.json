[This patch fixes it., The patch is trivial and does the trick for the Eclipse environment, In the pathc the .classpath file still includes src/test/hdfs-with-mr.  This should be removed.  Also, I always have to also compile the contrib module to get a happy eclipse regarding the classpath, but that should probably be fixed in a separate jira., Addressing Jacob's comment.
