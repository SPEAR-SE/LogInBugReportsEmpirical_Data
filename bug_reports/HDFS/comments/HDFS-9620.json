[The read path already has a mechanism for refetching block tokens, but it is currently not possible for writers to reacquire a block token for existing block being written., For readers, a new block token is acquired by calling {{getBlockLocations()}}. Writers get a block from {{addBlock()}} and it cannot be called multiple times for the same block.  Can we make a change to {{addBlock()}} to support it while maintaining compatibility? Or will it be better to add a new method to the protocol?]
