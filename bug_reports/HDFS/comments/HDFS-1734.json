This message is automatically generated., This patch doesn't seem to fix the problem of "absent genstamp". Since, generateFileChunks looks for genstamp in the request, genstamp must be added to the request parameters. Isn't it or am I missing something?, Thanks Jithendra for Review,
 Here this fix will solve this problem, because When we click on the file name in NN UI, generateFileDetails will write all the parameters in to page as hidden.

out.print("<input type=\"*hidden*\" name=\"genstamp\" value=\"" + *genStamp*
+	+ "\">")

 When we click refresh, the same parameters will be resubmitted. 


The initial problem is, when we click on file to open from UI, we missed to write genstamp as hidden parameter. So, when the refresh happens that parameter is missing.

With this patch refresh button is working., Correct, I missed that genstamp was being added as hidden input.

A few more comments:
 1. Please use junit4 for test. You don't have to extend from TestCase.
 2. testGenerateFileDetailsShouldPrintTheGetstampInJSPWriter is too long a name. A shorter name like testGenStamp might suffice.
 3. The patch has ^M at the end of every line, probably because the file was generated on a windows box. Can you clean that up?
 4. > FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(CONF);
     I will recommend using fs = cluster.getFileSystem().
