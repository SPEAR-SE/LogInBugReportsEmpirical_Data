[Attached the patch for the same.
Please review., Precommit build passed but failed to login to Jira and comment.

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/10209/console, Thanks Vinay for the patch. Makesense to me for incrementing the metric count only when real transfer happened. I agree for having test for intermediate failures would be difficult. Thanks for having one positive test here.

, Thanks [~umamaheswararao] for review.
