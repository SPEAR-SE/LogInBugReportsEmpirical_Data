[Thanks for working on this, Chang. Some comments on the patch:
# In {{setGenerationStampAndVerifyReplicas}}, {{staleReplicas}} is just a temporary list holding all the stale replicas. Thus updating this list seems unnecessary.
# A UC replica reported by DN with GS greater than the one recoded in NN may be valid. This is because the original writing may fail before the file gets closed and a writing pipeline recovery may still be in progress. Thus some DN may have bumped the GS while that GS has not been persisted in the NN yet (see {{DataStreamer#setupPipelineInternal}}). If those DataNodes restart, these un-finalized replicas will still be reported to NN. Later when recovering the block, actually these replicas will still be used as valid replicas (see {{DataNode#recoverBlock}}). , Thanks for valuable review [~jingzhao]! Understand the situation you describe. But could we check if replica has genStamp lesser than the current one?, For GS smaller than the current one, there may be some race conditions between writing recovery and block report. For example, we can have this scenario: the GS recorded on NN gets bumped during the recovery, while a block report that still contains the old GS gets delayed on the network thus is received afterwards. Thus it may be better for NN not to make any decision while the block is still UC., Thanks [~jingzhao] for explain! I will close this as won't fix, \\
