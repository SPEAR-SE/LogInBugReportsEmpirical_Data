[The write error is pretty misleading for this case as well:

{code}
11/11/20 10:12:41 WARN hdfs.DFSClient: DataStreamer Exception
java.io.IOException: File /user/harshchouraria/gridmix._COPYING_ could only be replicated to 0 nodes instead of minReplication (=1).  There are 1 datanode(s) running and no node(s) are excluded in this operation.
{code}

1 running, no exclusions, yet I could replicate only to 0. Perhaps decomm behavior has changed? We do not disconnect nodes immediately?, Restarting DN, makes it join back the cluster. No disallow exception is presented., Cannot quite reproduce this on current versions.]
