[This is intentional, since HDFS is only "private" APIs. At least that's the explanation we've claimed in the past., Not sure that's true, there's a handful of @InterfaceAudience.Public annotations in hdfs., Yes, that's what we've done in the past, see HADOOP-7732 and MAPREDUCE-559. There was a Ant javadoc-dev target for developers (as opposed to users) - which we didn't publish - perhaps we could do something similar in the Maven build., Now that we've got public APIs shouldn't we generate docs for them? Seems like we may have the reverse issue in common and MR, ie that we're publishing docs for classes that aren't public (ie InterfaceAudience#Private)., > Now that we've got public APIs shouldn't we generate docs for them?

Yes, makes sense.

> Seems like we may have the reverse issue in common and MR, ie that we're publishing docs for classes that aren't public (ie InterfaceAudience#Private).

We use org.apache.hadoop.classification.tools.ExcludePrivateAnnotationsStandardDoclet to make sure we only publish public APIs. In the case of HDFS we should probably use IncludePublicAnnotationsStandardDoclet so that we only publish APIs that are explicitly marked @Public., the pom.xml was already using org.apache.hadoop.classification.tools.IncludePublicAnnotationsStandardDoclet

so just added a new group called 'HDFS' and removed  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs* from the excludes

non-public (i.e. packages that are not @InterfaceAudience.Public) packages are listed but are empty, as is the case now with similar packages from Common, MapReduce, and YARN., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
