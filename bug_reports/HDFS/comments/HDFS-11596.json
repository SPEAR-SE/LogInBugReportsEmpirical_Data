, Hi [~yuanbo] thanks for working on this!

I ran {{mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pdist -Dmaven.javadoc.skip}} and looked in {{hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-*}} to test your patch. It looks like the hdfs client jar is still in the lib directory:

{noformat}
-> % find . -name "hadoop-hdfs-client*.jar"
./share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/hadoop-hdfs-client-3.0.0-alpha3-SNAPSHOT.jar
{noformat}

Looks like the source and test jars are also missing.

Would appreciate if you also tried running HttpFS from a tarball, to make sure it still works okay without the hadoop-hdfs-client JAR in its lib directory.

bq. With this patch, the hadoop-client jar is much smaller because the dependency jars are outputed into share/hadoop/hdfs/lib instead of hadoop-client jar.

I didn't see any size difference in the shaded hadoop-client-* or hadoop-hdfs-client jars, could you elaborate on this?, [~andrew.wang] Sorry, my mistake, upload v2 patch for this JIRA.
Here are the results:

, Thanks for the patch Yuanbo. I'm still thinking about this. The patch basically changes hadoop-hdfs' dependency on hadoop-hdfs-client from compile scope to provided, then fixed up other poms to refer to hadoop-hdfs-client with provided or test scope where needed.

Overall, it seems okay. Applications shouldn't be depending on hadoop-hdfs directly, so breaking them is okay (possibly good, as a prod to move to the client deps). We also expect Hadoop deps like this to be on the classpath when running Hadoop daemons.

That said, I am not a Maven expert, or super familiar with the expectations of dist-layout-stitching.

[~stevel@apache.org], [~aw], any comments?, Don't ask me, I don't understand maven , [~andrew.wang] Thanks for your review.
I think it's ok to change the scope since hadoop-3 is not released formally. The root cause is that hadoop-hdfs-client is a compile dependence of hadoop-hdfs. When another project is dependent on hadoop-hdfs, then hadoop-hdfs-client will be considered as a third-party lib and outputted into lib path by hadoop-assembly plugin.
If changing scope is an unacceptable behavior, then I will think another way to solve this problem., bq. Don't ask me, I don't understand maven

I knew we should have stuck with Ant :)

I propose we keep this change in trunk and see how alpha3 impacts downstreams. It's theoretically fine for branch-2 too since downstreams shouldn't be using our server-side artifacts, but we all know how that is.

+1 will commit to trunk shortly., Thanks for working on this [~yuanbo], I've committed this to trunk! Added a release note too., This broke the ability to run Hadoop from the source tree as documented in the Wiki (https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToSetupYourDevelopmentEnvironment) as the client dependency is missing from {{hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/target/hadoop-hdfs-3.0.0-*/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib}}.

I'm not questioning that this is a good change but I wonder how all of you guys are running Hadoop from source these days? We need to update the documentation and/or fix this situation somehow., I poked at this some more, and filed HDFS-12197 with a possible solution. The problem is more general, in that the NFS gateway and HTTPFS already didn't work even before this change. It's just that now the NameNode is broken too, and the NN is used a good bit more than the other two :)]
