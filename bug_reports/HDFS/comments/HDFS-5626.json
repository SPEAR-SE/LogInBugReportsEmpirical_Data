[simple fix for what is printed out on dfsadmin report command-line.

I also added a start-up log message to the DN about the maximum locked memory we have, and lowered the log level of the DN CacheReport to debug (it was flooding the logs), Looks good, just one comment: can we move the log line to DataNode#startDatanode where we do the rlimit capacity checks? Also please capitalize the log message. +1 once addressed., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
