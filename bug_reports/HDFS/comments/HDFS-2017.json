[Not clear about he problem you are describing.

You mean to say here the upgrade failed but Namenode started functioning?

> But if a ROLLBACK is done , the 1st dir will be rolled back (the older copy becomes current and its checkpointtime is now LESS than other dirs ..) and others left behind since they dont contain previous

How is this possible? The directory that is rolled back will be consistent with the directories that were not upgraded previously and hence are not rolled back.

> New changes lost after rollback
During rollback new changes are indeed lost., >You mean to say here the upgrade failed but Namenode started functioning?

Here , it is the Namenode process stopping abnormally(due to external cause) just after upgrade of the 1st name directory . After that , we're again starting it normally (REGULAR) and it is starting up fine .. 

>How is this possible? The directory that is rolled back will be consistent with the directories that were not upgraded previously and hence are not rolled back.

The difference in the directories is due to the second normal restart . Here(the 2nd restart-normal) , during loadfsimage , the 1st dir ll be loaded and written to other dirs during savenamespace (chktime incremented) .. Now if new changes are made and  we rollback .. 
 After rollback , since only the 1st dir ll be rollbacked and others left behind (since they dont 've previous dirs) , the rollbacked 1st dir ll not contain the new changes , while the others ll contain Delta  .. now the 2nd dir ll be loaded since its chktime is higher than the 1st dir's chktime , and will be written to all other dirs .. So , due to this , Delta will be available after this rollback ..

> During rollback new changes are indeed lost.

Yes , thats normal .. 
, Can you please answer the questions I asked on the list the other day?

>Steps to reproduce :

Are you running the "upgrade" command with 0.21?
 
>  3) Start namenode and write some files (delta) & then stop

> Which version do you restart with? 0.21 again or 0.20?
 
  4) Rollback namenode

You started the namenode after failed upgrade? Generally what you do is, rollback when upgrade fails. Ensure upgrade is successful before going ahead with the service.

However I do see a need for change. The system should not continue with its service when upgrade fails. It should ensure user performs rollback., I guess this old issue probably is not-a-problem anymore.  Resolving ...
