[I find the root cause of this bug.
The rpc port in Nfs3Base and RpcProgramNfs3 is not correct. We should use the configuration in Configuration.
I think I can give a patch later., [~wangg23], thanks for reporting the issue.
This problem seems to be corrected by HDFS-5246 by accident. Please let me know if any other related configurations is still not working in your environment., [~wangg23], I am resolving this JIRA as a dup of HDFS-5246.
Please feel free to reopen it if you think HDFS-5246 doesn't fix all the problems you saw., @Brandon Li , I double checked the source code.
In hadoop 2.2.0 released code, I think this issue exists.
In  the latest trunk, it seems that it is fixed.
I tagged the affected version as 2.2.0.
Could you confirm this issue is fixed in 2.2.0 ?, [~wangg23], hadoop 2.2.0 has been released and nothing can be changed for it. The next hadoop release will have the fix of HDFS-5246., [~brandonli], actually I have formatted a patch for this issue based on 2.2.0 source. I understand that 2.2.0 is released. Is it possible to include this patch in version 2.2.x ? Thanks., [~brandonli]], I see the changes in trunk code. The nfs code is very different from release 2.2.0.  A bunch of new features are included in trunk. My patch only works for 2.2.0.
Although looks like the issue is fixed accidentally in this jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5469 ,  I will get the latest code to check whether this issue is fixed. 

If it is still not fixed, I will reopen this jira. 

Thanks.:)]
