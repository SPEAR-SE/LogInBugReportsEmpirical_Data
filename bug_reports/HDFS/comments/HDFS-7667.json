[Diffs attached., While you're there, fix:

{code}
$HADOOP_PREFIX/bin/hdfs start namenode --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR  -upgrade -clusterId <cluster_ID>
{code}

to be

{code}
$HADOOP_PREFIX/bin/hdfs --daemon start namenode --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR  -upgrade -clusterId <cluster_ID>
{code}


Also be aware that this may not apply to 2.x.  The documentation is different., Oh, should probably drop --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR , since that's pretty useless as well., [~aw],

Thanks for looking it over. The .001 version makes those two changes., There are other problems in the doc. but I don't know if you want to fix them now or wait till later. Following the mantra of "Don't let best stop better", I'm +1 for committing this to trunk.  Let me know if you want to continue working on it or commit this version now. :)

Thanks!, [~aw],

Thanks for the review. I started out intending to just fix a few minor errors (missing articles, obviously wrong typos in commands, etc.). Then I couldn't help myself so I made some slightly larger grammatical changes and tightened up a few things. Please stop me before I kill any more and commit this.

Thanks!

Of course we still have not heard from Mr. Jenkins... I wonder where he is today.
, lol, believe I know the feeling... :D

Committed to trunk.

Thanks!, Thanks for the review and the commit [~aw]. If you're bored, HDFS-7644 is a 3 char fix.
