[Patch uploaded. The patch also refactors FSDirectory#replaceNode() by removing unnecessary FSNamesystem locking and rooDir.addINode() call., "by removing unnecessary FSNamesystem locking" -- I mean remove unnecessary fsdir locking. But to provide an unprotected version of replaceNode for the call in applyEditLogOp should be better., Add a new testcase in which we call setQuota (which calls
INodeDirectory#replaceChild) and rename for a directory. Without the fix to call the INode#getFullPathName for a file in the directory returns the wrong name., Jing, thanks for working on this.  What the actual problem the bug would cause?  Data loss or just some incorrect reports/logs?, The INode#parent is mainly used by INode#getFullPathName which is used in generating reports/logs and fsck (through FSNamesystem#listCorruptFileBlocks)., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
