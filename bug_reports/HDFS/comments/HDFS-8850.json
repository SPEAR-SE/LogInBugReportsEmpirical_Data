, Removing the 2.6.1-candidate label, as this is an issue for a class that exists only in 2.7 and as such I don't think it applies to 2.6. Let me know if you think this issue exists in 2.6., +1 LGTM , Adding back 2.6.1-candidate label for tracking. Will remove it once 2.6.1 is done., About to make an RC for 2.6.1. Dropping the 2.6.1 label as we have decided to drop this. Adding it to 2.7.2 though., [~hitliuyi], [~cmccabe]: Does it make sense to commit to 2.7.2 ?, Cherry-picked to branch-2.7., I think this makes sense for 2.7.2.  Thanks, all.]
