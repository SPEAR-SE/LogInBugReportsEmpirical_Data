[Here are the steps
1. Load a file to hdfs
2. change the permission to 755
3. Issue a create rest call and send overwrite=true for the above file
4. check the permission of the file after it got overwritten

actual: rw-r--r--
expected: rwxr-xr-x

If one is overwriting an existing file, it should not change the permission of that file unless explicitly asked for., > expected: rwxr-xr-x

HDFS file does not have 'x' permission.  The the expected string is incorrect., Changed the test to set the permission to 666 and it still failed

Expected: rw-rw-rw-
Actual: rw-r--r-- , Actually, setting the permission to the new one is the correct behavior.

Could you try the same thing for DistributedFileSystem?  You may want to set umask to 000 so that it won't affect the specified permission., resolving as invalid based on Nicholas's comments, Closed upon release of version 1.0.0.]
