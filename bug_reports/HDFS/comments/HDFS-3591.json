[This is mostly a direct port of HDFS-3357 and HADOOP-8350.  To be able to pull them in I had to move GenericTestUtils.java from hdfs to common like was done in HADOOP-8280.  I also had to create an implementation of BPOfferService.triggerHeartbeatForTest that is compatible with the work done in the HA patch.  The implementation of this method is the only new code in the entire patch, everything else is pulling in existing patches., This patch does not apply to trunk, or branch-0.23.  This only applies to branch-0.23 as it is backporting code already in trunk, and branch-2.  I ran all of the HDFS, and common tests, and they all passed for me.  I also brought up a small 3 node cluster and ran a few tests on it, and they all passed., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12534305/HDFS-3357-branch-0.23.txt
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 6 new or modified test files.

    -1 patch.  The patch command could not apply the patch.
