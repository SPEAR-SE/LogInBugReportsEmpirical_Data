This message is automatically generated., Nice catch. Here balancer exits here after 5 iterations of what it thinks has 0B move. It means it is still balancing and exits in middle the process. I see that the Bytes left to move is going down in every iteration.
It will be nice to have this fixed. But it would be good to have a unit test as well., h7364_20141106.patch: adds bytesAlreadyMoved checks to the existing unit tests., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
