, [~elgoiri] thanks for looking into this.
It can be considered for {{2.9.0}}(Currently voting inprogress) if there is one more RC, Might not block {{2.9.0}}(as there is an alternative to start {{dfsrouter}}),but better to have. what do you think..?, I would definitely commit to trunk, branch-3 and branch-2.
Not sure about the 2.9 release; [~subru], do you want to do branch-2.9 or branch-2.9.0?, bq.I would definitely commit to trunk, branch-3 and branch-2
FYI.it's applicable to only {{branch-2}} and {{branch-2.9.0}}. Script was rewritten for {{trunk}} and {{branch-3.0}}, bq. FYI.it's applicable to only branch-2 and branch-2.9.0. Script was rewritten for trunk and branch-3.0

That makes sense, my bad.
This was broken when backporting to branch-2 in HDFS-12620.
[~subru], do you want to push to branch-2.9 and branch-2.9.0 or just branch-2?, Thanks [~brahmareddy] for reporting/fixing it and [~elgoiri] for the review. 

bq. It can be considered for 2.9.0(Currently voting inprogress) if there is one more RC, Might not block 2.9.0(as there is an alternative to start dfsrouter),but better to have. what do you think..?

I agree. So for now, commit it to branch-2/branch-2.9 and we'll cherry-pick it to branch-2.9.0 in case we do a RC1., Committed to {{branch-2}} and {{branch-2.9.0}}. thanks [~elgoiri] for review., Just to clarify, [~brahmareddy], you meant {{branch-2}} and {{branch-2.9}}; not {{branch-2.9.0}} right?
The fix versions seem correct., Yes, even it's pushed to {{branch-2.9.0}} for safe side.Looks RC0 is cancelled for {{branch-2.9.0}} then this can be considered for {{2.9.0}} release.]
