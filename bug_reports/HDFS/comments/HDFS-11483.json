[-When we run sbin/start-dfs.sh , even if the the secondary namenode is 0.0.0.0 Its instructed to start...

To avoid this, protection was added, which is there in recent version,
but this file was not tagged to release.
Hence if we download the hadoop tar from mirror and try to execute it,
it starts secondarynamenode on 0.0.0.0
when it is supposed to switch to localhost, 
I'm not sure I follow.

release-3.0.0-alpha2-RC0 s the tag for Apache Hadoop 3.0.0 alpha2.  Looking at https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-3.0.0-alpha2-RC0/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/bin/start-dfs.sh, it's clearly had changes since May 2015, including several of my own patches.  If we grab the 3.x source and binary distros from the ASF website, it matches.

Looking at the release-2.7.3-RC2 tag and comparing it to branch-2, branch-2.7, and other (relatively) recent Apache Hadoop 2.x tag and branches, the code for start-dfs.sh all match.  

So this all looks normal, given:

* Apache Hadoop 3.x alpha releases have the newer, incompatible-with-2.x bits.

* There have been no changes made to start-dfs.sh in the branch-2 stream in a very long time, thus code from May 2015 is correct.]
