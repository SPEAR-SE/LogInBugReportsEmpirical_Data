[I found that the failure is caused by the interaction of HDFS-7217 patch and HDFS-5428.

HDFS-5428 created the failied test. HDFS-7217 delayed incremental block report for receiving block by one heartbeat.

Provided a patch to change the testing code to trigger block report.

Hi [~kihwal] and [~jingzhao], you guys worked on the above mentioned jiras. Would you please help taking a look at the patch?

Thanks a lot.

, Many thanks [~jingzhao]!

FYI, I just took a look at HDFS-7226 (TestDNFencing.testQueueingWithAppend failed often in latest test) a bit and found that it seems to be related to HDFS-7217 change too. However, it's more subtle there, and it appears to have something to do with hflush. I will look more at that jira a bit later.
