[Patch attached. I verified (via inserting a call to ExitUtil#terminate) that if one of the tests in TestListCorruptFileBlocks fails due to an exit exception the others still pass. , +1, the patch looks good to me.

I think it would be best long-term to move the ExitUtil checks out of MiniDFSCluster and into pre/post test case methods, which can probably be done via a JUnit RunListener, similarly to the patch that's posted to HADOOP-8755. That can certainly be done in a separate JIRA, though, and should maybe be done after HADOOP-8755 goes in., Good idea, filed HDFS-3929., -1 overall.
