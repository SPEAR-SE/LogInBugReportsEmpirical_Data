[Here is an example from HDFS-5522's precommit build, in which TestNameNodeRespectsBindHostKeys#testServiceRpcBindHostKey failed.

The test case starts up a MiniDFSCluster and does a check. Then it is shutdown and another one is started with a modified config variable and the test case does another check.

During the first NN is startup, the NN internally sets {{fs.defaultFs}}, {{dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address}}, {{dfs.namenode.rpc-address}}, {{dfs.namenode.http-address}}, {{dfs.namenode.https-address}} with the port it actually bound to.  MiniDFSCluster#createNameNode() sets this again after NN startup mainly for HA/federation with nsid and nnid.

The next time MiniDFSCluster is started or just NN is restarted, the config will contain target binding addresses with a non-zero port number.  Certain configs like {{fs.defaultFs}} is reset by MiniDFSCluster in certain cases (not all the time!), but {{dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address}} is left with the real port.  During restart the NN tries to bind to the specific port for the service RPC server.

In the failed test case, port 48275 was initially used by the service RPC server. Next time, http server was started with 127.0.0.1:0 and happened to use the recently freed 48275.  Because this port is already taken, the service RPC server failed to start and MiniDFSCluster startup failed.

, This seems like a pretty serious bug. Kihwal, do you have a rough count of how many tests are broken? If it's really substantial, we might need to do the fixing on a branch to avoid a mega patch, and to help split up the work.]
