                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.TestRetryCacheWithHA
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.TestDataNodeRollingUpgrade
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.TestFileTruncate

                                      The following test timeouts occurred in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs:

org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.TestDatanodeManager

Test results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/9305//testReport/
Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/9305//console

This message is automatically generated., The failed tests are not related. TestDataNodeRollingUpgrade and TestRetryCacheWithHA passed on my local machine, and TestFileTruncate failed on trunk as well.

This patch is trivial so there is no additional test., Will commit later, thanks [~eddyxu] for the contribution and [~cmccabe] for the review., Commit to trunk. The issue only exists in trunk., Thank you so much [~hitliuyi], FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6915 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6915/])
