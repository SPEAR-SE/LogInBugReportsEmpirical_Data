This message is automatically generated., Could someone help me to validate the scenario and the proposed fix. The problem I could see is, fs.create(BALANCER_ID_PATH) is allowing to do OVER_WRITE=true, when another balancer comes its not getting the 'AlreadyBeingCreatedException' and start perform balancing.

This message was automatically generated., It looks like {{hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.TestFileTruncate}} is not related to my patch.
, Expectation of create with overwrite on open file was changed in HDFS-3755. Before this, NN used to throw AlreadyBeingCreatedException. So there was no problem.

Source changes looks good. 
In Test, {{balancerStarted.countDown();}} should be called after {{runBalancer(..)}} right?
, Thanks [~vinayrpet] for the review comments. Yes you are correct, the test is flaky. I've modified the test case to ensure the {{first balancer}} is running when triggering the {{second balancer}}. Kindly take a look at the patch again., \\

This message was automatically generated., Attached another patch fixing the checkstyle comments., Rakesh, thanks for filing this bug.  It was a good catch.

The real fix is "fs.create(idPath, false);".  The new checkAnotherBalancerIsRunning() method is for fail-fast.  Some minor comments.

- For the test, the first Balancer may finish and exist before the second balancer start.  So how about simply creating the file but not run the first balancer?  I.e.
{code}
//testManyBalancerSimultaneously() t
      FileSystem fs = cluster.getFileSystem(0);
      final FSDataOutputStream out = fs.create(Balancer.BALANCER_ID_PATH, false);
      out.writeBytes(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName());
      out.hflush();
{code}
- Could you not renaming out to fsout in checkAndMarkRunning()., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~szetszwo] for the review comments.

bq. The real fix is "fs.create(idPath, false);". The new checkAnotherBalancerIsRunning() method is for fail-fast. Some minor comments.
Yes. I hope you are agreeing to keep this check in my logic.

bq. For the test, the first Balancer may finish and exist before the second balancer start.
Awsome. This will make it very simple. I'll modify this as per your suggestion

bq. Could you not renaming out to fsout in checkAndMarkRunning().
I renamed because checkstyle is complaining like,
{code}
./hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/balancer/NameNodeConnector.java:250:28: 'out' hides a field.
{code}
Does this change makes sense?


, Indeed, we could combine checkAnotherBalancerIsRunning to checkAndMarkRunning as below.  I also adds a comment to explain why doing append.
{code}
  private OutputStream checkAndMarkRunning() throws IOException {
    try {
      if (fs.exists(idPath)) {
        // try appending to it so that it will fail fast if another balancer is running.
        IOUtils.closeStream(fs.append(idPath));
        fs.delete(idPath, true);
      }
      final FSDataOutputStream fsout = fs.create(idPath, false);
      // mark balancer idPath to be deleted during FileSystem closure
      fs.deleteOnExit(idPath);
      if (write2IdFile) {
        fsout.writeBytes(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName());
        fsout.hflush();
      }
      return fsout;
    } catch(RemoteException e) {
      if(AlreadyBeingCreatedException.class.getName().equals(e.getClassName())){
        return null;
      } else {
        throw e;
      }
    }
  }
{code}
, Thanks [~szetszwo]. Attached another patch addressing the previous comments. Also, I've tried one more test case to simulate the case where another balancer successfully performs {{append}} operation and gone ahead with balancing. Kindly review the patch again., I think its good to merge two test cases under one unit test, it would avoid start another cluster again. Attached the modified patch to the jira., Latest patch looks good.
One nit in test.
{code}	      // release lease so that another balancer would run
      assertTrue("Failed to run first balancer!",
      fs.exists(Balancer.BALANCER_ID_PATH));{code}
comment is irrelevant here.
