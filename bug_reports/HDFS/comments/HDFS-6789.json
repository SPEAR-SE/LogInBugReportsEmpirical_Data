, The tests fail because
{code}
    FileSystem fs = HATestUtil.configureFailoverFs(cluster, conf);
{code}
calls {{NameNode.getAddress(nameNodeUri)}} to get {{InetSocketAddress}} for initializing {{ProxyAndInfo}} after HDFS-6507.
Since the tests are to ensure {{FileSystem}} and {{FileContext}} does not resolve the logical hostname, I think it's fine to spy NameService after initializing {{FileSystem}}., Attaching a patch to spy NameSpace after initializing FileSystem., I applied the patch and confirmed the tests passed in two environments:
* Oracle JDK7u40 in Mac OS X 10.9
* Oracle JDK7u65 in CentOS 6.4, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
