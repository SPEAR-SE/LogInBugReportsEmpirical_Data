[TransferFsImage.getFileClient is the single point of entry for the code that does transfer of the image and edits and it would be great to set timeouts in there.
However it is also used for telling the namenode it is time to pick up the image from checkpoint. And this call will sit without response until the namenode fetches the image, which can be a while.

We could either set the timeout to be rather large, giving the namenode enough time to fetch the image or we could set different timeouts for these cases.
In the second scenario we can theoretically rely on the fact that File[] localPaths passed into getFileClient is null and act accordingly.

Any thoughts?, Hi Molkov,

We also faced same problem in 2.0.1.

Also test failure is unrelated to current patch, - I dont like reusing the ipc ping interval for this timeout here. It's from an entirely separate module, and I don't see why one should correlate to the other. Why not introduce a new config which defaults to something like 1 minute?
- In the test case, shouldn't you somehow notify the servlet to exit? Currently it waits on itself, but nothing notifies it.

Ok, agree. Will introduce new config for this.

That was just added make the client call get timeout. Ideally while stopping the server, that will be interrupted. Anyway I will add a timeout for that also.

Thanks todd, for comments. I will post new patch in sometime., Attached the patch with different config, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This really needs a functional test that does a kill -STOP `cat /var/run/whatever.pid` and then verifies that a hung process is picked up. The tests I've been doing for HA on the 1.x branch can trigger things like this; we should consider integrating the test framework w/ hadoop, either as an upstream dependency or in bigtop, with the functional HA test suite there., Fixed typo.
Added @VisibleForTesting, since 'timeout' is used in test.

We have tested this in cluster, when the active nn's n/w broken. GetImage call got timeout., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
