This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good to me. I'm pretty confident the test failure is unrelated.

My only suggestion would be to maybe make the logging thresholds configurable, or a percentage of the related timeout if there is one, but you can take it or leave it.

+1, Thanks, I decided not to change the timeouts for warning -- they're set to 1 sec, which is a long enough time that you wouldn't expect any well-configured disk to take that long to fsync. Even if the timeout is 20sec, you'd probably want to know if your IO is taking more than 10s of ms, really, so 1sec should be conservative.
