This message is automatically generated., Resubmitting same patch to kick the build since it applies fine for me..., It makes sense to get rid of throwIOExceptionFromConnection(). If connection attempt failed or sending request resulted in an exception, it shouldn't try to check the http response code.  

+1 Looks good to me. Don't we need the same patch for branch-1? , Yes, I should have commented that {{throwIOExceptionFromConnection}} is wrong.  Http error codes do not generate an exception.  If an exception occurs during the connect, something seriously went wrong.  Ie. connect error, could send request, SSL negotiation failed, etc.  Thus the client is left in a blocking read waiting for a response that will never come.  The methods like {{getInputStream}} read the response code and headers.

On a side note, it's also odd that the DN's jetty doesn't have a timeout while waiting for a request.  Maybe it does, but when the DN is getting jammed the timeout isn't kicking in.  To clarify for others, we are addressing three problems:
# Socket is left dangling because the remote host closed the socket.  Not sure why unless there's a linux kernel bug (unlikely?) or the tcp FIN packets were somehow lost.
# DN accepts the connection, but never sends a response.
# DN host becomes a "zombie".  The host is inexplicably hung such that you can't even ssh or console into the box.  Sockets connect into the listen backlog, but are never accepted and processed.

This message is automatically generated., Last was missing a file, but investigating test failures.  Test creates a listening socket with a backlog of 1.  It opens a connection to fill the backlog, then tries to open another to test the connection timeout.  On OS X, the second connect fails as expected, but on linux the second connect succeeds...., Linux considers the requested listen backlog as "advisory"...  It rounds it up to the next power of 2, with a floor of 16.  I modified the test to try up to 32 times to trigger a connect timeout., -1 overall.
