[I don't think changes to DN->NN RPC are considered "incompatible changes" going from eg 0.22 to 0.23, since they don't affect users. Given that we don't purport to allow rolling upgrade between releases like this, it's not particularly an issue, right?, Good point. Flag removed., Patch attached.

1. Modifies FSDataset to track and report volume failures like other capacity etc. Adds the test listed in the description, makes TestDataNodeVolumeFailureReporting more robust.

2. Renames the volumesFailed metric to volumeFailures to accurately reflect what it's tracking. This doesn't break compatibility because this metric (added in HDFS-811) has not yet been released., Updated patch attached. Breaks out the testing of DFS_DATANODE_FAILED_VOLUMES_TOLERATED to a new test so it's easier to add new tests of this functionality., Some small comments:
- {{getNumFailedVols}} - probably best not to abbreviate vols, since most of the time we use the full word: {{getNumFailedVolumes}}
- in {{errorReport(...)}} we seem to log twice in the case that there is a disk error. Maybe the first LOG.info should get moved inside the if statement, and "msg" should be included in the warns?

Also, should make this Patch Available to run through Hudson., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Is this TestDatanodeBlockScanner failure related to the patch? It has a strange error message:
java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for corrupt replicas. Waiting for 1, but only found 1
, TestDatanodeBlockScanner passes for me in eclipse and when looped from the command line. I think this is related to an earlier change. The error message indicates we need to bump the number of attempts (ie it did see 1 corrupt replica after 20 attempts, but it also bails on the 20th attempt).

I'll bump the # attempts to 50 so we're more tolerant.
