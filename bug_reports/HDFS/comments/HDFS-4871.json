[+1 on the approach to enable CI.

[~arpitagarwal], do you know if we need to do something similar for Yarn, mapreduce tests as well? Or is this limited to common tests?

Thanks!, Thanks Chuan.

No we'd need to do this for HDFS, MR and Yarn tests too.

Once we get past the commons build failure we can address the remaining ones.

However I am running into some problems with using assumptions to skip tests in branch-2, I am not sure if this is due to a different version of jUnit. I am looking into it., Thanks Arpit, +1 on the proposal. Getting CI working on Windows is a great step forward for Hadoop on Windows!

bq. JIRAs for remaining failing tests to follow soon.
My personal preference would be to file a single parent task Jira, and as we fix individual tests we can link their Jiras to the parent Jira.

Can't we do this in a less intrusive manner, for example in test patch (or Windows equivalent), or some other script external to test code?, >My personal preference would be to file a single parent task Jira, and as we fix individual tests we can link their Jiras to the parent Jira.

This is a really good suggestion! I have create HADOOP-9620 to track the unit test issues in branch-2 on Windows., Thanks [~Chuan Liu] and [~sureshms]. Most of these patches have been committed to branch-2, the only remaining commit is HADOOP-9527 pending review from Ivan., I am resolving this as most of the commons issues have now been fixed with the exception of HADOOP-9527.]
