This message is automatically generated., The findbugs reported here is really odd. Does appear unrelated to this config wrapping patch.

bq. Class org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.tools.GetConf$Command defines non-transient non-serializable instance field handler
bq. This Serializable class defines a non-primitive instance field which is neither transient, Serializable, or java.lang.Object, and does not appear to implement the Externalizable interface or the readObject() and writeObject() methods.  Objects of this class will not be deserialized correctly if a non-Serializable object is stored in this field.

What makes this odd is that GetConf.java was not touched since September 2011 per {{viewvc}}. Why would this appear now?, +1, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1558 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1558/])
