[Hi Gera,

WebHdfsFileSystem doesn't have support for symlinks right now, and symlinks are also hard disabled in recent versions of Hadoop. When we do add support, being able to throw UnresolvedLinkException will definitely be part of that.

So, if you don't mind, I'll dupe this to the existing webhdfs symlink JIRA at HDFS-4934.]
