[Here's the check for HDFS encryption
{code}
  public boolean isHDFSEncryptionEnabled() {
    return conf.get(
        DFSConfigKeys.DFS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PROVIDER_URI, null) != null;
  }
{code}

The presence of an empty {{<dfs.encryption.key.provider.uri>}} is enough to fail this test, because the result isn't null, it is "".

It's not enough to have an empty property (as ramya verified) â€”the property must be completely deleted.

So: I think it's a bug in the DFSClient check; it should be something like:

{code}
  public boolean isHDFSEncryptionEnabled() {
   String provider = conf.get(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PROVIDER_URI, "") 
    return !provider.isEmpty();
  }
{code}

That is: if the provider URI is "" then there's no key provider, hence no encryption.

Fix is trivial, writing tests to verify that everything work will take slightly longer., Patch 001

# moves the probe to a static method in {{DFSUtils}}
# changes the logic so that if the trimmed value is "" then there's no encryption. This includes changing the default from {{null}} to "" so the {{getTrimmed()}} never returns null.
# adds a test which validates the logic.
# went through all references to the key {{DFSConfigKeys.DFS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PROVIDER_URI}} to enforce the same logic: {{getTrimmed( KEY, "")}} with "" meaning "no provider"

I'm tagging this as critical as in its current state you can't include an empty property in the configuration., \\

This message was automatically generated., Test failure is about a zip exception reading core-default.xml. That looks to me like one build has just stamped on the maven artifacts of another. Unrelated to this JIRA at all. Cancelling and restarting just to demonstrate., Thanks [~steve_l] for working on this. The patch looks good to me. 
We could also fix this by checking if (dfs.getKeyProvider != null) instead of using if (dfs.isHDFSEncryptionEnabled()) in DistributedFileSystem#addDelegationTokens(). This way, invalid key provider URIs (such as null or empty) could naturally be handled in KeyProviderCache#get(). And we could also remove isHDFSEncryptionEnabled() which is only used in DistributedFileSystem#addDelegationTokens., +1 for the fix., I will commit it shortly., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7884 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7884/])
