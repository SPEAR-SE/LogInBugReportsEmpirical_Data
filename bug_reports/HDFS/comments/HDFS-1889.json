[Attaching patch. No tests added since this tests the scripts that start and stop hadoop., Hey John,

I think we need to make this change in a number of places. I think federation added a bunch of uses of HADOOP_HOME that should be HADOOP_HDFS_HOME:

On trunk pre-federation:
{noformat}
hdfs2 (branch-0.22)$ grep -r HADOOP_HOME bin/
bin/hdfs-config.sh:elif [ -d "${HADOOP_HOME}" ]; then
bin/hdfs-config.sh:  . "$HADOOP_HOME"/bin/hadoop-config.sh
{noformat}

On trunk:
{noformat}
hdfs2 (branch-0.22)$ c trunk
Switched to branch 'trunk'
hdfs2 (trunk)$ grep -r HADOOP_HOME bin/
bin/hdfs-config.sh:elif [ -d "${HADOOP_HOME}" ]; then
bin/hdfs-config.sh:  . "$HADOOP_HOME"/bin/hadoop-config.sh
bin/stop-dfs.sh:NAMENODES=$($HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs getconf -namenodes)
bin/stop-dfs.sh:SECONDARY_NAMENODES=$($HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs getconf -secondarynamenodes 2>&-)
bin/start-dfs.sh:NAMENODES=$($HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs getconf -namenodes)
bin/start-dfs.sh:SECONDARY_NAMENODES=$($HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs getconf -secondarynamenodes 2>&-)
bin/refresh-namenodes.sh:namenodes=$("$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs" getconf -namenodes)
bin/refresh-namenodes.sh:  "$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs" dfsadmin -refreshNodes
bin/distribute-exclude.sh:namenodes=$("$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs" getconf -namenodes)
bin/distribute-exclude.sh:excludeFilenameRemote=$("$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs" getconf -excludeFile)
