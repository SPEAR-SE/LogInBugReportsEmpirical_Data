[Hey Liaowenrui,

 See the [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8721?focusedCommentId=13405151&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13405151] for details on your question. It can clear some of your basic doubt and can check more on NFS tutorials for further.

Please post such questions in mailing lists rather than in JIRAs.
JIRA is mainly for tracking the confirmed bugs., This is ensured by fencing, see the docs more details:
http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/HDFSHighAvailability.html, Eli Collins,

  I Know it. if This is ensured by fencing,and the standby become active.but if the server of active Namenode is shutdown,fecing active fail,the standby NameNode is not become Active.the hdfs is not used. 

  and also,because the server of active NameNode is shutdown lead to hdfs is not used, I think this Design is not Reasonable.do you think it?, Uma,
what do you mean?, Dropping fix-version from 'non-fixed' (didn't have code-fixes) JIRAs.]
