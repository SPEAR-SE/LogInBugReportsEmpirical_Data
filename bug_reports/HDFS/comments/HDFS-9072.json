, Hey [~stevel@apache.org], it looks to me like this commit broke branch-2 compilation due to a missing import of {{DFSTestUtil}}. I just pushed a little commit to fix branch-2 compilation (e533555b577c3678aa7a430c6b084973187de18a) and was hoping you could take a look at it when you get a chance., The two test cases are also failing in branch-2.7. The trunk patch applies, but its dependency, HDFS-9067, is not applicable to 2.7 as it is patching the non-existant TestLazyWriter as well.

I am attaching the patch that includes {{DFSTestUtil.waitForMetric()}}., +1 but please file a new jira since this appears to loop forever waiting for the metric.  the 1s delay probably wastes a lot of runtime in the tests..., bq. please file a new jira since this appears to loop forever waiting for the metric
Filed HDFS-9740., Committed the patch to 2.7., Closing the JIRA as part of 2.7.3 release.]
