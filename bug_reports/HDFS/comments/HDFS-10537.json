[The exception is saying that the edit directory (specified via configuration value)  contains an authority component in the value.
What is the value of the following conf keys ?
1. dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir
2. dfs.namenode.edits.dir

If both of the above keys are not specified then the edits directory will default to {{dfs.namenode.name.dir}}  value.
But I don't see the authority component in your {{dfs.namenode.name.dir}} so I suspect that you are specifying one of the above 2 conf values.]
