[This is particularly problematic for tests on Windows.  The tests stop and start {{MiniDFSCluster}} many times within the same process.  Windows holds a lock on the unclosed verification log, preventing {{MiniDFSCluster}} from fully deleting the testing data directory.  This problem currently causes 152 test suites to fail early during initialization on Windows.

I have a patch in progress for {{DataBlockScanner}} to call a shutdown method on {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}} so that it can close the verification log., The attached patch changes {{DataBlockScanner#run}} so that during shutdown, it iterates through every {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}} and calls a new {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#shutdown}} method, which closes the verification log.

Jenkins will give this patch -1 for no new tests, but this patch is going to fix more than 100 test suites when running on Windows., Adding 3.0.0 to Affects Version/s and Target Version/s.

This message is automatically generated., +1 Looks good, Thanks Chris for reporting the problem and for the patch! I also saw that something around DataBlockScanner causes many tests to fail.

Quick question, would it make sense to shutdown BlockPoolSliceScanners on DataBlockScanner#shutdown? In the current patch you are assuming that it is fine to close the verificationlogs when DataBlockScanner#run exits what might not be always true (don't know for sure, asking based on the class relationship). Just a thought, otherwise patch looks good., Xuan and Ivan, thank you for the code reviews.  I'm going to cancel this patch for now, because I'm working on an improved version.  I still see a few lingering test failures caused by the fact that {{DataBlockScanner#shutdown}} performs its shutdown work asynchronous of the caller within its background blockScannerThread.  I have a patch in progress to make this synchronous, so that the caller of {{DataBlockScanner#shutdown}} knows deterministically that shutdown has completed.  I'll let you know when the new patch is available for review.

I believe this is a safe change.  {{DataNode#shutdown}} calls {{DataBlockScanner#shutdown}}.  {{DataBlockScanner}} owns the {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}} instances.  All operations on {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}} that could use the internal {{verificationLog}} instance are initiated from the background thread of {{DataBlockScanner}}.  Therefore, when the {{DataBlockScanner}} background thread is exiting, it is safe to close each verification log, because nothing else will attempt to use it.
, Here is the new version of the patch:

# During {{DataNode}} shutdown, change {{DataBlockScanner#run}} to shut down every allocated {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}}, which in turn closes the verification logs.  This part is the same as the earlier patch.
# {{DataBlockScanner#shutdown}} also joins to the background blockScannerThread.  There is a slightly tricky bit in here about avoiding a deadlock.  I explained it in comments.  This is necessary to make shutdown synchronous, so that the caller knows deterministically that shutdown has completed.  In the case of {{MiniDFSCluster}}, it means that it is safe to delete the working directories, because nothing will be holding locks.
# Change {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#scan}} to use {{Thread#isInterrupted}} instead of {{Thread#interrupted}}.  {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#scan}} runs within the blockScannerThread, which depends on seeing the interrupted status of the thread to know when to exit.  (See the while loop condition in {{DataBlockScanner#run}}.)  When {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#scan}} was calling {{Thread#interrupted}}, it would clear the current thread's interrupted status, so that the while loop in {{DataBlockScanner#run}} would never see it, and therefore would never exit.  This was occasionally causing tests to enter an infinite loop on Windows.

With this patch in place, I am consistently seeing good test results on Mac and Windows, with no tests blocked on a prior {{MiniDFSCluster}} holding a lock on a verification log., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Hey ya'll, it looks like this commit has broken TestLargeBlock. I can't tell for sure since the results from this JIRA's test-patch run have been deleted by Jenkins, but I suspect that this wasn't noticed since test-patch doesn't report on tests that time out rather than explicitly fail.

This test failure is tracked by HDFS-4328. Chris - would you mind taking a look at that JIRA to see if you can tell what the trouble is?, Aaron, thanks for the note here so that I would notice the new jira.  I'm going to enter some preliminary analysis on HDFS-4328.
