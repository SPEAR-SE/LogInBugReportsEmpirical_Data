[I think namenode should update the counter of under replicated block and corrupt blocks, even namenod in safe mode.

Attached initial patch. Updated existing test code for test.
Please review.

This message was automatically generated., bq. BlockManager.java:1: File length is 3,821 lines (max allowed is 2,000).

Checkstyle is because of file length..., I think, in the namenode's safemode block stats will not be correct because all block reports might not have updated.
So IMO this is not a problem., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for reviewing...  

Yes you are correct, all block reports might not have updated. But it should return the correct count whatever there in {{UnderReplicatedBlocks}}, after block report it should give the actual count based on block report.
