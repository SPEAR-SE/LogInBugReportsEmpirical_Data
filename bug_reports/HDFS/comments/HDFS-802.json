[Patch to update the Eclipse configuration, We need to have this be an automatic process.  This happens pretty much everytime somebody updates the libraries.  Is there anyway to pull the values from the ivy config file?, Apparently it might be done through some kind of parsing script, e.g. adding all the files from 
{noformat}
build/ivy/lib/hdfsproxy/common
build/ivy/lib/hdfsproxy/test
{noformat}, What I meant is 
{noformat}
build/ivy/lib/Hadoop-Hdfs/common
build/ivy/lib/Hadoop-Hdfs/test
{noformat}, I've patched latest HDFS with this then ran {{ant && ant compile-hdfs-test && ant eclipse-files}} and got working project with all libs in their place.

+1 on the patch., I've just committed this. Thanks Edwin!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #129 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/129/])
