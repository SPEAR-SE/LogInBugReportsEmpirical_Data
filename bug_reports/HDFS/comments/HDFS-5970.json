[Thanks Junping.
, Nice catch, Yongjun! Would be great if you can deliver a patch with unit test., Hi Iunping, 

Thanks for your encouraging words! 

I need to mention that this bug is related to HDFS-5939 that I'm working on. I tried to address HDFS-5939 by adding "return null"
from within the chooseRandom mehtod. Thanks to [~wheat9] who suggested that we need to file this JIRA for callers of this method to 
be aware of that the method could return null when reviewing my HDFS-5939 fix. While we are still discussing the best solution for 
HDFS-5939, it's likely we will replace the "return null" I added with throwing an exception.

Prior to my change, the method chooseRandom already has a piece of code that returns null under certain condition, So this JIRA is 
still valid in that sense. However, we haven't got any report of null value returned from that piece of code yet, probably we can keep 
this JIRA open until we have a real case.  

Thanks.


, The plan sounds reasonable. I agree NPE happens here is still "theoretically", so we can come back to this when real case happen. Move its priority to "Minor" but leave it open until we seriously check it won't happen. , Thanks for making the change. Indeed it's "minor".
 
, We just "reproduced" this issue accidentally using Hadoop 2.3.0:

Unfortunately it causes the namenode shutdown., [~olegd],  what action you do to reproduced ?, I just reproduced it returning null.
