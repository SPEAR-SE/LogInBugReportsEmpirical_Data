, Hi Charles, 

Nice correcting work here and thanks for doing that.

I browsed through, caught one place, 
{code}	
767	        LOG.info("Partical read. Asked offset: " + offset + " count: " + count
768	            + " and read back: " + readCount + "file size: " + attrs.getSize());
{code}

There need to be a space in front of the "file size:".

Hope I did not miss other places.

Thanks.

, Thanks [~clamb] for contribution and Steve for review. 
Will commit it later., Hi Charles, could you rebase the patch for trunk, and make a patch for branch-2? I find some conflicts when committing., Hi [~hitliuyi],

The .004 is rebased for the trunk. Let's wait for the jenkins run. Once that completes, I'll upload the branch-2 rebase diffs.

, bq. Is it correct?

Yes, it's ok because statistics is only declared and never used (except there). Hence, it's always null. Probably a better change would have been to just eliminate statistics completely from the file.
