how could I subscribe from this mailing list??

thank you.

, I don't know , i'm a new hand too., @gschen, you can subscribe the mailing list here: http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html , Does this problem still exist in branch-1?, 
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-1/src/hdfs/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/datanode/FSDataset.java

line 205 ,  same  as above

and also  branch-1.0, Thanks Junjun, could you post a patch as well?

, OK,I'll try,

{code}
  if (children == null || children.length == 0) {
        List childrenList = new ArrayList();
        for (int idx = 0; idx < maxBlocksPerDir; idx++) {
           childrenList .add( new FSDir(new File(dir, DataStorage.BLOCK_SUBDIR_PREFIX+idx)));
        }
        children = childrenList.toArray();
  }
{code}, OK,I'll try,

{code}
  if (children == null || children.length == 0) {
        List childrenList = new ArrayList();
        for (int idx = 0; idx < maxBlocksPerDir; idx++) {
           childrenList .add( new FSDir(new File(dir, DataStorage.BLOCK_SUBDIR_PREFIX+idx)));
        }
        children = childrenList.toArray();
  }
{code}

to not change the exception throw , I remove the try catch .

how do you think?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12566894/patch.txt
  against trunk revision .

    {color:red}-1 patch{color}.  The patch command could not apply the patch.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/3898//console

This message is automatically generated., this patch for  branch1 .  why qa apply it to   hadoop v2 ?, For branch-1 patch, we don't have to submit since QA won't be able to test it., If the FSDir constructor throws an exception, then children won't be initialized.  Would it be a problem?

Also, could you try to add a new test for it?, there may be two situtions cause mkdir failed
1,too deep   , we should tag  this dir as a final dir , do not try to create subdir .
2,space full , do nothing




, there may be two situtions cause mkdir failed
1,too deep , we should tag this dir as a final dir , do not try to create subdir .   so next time it return null .
   and should we catch this exception to choose another not so deep dir to addblock ?
2,space full , do nothing?

and how to know which situtions  is ?

this should be think over., How about try-catch inside the loop and the have a finally-block for the assignment statement?]
