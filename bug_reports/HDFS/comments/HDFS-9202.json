[This issue is after HDFS-8740.

{code}
   static{
-    HdfsConfiguration.init();
+    HdfsConfigurationLoader.init();
   }
{code}
Above change in DistributedFileSystem.java resulted not adding deprecated keys.

There is a need of moving HdfsConfiguration.java to hadoop-hdfs-client module. 
or Having a separate similar class for client module which adds deprecated keys which are related to only clients., Thanks for filing this. The [HDFS-8740] was not aware of the deprecated keys. I agree with [~vinayrpet] that we may need to add deprecated keys in client module that are related only to clients.

As the {{HdfsConfigurationLoader}} is a replacement of {{HdfsConfiguration}} to load default resources, I think we can add the deprecated keys there, following the paradigms in {{HdfsConfiguration}}. {{HdfsConfiguration}} itself should not be moved to {{hadoop-hdfs-client}} module, IMHO, as it adds deprecated keys in server side., Attached patch to add Deprecated keys for client in HdfsConfigurationLoader.

Added a new test class itself, as loading happens in static block, test need to verify n forked JVM.

Please review., HDFS-9301 has resolved this issue by Moving HdfsConfigutaion.java to hadoop-hdfs-client]
