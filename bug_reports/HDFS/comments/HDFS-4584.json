This tests starts one namenode and then attempts to copy the image files. It fails on Windows since the files are open without shared read permissions. Fixing it would require changing the name node to use native File IO.

I propose fixing testMismatchedNNIsRejected and testWebPageHasQjmInfo and skipping testNewNamenodeTakesOverWriter on Windows for now. 

We can file a separate JIRA for the name node change which I expect to be a more involved fix., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi, Arpit.  This looks good.  I verified it on Mac and Windows.  One small thing: instead of {{if (Path.WINDOWS) return;}}, could you use the JUnit assertion {{assumeTrue(!Path.WINDOWS);}}?  JUnit counts and reports skipped tests differently from passing tests, and this is something that I've found helpful for identifying if a project has any tests that are being skipped., Great suggestion Chris and thanks for reviewing.

I have updated the patch., +1 for the patch.  Thanks for making that change., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Arpit, thanks for the patch. 

I was thinking whether it's possible to alter the problematic test {{testNewNamenodeTakesOverWriter}} in a way such that it can still run on Windows. What do you think about doing the following:
1. cluster1#format(true)#build() - same as now, this will generate local image file and namespace id
2. cluster1#shutdown() - release file locks
3. FileUtil#copy() - 
4. cluster1#format(false)#build()
5. cluster1#FileSystem#mkdirs() - move mkdirs here such that it is saved in the edits log
6. cluster2#format(false)#build()

This should preserve the intent of the test and still allow it to run on Windows I think. Let me know if this works. I am fine with the current patch if not., Hi Ivan, I had tried your suggestion but it did not work.

I think the test is fragile by nature, see the commented shutdown() call in the original test. I have filed HDFS-4625 and linked it to track the skipped test case and hope this is a reasonable alternative for now., I have committed this. Thanks, Aprit!
