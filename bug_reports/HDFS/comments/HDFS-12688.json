[Have you checked the HDFS audit logs?  That should give you clues about what is happening here and who is re-creating the directory.  I suspect what's happening here is that the job is executing asynchronously, and you're actually running multiple copies of the job at the same time when you run the script multiple times.  If the job is still running then it is going to re-create the output directory when its tasks need to write output.
, I suspected that same asynchronous behaviour when this issue was brought to my attention by a user. However, at no point in time am I running two copies of the job at the same time. Each time, I have launched my script only after the previous execution would end.

I suggested running it multiple times only because the error occurs randomly -- it has also shown up at the very first run of the script sometimes., Then there is very likely some other job or async behavior that is re-creating the directory.  Please examine the HDFS audit logs.  You should see why the directory is getting re-created after delete there and which node is doing it.  That will likely pinpoint exactly how this is occurring.

, You are right! There was another job that was writing to the same file in there and thus recreating it. This explain it, thank you!, Another job was recreating the file that the user suspected wasn't being deleted.]
