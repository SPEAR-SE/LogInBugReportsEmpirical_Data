bq. Any interest in fixing up the RAT issue too? It looks related to the hdfs-native-client refactor.
Sure. Is this the license issue with {{hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-native-client/src/main/native/fuse-dfs/util/tree.h}}? Should I open a new JIRA? A quick search through the JIRA pool didn't yield any pertinent open JIRAs, but I may have missed it., Thanks for reporting! I just opened HDFS-9215 and submitted a patch.]
