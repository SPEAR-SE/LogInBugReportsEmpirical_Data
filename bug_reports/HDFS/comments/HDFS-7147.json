[h7147_20140926.patch: removes the Configurations section., Thanks for updating the documentation, Nicholas!

Besides the possible new commands proposed by HDFS-7076, maybe we should also provide more details about how storage policies work for files and directories? E.g., how a file's storage policy is determined based on its own policy and the policies set on its ancestral directories, and what to expect for a newly created file's storage policy. Besides, we can also provide doc for the new tool added by HDFS-7140., h7147_20141101.patch:
- allows policyName to be case insensitive;
- removes blockStoragePolicy-default.xml;
- doc changes:
-* adds descriptions for SSD & Memory;
-* adds RAM_DISK storage type;
-* adds All_SSD, One_SSD and Lazy_Persist storage policies;
-* adds "hdfs storagepolicy" command., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
