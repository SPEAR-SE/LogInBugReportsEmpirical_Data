This message is automatically generated., Looking at the failed tests appears to confirm a suspicion of mine that client side file creation is relying on the NN to strip the execute bit.  I'd also look into the permission checker and ensure it isn't going to make any bad determinations based on the presence of the execute bit., @Daryn, thanks for the hints.
Here the change is not to change the default file mode when the regular file is created. It just allows the user to set execution permissions on file. 
, I understand.  However, the CLI tests appear to be failing because touchz is creating files with +x after your patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Previously TestHDFSCLI failed because it didn't expect to see 'x' after "chmod 777". The test has been fixed.
touchz still creates files without +x. I've added one more test step in TestPermission to verify this. Just uploaded a new patch for this.

This message is automatically generated., The unit tests passed in my local test., cancel and then resubmit the patch to trigger the testing again., I'm not sure that allowing sticky bit on file should now be allowed.  Older *nix flavors used it to keep the text segment of an executable in swap.  Linux has never supported it, and I believe most other OSes dropped it., OS not supporting the sticky bit doesn't mean the sticky bit can't be set. 

From file system point view, the sticky bit for regular file has little meaning (sticky bit for directory is a different story). If we try it on Linux, sticky bit can still be set for regular files though the kernel may just ignore it., +1 
Please file jira to change ls command to display and execute and sticky bit permission., Thanks!
JIRA HADOOP-9501 has been created to trick the ls command change.
