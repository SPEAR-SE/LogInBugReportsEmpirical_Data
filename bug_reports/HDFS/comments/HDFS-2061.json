[addStoredBlock() is not currently robust against future sub-classing of BlockInfoUnderConstruction:
{code}
//currently uses
if (block.getClass() == BlockInfoUnderConstruction.class) {...}
//should be
if (block instanceof BlockInfoUnderConstruction) {...}
{code}

processReportedBlock() had a left-over "this" in an assert message, from being moved from DatanodeDescriptor to BlockManager:
{code}
//currently uses
... + " in recentInvalidatesSet should not appear in DN " + this;
//should be
... + " in recentInvalidatesSet should not appear in DN " + dn;
{code}
