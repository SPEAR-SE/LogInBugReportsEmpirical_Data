This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch.  This looks handy.  I'll commit it later today., Thanks for the review [~cnauroth].

The intent was to put this in fs-encryption and then let it percolate to the trunk, but if you would like it in the trunk sooner, feel free to commit it at your leisure.

, I think I'll put it into trunk and branch-2, since it's not directly related to the encryption work.  That will keep the merge patches smaller too when it comes time for merging the encryption work.  I'll plan to do this by end of day unless I hear otherwise from you., +1. Thanks again Chris.
, I committed this to trunk and branch-2.  Charles, thank you for the contribution., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5786 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5786/])
