[@Chris Nauroth, Hello, [~sinago].  This behavior is by design.  The documentation mentions that running {{chmod}} on a file with an ACL actually changes the permissions on the mask entry, which in turn alters the effective permissions for all extended ACL entries.

http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsPermissionsGuide.html#ACLs_Access_Control_Lists

This behavior matches with the POSIX ACL model.  The spec that we used as a reference during development goes into greater detail describing the motivation for the mask entry and its interaction with applications that are not ACL-aware, such as {{chmod}}.

If you want, you can control the mask entry directly by using {{setfacl -m}} and including a mask entry with the explicit permissions that you want.]
