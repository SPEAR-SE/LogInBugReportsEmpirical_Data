[I guess if we create credential for user "root" at namenode, then the problem will go away. But since linux "root" user can run any client program like I described, the issue I described is still valid. Any comments are welcome.
, The problem should manifest with something as simple as this in the doAs:
{code}
FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(conf);
fs.getFileStatus(new Path("/"));
{code}

Webhdfs internally acquires a token and tries to cancel upon close of the fs.  The tokens you explicitly acquired should be inconsequential.  The issue is TokenAspect doesn't know the ugi context that acquired the token.

See if HDFS-6222 solves the problem.  Webhdfs will cancel its own token directly instead of via TokenAspect.  If it solves the issue, let's dup this jira., Thanks a lot [~daryn]! Sorry to late response.Had to work on other stuff daytime.

Your comments above indeed matches the problem reported here and I just verified that your HDFS-6222 patch solves the problem, many thanks for the fix there!

I noticed that you fixed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6312 in this one. But would you please still consider HDFS-6312 as a separate fix? Please see mine and Alejandro's comments there. 

Best regards.
