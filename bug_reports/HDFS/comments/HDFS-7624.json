This message is automatically generated., Hey Sam, could you please explain what is "power platform", and why 4096 as HDFS block size is incorrect?, Hi Konstantin, 

The "power platform" means IBM power system/server and the Linux OS for power has some differences from Linux OS for x86 system. In the test, 'BLOCK_SIZE = 4096' does not mean the HDFS block size is 4096, but mean the operating system page size is 4096. The page size of operating systems are different, so we should not hardcode the page size in the test. The correct way is to get the page size using 'NativeIO.POSIX.getCacheManipulator().getOperatingSystemPageSize()' instead., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
