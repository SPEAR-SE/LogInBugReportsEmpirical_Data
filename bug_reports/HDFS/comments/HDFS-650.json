[Hi Yajun, what is the version of Hadoop are you using?  You may find it from the NameNode's web page (http://namenode:50070/dfshealth.jsp)., Hadoop-0.19.0

, I'm changing 'Affects version' value to {{Unknown}} because:
- Append branch is the part of 0.21 release and this JIRA is mistakenly assigned to the wrong release
- 0.19 version isn't listed among the available releases
, The issue is that the file has been closed and the lease dit not removed. The logic from the code point of view in NameNode, it seems to be unlikely. 

At this point, I could provide some information is that the user request the APPEND operation before the file is not closed.

So this issue is there only in this scenario?? (When user tries to append before closing the file)
, Quite a bit of work has been done on the leases since 19, particularly with the new append.  Has this been seen again?  If not, I'd like to go ahead and resolve it and it appears unlikely that any more progress will be made in determining the problem.  Any objections?, No objection on closing on my side. 0.19 been a long time ago., Resolved.]
