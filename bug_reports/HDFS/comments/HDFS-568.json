, Oops, we have to update mapreduce jar., I think the solution is to update hadoop-mapred-examples-0.21.0-dev.jar since MAPREDUCE-874 has changed it.,  After updated  hadoop-mapred-examples-0.21.0-dev.jar locally, passed TestServiceLevelAuthorization.

No patch is needed for this issue., I have updated hadoop-mapred-examples-0.21.0-dev.jar on trunk., In [build #87|http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hdfs-Patch-vesta.apache.org/87/testReport/], TestServiceLevelAuthorization failed with a NullPointerException.

Got a different story this morning.  The test fails for both commands.  I may have done some wrong previously., I was seeing the same behavior.  , TestServiceLevelAuthorization.testServiceLevelAuthorization() creates a MiniMRCluster and runs some jobs.  I think it makes sense to move it to the mapreduce sub-project., I looked into this and the problem seems to emanating from CompletedJobStatusStore::readCounters(), which is returning a null value and crashing the test.  I don't believe it's related HDFS-538 and it's definitely not related to MAPREDUCE-874.  Since the mapred jars don't get updated with every commit back into hdfs, it's not immediately obvious what may have caused the regression. I've spoken with Arun about it offline and he's looking into a possible cause., MAPREDUCE-870 retiresjobs immediately. So, mapred.job.tracker.retire.jobs is set to false in mapred-site.xml for mapreduce tests to run.
I think the same thing should be done for hdfs also., Attaching patch mapred.job.tracker.retire.jobs to false in mapred-site.xml , submitting for hudson, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
