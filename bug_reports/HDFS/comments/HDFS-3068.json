[@Tom, How about fall back to old block reader if the underlaying socket input stream does not have readabale channel? Because RemoteBlockReader2 needed channel based inputstreams to deal with direct buffers. Also we can warn about this while falling back to old reader., Uma, that would be a good way to fix this.]
