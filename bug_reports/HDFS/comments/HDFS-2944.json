, > ... I decided to change the value to "false" to preserve the current behavior of having the feature disabled by default.

The feature was designed to be enabled by default.  Do you see any reason to disable it?, bq. The feature was designed to be enabled by default. Do you see any reason to disable it?

I know of no reason this should be disabled by default, but I'm also not familiar with the development history of the feature. Thus, I figured that should be done as a separate JIRA, given that it's an actual behavior change. Feel free to file the JIRA if you think that change should be made., Thanks, I created HDFS-2981., Reopen for committing it to 0.23., Merged to 0.23.
