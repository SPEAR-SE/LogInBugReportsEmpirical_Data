[I suggest to increase the "hard coded" TIMEOUT variable in TestBalancerWithNodeGroup from 20 seconds to 60 seconds. 

Since it needs to bring up mini HDFS cluster, write data to this mini HDFS cluster, bring up new datanode, and run balancer to balance datanodes. In an idle 4-core and 8GB memory server, this testBalancerWithNodeGroup() method will take about 17 seconds. It inclines to get timeout in a busy machine., {{TIMEOUT}} is for running the balancer. The test case itself has 60 second timeout, so {{TIMEOUT}} should be less 60 seconds. May be 2X of the normal run time (40?) is more reasonable. , Thanks for [~kihwal]'s suggestion, I have changed TIMEOUT to 40 seconds., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

, [~airbots], I found this test failing again in our nightly builds, Can you take a look into it again?

{noformat}, Working on it., Hi [~mdesai]
This 40 seconds is long enough for the balancer. It fixed the short timeout bug. There must be other bug during the test. I will close this one first and file a new bug after investigation., The new bug is filed as HDFS-6159, Thanks [~airbots]]
