This message is automatically generated., Thanks Jeff for reporting the bug and Vivek for working on it. 

OTOH, the patch is incorrect. Please use escapeHtml properly., Looks like the issue only Hadoop 1.x. We should simply backport HDFS-4162., Blocker for the next 1.x release., Somebody please share with me the process of contributing patches to 1.x branches.  Is there any wiki page available for the same?, I think the answer is probably no. Basically, you should switch branch from trunk to branch-1 and setup build env by following: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/BuildingHadoopFromSVN. When your env is ready to go, do changes and run ant test and paste your test results (not increasing new failures or warnings) in JIRA. The committer will review your patch based on your changes and result. I think this is current branch-1 process., Refer: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-hdfs-dev/201308.mbox/%3CCADdVdVHYSnXOxUB2t8kKnwATA8QYg6z4ycWJmcAWQahwEyupdw@mail.gmail.com%3E

Cancelling patch and moving JIRA status accordingly., Refer: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-hdfs-dev/201308.mbox/%3CCADdVdVHYSnXOxUB2t8kKnwATA8QYg6z4ycWJmcAWQahwEyupdw@mail.gmail.com%3E

Closing this issue as "Won't fix", [~vivganes]: You might not want to work on this, but this is still a blocker for 1.x. BTW, the mailing list thread is about HDFS-2933 and not relevant to this Jira., [~vicaya] Oops sorry to have closed the wrong issue. my bad :( I am willing to work on this issue. can I reassign this issue to myself?  Since that mail talked about branch-1,  got confused between this jira and hdfs-2933, which seems to have been closed already , [~vivganes]: no problem, feel free to assign it to yourself, if you want to work on it. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., [~vicaya] I have uploaded a patch for branch 1.2, by porting HDFS-4162.  But Jenkins tries to apply the patch to trunk.  Is there any way to make Jenkins understand that the patch is for branch 1.2 and not trunk?, Can someone please help me in validating the patch for branch-1.2 locally on my machine? I am looking for some wiki/doc which contains instructions on how to build branch-1.2 and how to test patches, along with prerequisites, if any., At this point, there is unlikely to be another 1.x release, given the last one will be a year ago tomorrow., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Closing this jira. As [~aw] pointed out, it is unlikely that there will be another 1.x release. This is no longer an issue after HDFS-6252 is merged in branch-2.]
