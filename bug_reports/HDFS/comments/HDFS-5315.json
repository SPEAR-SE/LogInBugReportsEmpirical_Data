[This jira is dupliucate of following....

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4759

As even after above defect fix return code will be "0", since we are not doing  "System.exit(1);" for following..

{code}
catch (IOException e) {
      String[] content = e.getLocalizedMessage().split("\n");
      System.err.println("snapshotDiff: " + content[0]);
    }
{code}
, yes,if we add the System.exit(1),then if we do echo $?,if failure means it will return 1
, I already worked on this ,and i has prepared patch for this ,with that patch it will work in required manner,
i am attaching that patch here.. please review it
Result after applying that patch
:/home/hadoop-2.1.0/bin # ./hdfs snapshotDiff / invalid no
snapshotDiff: Cannot find the snapshot of directory / with name invalid
home/hadoop-2.1.0/bin # echo $?
1
home/hadoop-2.1.0/bin # , Is there any reason to keep this as separate class itself? Why can't we keep this under dfsadmin commands itself?
There anyway ToolRunner result will be passed to System.exit.
What do you say?, yes,if we move this under dfsadmin command this issues are resolved,so for that i raised one jiira
