, This was committed to trunk Fri Sep 11 21:54:24 UTC 2009.  Resolving as fixed., Ran into this issue stress testing the append work on branch 20. This patch includes a test case that demonstrates the issue (test case depends on some of the test utils from other branch 20 append patches), This should be pulled into the branch-0.20-append branch., Merged the patch from 0.20-append to 0.20-security. It fixes concurrent modification exception. Test changes are not ported because it has dependency on other changes from 0.20-append., +1 for hdfs-606-20s.patch.]
