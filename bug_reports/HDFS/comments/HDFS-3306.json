This message is automatically generated., Agree with your logic, and the change looks good.  Testing?, To test this, I mounted a fuse_dfs filesystem, created a bunch of files, and then deleted them., Check the parallel case, eg multiple threads cat'ing the same set of files in parallel (will result in open/release on the same files)?, Per offline conversation Colin tested this multithreaded.

+1   I've committed this and merged to branch-2.
