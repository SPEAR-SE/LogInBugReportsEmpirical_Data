[[~andrew.wang], need advice.  The core requirement is we need to seamlessly support raw encrypted data transfer by arbitrary users.   (Webhdfs support is just bonus points)  Distcp already copies via reserved raw paths and then transfers over xattrs including the EZ/FE xattrs.  This only works for super users but could be extended to support non-super users.

On another Jira we both shared concerns about allowing a user to alter the FE info xattr but that's essentially required.  What about relaxing the restrictions for setting the FE info to: a) file must be in an EZ; b) file must not have an existing FE info., [~andrew.wang] obviously has more weight to comment.

The proposed relaxation of a+b for file owner to set feinfo SGTM.

Question: what if the owner typo'ed and set a wrong xattr, then wanted to remove? Do we relax it for {{removeXAttr}} and \{{getXAttrs}} as well (which sounds fine too for xattr in general, but less so for fe info...)?]
