[upload the ut to reproduce this issue, When appending a file, namenode does not update the disk consumption for the last block in the file. So, the cached disk consumption is less than the actual disk consumption.

I am going to format a patch later. I have a fixed in my local branch currently., upload the patch to fix this issue. 
The patch works for current trunk., Hi [~brandonli], would you mind to assign this jira to me ? 
I am happy to follow up the fix of this.
And could you review my patch? It is quite simple. Looking forward to your help.

Thanks a lot., Hi [~GWong], thanks for working on this. This is actually a bug from HDFS-6423. Your patch looks good to me. The only comment is that maybe we can move all the new unit tests into TestDiskspaceQuotaUpdate.java, where we should also change the number of DN and the replication factor to some number greater than 1., Thanks Jing for your reply. 

OK. I will add more UT to address your comment. , change the patch to address Jing's comments., [~jingzhao], when I am working on this issue, I find another issue about Quota update. Here is the filed jira
