[Move the discussion from HDFS-4061 here:

When the NameNode invalides a block for a datanode D1 and remove the datanode-block pair from the blockMap, and before the invalidation request is sent to the datanode D1, the BlockManager#computeDataNodeWork also starts to work and schedule the replication to D1. So the invalidation and replication request will be sent to D1 at the same time. D1 will then ignore the replication request (also throws a ReplicaAlreadyExistsException), and delete the replica. Thus NN cannot receive the blockreceived msg from D1. And the testcast will timeout in 5min which is smaller than the timeout of PendingReplication request (usually 5~10 min)., And I guess that's also the reason for HDFS-342? Since the initial replication request is ignored, the replication on D1 can only be done after the pending replication timeout., Initial patch to fix., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., testcase failure reported in HDFS-3948 before. Will run TestUnderReplicatedBlocks in loop later.  , Run the testcase ~800 times and all of them passed., +1 for the patch., I committed the patch.
