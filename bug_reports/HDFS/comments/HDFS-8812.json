[I reproduced the error with AWS m3.xlarge instance but I couldn't with my MacBook Air.
{code}
      try {
        byte[] buf = new byte[1024 * 1024];
        peer.getOutputStream().write(buf);
        Assert.fail("write should timeout");
      } catch (SocketTimeoutException ste) {
{code}
It seems to me that {{peer.getOutputStream().write(buf)}} completed before reaching the configured timeout (1 sec). I'm thinking smaller timeout and/or bigger byte buffer will fix the problem., 001 patch
* Write 10MB byte buffer
* Use Time.monotonicNow() instead of Time.now() to ignore system clock changes.
I confirmed the test passed with the patch in the both environment (m3.xlarge and MBA)., [~ajisakaa], this looks like a dup of HDFS-8785. , Dupe of HDFS-8785..?, Thanks [~xyao] and [~brahmareddy] for the comment. I'll close this issue., \\
