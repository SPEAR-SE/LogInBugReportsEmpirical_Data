[This patch should also update TestAppendDifferentChecksums to remove the disabling of the block scanner which was introduced in HDFS-2130 (see the comment in the test for details)., This problem is highly reproducible. In my tests, I hit this issue every time with less than 10000 append requests, 100 bytes each time.

In the DataScanner thread, the BlockSender got a block path under rbw. BlockReceiver serving write request removed the rbw block from rbw directory to finalized directory. The BlockSender tried to open the file before the BlockReceiver updated the VolumeMap, thus the FileNotFoundException was thrown.

Here BlockPoolSliceScanner can ignore this exception since a real missing block problem should be caught by DirectoryScanner., Changes in the patch:
1. handle FileNotFoundException in BlockPoolSliceScanner.verifyBlock() to avoid the possible deadloop in completeFile().
2. fix the class description for BlockPoolSliceScanner
3. enable DataScanner in TestAppendDifferntChecksum, Is this an issue in trunk as well? If yes please provide a trunk patch., The new patch is for trunk., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
