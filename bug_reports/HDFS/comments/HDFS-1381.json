[Update: though these configs no longer show up in {{MiniDFSCluster}}, they're still in a few places they shouldn't be., literally replaced the mentioned the name.dir and data.dir javadoc mentions with their fully qualified ConfigKey names DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_NAME_DIR_KEY and    DFSConfigKeys.DFS_DATANODE_DATA_DIR_KEY, Updated the JavaDocs to represent the keys mentioned in the bug report., Hey Jim, patch looks great. Thanks a lot for doing this.

Only thing is that I'd recommend using the {{@link}} annotation with the '#' symbol to separate members so that when Javadocs are generated they'll include hyperlinks to the right place. This will also let Eclipse and other IDEs refactor the comments correctly if we ever change the names of these variables.

For example, instead of this:

{code}
DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_NAME_DIR_KEY
{code}

do this:

{code}
{@link DFSConfigKeys#DFS_NAMENODE_NAME_DIR_KEY}
{code}
