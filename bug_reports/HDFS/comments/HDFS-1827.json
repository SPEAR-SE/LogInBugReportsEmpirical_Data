[Replaced the infinite waits with a 20-second timeout. Throw TimeoutException WITH useful information as to current state. Now if it errs in the future, at least we'll be able to see why.

Also found what appears to be an argument reversal in the assert in line 180.  My best reading of the meaning of the args, the surrounding comments, and the intent of the caller, says that it should be changed.  If I'm correct, this would explain the failure.

Finally, added more comments for clarity, and replaced a spurious Boolean with boolean.

Posted here for information, but I'm going to subordinate this bug to HDFS-1295 (which it was blocking) and submit a single patch to that Jira.
, As part of HDFS-1295, this patch caused TestBlockReplacement to pass in build PreCommit-HDFS-Build/346, whereas it had failed before., Cleaned up a couple comments.  Please review., +1, nice test improvements., Thanks, Todd.
Uploading again to try to trigger Hudson QA.

BTW, this fix will be submitted as a stand-alone patch, not as part of HDFS-1295 as previously stated., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The failed test, org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.TestFiDataTransferProtocol2.pipeline_Fi_17, appears unrelated to the changes in TestBlockReplacement, and also appears to have failed on both the "before-patch" and "after-patch" diff.  Ignoring.
