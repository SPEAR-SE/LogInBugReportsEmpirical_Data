[I have just added a check in BlockManager#removeStoredBlock to add to pendingDNMessages if the namenode is standby.

There is one test case failing TestDNFencing#testDnFencing by the change.
The test case was checking for postponedMisreplicatedBlocksCount after the failover.
Since the change adds the deleted block to the pending messages queue and during the trnasition to active, it dequeues the deleted block request.
So the postponedMisreplicatedBlocksCount will be zero after the failOver., \\

This message was automatically generated., Can you retest or justify unit test failures? The change looks good. The findbugs warning seems unrelated., Attached a new patch fixing checkstyle and whitespace warnings.
All the test failures seems unrelated to my patch.
Ran them all on my local box and all of them pass., Thanks [~kihwal] for the review.
All the tests pass on my local box and they fail due to timeouts.
Please review the new patch.
It fixes the checkstyle and whitespace warnings otherwise the patch is the same as before., \\

This message was automatically generated., TestTraceAdmin is being fixed in HDFS-8358.
The check style warning is about one indentation error. Rather than resubmitting a patch and wasting the build resource, we will fix it during commit., +1 the patch looks good., Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7.
