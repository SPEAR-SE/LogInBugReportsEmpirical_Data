[Following is my analysis:

# ErasureCodingWorker is creating the {{RemoteBlockReader2}} with null {{tracer}}, during the {{RemoteBlockReader2#read}} function call, it is hitting NPE and resulting in the failure. To fix this, how about passing the {{datanode#getTracer()}} to the reader ?
{code}
ErasureCodingWorker .java

        return RemoteBlockReader2.newBlockReader(
            "dummy", block, blockToken, offsetInBlock, 
            block.getNumBytes() - offsetInBlock, true,
            "", newConnectedPeer(block, dnAddr, blockToken, dnInfo), dnInfo,
            null, cachingStrategy, null);
{code}
{code}
RemoteBlockReader2.java

  public synchronized int read(ByteBuffer buf) throws IOException {
    if (curDataSlice == null || curDataSlice.remaining() == 0 && bytesNeededToFinish > 0) {
      TraceScope scope = tracer.newScope(
          "RemoteBlockReader2#readNextPacket(" + blockId + ")");
      try {
        readNextPacket();
      } finally {
        scope.close();
      }
    }
{code}
# The root cause is not visible in the log messages as StripedBlockUtil#getNextCompletedStripedRead() is logging the exception with {{DEBUG}} level, IMHO the log level has to be changed to {{INFO}}  to know the failure reason.
{code}
if (DFSClient.LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
        DFSClient.LOG.debug("ExecutionException " + e);
      }
{code}

I'll soon prepare a patch including these changes., Thank you Rakesh for reporting it. Changes looked good to me. Lets wait for jenkins to see this test failure fixed., \\

This message was automatically generated., Note: It seems test case failures are not related to the patch. Also, release audit and checkstyle warning are unrelated., Thanks for working on this, [~rakeshr]. The changes looks good to me. One comment is about the log level change. Changing the log level from debug to warn may generate unnecessary exception trace for DFSStripedInputStream since the failure can be covered by later decoding. So how about we change the log level for the unit test? We can need to add the following code to {{TestRecoverStripedBlocks}}:
{code}
static {
  GenericTestUtils.setLogLevel(DFSClient.LOG, Level.ALL);
}
{code}, Thank you [~umamaheswararao], [~jingzhao] for the review comments.

Attached another patch addressing the above comment. Kindly review it again., \\

This message was automatically generated., Note: It looks like test case failures are not related to the patch. [TestRecoverStripedFile|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/12769/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfs/TestRecoverStripedFile/] case is consistently passing now., The new patch looks good to me. All the failed tests passed in my local machine. 

+1. I will commit it shortly., I've committed this to trunk. Thanks for the contribution [~rakeshr]! Thanks for the review [~umamaheswararao]!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8555 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8555/])
