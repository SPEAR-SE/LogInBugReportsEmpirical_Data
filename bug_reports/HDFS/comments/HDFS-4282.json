[Seems likely this was caused by HADOOP-9103., The issue seems to be that FSImageSerialization.readString() calls {{UTF8.toString()}} which, due to coming from java.lang.Object, can't throw IOException. Hence, the IOException for invalid UTF8 gets re-thrown as RuntimeException there, which ends up causing the test case to fail.

Our options seem to be:
1. restore prior behavior of just generating a bogus string if presented with non-UTF8 bytes
or 2. add a new method like toStringThrowingIOE() which would throw an IOException for invalid UTF8

Personally I favor option 2. Thoughts?, I agree - option 2 seems to me like it will result in clearer code., Yes. Option 2 seems to be a better way., Here's a patch which implements a toStringChecked() method. I also had to add bounds checking for multi-byte UTF8 sequences. Please double check my index math while reviewing -- only halfway through my cup of coffee and seems like an easy place for a bug to slip in., There's another option which you may not have considered-- teaching {{testFuzzSequences}} to recognize and ignore the {{RuntimeExceptions}} that come from UTF8, probably by peeking at the exception string.  I'm not sure whether that would be better or not.  I think this approach is probably better-- conceptually, decoding exceptions should be {{IOException}}.

In any case, the patch looks good to me.  I'm glad that we can now properly handle truncated cat faces., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
