[See defect https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6515 which was opened for 2.4.0 version., Looking at non-test HDFS code, there are several places where 4096 appears and is related to x86_64 architecture, and should be changed:

hadoop-hdfs/target/classes/hdfs-default.xml
<property>
  <name>dfs.stream-buffer-size</name>
  <value>4096</value>
  <description>The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations.</description>
</property>

hadoop-hdfs/src/main/resources/hdfs-default.xml
<property>
  <name>dfs.stream-buffer-size</name>
  <value>4096</value>
....

hadoop-hdfs-httpfs/target/classes/httpfs-default.xml
  <property>
    <name>httpfs.buffer.size</name>
    <value>4096</value>
    <description>
      The buffer size used by a read/write request when streaming data from/to HDFS.
    </description>
  </property>

hadoop-hdfs-httpfs/src/main/resources/httpfs-default.xml
  <property>
    <name>httpfs.buffer.size</name>
    <value>4096</value>
    <description>
      The buffer size used by a read/write request when streaming data from/to HDFS.

      int bufferSize = fs.getConf().getInt("httpfs.buffer.size", 4096);
