[Hey Roman, is this not a duplicate of HDFS-2325?, @atm

It sort of is. you need to solve the build.xml issue first and then you bump into the .h being out of date issue. Given that HDFS-2325 is already marked as a blocker for 205 -- I'm going to close this one and provide additional info over there. Thanks for pointing the dup out!, Dup of HDFS-2325]
