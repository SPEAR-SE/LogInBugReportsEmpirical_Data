[It seems that TestStartup is talking to the running hdfs through servlets.  It may fail in different ways.  I guess the failure depends on the status of the hdfs., This is still the case in trunk, and can also cause spurious test failures when a build machine is shared., Trivial patch fixes the issue, +1 overall.

    , Hi Nicholas. I think this should be committed to branch-0.21 and branch-0.20 as well. The trunk patch applies correctly on 0.21. Attaching a patch for 0.20 which is only trivially different (and tested on a machine that previously exhibited this issue), > Hi Nicholas. I think this should be committed to branch-0.21 and branch-0.20 as well. ...
Sure.

Reopen for committing it to 0.20 and 0.21., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #170 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/170/])
    Move  from trunk to 0.20 in CHANGES.txt.
