[Thanks for the report tangshangwen! I see the code has changed a little bit https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blame/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/FSDirAttrOp.java in trunk. Are you able to load the namespace on a single node hadoop cluster to see if this happens on trunk? Are you able to debug why this is happening?]
