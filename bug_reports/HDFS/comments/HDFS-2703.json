[Patch attached. Verified that when the 2NN triggers a roll and a storage directory fails a  warning now shows up in the log and the Web UI lists this storage directory as failed., This applies atop HDFS-2701., Looks good, but see the comment about a test plan in my comment on HDFS-2701, +1, Tests and test-patch are clean. I've committed this.

Thanks for the review Todd!]
