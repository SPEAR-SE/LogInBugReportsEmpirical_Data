[Turns out this test wasn't really disabled, TestFileCreationNameodeRestart.java was weirdly calling our "disabled" test on the side. Thus I assume that the functionality is still good, since it's been running for a while.

I deleted this side call and re-enabled the test so it'll run in a more normal fashion., +1 pending jenkins, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs:

This message is automatically generated., This test failure could be related to HDFS-3658, the logs look like the same problem even though the assert failure is a bit different.

Anyway, I ran this test locally and it worked. I believe unrelated., Rebase on trunk, patch was stale., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I agree the failure seems unrelated. I ran locally as well, will commit when jenkins comes back., Test failure is HDFS-3664. Findbugs is HDFS-3850., I've committed this and merged to branch-2.
