[I think the patch for HDFS-2882 also fix HDFS-4455.  The IOException is caught and an infinite loop to retry connectToNNAndHandshake().
it makes sure DataNode will retry if it can connect to one of the NameNode, also make sure it won't continue startup when it shouldn't.

  public void run() {
   LOG.info(this + " starting to offer service");

   try {
     while (true) {
       // init stuff
       try {
         // setup storage
         connectToNNAndHandshake();
         break;
       } catch (IOException ioe) {
         // Initial handshake, storage recovery or registration failed
         runningState = RunningState.INIT_FAILED;
         if (shouldRetryInit()) {
           // Retry until all namenode's of BPOS failed initialization
           LOG.error("Initialization failed for " + this + " "
               + ioe.getLocalizedMessage());
           sleepAndLogInterrupts(5000, "initializing");
         } else {
           runningState = RunningState.FAILED;
           LOG.fatal("Initialization failed for " + this + ". Exiting. ", ioe);
           return;
         }
       }
     }
do anyone see any scenario that not covered by this fix?, Looked at HDFS-2882. I agree that should fix this issue.]
