[The patch sets the sslEnabledProtocols to TLSv1,TLSv1.1. I would have also added TLSv1.2, but Java 6 doesn't support it (we can add it when we drop Java 6 support).

This message is automatically generated., I was accidentally testing with Java 7 instead of 6.  It turns out that the documentation was wrong and Java 6 only supports TLSv1, not TLSv1.1 (a different documentation page I just found supports this)., New patch only sets "TLSv1", {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
