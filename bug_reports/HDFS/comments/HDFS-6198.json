[This patch uses the platform-specific file path separator.  I've verified that {{TestDataNodeRollingUpgrade}} passes on both Mac and Windows after this patch., Is {{Pattern.quote(File.separator)}} going to be {{\}} in Windows? If so then the regex should be invalid. Am I correct?, Hi Chris, I think we should also fix {{TestBlockPoolSliceStorage}} in the same Jira.

It was intended as a targeted unit test for the regex operations and also uses "/" as the hard-coded separator. I should have known better..., If we were just doing {{File.separator + "BPstuff" + File.separator}}, then the regex would be invalid.  We'd get an exception while trying to parse the regex.  Wrapping it with {{Pattern.quote}} is what makes it safe.  This injects {{\Q}} and {{\E}} for literal character quoting.  On Linux/Mac, the final pattern is:

{code}
^(.*)(\Q/\EBP-\d+-\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}-\d+\Q/\E)(current)(.*)$
{code}

On Windows, the final pattern is:

{code}
^(.*)(\Q\\EBP-\d+-\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}-\d+\Q\\E)(current)(.*)$
{code}

Thanks for the tip on {{TestBlockPoolSliceStorage}}.  I'll take a look at that one and provide a new patch., Here is patch v2 with the additional test fix mentioned by Arpit., +1 for the updated patch, pending Jenkins.
