[uprating as triggering jenkins failures, Thanks [~stevel@apache.org] for looking at this issue. 
, Current patch Updated in HDFS-9067 seems to fix all jmx related issues. Locally i verified the same. 
Ill resolve this issue., HDFS-9067, did not fix all failures. But it has exposed a Util method in {{DFSTestUtil#waitForMetric()}} to wait for the metric update.

This can be used to fix this failure., Thanks [~vinayrpet]
Updated the patch , after the fix of HDFS-9067.
Please review., Fixed as part of HDFS-9073. Hence resolving this issue.]
