[Attaching a test log from a precommit build.

The test calls {{append()}} and makes an assumption on when the block state changes on datanodes. In the failed test, {{getFileChecksum()}} reached a datanode right after {{append()}}. This made {{BLOCK_CHECKSUM}} op on the datanode to fail with an {{EOFException}} while trying to read the meta file. If the {{BLOCK_CHECKSUM}} op reached the datanode a tiny bit later, it would have failed with the expected exception.
