When i use 'testuser' account, I try to 'hadoop fs mkdir /user/data' command.

I think 'hadoop fs mkdir /user/data' command not working.

Probably the old user-to-group mapping had been cached, so the command failed. You can execute "hdfs dfsadmin -refreshUserToGroupsMappings" to clean up the cache.
If you have a question, please send an e-mail to user@hadoop.apache.org., 
Permission Owner Group Size Name
drwxr-wr-x hdfs supergroup 0 /user

As seen above, there is permission to be granted but I don't understand how an user in supergroup can make a directory.
because permission is r-x. that 'testuser' account should not be able to make a directory. isnt' it?, Oh, I misunderstood the description.
A user in supergroup is a super-user, so permission checks never fail.
See http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsPermissionsGuide.html#The_Super-User for the detail.]
