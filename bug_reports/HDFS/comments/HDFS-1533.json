{code}, It looks good except that
1. Move class CorruptFileBlocks to package hdfs.protocol;
2. When handling listCorruptFileBlocks in safemode, the exception thrown condition should be the replication queue not populated yet., Oh, I just realized that the patch that populating the replication queue earlier has not been committed yet., Moved CorruptFileBlocks and TestCorruptFileBlocks to HDFS.

Verified that ant test/ant test-patch results did not change., +1. This looks good to me., Shall we commit this because trunk is broken after HADOOP-7060 was committed, I've committed this. Thanks, Patrick!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #643 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/643/])
