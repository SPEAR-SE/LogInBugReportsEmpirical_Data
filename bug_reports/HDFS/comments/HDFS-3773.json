[Trivial patch attached. The trouble is that FSEditLog needs to be able to instantiate the QuorumJournalManager by reflection, but those two classes are in different packages., We had to make this change locally to get tests working again after applying HDFS-3741. , +1, sorry about that. I had it fixed in one of my later patches which wasn't yet posted., Thanks a lot for the quick reviews, Todd and Andrew. I've just committed this to the HDFS-3077 branch.]
