[Hello Nitika,

Please direct your question to mapreduce-user@hadoop.apache.org mailing lists. The JIRA is meant to be only for project discussion and development, not a user support channel.

I'm sure a lot of folks (including me) would be happy to answer your question on the mailing list instead. Also helps if you post logs and error stacktraces you've received instead of just code.
