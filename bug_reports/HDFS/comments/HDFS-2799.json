This message is automatically generated., I think a simple fix of porting the Config.getâ€¦ method to the right one would be much better. Testing it too should be simple enough (run with a config and see what dir it created?), Hi Harsh,

I have given a patch as u expected.
I have moved the getCheckPointDirs to DFSUtil so this can be used by others in case required :)

With this movement it is much easy to write a new test also :), @Eli can u review the patch once, - Both getCheckpointEditsDirs and getCheckpointDirs need to be fixed (these are the last two uses of getStringCollection in hdfs)
- Agree w Harsh that it should use getTrimmedStringCollection directly to be consistent with the rest of the code
- Good test for this would be to have a test that adds space or new line to each config value that has a csv list of directories and tries to start a mini cluster (for an example of setting new values for directories checkout TestNameEditsConfigs), I agree with both of u,

I will provide a patch as expected soon :), Hi Harsh/Eli

This message is automatically generated., +1 looks good. Two small nits: the first line of the test javadoc was indented incorrectly and the test name had a spelling mistake ("trimm"), I'll fix those and commit., I've committed this and merged to branch-2.
