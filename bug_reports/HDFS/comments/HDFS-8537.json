[The command line "hdfs debug" shows the correct usage info:

{code}
HW11217:hadoop xyao$ hdfs debug
Usage: hdfs debug <command> [arguments]

verify [-meta <metadata-file>] [-block <block-file>]
recoverLease [-path <path>] [-retries <num-retries>]
{code}, This seems to be already fixed by HDFS-8566.]
