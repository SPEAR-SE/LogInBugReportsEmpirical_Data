[This concern is easy to capture with the query language used by [lgtm|https://lgtm.com]. I've just written a query for it, which you can see [here|https://lgtm.com/query/1995330256/project:5629499534213120/lang:java/] -- it finds 32 results in the [GitHub mirror of Hadoop|https://github.com/apache/hadoop], including a number within HDFS itself.

(Disclaimer: I'm a co-founder of Semmle, the company that provides lgtm as a free service to open source.), That's great [~pavgustinov]! very nice tool and thank you so much!
