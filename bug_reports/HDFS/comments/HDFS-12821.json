[A dup of HDFS-12528 ?, yes, should be the same issue. , Think so too.

In HDFS-12528, the file was appended, thus the last block generate stamp was changed. Since the block meta file name contains the gen stamp, the meta file could not be found any more:
{noformat}
Meta file for BP-810388474-172.31.113.69-1499543341726:blk_1074012183_273087 not found
{noformat}

How was the block invalidated in this case?
, When we receive the block invalid exception, this means it's moved to some other datanode. We should not disable the SCR. We are suffering the performance downgrade while doing balance on HBase cluster.

So, we need just simply skip the exception of block being invalid. Did UT about this case]
