    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs:

                  org.apache.hadoop.ha.TestZKFailoverController
                  org.apache.hadoop.io.file.tfile.TestTFileByteArrays
                  org.apache.hadoop.io.file.tfile.TestTFileJClassComparatorByteArrays
                  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestReplaceDatanodeOnFailure

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

Test results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2707//testReport/
Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2707//console

This message is automatically generated., The javadoc/test failures seem unrelated, is there a jira for those?  +1 otherwise, The javadoc warnings are MAPREDUCE-4373.
I filed a JIRA for the TFile tests. I've seen TestReplaceDatanodeOnfailure be flaky since it was introduced. I'll try to look into TestZKFailoverController as well, since I thought we'd figured out all the issues there.

I'll commit this momentarily., committed to branch-2 and trunk., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2467 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2467/])
