This message is automatically generated., * rebase on trunk, Hi Rahul,
This patch looks good to me overall.  I created a rebased version of it that incorporates changes from trunk.

I wish we could have a unit test for this.  It's a little difficult to create a good one without getting kind of uncomfortably coupled to the HDFS code (after all this is in tools).  We would probably have to create an API to corrupt file checksums in HDFS, and use that.  Then we could be sure that distcp -skipcrccheck was not consulting the CRC.  I'm not sure if this is worth the extra work, though... thoughts?, How about just corrupting the block files manually itself ala TestFSInputChecker?

Also, let's manually test that we can distcp from a v1 cluster to a v2 cluster with this patch (using skipcrc since HADOOP-8060 is not yet ready)., bq. How about just corrupting the block files manually itself ala TestFSInputChecker?

Probably best to add a @VisibleForTesting method in MiniDFSCluster that corrupts the block.  MiniDFSCluster is part of HDFS, this isn't.
, Hi Colin,

Thanks for taking this forward. I am ok with your comments on the unit testing idea; this was a case of missing functionality rather than a bug, skipping CRC check by itself is a low value feature; just that it is needed when working with different variants of hadoop or other filesystems., Looks like the entirety of TestDistCp is @ignored right now.  Let's fix that in a separate JIRA., I confirmed through manual testing that -skipcrccheck does indeed cause the crc checking paths to be bypassed.

However, I found this in this code, in {{DistCpUtils#checksumsAreEquals}}:
{code}
    try {
      sourceChecksum = sourceFS.getFileChecksum(source);
      targetChecksum = targetFS.getFileChecksum(target);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      LOG.error("Unable to retrieve checksum for " + source + " or " + target, e);
    }
{code} 

I think this should be a fatal error for the distcp operation unless {{-skipcrccheck}} is set.  Silently ignoring checksums if we can't find them doesn't seem like a good behavior.  Perhaps we should open a different JIRA for that, though..., testing done:

I confirmed that copying files from a cluster running branch-1 derived code to a cluster running branch-2 derived code did *not* work unless {{-skipcrccheck}} was supplied.

The exception was this:

With {{-skipcrccheck}}, this problem did not occur., style nits:
- missing space after ',' in RetriableFileCopyCommand's constructor definition, and its usage
- please reorder the '@param' in the javadoc to match the order of arguments
