[The test failure can be reproduced locally on Linux and Mac., The exception message changed with us swapping out the broken regex handler.  So this is an extremely simple patch.  (I'm not going to ask why HDFS is running effectively the same tests as common ... ), Meh, actually, it looks like we just need to swap out the exception thrown.  I'm guessing they don't match or something., I've reverted the patch that caused this issue, so closing this one.]
