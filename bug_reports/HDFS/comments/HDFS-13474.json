[Thanks for reporting,Could you try with Java8..? Could have this query in mailing list, Jira is to track the issues., Hi Brahma Reddy, thank you for getting back to me so quickly on this. Apologies if I've incorrectly raised the issue here - I am not familiar with the procedure for raising issues - can you please provide a link to the mail list for next time ? 

I have installed Java8 and re-run the commands but I get the same response and error code returned. Can you please advise ? ]
