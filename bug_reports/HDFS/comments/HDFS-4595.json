[Patch makes the following changes:
# Adds a test for testing the fallback mechanism.
# Found a bug where datanode proxy was not created with in the ugi.doAs() block.
# Added info level log to indicate the short circuit is disabled.
# Printing short exception stack trace for AccessControlException when short circuit is disabled., Updated patch that also checks that short circuit fails in the newly added test and is indeed disabled as expected in the DFSClient., This bug was fixed in HDFS-347.  However, since we have decided to keep the legacy block reader code available, this fix has some value still.

{code}
   void disableShortCircuit() {
+    LOG.info("Short circuit is disalbed");
     shortCircuitLocalReads = false;
   }
{code}

Spelling.

{code}
-        DFSClient.LOG.warn("Short circuit access failed ", ex);
+        DFSClient.LOG.warn("Short circuit access failed " + ex);
{code}

This message is automatically generated., bq. Hmm. Why not print the full exception trace?
While testing the feature, I found exception added no value other than clutter the logs. This log is printed when AccessControlException is caught and it is being handled to fall back to regular read. Why do you think stack trace at the client would help?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Attached file fixes the typo, addresses -1s from  Jenkins build., bq. Why do you think stack trace at the client would help?
Stack traces for this from the client actually hurts us in HBase, in that, it puts a lot of noise when we are hunting down some other exception.
