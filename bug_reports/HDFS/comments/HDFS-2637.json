{noformat}, +1, This may be applicable for trunk as well right?
I think this issue is same as HDFS-2378. Can it be duplicated?, doh, yea, this is dup of HDFS-2378. Somehow when Eli and I were discussing it this morning I forgot that I'd already filed a JIRA for it. Since we already have the patch here, we can just commit this one and mark the other as dup, I guess?

In trunk the block recovery algorithm is quite different so I don't think it applies -- the block recovery is triggered as part of the pipeline setup, rather than an RPC. But maybe we have a similar type of bug in trunk with timeouts in the pipeline setup process? Mind taking a look, Uma?, Ok Todd, i will take a look on trunk code once and update if it really applies.
Why i pointed for trunk is because HDFS-2378 filed against to 0.23.0 and 1.1.0., Thanks Todd. I've committed this., make FixedVersion consistent with commits., Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.1.0.]
