[If we do this, it must be back-compatible.  In the first release after the change it should still accept the old names but print warnings.  The suggested way to do this is to add static accessor methods for each such parameter and replace all accesses to the parameters with calls to the accessor methods.  Then back-compatibility can be handled centrally in the accessor methods.  Perhaps all of the accessor methods can even share a back-compatiblity mechanism., Its all dfs.* and its in Hadoop, and the settings go to hdfs-site.xml. I think that is sufficient?

Don't think its worth the change. Feel free to reopen if you feel otherwise strongly.]
