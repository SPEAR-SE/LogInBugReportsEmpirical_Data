[Thanks for the fix, Haohui. The patch looks good to me. Some comments:
# Looks like {{GetBlockLocationsResult#iip}} can now be replaced by a boolean indicating whether to update access time.
# If the given {{srcArg}} is a reserved path (suppose it is mapped to /foo/bar),  and if between the read and write lock the original /foo/bar is deleted and another file is named as /foo/bar, then the following code will update the access time of the wrong file.
{code}
+        // Resolve the path again and update the atime only when the file
+        // exists
+        final INodesInPath iip = dir.getINodesInPath(src, true);
{code}
# Maybe we can also add an extra test {{testGetBlockLocationsRacingWithRename}} to catch the above case?, \\

This message was automatically generated., The 001 patch looks good to me. But among the failed tests, TestEncryptionZones, TestEncryptionZonesWithKMS, TestFsck, and TestReservedRawPaths may be related. The failures can be reproduced in my local machine and they all passed without the patch., \\
