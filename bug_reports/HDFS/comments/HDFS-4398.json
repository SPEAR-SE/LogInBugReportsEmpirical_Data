[WebHDFS REST API is meant to be for multiple FileSystem impls, AFAIK file ID is HDFS specific. If we want to expose filesystem specific information, we should consider adding an extension point in the required places., This JIRA is not to change WebHDFS REST API. It's to change WebHDFS internal implementation to support file ID., This is no longer needed. Path will be used for carrying inode information as proposed in HDFS-4489. So no protocol change or WebHDFS changes required. I am also going make this a task so that it does not clutter the subtask list of HDFS-4489.]
