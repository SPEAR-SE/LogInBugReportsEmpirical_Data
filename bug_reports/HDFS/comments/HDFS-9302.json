[[~Karthik Palaniappan],  thanks for reporting this, it's better to return a better exception and error msg to user if there is no {{newLength}}.
This can be done by checking whether newLength is null string (NewLengthParam#DEFAULT) in {{NamenodeWebHdfsMethods}}, feel free to upload a patch to fix it.

In the document, the newLength is already a required parameter, for any optional parameter, there is [], Hi , i would like to work on this issue, [~Karthik Palaniappan] if you have already started, please assign it to you, Attached the patch [~hitliuyi] ,please review , \\
