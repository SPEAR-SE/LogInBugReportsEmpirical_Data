[I failed to see the chance of Error(like ClassNotFoundError) in the following code. Could you please point me to the same. Thanks!

try {
final Path tmp = new Path(job.get(TMP_DIR_LABEL), relativedst);
if (destFileSys.delete(tmp, true))
break;
} catch (Throwable ex) {
// ignore, we are just cleaning up
LOG.debug("Ignoring cleanup exception", ex);
}]
