This message is automatically generated., This had been reported in HDFS-6052.  I decided to close HDFS-6052, because there is more activity here on this one., Thanks for looking at this, Akira.

Since {{runBlockReaderLocalTest}} is the test function that requires the native library, why not put the check there?

I would rather keep as much test coverage as possible even without libhadoop.so., Thanks for the review, [~cmccabe].
Attaching a patch that reflects your comment., +1.  Thanks, Akira., committed, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5274 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5274/])
