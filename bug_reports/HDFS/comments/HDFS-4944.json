[I've attached patches for both branch-1 and trunk.  The branch-1 patch fixes the bug by switching to a different {{java.net.URI}} constructor that takes care of the URI encoding for us.  I've also added a unit test for creating a file that contains spaces.

The trunk patch just adds the unit test.  Trunk doesn't have the bug, but I'd like to keep the unit test there as a safeguard against regressions.
