This message is automatically generated., The test failure is unrelated.  The Findbugs warning is also unrelated.  I just committed a fix for that in HDFS-7107., Hi, [~cnauroth] Thank you so much for looking into this and providing the fix! It looks great to me. , Hi, [~cnauroth] 

Just one more small suggestion, could your patch catch {{IOException}} for {{sd.unlock()}} and continues to unlock the following SDs? So that It will leave less storage directories locked in the end. , [~eddyxu], thank you for reviewing.  Here is patch v3 to catch and log the {{IOException}} on failure to unlock an individual storage directory.  It's a good suggestion., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., I think something went wrong with the javac warnings check in the last pre-commit run.  I checked locally, and I didn't find any difference between current trunk javac warnings and warnings after the patch.

The test failures are unrelated., Good catch, Chris.  +1.

I looked at https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/8138//artifact/patchprocess/diffJavacWarnings.txt and I didn't see anything related to your patch, so I think the javac warning message was spurious., Thank you both for the reviews and the commit., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #689 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/689/])
