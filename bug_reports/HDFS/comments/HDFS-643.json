[I think the correct behavior here would be:
- If /3 is a directory, move /1 and /2 into /3
- If /3 is not a directory, throw an error., Tried the following:
{noformat}
-bash-3.1$ hadoop fs -lsr foo
drwx------   - tsz users          0 2009-09-22 23:18 /user/tsz/foo/1
drwx------   - tsz users          0 2009-09-22 23:18 /user/tsz/foo/2
drwx------   - tsz users          0 2009-09-22 23:18 /user/tsz/foo/3
-bash-3.1$ hadoop dfs -mv foo/1 foo/2 foo/3
-bash-3.1$ hadoop fs -lsr foo
drwx------   - tsz users          0 2009-09-22 23:19 /user/tsz/foo/3
drwx------   - tsz users          0 2009-09-22 23:18 /user/tsz/foo/3/1
drwx------   - tsz users          0 2009-09-22 23:18 /user/tsz/foo/3/2
{noformat}

Could you check again?, Hm... i just tried to verify the behavior, and I got the same result as Nicholas. Perhaps I misinterpreted the initial problem., That's great, Bryan!  Let's close this.  Feel free to reopen if you see the problem again.]
