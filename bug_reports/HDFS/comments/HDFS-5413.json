[Attaching patch to fix hdfs.cmd.

BTW, I also reviewed hadoop.cmd for the same bug, but that one is fine., It seems haadmin is missing from 'hdfscommands'., Thanks for another good catch.  I was trying to build the list of hdfscommand from looking at the usage text.  Unfortunately, the usage text was out of date, so this led me astray.

Here is an updated patch that updates the usage text, adds haadmin, and also adds journalnode.  This one was completely missing from hdfs.cmd., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The patch contains only script changes, so there are no new tests.  I tested manually in a cluster running on Windows by running all hdfs.cmd sub-commands and one direct class to cover the passthrough case.
