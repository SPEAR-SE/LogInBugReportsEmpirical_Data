, TestUnderReplicatedBlocks starts failing.  Not sure if it is related to this.  See https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/3371//testReport/, Nicholas, I checked the test output and guess maybe the test failure is caused by this:

When the NameNode invalides a block for a datanode D1 and remove the datanode-block pair from the blockMap, and before the invalidation request is sent to the datanode D1, the BlockManager#computeDataNodeWork also starts to work and schedule the replication to D1. So the invalidation and replication request will be sent to D1 at the same time. D1 will then ignore the replication request (also throws a ReplicaAlreadyExistsException), and delete the replica. Thus NN cannot receive the blockreceived msg from D1. And the testcast will timeout in 5min which is smaller than the timeout of PendingReplication request (usually 5~10 min).

I can file another jira to fix the testcase if you think it is correct., Thanks for digging it up.  I think you are correct.  The timeout set here was too short so that TestUnderReplicatedBlocks started failing after the patch had been committed.  It would be great if you could post a patch to fix it., How about lowering the heartbeat intervals instead so we don't need to wait 10 mins?, HDFS-4067 can fix the TestUnderReplicatedBlocks failure so we do not need to change the timeout of PendingReplication request.]
