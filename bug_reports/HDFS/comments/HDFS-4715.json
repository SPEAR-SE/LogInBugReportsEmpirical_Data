[The patch (HDFS-4549.2.patch) looks different from the current trunk code.  For backporting, we would try to backport the code exactly so that it is easier to maintain the code.  Could you make the backport patch the same as the original patches?  Some other comments:

- The import org.apache.log4j.helpers.BoundedFIFO is not used.

- the parameter in update(..) should be the read length but not the read value.
{code}
+    return update(getInputStream().read())
{code}

- the filelength in udpate(..) may be null, Addressed your points, and got things as close to trunk as possible., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Two minor problems:
- There is an additional System.out.println("length of response: " + e.length) in OpenEntity.
- In ByteRangeInputStream, the update(..) header splits into two lines.  It should be 
{code}
+  private int update(final int n) throws IOException {
-      throws IOException {
{code}
instead of 
{code}
 +  private int update(final int n)
        throws IOException {
{code}

Since both are very minor and I have changed them in my machine, let me post a patch., HDFS-4751.2.patch: addresses above two minor problems., Mark, since Jenkins won't be able to test the patch, could you run "ant test-patch" and "ant test-core" and then post the results?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
