[Ping [~daryn]
Hello Daryn this jira is showing up as a critical jira on Hadoop 3 release dashboard. This one was filed 4 years ago, do you think this is still a critical issue?

Thanks!, I'm downgrading this to major so it stops showing up on the release dashboard, please re-upgrade if it is in fact critical., This issue was fixed years ago when authenticated url was removed from webhdfs.]
