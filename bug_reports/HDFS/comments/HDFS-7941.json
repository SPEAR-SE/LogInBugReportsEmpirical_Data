[Ok, I just tested this will BLOCK compression, RECORD compression as well as NONE compression, and same result on all modes. Furthermore, I tested without sequence files (i.e. normal files) and also here it only syncs at the very beginning and never again until file is closed., Hi Sverre, 

Any update on the fix for this? I think there is a general issue on hsync(), this bug can be reproducible when someone directly calls FSDataOutputStream's hysnc()., And ya internally SequenceFile.Writer uses FSDataOutputStream., The file may not appear to grow because the new length is not sent to the Namenode on hsync or because Block-compression is used and the data is still in the compress buffer.

See http://stackoverflow.com/a/37664114/136247 for more details., (Revised summary.)

Have you tried hsync(UPDATE_LENGTH)?, SequenceFile does not provide a hsync(UPDATE_LENGTH) method (that would be a method of an underlying DFSOutputStream).

Even if it did, that would not solve the problem of block compressed data being buffered.]
