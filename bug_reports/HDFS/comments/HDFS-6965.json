[I think there is a flaw in isGoodTarget().  When checking the available space, it checks against {{node.getRemaining()}}. It has too check at individual storage level., Simply changing {{node.getRemaining()}} to {{storage.getRemaining()}} is probably sufficient.  Checking both should be redundant, shouldn't it?  If the storage has space, then the node certainly should have space unless there's an accounting bug., Yes checking at storage level should be sufficient.  Whenever a node is chosen,  {{chooseLocalStorage()}} and {{chooseRandom()}} iterate over storage objects in random order and pick the first one that is acceptable. So {{storage.getRemaining()}} is the correct check., Attaching  a patch with the changes mentioned in comments by Daryn and Kihwal.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/7998//console

This message is automatically generated., I ran all the above failed tests on my local setup multiple times and all of them are passing.
I assume this failure is  due to test timeout issue., Filed HDFS-7069 for TestMissingBlocksAlert.
+1 for the patch, Committed to trunk and cherry-picked to branch-2.  Thanks for working on the fix, Rushabh., Thanks Kihwal for reviewing and committing., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #683 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/683/])
