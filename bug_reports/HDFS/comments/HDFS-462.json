[Yes, as we traced with Luca, the rename of {{current}} to {{previous.tmp}} fails because {{current/edits}} remains open after {{loadFSImaeg()}}. WinNT does not let rename directories if there are open files in it. This was introduced by HADOOP-5314. For regular name-node start up this makes sense, but fails in other scenarios.

We should really-really resurrect windows build at least once a week as we used to have., MiniDFSCluster also does not work in Windows.

{noformat}, Attaching patch that fixes problem.  Konstantin tested on his Windows box and it worked.  Passes unit tests.  Nicholas, I don't believe your issue is due to this problem, but rather from the URI patch that's related to this one., submitting patch, Nicholas your case falls under HDFS-456. See error messages before that complaining the path is not a uri.

This message is automatically generated., Again, no new tests as is fixing a defect that's being caught by the current unit tests (under Windows at least).  Patch is ready to go., I just committed this. Thank you Jakob., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #23 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/23/])
