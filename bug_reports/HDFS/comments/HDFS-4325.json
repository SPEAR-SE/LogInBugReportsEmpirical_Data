[Hi Binglin, would you mind setting the affects/targets versions fields to indicate which branch(es) you observed this bug, and which branch(es) you think it should be fixed? Thanks a lot., Because ClientProtocol is in RPC and param dirPerm is defined as "required" in proto files, I am not sure whether or not to remove it, so I just add some comments to clarify this parameter is invalid, and do some minor modification in server side.
