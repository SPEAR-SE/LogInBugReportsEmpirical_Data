[I don't think it can happen after taking both branches into consideration., Let's look at first branch where oldFile is null, we have the following assignment:
{code}
        newFile = fsDir.addFileForEditLog(inodeId, iip.getExistingINodes(),
{code}
However, addFileForEditLog() would return null if IOException is encountered:
{code}
    } catch (IOException e) {
      if(NameNode.stateChangeLog.isDebugEnabled()) {
        NameNode.stateChangeLog.debug(
            "DIR* FSDirectory.unprotectedAddFile: exception when add "
                + existing.getPath() + " to the file system", e);
      }
    }
    return null;
{code}
I think the potential of NPE still exists., I don't see {{addFileForEditLog}} can throw an {{IOException}} unless the editlog is corrupted. [~jingzhao], can you comment on this?, What if QuotaExceededException is thrown ?, Normally we will not hit any QuotaExceededException while replaying editlog since all the checks have been done when first time serving the request (i.e., no editlog was written unless the op succeeded at that time). If the newFile is null this usually means there is corruption in the editlog. But I agree instead of throwing NPE directly maybe we can add an extra check and throw an exception containing more information here., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
