[1. +1 on extending CheckpointSignature to return the checksum of the fsimage/edits file.  I suspect that this can be done with no overhead in the NN, the NN could keep these values precalculated. Similarly, when the SN uploads a new fsiamge, it should be able to provide the checksum to the NN.

2. Maybe we can make the TransferFsImage portion of code pluggable, so that one can use either http (the current method) or scp., This issue is being worked on in HDFS-1481, so closing this one as duplicate]
