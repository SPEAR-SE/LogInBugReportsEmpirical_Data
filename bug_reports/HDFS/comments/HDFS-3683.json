[If we do (STARTING_ID - LATEST_ID) / (# of Transactions), we should accurately get the percentage assuming TxIds are in increasing order and expectedStartingTxId is the correct starting TxId.

Let me know how it looks., Sorry thats supposed to be (LATEST_ID - STARTING_ID)..., The patch looks pretty good to me. Plamen, can you comment on what testing you did of this patch? Were you able to confirm that the log message appears correct now when loading an edit log whose first transaction is not 1?, Marking patch available so that Jenkins runs., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Plamen, though this patch does indeed correct the percentage in the log message, it doesn't fix the other portion, which is supposed to show the raw number of transactions loaded. I tested this by putting a one second sleep per transaction in the edit log loading code, and then restarting an NN with a few edits. This displays the following:

{noformat}, Oh, haha. Yes I see the issue now. That same fix for the percent is supposed to also be applied for the "X/N transactions completed" part so that it shows up as 1/22 ... 12/22 .. 22/22, correct? I will post up another patch to fix that. Thanks for the catch., Yes, that was my thinking. , I think there is also a subtle "off by one" error in my use. This new patch should account for it. Basically "numOfTxns" is LAST_TXID - START_TXID + 1, so to get X/N = 1, X should be LAST_APPLIED_TXID - START_TXID + 1., And here is the patch., -1 overall.
