[Attached patch. Please review.., {{prog.setCount(Phase.LOADING_FSIMAGE, currentStep, i + 1);}}
Instead of like this, you can use, {{prog,getCounter(..)}} and {{counter.increment()}} ?, Thanks [~vinayrpet] for reviewing. 
I have updated the patch.
Please review.

This message was automatically generated., Fixed checkstyle error and attached updated patch.
Please review., {{prog.getCounter(Phase.LOADING_FSIMAGE, currentStep).increment();}}
Instead of getting counter for every INode being loaded, you can take reference of counter outside for-loop and just increment it inside for-loop ?
This might give little better loading time since number of INodes being loaded will be very huge and there is no need to lookup for the step counter everytime, , \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for review comments.
Attached updated patch, Please review.., +1 for latest patch.
Regarding test, currently there is no end-to-end test for Namenode's startupprogress. {{TestStartupProgress}} are just unit tests, not cluster tests. So it would be good to have cluster tests for NameNode startupprogress. Can be done in follow-up jira.

Will be committing the latest patch soon., Committed to trunk and branch-2.
Thanks for the contribution [~surendrasingh]., Raised followup HDFS-8524 for adding tests., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7949 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7949/])
