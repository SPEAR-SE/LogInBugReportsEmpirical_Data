[Since non-file journal managers could ostensibly be used for more than just shared edits, and since a journal manager doesn't necessarily need to store edits in a directory, perhaps we should change the title of this JIRA to something like "'hdfs -format' should be able to initialize non-file journal managers" ? Just my $0.02., Make sense. Updated the title.]
