[The complete debug/error trace of the issues that I am facing while building
Hadoop 2.6.0, till the build stops because of an unrecoverable error.

, This isn't a bug; it's a build problem, and one you have locally that nobody else is seeing. 

Hadoop 2.6 was built and tested on windows. 

# Make sure that you have followed the latest building on windows instructions in BUILDING.txt
# make sure there aren't any references to hadoop on your PATH, or hadoop versions in CLASSPATH
# Try purging your maven 2 repository of org.apache.hadoop artifacts

Closing as Invalid: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/InvalidJiraIssues

Get on the hadoop developer list and ask for help there, not via a JIRA, which is for bug reports, Closing tickets that are already part of a release.]
