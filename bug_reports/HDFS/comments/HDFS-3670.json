[Adding 1.0 to affects versions., > ... Currently you get eg a file not found if webhdfs is not enabled which isn't intuitive.

More precisely, it is "resource not found" but not "file not found".  The reason is that when WebHDFS is disabled, the servlets are not added and the web server returns "resource not found" by default.  Note that when WebHDFS is enabled, "HDFS file not found" is a JSON FileNotFoundException response.

BTW, I think there is no standard HTTP response for "not-enabled"., this does not apply to HttpFS, if HttpFS is up then it is enabled., After seeing Nicholas' comment (that we do distinguish between resource not found and file not found) perhaps we don't need this., Let's close this as not-a-problem.]
