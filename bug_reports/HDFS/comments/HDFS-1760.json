This message is automatically generated., The tests that failed appear unrelated to this change.

These tests have been sporadically failing in prior builds:
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.TestTransferRbw.testTransferRbw
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.TestBlockReport.blockReport_08

These tests have been consistently failing for a long time.
org.apache.hadoop.hdfsproxy.TestAuthorizationFilter.testPathPermit
org.apache.hadoop.hdfsproxy.TestAuthorizationFilter.testPathPermitQualified

Requesting approval despite the test failures., Good catch.  Removed duplicate name tag., Ignore last comment.  Wrong jira., Good catch Daryn.

Line 236 in INode.java - are the checks "p_node == null" and "isRoot()" the same? If so, can they be made simpler., Simplified the requested logic.  There is a subtle difference between isRoot() and p_node == null.  The parent node will happen to be null for the root, but will also be null for an inode not yet linked into the directory structure., -1 overall.

looks good to me., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #590 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/590/])
    HDFS-1760. In FSDirectory.getFullPathName(..), it is better to return "/" for root directory instead of an empty string.  Contributed by Daryn Sharp
, I have committed this.  Thanks, Daryn!

Also thanks John for reviewing it., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #643 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/643/])
