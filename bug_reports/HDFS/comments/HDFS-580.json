[My gut tells me that since there are zero blocks assigned, the name node is just happy to get a response not really caring what that response is., Can this be fixed by HDFS-528?, Potentially.  It really comes down to what does the name node consider 'live'.  In our case, the name node actually reported all the DNs as live.  But it makes me wonder if we've just hit a specialized form of HDFS-528., Maybe the NN should do a health check by trying to write and then read a file before declaring itself live]
