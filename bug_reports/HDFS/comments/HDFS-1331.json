[Allen, could you please come up with the explicit proposal on how it should work. If we want it in 0.22., Changing to improvement and removing 0.22 fix version., I'm changing this back to a bug.

The way test works is not expected behavior from anyone who has actually done any real shell coding., e) where is -l?, edit of my last comment was meant to add test -h/-L to address testing for symlinks
e)where is -L? , Attaching patch for trunk
* implements {{-test -s}} and {{-test -f}}
* adds tests for them

This patch depends on HADOOP-8994 being applied first -- the patch might apply without HADOOP-8994 but it will fail in TestDFSShell.  I'll upload a second patch with the combined diffs so that jenkins will test it successfully., Attaching hdfs1331-with-hadoop8994.txt which should pass jenkins., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Looks good, but please update the usage and remove the spurious {{System.out.println("isFile = " ...}}, New patch:

Update usage message, remove debug println., re-submitting patch to try to kick hadoopqa into action, Sorry for the delay.  A very small request is to follow the pattern for the usage of other commands by displaying each option on a separate line like: "  -OPT  DESCRIPTION\n"., bq. follow the pattern for the usage of other commands

There's a lot of inconsistency, but I figure the {{-ls}} usage message is a good example to follow. I cleaned up the rest of {{Test.java}}s usage message too while in there., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
