, there is no write timeout. why not add writeTimeout?, [~zsl2007], it appears that the DataNode is setting both a write and a read timeout on its sockets, but the DFSClient is only setting a read timeout.  If you want to file another JIRA to add a write timeout to DFSClient sockets, that might be a good idea., Any chance of bringing this to a 2.5.x patch release? Over on HBASE-13339 we're trying to work out how best to support users with minimal impact on dependencies for our next minor release (1.1). Bumping Hadoop minor versions (I think) will break our semantic versioning compatibility guidelines.

FYI [~eclark], [~busbey], [~cnauroth], Hi [~ndimiduk].  I'm not aware of any plans for a 2.5.3 patch release.  To do so, we'd need someone to volunteer as release manager and conduct a vote on a release candidate.  [~kasha], I'm notifying you just FYI, since you had been release manager previously on the 2.5.x release line., Thanks for the ping, [~cnauroth]. 

[~ndimiduk] - there are no active plans for 2.5.3. If HDFS committers think this issue is serious enough to warrant a point release, I don't mind creating the RC and putting it through a vote. , Hi [~kasha]. Thanks again for the offer. HBase community has decided to lax it's position [0] on dependency project version changes for the time being and will release 1.1 against Hadoop 2.6.0. In general, we would appreciate a release patch cadence that includes bug fixes that do not impact user-facing APIs and wire compatibility in addition to security fixes. However this is probably a discussion for a wider audience.
