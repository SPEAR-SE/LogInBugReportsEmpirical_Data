[Made a tentative patch for review., Hi [~xiaobingo], thanks for the patch. Can we use an {{else if}} clause instead of the nested {{if}}? +1 with that updated., This came up at HDFS-3447 before and [~daryn] was against dropping this to debug. His last comment proposes a preferred solution; can we pursue that instead?, I see, thanks for the pointer [~andrew.wang]. We'll hold off making the change for now.]
