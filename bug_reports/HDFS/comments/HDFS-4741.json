[The main cause of the failure appears to be "winutils chmod -R" being broken on Windows. Filed and linked HADOOP-9508.

If the winutils fix by itself is sufficient to resolve this test failure I will resolve it as a duplicate., The directory "execute" permission as emulated on Windows works differently as compare to Unix. 

The testcase verifies that changing permissions on the edits dir is detected correctly by the name node after a checkpoint (both revocation and grant). It revokes rwx permissions on a directory name2 and expects that the namenode will not be able to write to name2\current\. This is not so on Windows.

The simplest fix is to just manipulate permissions on name2\current when running on Windows., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
