[The regex pattern that matches the username and the group is changed to include "-", which is a more correct pattern for the username and the group name., This issue seems to apply only to branch-2.4. We should change target version to 2.4.1. 

It's cumbersome to define a regex for usernames. For example, usernames must not start with '-' but may contain a '.' . In order to avoid dealing with this, you can paste the value of {{System.getProperty("user.name")}} for this component of regex.

{code}
"([d\\-])([rwx\\-]{9})\\s*(-|\\d+)\\s*" + System.getProperty("user.name") + "\\s*([a-zA-Z_0-9\\-]+)\\s*(\\d+)\\s*(\\d+)\\s*([\b/]+)"

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Gera. It appears this offending method has been removed as part of HDFS-6164.

I changed the target version to 2.4.1. However, since this is regarding a functionality that was removed in 2.5.0 and it pertains to purely a unit test failure, it is not too important to fix. I don't think this should stop 2.4.1.

I'll still upload an updated patch for 2.4.0 shortly., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
