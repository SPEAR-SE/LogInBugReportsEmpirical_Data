[Code looks good to me. I wonder why the HDFS namenode was not using the group information in the first place, it seemed like a pretty reasonable thing to do. Maybe Owen has some historical perspective on this?

Do we need to put some javadocs to state that if there are multiple groups in the ugi, then the first one takes efffect as far as file permissions are concerned?

Also, this looks like an incompatible change, especially because files will now have the appropriate group information., This is apparently the expected behavior. See HADOOP-5769, Thanks for the information, Todd :)]
