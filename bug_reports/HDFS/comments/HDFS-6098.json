{code}, The synchronization of {{FsVolumeImpl#bpSlices}} looks wrong. In different locations it is modified without a lock or synchronized via {{FsVolumeImpl#dataset}}. Also reads are unsynchronized., Correction - modification of the map is not synchronized at all., Trivial patch to make {{bpSlices}} a {{ConcurrentHashMap}}. I think it is sufficient here., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
