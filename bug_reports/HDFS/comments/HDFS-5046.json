[bq. a). decommission progress hangs and the status always be 'Waiting DataNode status: Decommissioned'. But, if I execute 'hadoop dfs -setrep -R 2 /', the decommission continues and will be completed finally.

The step (a) points to your problem and solution both. You have files
being created with repl=3 on a 2 DN cluster which will prevent
decommission. This is not a bug.]
