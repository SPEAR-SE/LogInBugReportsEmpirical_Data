[It looks like a known issue for jetty 6:

http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-315

When it happens, the exception thrown by jetty is caught by the jersey exception handler. The exception is eventually map to a 500 response, terminating the connection., It's a slow writer and the maxIdleTime config is being exceeded.  It's used to set the socket's so timeout., HDFS-7279 should fix this problem.]
