[We don't really need to rely on NameNode registration.  A DataNode always knows which port it's listening on for DataTransferProtocol, based solely on its own local configuration.  The attached patch implements the fix.  I'm still passing through the {{DatanodeID}}, because that's still useful for debug logging., +1 patch looks good., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., HI [~cnauroth],

Thanks for reporting the issue and working on the solution. I reviewed the fix, it looks good to me. I happen to notice a typo in the related code at line 113:

{code}
   } else if (datanodeId.getXferPort() < 1024) {
      LOG.debug(
        "SASL server skipping handshake in unsecured configuration for "
        + "peer = {}, datanodeId = {}", peer, datanodeId);
      return new IOStreamPair(underlyingIn, underlyingOut);
    } else if (dnConf.getSaslPropsResolver() != null) {
{code}
In the debug message above, the "unsecured" meant  "secured".  Can we fix it in this patch?

Another thing is, I wish the 1024 is a constant defined in the security util somewhere, but it pre-existed. So I think it we were to replace it, it does not have to be the scope of this jira.

Thanks again.



, Thank you for the code reviews, Nicholas and Yongjun.

Yongjun, I'm uploading patch v2 with the log message fixed like you suggested.  Nice catch!  I'm going to commit this version based on the prior +1 from Nicholas, and this new version is only changing a string literal in a log message.

You're right that there are a few different places checking for a port number < 1024.  We might benefit from a shared {{isPrivilegedPort}} method somewhere.  One interesting aspect is that Windows has no concept of privileged ports, so perhaps this method would return false always on Windows.  I won't address it here, but I do encourage you to file a jira for that chnage.

bq. -1 tests included. The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.

This turned up in internal system testing that involved restart DataNodes while running jobs.  It would be very difficult to put this into a predictable test.

The failure in {{TestWebHDFSForHA}} looks unrelated.  The test passed locally., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
