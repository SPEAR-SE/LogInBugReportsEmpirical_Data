[Thanks [~brahmareddy] for working on this. Patch LGTM and I've tested it locally with branch-2.7.
+1, [~xyao] thanks a lot for your review., Thanks a lot for debugging and fixing this [~brahmareddy]].

It looks like [~zhz] just committed this patch to branch-2.7 so we no longer need this fix., Thanks for pinging Arpit. Are you referring to HDFS-8647?, Hi Zhe, yes I meant you just cherry-picked HDFS-8647 to branch-2.7., I see, thx for confirming. 

FYI I just committed it to branch-2.6 as well, Closing as implemented since it's fixed as part of cherry-pick from HDFS-8647. Thanks [~arpitagarwal],[~zhz]]
