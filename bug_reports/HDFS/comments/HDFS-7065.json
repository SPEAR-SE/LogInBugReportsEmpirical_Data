{panel}, The pre-commit build is not working as expected.  There is no {{TestStorageMover}} in the source tree!  It is only in HDFS-6584 branch.  It looks like a leftover from previous build attempt. , Hi Kihwal, thanks for working this.  Are you able to reproduce the problem?  I think this is hard to test.

Anyway, you analysis makes sense and the patch looks good.
