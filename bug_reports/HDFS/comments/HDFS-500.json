[Patch removes all lingering warnings from hdfs that can be removed.  There are five remaining:

    [javac] 5 warnings
{noformat}
The three warnings related to the create method are being resolved in HDFS-490.  The remaining three are due to the Java bug that does not correctly ignore deprecations when directed to do so (as documented in MAPREDUCE-623 and HADOOP-5877).  Still waiting for consensus on how to handle these zombie warnings.

There are quite a few warnings not directly in the hdfs package, but that exist within the hdfs-with-mr tests from Mapred's Great Package Deprecation of 2008.  Mapred's still working on how to handle these, but it seems to me that having these tests in hdfs creates a cycle that runs counter to the goal of the project split., submitting patch., canceling patch to get Hudson's attention, Yo, Hudson!, oh, well. No Hudson.  Manually, all unit tests patch. test-patch is fine:

The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.{noformat}, I meant, test-patch is fine as this is just a javac cleanup and no new tests are needed., If I remember correctly, we need @deprecated in the javadoc, otherwise, there will be some warnings.  I suspect test-patch fails to detect these new warnings., > If I remember correctly, we need @deprecated in the javadoc, ...
