[Match getDefaultPort behavior on trunk., Branch 2 has a test for these custom properties, which of course fails with their removal.  Updated the patch to remove the test, but am getting a bit concerned about the backwards compatibility of this change.  The concept of changing defaults is of course wonky and is correct to remove; not sure I'm convinced it's safe to remove it as part of branch-2, however..., btw, [~aw], any idea why Jenkins isn't picking this up to run against branch 2?  I believe it's named correctly according to [HowToContribute|https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute#Naming_your_patch]., \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. ...am getting a bit concerned about the backwards compatibility of this change...

Yes, I agree.  Navigating through the twisty history, I can see that there was concern expressed about this part of the change in the later comments of HDFS-5321.  There was a specific choice to restore the behavior of making {{getDefaultPort}} respect the configuration as part of HDFS-6632, so I think we need to preserve that.

FWIW, I don't think this is strictly correct for the contract of {{getDefaultPort}}.  Other implementations hard-code the return value to its typical default instead of reading configuration.  {{DistributedFileSystem}} is hard-coded to return 8020.  {{FTPFileSystem}} hard-codes 21.  Sometimes we have to let compatibility win though.  I suppose that's why we're taking the opportunity change it on trunk.

For these test failures on branch-2, shall we change {{WebHdfs}} and {{SWebHdfs}} to call {{setConf}} on the wrapped instance?  This would require private static helper methods that do the instantiation + {{setConf}}, just to satisfy Java's rules about the call to {{super}} being the first line in the constructor.  e.g.:

{code}
    super(theUri, createWebHdfsFileSystem(conf), conf, SCHEME, false);
{code}

{code}
  private static WebHdfsFileSystem createWebHdfsFileSystem(Configuration conf) {
    WebHdfsFileSystem fs = new WebHdfsFileSystem();
    fs.setConf(conf);
    return fs;
  }
{code}
, Hi [~jghoman].  I'd like to clear up these test failures.  I'm attaching patches that implement what I described in the last comment.  Please let me know your thoughts.

The two patch files labeled 003 are identical.  They just have different file names to trigger separate Jenkins test runs for trunk and branch-2., \\
