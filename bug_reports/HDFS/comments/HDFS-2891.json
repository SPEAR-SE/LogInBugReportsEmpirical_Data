More info:

This happens when we test with Hbase.
Run the HDFS and HBase cluster normally, and Suddenly Power-off the mid Datanode from the pipeline.
Then Clinet was getting following exception.

After that client closed the connection and first Datanode was getting EOFException and interrupted the threads.

Finally Client is marking this first DataNode as bad.

{noformat}

Infact first datanode is healthy, but unportunately due to this timeouts clinet detected first datanode as bad. Then immediately it is trying with the second datanode( by choosing it as primary node).

Ideally first Datanode should get first timeout because he will wait only 66000ms for ack response from second datanode(power off DN). Here clients waits for 69000ms. But for some reason Client is getting first time out exception that firstDatanode. So, first DN marked as bad instaed of second one.

Impact is, Clinet again tries for the second datanode and obiously will fail again.It will 6 times unnecessarily it will retry.

Finally it will end up in writing only one replica in third DataNode. But here we have two nodes healthy. , Note: this is not happening very regularly., Hi Uma,

This problem exists in branch-1.0 also.

*This can happen in the following scenario :*
{quote}
1. consider the pipeline as [ DN1 -> DN2 -> DN3 ]
2. create one file and get the stream.
3. write some bytes using that stream and call sync.
4. keep the stream open.
5. Now unplug network / power-off / ethernet down in DN2 machine.
{quote}

*The explanation is as follows :*

*Consider the case, when the caller is not writing any data and dataStreamer & ResponseProcessor threads are running And also DN2 machine ethernet down:*

{quote}
	1. At *time t1* , ResponseProcessor will start reading the ack from DN1 [timeOut is 69 secs ]

	2. But in the DN1 , packetResponder not yet started reading the ack. It will be waiting on ackQueue until one packet arrives.

	3. After time *t1+34.5* secs only, dataStreamer will stream the HEART_BEAT packet to DN1. [if there is no data packet, DataStreamer will send HEART_BEAT packet after waiting for half of the timeout value]

	4. Then only, DataXceiver will receive the packet and will put it in ackQueue in DN side.

	5. At *time t2* , Once the ackQueue is enqueued, the packetResponder will start reading the ack from DN2. [timeOut is 66 secs]

	6. As DN2 machine ethernet is down, packetResponder in DN1 is not getting the reply.

	7. But packetResponder will get timeOut only after *t2+66* secs.

	8. Hence ResponseProcessor is getting socketTimeOutException earlier than PacketResponder.

{quote}

		*t2 - t1 >= 34.5 secs*   [if its greater than 3 secs itself, the reported scenario can happen]

	So, DFSClient is getting SocketTimeOutException before DN1.
	Hence DFSClient is detecting DN1 as bad datanode [which is up] and not detecting DN2 as bad datanode [which is down]


*Reason :*

In DataNode, the PacketResponder will start reading the ack only when it receives one packet [either data or heartbeat packet]
But In DFSClient, the ResponseProcessor will start reading the ack before sending packet.
, Hi Chackara,

 Thanks a lot for working on this issue.
Seems to be valid scenario. Do you want to upload a patch for this issue?]
