[Also remove redundant call to {{getNumUnderConstructionBlocks}} on startup., +1, thanks Arpit.

I found a nit in {{getCompleteBlocksTotal}}, if you can modify it too, that would be nice.
{code}
readLock();
numUCBlocks = leaseManager.getNumUnderConstructionBlocks();
{code}
It's better to put {{readLock}} below, \\

This message was automatically generated., Is it possible to return {{leasesById.size()}} instead?, Thanks for the reviews. v2 patch attached.

bq. Is it possible to return leasesById.size() instead?
Fixed.

bq. I found a nit in getCompleteBlocksTotal, if you can modify it too, that would be nice.
Looks risky, the lock ensures consistent state for each INodeFile. , Patch v2 looks good to me. +1
One nit: you can use a timeout rule that applies to all cases instead of adding them individually.

{code}
@Rule
publicTimeout timeout=new Timeout(300000);
{code}, {code}
+    private Collection<Long> getFiles() { 
+      return Collections.unmodifiableCollection(files);
+    }
{code}

Just wondering whether it is necessary?

{code}
-  @Test (timeout=1000)
+  @Test (timeout=300000)
{code}

Are you seeing timeouts? I would be surprised as the tests operate on mocked objects and should be really quick., I don't see a good reason to return a modifiable reference to the internal list.

bq. One nit: you can use a timeout rule that applies to all cases instead of adding them individually.
Done in v3 patch., +1 pending jenkins., \\

Arpit, sorry, I mean to put following in the {{try .. finally}} closure,  ideally it will not throw exception in real case, but from the implementation, it contains and could cause dead lock.

numUCBlocks = leaseManager.getNumUnderConstructionBlocks();
