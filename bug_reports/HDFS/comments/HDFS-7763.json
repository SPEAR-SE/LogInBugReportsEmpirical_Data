This message is automatically generated., The findbugs warning is not related with current fix: "Inconsistent synchronization of org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.BackupImage.namesystem; locked 60% of time", I feel a bit confused here.  Shouldn't exiting with an exception cause the exception to be logged?

{code}
+    int retCode = 0;
+    try {
+      retCode = zkfc.run(parser.getRemainingArgs());
+    } catch (Exception e) {
+      LOG.warn("", e);
+    }
+    System.exit(retCode);
{code}

Do you want to catch {{Throwable}} rather than {{Exception}} there?  It seems like you would like to catch all exceptions.

{code}
      LOG.warn("", e);
{code}
Why no message?, How about v2, Colin?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This looks good to me, though one little nit is we could do {{System.exit}} in a {{finally}}.
