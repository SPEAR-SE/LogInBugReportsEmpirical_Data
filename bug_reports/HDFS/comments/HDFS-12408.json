[I am raising this as a 3.0.0-beta1 blocker so we can drive towards clean test runs for the beta release.

There are a few non-EC tests that also seem to be flaky, will file separate Jiras for those.

cc [~andrew.wang] as the 3.0.0-beta1 RM., Resolving since HDFS-12417 is committed. That significantly reduced noise in the pre-commit runs.

Filed two new blockers for other consistently failing tests - HDFS-12436 and HDFS-12437.]
