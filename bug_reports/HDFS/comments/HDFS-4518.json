[Attaching a patch for branch-1. I believe no patch is needed for trunk as the byte-granularity metrics are already exposed via JMX (FSNamesystemState)., Thanks to Suresh for the offline feedback, I missed that a patch is needed for trunk to expose via the metrics system.

Attached updated patches for branch-1.1 and trunk., +1 for the trunk patch., +1 for the branch-1 patch. I will commit it once Jenkins +1s the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
