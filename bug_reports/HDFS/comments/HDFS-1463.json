[If safemode is on, then setting access time on a file will throw an exception., +1. This looks good!, This could be problematic because SafeMode implies readonly mode, but this patch could make readers fail if it needed to update accessTime fo a file. I would prefer to skip updating accesstime of a file if the namenode is in SafeMode., Merged patch with latest trunk. Ignore updating accesstime in getBlockLocations if the namenode is in safemode.
