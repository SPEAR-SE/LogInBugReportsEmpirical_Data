[Issue already fixed on trunk via HDFS-3667 that added retry support to webhdfs.  The fix was extraneous to the retry changes, so I've extracted the couple of relevant lines.

No test is included.  It's a simple change, HDFS-3667 included no test, and it sure doesn't look simple to test.

I have manually verified it on a secure cluster.  The issue was originally uncovered by a 401 Unauthorized response.  It now handles that case correctly., Patch is 23-only, so pre-commit will fail to apply., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12572111/HDFS-4553.branch-23.patch
  against trunk revision .

    {color:red}-1 patch{color}.  The patch command could not apply the patch.

This message is automatically generated., Can you run test-patch? Or at least share your test results?, The patch looks okay. Full test-patch won't be necessary, if you have full hdfs test result + manual test result of the fix., I ran the webhdfs tests, and as cited above tested that a 401 does not cause a NPE., +1 for the branch-0.23 patch., I've committed this to branch-0.23. Thanks for the work, Daryn., Is HDFS-4490 fixed by this change? If so can you link it to this jira and mark that as closed., Yes, it is!  I thought I had filed a similar jira but couldn't find it., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #545 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/545/])
