[Looks like this test is no longer failing, and hasn't been for a while., This was probably fixed by HDFS-1829, which seems to dup this bug.  Although the title of that bug only mentions infinite loops, it also identified and resolved an NPE; see comment [13019933|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-1829?focusedCommentId=13019933&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13019933]]
