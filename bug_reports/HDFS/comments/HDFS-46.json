This message is automatically generated., Test failures are not related to this patch!, Current patch is based on trunk!, Hi Nicholas, Can you please take a look?

Thanks
Uma, Patch looks good.  Since the new test is really simple, how about combining it to another test, say testMultipleFilesSmallerThanOneBlock?  Then, it would save a few seconds for starting and shutting down a cluster., Thanks a lot for taking a look.
ok for me to merge the test with existing one. I will post the patch in couple of minutes.

Thanks
Uma, Hi Nicholas,
I have Updated the patch!
