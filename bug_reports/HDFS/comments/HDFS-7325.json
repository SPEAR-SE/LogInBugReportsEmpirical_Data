The < above should be <=.  When numAllocated == maxAllocated, we definitely should call notify().  How about simply including the change in HDFS-7358 and resolving this?, bq. The < above should be <=. 

One tricky thing here is that the patch moves this block after the {{numAllocated--}}.  So I believe this should be correct... 

bq. How about simply including the change in HDFS-7358 and resolving this?

OK., > One tricky thing here is that the patch moves this block after the numAllocated--. ...

Ah, you are correct.  We actually do not need the "if" since "numAllocated < maxAllocated" is always true.]
