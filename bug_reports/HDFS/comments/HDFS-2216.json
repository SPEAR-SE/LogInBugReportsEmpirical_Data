[Hey Gabriel, Apache JIRA is for tracking confirmed bugs/improvements/features, not for answering user questions like this one. This question would be better asked on a mailing list like hdfs-user@hadoop.apache.org.

That said, you should know that the dfs.blocksize configuration option is, perhaps surprisingly, only read by HDFS clients. Can you confirm that this setting was set on the client machine from where you were uploading the file(s) into HDFS?]
