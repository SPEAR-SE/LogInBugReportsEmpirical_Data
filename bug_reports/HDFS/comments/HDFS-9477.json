[Notice that it's occurring because of an atime update - probably from opening the file.  This appears to be caused by the file descriptor-ish feature added awhile back.  Anyhow, I believe /.reserved paths should probably never occur in the edits., Thanks for your reply.
Which file do you mean by opening the file? /.reserved/.inodes/2346114?
I mounted HDFS on linux using nfs gateway, and then shared it with samba. So we can open the files in HDFS without downloading it on windows.
About thirty records of OP_TIMES of /.reserved/.inodes/xxxx occurs in edits in about a week after that.I think that may be related.
I know little about the file descriptor-ish feature, and will learn something about it
, I believe that HDFS-8269 has solved this issue, please check it.]
