bq. What was the user-visible impact of this, if any?

Your NameNode would not start in a non-HA, non-Federated environment unless the values of fs.defaultFS and dfs.namenode.rpc-address were the same in the NN conf. I encountered this because I wanted to test ViewFS in a non-federated cluster and I wanted the fs.defaultFS to be viewfs://...
