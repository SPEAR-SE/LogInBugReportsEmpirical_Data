This message is automatically generated., I'm sure that this patch will work to get the test passing, but I'm not sure that it's the most appropriate solution. Is it not possible to fix HADOOP-8184 so that the exception messages returned have the same data that they used to?, IMO it depends. The patch that caused this failure didn't make any note of semantic changes, so it seems a little strange to just change the test with no comment. But if this is in fact an improvement, it seems reasonable to fix the test. Could someone comment on what semantics actually changed? We used to prepend the exception class as part of the message of RemoteException, but now we don't?, Great point, Todd. I'm also not entirely clear if the exception message change in HADOOP-8184 was an unintended side effect, or one of the intended effects of the JIRA.

There is perhaps a question of compatibility here as well, since HADOOP-8184 changed the output of the `hadoop fs ...' CLI in the event of errors, as HDFS-3142 demonstrates. Should we be at all concerned about that? It doesn't seem like a big deal to me, but I'd like to hear others' opinions., Hi Aaron and Todd,

The changes probably is not intentional but it is a good change since the class name should not be in the message.  Exception messages are not APIs and so it can be changed anytime.  Also, test should avoid depending on the message format.  However, CLI error messages are a kind of public APIs.  They should not be changed unless there are bugs.

Since the new CLI re-write is not out yet and it is better not to have the class name in the message, I think we should keep the current message format and fix the tests.  What do you think?, Seems reasonable to me. We should mark HADOOP-8184 as an incompatible change and make sure this is noted in the release notes. Though they're not public APIs, there are cases in which I've seen software match against exception error messages -- mostly because we have a very flat exception hierarchy in Hadoop. For example, HBase's FSHDFSUtils class does this in a few places to distinguish different cases of lease expiration., bq. Seems reasonable to me. We should mark HADOOP-8184 as an incompatible change and make sure this is noted in the release notes.

+1, Also, +1 to this patch. I'll commit this shortly., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks a lot for the contribution, Arpit. Thanks for the discussion, Todd and Nicholas., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2015 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2015/])
