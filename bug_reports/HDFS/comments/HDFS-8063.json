[Shutting down MiniDFSCluster assures no spans arrived any more. I merged testWriteWithoutTraceHooks and testReadWithoutTraceHooks in order to reduce the number of MiniDFSCluster startup as far as possible. I also removed code duplication., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for looking at this, [~iwasakims].  It's nice that you refactored the common code into the {{writeTestFile}} function.

I do wonder if we could avoid shutting down the MiniDFSCluster on every test.  Did you try just doing the hsync by itself?  That would cause the background write thread to have to fire and complete.  Shutting down the whole cluster shouldn't be necessary to ensure that the write completed, surely?  The stuff the NameNode is doing is not really done in the background, so I'm not sure it needs a shutdown.  Maybe I am missing something?, Thanks for the comment, [~cmccabe].

bq. Did you try just doing the hsync by itself?

I think it should work for writing path but still it is difficult for waiting every server side tracing spans which is closed after the response of rpc is sent to client, in general.

For example, you can see {{OpReadBlockProto}} is closed after the top level {{testReadTraceHooks}} in attached testReadTraceHooks.html. Though {{assertSpanNamesFound}} waitFor at lease one {{OpReadBlockProto}} arrives to receiver, it does not wait for the final {{OpReadBlockProto}}.
, Thanks for the explanation.  Yes, I agree that waiting for the spans to complete could be annoying in general.  +1 for the patch.

If we later want to refactor this to use fewer MiniDFSCluster instances, we could also consider some kind of retry loop using {{GenericTestUtils#waitFor}}, like we have in some other tests., Tests in the current TestTracing could be done in single test method in order to reduce the number of starting MiniDFSCluster. Reading with tracing which causes the problem should be done in the last as did in 002., +1, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
