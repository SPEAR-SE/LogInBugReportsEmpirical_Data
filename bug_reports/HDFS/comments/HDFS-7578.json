This message is automatically generated., Hi [~brandonli],

Thanks for posting this patch. It looks pretty good. Did you see this problem in the field or did you notice it through code examination? Is it possible to create an actual test case the demonstrates the problem?

I have a few relatively minor comments.

In Nfs3Utils.java, you could change this:

{code}
    XDR out = new XDR();
    out = response.serialize(out, xid, new VerifierNone());
{code}

to

{code}
    final XDR out = response.serialize(new XDR(), xid, new VerifierNone());
{code}

Also, the code in #writeChannelCommit and #writeChannel are pretty much identical except for the call to LOG.debug. You might want to refactor that a little. (also, s/Commit done:/Commit done: /)

Thanks.
Charles

, Thank you, [~clamb]. 
I've updated the bug description to be more accurate and uploaded a new patch to address your comments., LGTM. Non-binding +1 from me.

Thanks Brandon.

This message is automatically generated., I think in general it is a good change. An easier approach is to use {{Channel#getRemoteAddress()}} when constructing {{RpcResponse}} instead of propagating it everywhere., [~wheat9], I am not sure if I got the whole idea. We could use ChannelHandlerConctext to get Channel and then get remoteAddress. Are you suggesting not passing down remoteAddress or ChannelHandlerContext?, The patch looks good to me and I don't see an easy way to simplify constructing {{RpcResponse}}. [~wheat9] if you still remember your idea could you advise?

Luckily the patch still applies. , \\

This message was automatically generated., The patch does apply and build successfully on my local machine. 

It's also strange that my comment triggered Jenkins. [~aw] Is that expected with the new test script?, bq. It's also strange that my comment triggered Jenkins.  Is that expected with the new test script?

Yup.  That part of the pipeline is before test-patch.sh.  It's always been that way., 002 patch needs a minor rebase, attaching 003 patch to trigger Jenkins., Thanks for confirming this Allen. , \\
