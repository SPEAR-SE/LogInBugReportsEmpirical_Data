[> I feel as though DFSClient should be changed to wrap writes in some form of delegate to a method that takes a timeout which uses the value specified as "dfs.socket.timeout"

This is the case in 0.17. These writes have a timeout of around 10minutes. It not not configurable now, but it could be. There are socket writes in many different contexts and we might need different config timeouts for those. HADOOP-3124 is about one such config.

Take a look at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.SocketOutputStream for more details if interested.]
