[Also from HDFS-3828,
bq. note that printBlockReport and getNextBPScanner do not check for null so they will NPE and we should fix them. Also, looks like the test checks the return value to see if the scanners are initialized yet., This isn't just refactoring, per the following comment the goal is to restructure the flow to scanBlockPoolSlice to avoid the unnecessary work.
