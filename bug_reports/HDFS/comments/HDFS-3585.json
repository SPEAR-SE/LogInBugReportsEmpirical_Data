[Here the scenario is 

1. Create 2 clients
2. write a file using the client 1
3. trigger a BR
4. trigger lease recovery from the client 2
5. let client 2 complete its recovery in DN and let commitBlockSync complete
6. Now allow the old BR to process which is triggered @ 3
7. The block is marked as corrupt in this scenario

, In the mentioned scenario 
consider we a have block of GS 1002 and its reported to NN
Now DN has completed the recovery which should have bumped GS to 1003 and commitBlockSync successfully executed
Next the old block report is processed then there is a mismatch in the GS and reported ...!

SO the block is marked as corrupt  :(

, If I follow correctly, you're saying that the BR contains the block with GS=1002, but the NN has already seen the synchronization at GS=1003, so it marks blk_1002 as corrupt.

Shoudln't this be OK? i.e the NN will then issue deletion of the replica with GS=1002, the DN will ignore it because the GS doesn't match, and the corrupt block entry will go away?, (oops, I didn't mean to assign this... just meant to comment), Todd, If this situation happened for all blocks( for replication), then we will not invalidate that corrupt blocks right? If we have enough replication then only we will go for invalidation.]
