[Actually this is happening due to the following code snippet.
{code}
    if ((args.length == 0) || ("-files".equals(args[0]))) {
      printUsage(System.err);
    ToolRunner.printGenericCommandUsage(System.err);
    }
{code}
Here actually in printUsage() method itself they are printing the generic command usage informtion,here they added one more step for printing the usage.so it is printing twice, Attaching the patch by removing the printing usage line.
Please review it.]
