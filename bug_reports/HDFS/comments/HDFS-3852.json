[The test failure seems sporadic.  I'll look into it., FWIW, this test appears to fail 100% of the time on my box. I just ran it 5 times and it failed every time., Ok.  I was just perusing the pre-commit builds.  Are you using java 7?, Nope, same old java 6. FWIW, got bisect also agrees with me that 8225 caused this. 

Does the test not fail for you?, Fails locally for me as well, and also [in recent jobs|
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/3104//testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfs/TestHftpDelegationToken/testHdfsDelegationToken].

Here's the failure:

{noformat}
java.lang.AssertionError: wrong tokens in user expected:<2> but was:<1>
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:91)
        at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:645)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:126)

        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestHftpDelegationToken.testHdfsDelegationToken(TestHftpDelegationToken.java:60)
{noformat}, The test is attempting to insert two tokens with the same service.  The UGI's private creds is a list which happily accepted tokens with duplicate services and even duplicate tokens.  When I changed UGI in HADOOP-8225 to allow extraction of a {{Credentials}} object from the UGI, it broke the test because  {{Credentials}} uses a map for tokens which naturally doesn't allow for service dups.  The test is really trying to ensure the correct token is retrieved for htftp so I changed the 2nd token to have a different service to prevent it replacing the first token.

Arguably, multiple tokens for the same service with different kinds should be permissible.  However in practice that is/was not "possible" because a {{Credentials}} (which doesn't allow service dups) is used to build up tokens to be dumped into the UGI., Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for the explanation, Daryn, and thanks for looking into this issue.
