This message was automatically generated., I'm re-kicking jenkins since we got a bunch of weird timeouts, just like with some of the patches yesterday.  Seems unrelated to the patch, Summary of the approach here: the format of OP_EDIT_LOG_RENAME_OLD allows moving /f to /d/f to be represented as RENAME(src=/f, dst=/d) or RENAME(src=/f, dst=/d/f).  This change makes HDFS always use the latter form.  This, in turn, ensures that inotify will always be able to consider the dst field as the full destination file name.  This is a compatible change since we aren't removing the ability to handle the first form during edit log replay... we just no longer generate it., \\

This message was automatically generated., +1 non-binding., HI [~cmccabe],

Thanks for reporting the issue and the patch. It looks good to me, only couple of minor comments: 

*  can we add a description to this jira explaining why (e.g., "This, in turn, ensures that inotify will always be able to consider the dst field as the full destination file name.")?
* can we add java doc to the {{void logRename(}} methods to say something like "if the rename source is a file, the target is better to be a file too, this will ensure that inotify will always be able to confider the dst file as the full destination file name."? 

Thanks.

, bq. can we add a description to this jira explaining why (e.g., "This, in turn, ensures that inotify will always be able to consider the dst field as the full destination file name.")?
