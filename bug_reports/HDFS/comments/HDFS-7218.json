, In current FSN, we only log failed audit event for {{AccessControlException}}, let's keep in line with it?, [~hitliuyi],

Thanks for the review!

Yes, I think you are right that we should only write to the audit log on AccessControlExceptions. I've made those changes.

, Thanks [~clamb], just one small nit, +1 after addressing.

{code}
logAuditEvent(success, "getAcl", src);
{code}
{{getAcl}} is better to be {{getAclStatus}}

, Good catch Yi. Attached is a corrected patch.

Thanks again for the thorough review.
