[* HDFS-573 implemented Windows compatibility for libhdfs.  As part of this effort, we refactored OS-specific system calls into OS-specific source files.  We also introduced htable.c for a platform-neutral hash table implementation.  libwebhdfs includes jni_helper.c from libhdfs in its own build.  jni_helper.c depends on the OS-specific sources and the hash table, but since the libwebhdfs build was not updated to include these files, this causes unresolved external symbols.
* HADOOP-11403 introduced the {{terror}} function in exception.c as a cross-platform thread-safe error reporting function.  libwebhdfs code was changed to call this function, but libwebhdfs doesn't use the exception.c from hadoop-common.  Instead, it uses the exception.c from libhdfs, which does not have this function.
, The attached patch fixes the libwebhdfs build by adding the required sources introduced in HDFS-573 and using the same strategy as HADOOP-11403 for a cross-platform thread-safe function similar to {{strerror}}., HADOOP-10452 requests updates to BUILDING.txt.  I've asked that we include information on {{-Drequire.libwebhdfs}}.

I created HADOOP-11937 to request that test-patch.sh do a full native build, including all optional components like libwebhdfs.  This would have caught the problem before the patches that caused the break were committed., \\

, Hi [~cnauroth], do we need this fix in branch-2.6/branch-2.7?, IMO, this is not worthwhile for a backport to branch-2.7 or branch-2.6.  There is some debate about the actual utility of libwebhdfs, and we don't have any evidence that it's being used by anyone.  If someone else wants to request a backport though, then I wouldn't object., Thanks Chris for clarification on this. I agree that this is not a very high priority bug to fix.
This comes to my radar per [~kihwal]'s comments in HDFS-9445(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-9445?focusedCommentId=15081254&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15081254). [~kihwal], do you still think we should backport this to 2.6/2.7 now or you are OK to defer to later?, bq. This comes to my radar per Kihwal Lee's comments...

I see.  If it helps expedite HDFS-9445, then I see no harm in including this too.  Let's see what Kihwal thinks., I don't see a point of maintaining libwebhdfs in 2.6 and 2.7. We might as well push for HDFS-9047.  YETUS-223 is also related., So Kihwal, you are preferring to push HDFS-9047 (deprecate/remove libwebhdfs) instead of fixing the build failures like patch here. Isn't it? But that one is unassigned so far, and I didn't see who is actually working on it recently..., The immediate goal will be to make the precommit work. We can go either way.  We can fix it, but the fact that nobody complained about the breakage in 2.6 and 2.7 so far probably means no one is using it. If we remove it, it is different from deprecating functioning code. Rather, we will be removing code that has been unbuildable for a long time. , I felt it needs more discussion, so left a comment in HDFS-9047. , Ok. Thanks for pushing it, [~kihwal]!]
