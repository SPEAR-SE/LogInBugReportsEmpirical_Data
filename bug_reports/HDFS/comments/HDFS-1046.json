[h1046_20100326.patch: changes tomcat version to 6.0.24  ([Srikanth's fix|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-481?focusedCommentId=12850021&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12850021]), +1 patch looks good.

For a longer term, we should fix hdfsproxy/build.xml so that it won't depend on external urls.
, I tested it manually on 0.21 and 0.22.  The patch worked fine.  The problem does not exist in 0.20.

I have committed this.  Thanks, Srikanth!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #223 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/223/])
