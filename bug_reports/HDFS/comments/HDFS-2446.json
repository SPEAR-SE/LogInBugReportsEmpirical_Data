[Thanks to Kihwal Lee , we got a workaround as following

Adding the following in $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/log4j.properties in only client side, get rid of two extra INFO logging

log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.security.JniBasedUnixGroupsMapping=WARN,console
log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.util.NativeCodeLoader=WARN,console
, The one time info messages are useful on servers, but DEBUG seems better suited for clients. What will be a sane and generic way to support this? Some are programmatically using hadoop client, bypassing the hadoop script, so tweaking the env vars within scripts won't cover all cases., There is no generic log level setting change that can satisfy all. With the current architecture, the only way of achieving this is to control it through config. So, it depends on the flexibility of deployment/installation method user is using. This can be done through passing HADOOP_*_OPS env vars. Or something like HADOOP-7814 could help supporting multiple config in a cluster. Since there is no code change for directly addressing this problem, I will close this.]
