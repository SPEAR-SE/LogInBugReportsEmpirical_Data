{noformat}

Is this correct? IIUC the point of calling the empty static method HdfsConfiguration#init is to force the jvm to load the HdfsConfiguration class (if it has not already) and therefore execute the static block (which is executed when the class is loaded, not when init() is invoked).  , Per Eli's feedback, updated comments to be more accurate., Thanks Jolly.  Do we need to call HdfsConfiguration#init in these n places to make sure it's loaded? If so, is there 1 place that would suffice?  The latest patch looks good, I'm just wondering if there's a better way to implement it.

This message is automatically generated., Unfortunately there isn't one central place that suffices. I think once HADOOP-7287 is fixed it will be less important to call this in every Tool. Also, in debugging HADOOP-7287 we just noticed that DistributedFileSystem doesn't instantiate HdfsConfiguration at all - so we'll have to add this there. For now, I'm all for being more cautious and having this in too-many spots rather than too-few.

bq. In terms of testing does the test in HADOOP-7287 fail w/o this patch and succeed with it?

This is just a cleanup JIRA. I'll open another one to make sure we initialize it in the right spots (DistributedFileSystem in particular), +1, bq. In terms of testing does the test in HADOOP-7287 fail w/o this patch and succeed with it?

The test case provided in the patch for HADOOP-7287 does not fail without this patch, since the bug here is really just that the calls to {{addDeprecation(...)}} never occur without this patch.

However, the manual test case described in HADOOP-7287 (i.e. `hadoop fs -Ddfs.blocksize=4096 -touchz f1 ;  hadoop fs -stat "%o" f1') does indeed fail without this patch, but succeed with it. I just tested this manually., Sorry, that should've been `hadoop fs -Ddfs.block.size=4096 -touchz f1 ; hadoop fs -stat "%o" f1', It turns out that I was wrong about this just being a cleanup JIRA. It in fact fixes a bug since a couple of the cases that loaded the DFS configs didn't set up the deprecations. I committed it to trunk and 22 and made the commit message reflect this fact.
