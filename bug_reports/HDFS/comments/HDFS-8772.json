This message was automatically generated., Hey Walter, the DN will send FBRs on startup right? It looks like the issue in the test is a race condition where the DN have registered but not FBR'd; could we wait for that startup FBR rather than manually triggering a new one? Seems more realistic., Thanks [~andrew.wang] for review!
>... could we wait for that startup FBR...
That's also my first thought. But how much time should it wait? I think it should wait more than the interval of heartBeat.

Uploaded 02 patch.

Also I'm thinking add a helper function later, in MiniCluster to wait for first BR.  sleep 200ms every test, just like waitActive() does. Because sleeping a rough number of time( for example, sleep 2000ms) is kind of wasting time., Hey Walter,

We have this function FSNamesystem#getNumStaleStorages() which I think does what we need, see also DatanodeStorageInfo#areBlockContentsStale(). I think we could use GenericTestUtils#waitFor to wait for this to hit 0, waitFor is similar to your idea about polling every 200ms., \\

I think we could use GenericTestUtils#waitFor to wait for this to hit 0, waitFor is similar to your idea about polling every 200ms.
A quickly restarted DN doesn't affect them. GenericTestUtils is very helpful.
I checked DatanodeDescriptor#updateRegInfo(DatanodeID). I think we can utilize blockReportCount.

This message was automatically generated., LGTM, just one q, should we bump up the waitFor to be less aggressive like 30s, and the overall test timeout from 60s to 120s? Test boxes can be overloaded at times and run slowly, so I'd like some more safety to avoid flakiness., Actual testcase may cost 4.4 sec, if jenkin machine overloaded, i think, only we can bump the wait time to 10 sec is sufficient., And I'm pretty sure waitFor 3s is enough. TestProcessCorruptBlocks even sleep 3s to wait full BR. I changed it to 10s to make sure, according to [~brahmareddy]'s comment., \\

This message was automatically generated., Sure, the point of test timeouts is more so the build doesn't hang for hours, not to be particularly stringent about them. Anyways thanks for the work here all, I'll commit shortly., Ran into some issues backporting to branch-2, [~walter.k.su] mind preparing another patch for branch-2? We conflict a bit with HDFS-6440 in MiniDFSCluster, hoping we can fix by including some of those refactors., Upload a patch for branch-2. Thanks [~andrew.wang] for take care of that., \\
