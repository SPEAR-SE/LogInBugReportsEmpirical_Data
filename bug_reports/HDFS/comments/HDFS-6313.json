[In 2.4.0 it is {{DFSUtil.resolveWebHdfsUri()}}. In trunk, it is {{WebHdfsFileSystem#resolveNNAddr()}.  They all obtain NN addresses by calling {{DFSUtil.getAddresses()}}, which gets all NN http addresses from all known name services. If multiple name services are configured, {{WebHdfsFileSystem}} can use a wrong NN., The patch makes WebHdfsFileSystem extract the only entry that matches the logical name. The new test case demonstrates the bug., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good.  Should the test clone the conf for the client before injecting another logical name to ensure it doesn't cause side-effects in the minicluster?, MiniDFSCluster or NN does not alter the config after its up. It was a easy way to get HA config set up for the test., +1 I see.  It's just client usage of the config so it's ok., Committed to branch-2, branch-2.4 and trunk.
