Besides, we can leave the unit test fix till the end (i.e., after finishing most of the functionalities), bq.we can leave the unit test fix till the end
I'm a little concerned about this. If we have some tests that are not appropriate to run right now, we should disable them. Otherwise, it's hard to monitor new test failures caused by new changes. For example, we're working on using EC schema, which may introduce new failures., Thanks for the comments, Kai. I'm not saying we do not need to fix the bugs during the development. Actually the nightly run is setup to help us to identify bugs.

Currently my only concern is that we do not need to create a jira for each small test failure fix. Too many jiras make it hard to follow the current development progress. I guess what we can do is to combine several small bug fixes together., Thanks for your clarifying. I see your points.
bq.we do not need to create a jira for each small test failure fix
I agree if those failures are related or coupled together. If not relevant to each other, I thought it's a good practice to do so. It's easy to fix each one of them more quickly.
bq.Too many jiras make it hard to follow the current development progress.
May I understand this as, "too many sub-task jiras under the master jira"? If so I agree. We could even remove those sub-task jiras just for tests from the master jira, to make it clean. ]
