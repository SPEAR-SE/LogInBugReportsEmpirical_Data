[[~andrew.wang],

Take a look at the attached diffs and see if you like the wording.
, This is a nice improvement! It'll reduce duplication and ease any updates we need to make.

* In some places, it'd be nice to keep a little more. For example, in setXAttr, we could keep the "namespace.name" example but still keep it generic, i.e.

bq. The name must be prefixed with the namespace followed by "." For example, "user.attr".

Another example of something we might want to keep (noticed you kept it sometimes and not in others):

{noformat}
-   * Only those xattrs for which the logged-in user has permissions to view
-   * are returned.
{noformat}

* I'd like it if it said "HDFS extended attributes user documentation".
* ClientProtocol also has similar redundancy we can remove, devs can refer to the user documentation too :)

Thanks Charles :), Forgot, AbstractFileSystem could use the same treatment as well., Thanks for the review [~andrew.wang],

I debated about whether to take out the "Only those xattrs..." bits. I agree they should stay in.

I think AFS was in the first diff, but I can see how one's eyes would glaze over and miss it.

The .002 should address everything.
