[[~rusanu], thank you for reporting this.  The CMake build defaults to release mode, and in this mode, it assumes you don't want a pdb.  CMake however also emits an alternative build configuration named RelWithDebInfo that is a release-mode build, but with generation of a pdb.  This is a trivial fix to switch over to using the RelWithDebInfo configuration.  The only other thing I needed to tweak was that RelWithDebInfo also turns on incremental linking, which we don't use in hadoop-common.  For consistency, I've overridden this to false., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
