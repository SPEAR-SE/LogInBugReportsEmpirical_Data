[Trivial patch should fix the issue. I'll verify with an HLog benchmark on a cluster as well.

This is definitely correct since the method is just a one-line call to another method which is unsynchronized., Verified that this increased my benchmark performance by a factor of two., Ah, so this explains what you guys thought might be an interaction with Nagle?, +1 pending Jenkins. , -1 overall.

Yep, turned out to be much simpler :)

The patch failed on Hudson due to HDFS-3034 having removed the deprecated method. I'll commit this based on Aaron's +1 and based on my manual stress testing using HBase's HLog class, which uses this method.

No unit tests since it's hard to unit test for performance, and the hflush equivalent is already tested by TestMultithreadedHflush, Committed to branch-2 (as noted above, this problem isn't present in trunk since sync() was removed).

Thanks also to Matteo Bertozzi and Jon Hsieh for their help tracking this issue down.]
