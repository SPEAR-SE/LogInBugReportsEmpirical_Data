[Weiyan, could you look into the findbugs warnings at some point?  Thanks!, sure. , Hi Weiyan,

What's the ETA on this? These are causing jenkins to -1 other changes like HDFS-3641 that update the raid code.

Also per Jason's comment on MR-3868 TestRaidNode consistently fails. I filed HDFS-3648 for this.

Thanks,
Eli, RAID was removed. Closing as not a problem.]
