[Same is true of several test cases in TestHDFSFileContextMainOperations, Patch attached.  Simple change, I verified by running TestFcHdfsSymlink., +1, lgtm, though not sure why the patch adds {{throws IOException}} on those getter methods. Fine with me if you just fix that on commit (no need to reupload), Thanks Todd.  The abstract method they override throws IOException since the local fs versions can throw an IOException (they construct a path to create the base directory and that can cause an exception)., +1 looks good., Thanks Cos. I committed this.]
