[You can enable this through config. Here is an example:
{noformat}
dfs.client.retry.policy.enabled=true
dfs.client.retry.policy.spec=1000,2
{noformat}, [~kihwal] In the case ,it's should reconnect irrespective of retry policy maybe better. 
And the *_ConnectTimeoutException_* not handle by _MultipleLinearRandomRetry_ retry policy., As default behavior,why found host is changed,but do nothing.it's unreasonable,and we can't release very corrected configuration for every client.  [~kihwal], This problem also occurs in ResourceManager. 
I think this issue seems to fit the hadoop common jira.
, at least,should config dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts=1 as default by not 0]
