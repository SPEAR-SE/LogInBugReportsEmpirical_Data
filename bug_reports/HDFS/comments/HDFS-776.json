This message is automatically generated., > 3. Throwable is not caught. It should be caught at the top level and kill the Balancer server process.

I disagree since balancer supports multiple namenodes.  If a balancer is working with NN1, then failing updating the keys with NN2 should not stop NN1's work.

How about throwing an exception in getAccessToken(..) when it is called?  We may set shouldRun to false in run() and the check shouldRun in getAccessToken(..)., Yep, considering multiple Namenodes support in Balancer today, your points make sense to me.

{quote}
this proposal sounds good. Let me take a look.
, Attached the patch. getAccessToken will check about shouldRun flag and handle throwable outside and sets the shouldRun flag to false instead of shutdown.
Test: ran the all balancer tests to check this is not effecting., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Oops. its my mistake. sorry, In previous patch i made that as IOException. In current one only forgot to change :(. Thanks a lot for noticing.I have updated it.
