[First off, please do not use the JIRA as a Q&A medium. The HDFS project provides and maintains a development list at hdfs-dev@hadoop.apache.org you should mail to with such questions. Only file valid issues on the JIRA please.

Onto your question, HDFS has no random-write features, it does not support it yet, hence there exists no API. If you plan to add such a feature, a design document for your implementation idea and discussion on the hdfs-dev@ lists is very welcome. Merely adding an API will not solve this - you will need to understand why its a limitation at the architecture level currently first.

Resolving as invalid. Please use lists for general Q&A.]
