[I vote we just move these "unit" tests back into the main tree, and use junit 4.5 category annotations to mark the ones that are true unit tests. Surefire 2.11 supports test categories via http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SUREFIRE-329 so if we upgrade to that build we can still have a separate target for the unit tests., oops, I realized I already filed this, see HDFS-2276.]
