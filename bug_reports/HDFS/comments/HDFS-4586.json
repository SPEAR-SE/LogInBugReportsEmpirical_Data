[Seems to be a regression introduced with HADOOP-8973. TestDataDirs mocks based on the previous implementation of DiskChecker#checkDir. This seems to be breaking the layering of projects, and to prevent this from happening, I will mock DiskChecker#checkDir instead. Will post a patch for this soon. Please comment if you think differently.
, Thank you, Ivan.  Sounds like a good plan., Thanks, although I'm not sure if mocking of a static method is feasible in mockito :(, Attaching the patch.

The current version of mockito used in Hadoop does not support mocking of static methods. There is some controversy of adding this support in general (as discussed in HADOOP-8973) so this was not an option. Instead I abstracted out of DiskChecker static method into a wrapper object that allowed me to mock.

I believe this satisfies both the layering issue I mentioned above and is in line with guidelines around mocking. The downside is the additional of the new wrapper helper class. Please comment if you have suggestions for improvement., I really appreciate you picking up this fix so quickly.  :-)

{code}
    public DataNodeDiskChecker(FsPermission expectedPermission) {
    }
{code}

It looks like the constructor forgot to initialize expectedPermission.  I added {{this.expectedPermission = expectedPermission;}} before I tested the patch.  I verified that it was successful on both Mac and Windows.

If you can upload a new patch with that small change, then I am +1.  I agree with the approach.

Thanks again!
