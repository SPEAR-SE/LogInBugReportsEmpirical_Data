, I'm flagging this as a blocker for 2.8.0, because it's a regression.  [~raviprak], [~wheat9] and [~ozawa], would you remind code reviewing the patch since you have the prior context from participating on HDFS-9084?  Thank you., Thanks for the fix Brahma and for pointing me to the issue Chris. I was trying to slip this fix in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7987 . +1 . LGTM. Will commit shortly, I've committed this to branch-2.8, branch-2 and trunk. Thanks a lot Brahma, Chris and everyone., [~raviprak], thank you!, Thanks [~raviprak] for commit and thanks [~cnauroth] for taking care this issue.., FYI for git log greppers, this one is missing the JIRA #., Yupp. Sorry about that. I forgot initially and then didn't want to rewrite history :(]
