[Assigning it to myself if no one has issues. Will come up with patch soon., The intermittent timeout happens only in scenarios when due to race condition the executor service is shutdown even before the LatchedCheckable#check is called. In this scenario the interrupt call by the shutdown method is ignored and the FutureTask#get in the  line {code} assertFalse(olf.get().get()); {code} never sees that the executor service is shutdown and even misses the interrupt call. This causes the FutureTask#get to loop through indefinitely if the waittimeout is not specified. 

To fix this before we call shutdown on executor service we make sure the thread performing the call on LatchedCheckable#check is called using countdownlatch startedSignal (refer to patch) and then proceed with shutdown. This ensures that the interrupt call by the shutdown on executor service is never missed.

Attached is the patch for trunk. Please let me know any suggestions.]
