[Thanks [~tlipcon] for filing this. I saw the same error message and was surprised initially. But after reviewing the log, I arrived at the same conclusion that this is a harmless error message.

I think we can remove this error message when the replica is in finalized state (which indicates the recovery is done by another recovery attempt), Yep, if my memory from 5 years ago serves me correctly, we can just remove the error, or at least the "THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN" part :)]
