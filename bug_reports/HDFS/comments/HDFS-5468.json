[Attached a patch that avoids remixing leading hyphens on the input command, so getting help usage works when executing something like _hdfs cacheadmin -help -addPool_. Added a unit test to exercise the cacheadmin help command.

Added the -path specifier to the help usage of the removeDirectives command., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
