[Downgrade actually can be done in a rolling fashion as shown in HDFS-7230.  So the "-rollingUpgrade downgrade" startup option is indeed not very useful.  I suggest removing it., [~szetszwo] Hi Nicholas. I want to work on this ticket. Can you assign this issue to me? Thank you., [~szetszwo] I understand the background of this ticket, so I'd like to confirm what I should do here.
1. Remove "-rollingUpgrade downgrade" option from namenode startup
2. Update documentations about this option.
Is this right?, Yes.  We should print a warning message when "-rollingUpgrade downgrade" is used.  The message could simply point to the documentation., I removed rollingUpgrade downgrade option and update documents.
Please review it. Thank you., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Yes, we should remove all dependencies since "-rollingUpgrade downgrade" is no longer a valid option., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
