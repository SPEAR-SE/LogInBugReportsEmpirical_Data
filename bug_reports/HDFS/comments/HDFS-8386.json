This message was automatically generated., I haven't included unit test case as this is minor code refactoring. Also, test case failures are unrelated to the patch. Could some one help to review the proposed changes. Thanks!, Patch looks good thanks for working on this Rakesh. One question: should we take this opportunity to tighten the visibility of {{streamer}} to private?

+1 pending though, Thank you [~andrew.wang] for the interest.

{{streamer}} is used by the erasure coding element [DFSStripedOutputStream.java#L283|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/HDFS-7285/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/DFSStripedOutputStream.java#L283]. Considering this usage, can we keep the visibility same as {{protected}}. But I feel it is possible to to make the visibility to {{private}}, following is one proposal to make it {{private}}. I hope the below code snippet will be helpful to know about the proposed changes. If you agree I'm happy to do the changes accordingly. Any thoughts?
# Expose update and getter API in DFSOutputStream.java:
{code}
  protected synchronized void updateStreamer(DataStreamer streamer) {
    this.streamer = streamer;
  }

  protected synchronized DataStreamer getStreamer() {
    return streamer;
  }
{code}
# Modify the logic to access {{streamer}} in DFSStripedOutputStream.java like,
{code}
  private synchronized StripedDataStreamer getCurrentStreamer() {
    return (StripedDataStreamer)super.getStreamer();
  }

  private synchronized StripedDataStreamer setCurrentStreamer(int i) {
    super.updateStreamer(streamers.get(i));
    return getCurrentStreamer();
  }
{code}, Thanks [~rakeshr] for the update. I like the getter and setter proposal #1, it seems cleaner. Could we name it setStreamer instead of updateStreamer too, to follow the normal naming convention? Otherwise LGTM., Thanks [~andrew.wang]. I've uploaded another patch by exposing setter/getter APIs., \\

, In trunk, the streamer synchronization bug does not exist since streamer is only initialized in constructors.  

Also, simply replacing streamer with getStreamer() may not be really fix synchronization bugs if there is any.  For example, in adjustChunkBoundary() below, would it work if getStreamer() returns a different object each time?
{code}
   protected void adjustChunkBoundary() {
-    if (streamer.getAppendChunk() &&
-        streamer.getBytesCurBlock() % bytesPerChecksum == 0) {
-      streamer.setAppendChunk(false);
+    if (getStreamer().getAppendChunk() &&
+        getStreamer().getBytesCurBlock() % bytesPerChecksum == 0) {
+      getStreamer().setAppendChunk(false);
       resetChecksumBufSize();
     }
 
-    if (!streamer.getAppendChunk()) {
-      int psize = Math.min((int)(blockSize- streamer.getBytesCurBlock()),
+    if (!getStreamer().getAppendChunk()) {
+      int psize = Math.min((int)(blockSize- getStreamer().getBytesCurBlock()),
           dfsClient.getConf().getWritePacketSize());
       computePacketChunkSize(psize, bytesPerChecksum);
     }
{code}

I suggest revert the committed patch since it may potentially hide some synchronization bugs in the HDFS-7285 branch.
, It is fine to do refactoring in trunk.  However, I think we should remove “synchronized" from getStreamer() since it may unnecessarily block the caller and, as a result, slow down write performance in trunk.

Let's also remove setStreamer(..) which is currently not used.  We may add it in the HDFS-7285 branch and see how to do synchronization correctly., Thank you [~szetszwo] for the detailed explanation. I got your point. How about raising a trivial improvement jira task and put a patch over there to do the suggested changes in trunk?. Also, I've raised HDFS-8550 separate jira to correct the synchronization part in HDFS-7285 branch., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8032 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8032/])
