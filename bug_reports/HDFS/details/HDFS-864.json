I found these deadlocks using jcarder, which works at runtime to detect lock order inversions with a bit of overhead. I had to make a few changes to jcarder ( http://github.com/toddlipcon/jcarder/tree/cloudera ) but at this point it's very effective for this and doesn't require any extra development effort. Once those changes get incorporated into a jcarder release, I hope to get it integrated into the Hudson test-patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-01-04T20:59:53.612+0000","updated":"2010-01-04T20:59:53.612+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444319/comment/12885162","id":"12885162","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slukog","name":"slukog","key":"slukog","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gokul","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\nsince the 0.20 versions doesn't have the attemptRestoreRemovedStorage() method in FsImage, i think the there is no possibility for deadlock in 0.20.1 or 0.20.2 .
