I am unsure of what fd exhaustion means (is it hitting nofile limits?),....\n\nYes. In a very big cluster, we've seen NN running out of 64K file descriptors. I was told that it can be raised further (e.g. 1M) without much negative impact on performance, at least on Linux. So there are ways to avoid it or minimize the possibility, but NN still needs to be able to deal with the situation.\n\nMonitoring and limiting number of connections can be tricky. Ideally we want the average number to be reasonable, but also want NN to absorb a short burst of requests instead of rejecting them. The client-side retry mechanism will require some changes, if IPC start actively rejecting requests. The things get very nasty if IPC connections get \"reset\" or fall into syn backlog and stay there for long. Massive lease renewal failures will likely occur and that will cause block recoveries and so on. In short, protecting namenode might be simple, but that sometimes actually hurt cluster availability.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-28T22:24:29.724+0000","updated":"2012-11-28T22:24:29.724+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618061/comment/13506041","id":"13506041","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Attached patch is the \"quick death\" fix for branch-0.23.

The exception was sent back to the caller, but no action was taken locally. From this point on, the edit log state is  BETWEEN_LOG_SEGMENTS and no further rolling was allowed because endCurrentLogSegment() fails. But logSync() and logEdit() went on as if nothing is wrong.\n\nTrunk does not have this issue. In {{mapJournalsAndReportErrors()}}, if a journal marked as required fails, namenode will terminate. But if none is marked required, it will simply throw an exception even if all journals fail. But logSync() will log FATAL and terminate since JournalSet#isEmpty() works diferently in trunk.\n\nIn branch-0.23, FSEditLog maintains a list of journals. logSync() invokes isEmpty(), but it won't check the validity of journals in the list. Instead it checks one by one in a loop. Although it already has a logic for counting and disabling bad journals, there is nothing equivalent to the resource availability check in trunk/branch-2.  I think the best place to add this is {disableAndReportErrorOnJournals()}. This will make the failure behavior almost same as what is already implemented in truck/branch-2.\n\nThis issue does not exit in branch-1, where rollEditLog() clears {{editStreams}} before creating new edit files. Since it calls {{exitIfNoStreams()}} before returning, namenode will terminate if no edit stream was successfully created.\n\nAs for test cases, trunk already has TestEditLogJournalFailures.
