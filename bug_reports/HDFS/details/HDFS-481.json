Is there another way to detect/prevent it, other than (what looks like) taking a configurable string and hard-coding a check for it?\n\nThe rest of the changes look reasonable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-08-24T05:15:05.044+0000","updated":"2009-08-24T05:15:05.044+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429983/comment/12746789","id":"12746789","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

That happens if the forwarding servlet could not find the matching servlet to forward request to. \n\nFor instance, if the user request path is /hadoop20 and hadoop20.war does not exist under the same webapps/ folder as the ROOT.war, what the forwarding servlet will do (through ServletContext.getContext()) in this case is to match the longest path. Since it could not find /hadoop20, it will match against its parent path /, which matches to ROOT.war, the forwarding servlet itself, then it causes an infinite loop, finally causing java.lang.StackOverflowError to be thrown. \n\nI've thought of using logic curContext.getServletContextName().equals(dstContext.getServletContextName()) to tell, but it will break the unit test.  Since cactus unit test framework won't be able to do cross context forwarding at this stage yet. All forwarding occurs in the same context.  In that case, ServletContext.getContext() would always return the same context. the unit test would stuck there. \n\nI couldn't think any other ways to work around this at this stage. Do you have any better ideas?\n\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhiyong1","name":"zhiyong1","key":"zhiyong1","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhiyong zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-08-24T17:49:04.972+0000","updated":"2009-08-24T17:49:04.972+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429983/comment/12747649","id":"12747649","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. I couldn't think any other ways to work around this at this stage.

Is it difficult to restrict the set of valid targets to exclude the current servlet? If nothing else, looking up (rather than hard-coding) the servlet name strikes me as a minimum requirement. This can't possibly be an issue unique to hdfsproxy; is there a canonical approach that doesn't work with its requirements?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-08-25T21:14:26.192+0000","updated":"2009-08-25T21:14:26.192+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429983/comment/12847319","id":"12847319","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sriksun","name":"sriksun","key":"sriksun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853"},"displayName":"Srikanth Sundarrajan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"HDFS-481 patch includes the following fixes\n\n* LdapIpDirFilter broken into LdapIpDirFilter for authentication and AuthorizationFilter for authorization. \n* KerberosAuhoriztionFilter extends AuthorizationFilter - to be used again kerberos based hadoop secure version\n* Infinite redirection addressed by checking the servlet context object instead of the names\n* Acting on behalf of the requesting user using UGI.createProxyUser (hdfsproxy runs as a trusted super user)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sriksun","name":"sriksun","key":"sriksun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853"},"displayName":"Srikanth Sundarrajan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-03-19T11:23:11.562+0000","updated":"2010-03-19T11:23:11.562+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429983/comment/12847320","id":"12847320","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sriksun","name":"sriksun","key":"sriksun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853"},"displayName":"Srikanth Sundarrajan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"HDFS-481-bp-y20.patch and HDFS-481-bp-y20s.patch are backport patches.

ProxyFileDataServlet, ProxyListPathsServlet, ProxyFileForward - Use createProxyUser instead of createRemoteUser to obtain UGI for the requesting user, name.conf - context attribute is set by LdapIpDirFilter\n\n2. LdapIpDirFilter - Removed class members userId, groupName and Paths and these are now set for each request through LdapEntry (a private inner class)\n\n3. KerberosAuthorizationFilter - Accessing proxy user keytab file for credentials and initializing UGI\n\n4. LdapIpDirFilter + AuthorizationFilter -  Separated IP based authentication and path authorization into two independent filters. IP based authentication is done by LdapIpDirFilter and Path authroization is implemented through AuthorizationFilter.\n\n5. TestLdapIpDirFilter + TestAuthorizationFilter - IP based test cases retained in TestLdapIpDirFilter and path test cases are moved to TestAuthorizationFilter\n\n6. ProxyUtil - Added methods to create proxy user and getting namenode url from Hadoop configuration\n\n7. hdfsproxy-default.xml - Including new security related attributes\n\n8. tomcat-web.xml - Adding additional filter for Authroization. Allowing LdapIpDirFilter & KerberosAuthroizationFilter to be processed for forward and request methods \n\n9. build.xml - Including TestAuthroizationFilter for cactus based unit tests, Also increasing verbosity level for logs during build\n\n10. ProxyForwardServlet - Fix for infinite looping by verifying if the context is same as the current and aborting\n\n11. TestProxyUtil & TestHdfsProxy - Fixes to get the tests to run\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sriksun","name":"sriksun","key":"sriksun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853"},"displayName":"Srikanth Sundarrajan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-03-29T10:35:24.199+0000","updated":"2010-03-29T10:35:24.199+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429983/comment/12850878","id":"12850878","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sriksun","name":"sriksun","key":"sriksun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sriksun&avatarId=18853"},"displayName":"Srikanth Sundarrajan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"{quote}\nIf it is not too hard, it would be great if you could separate the divide patch to some other issues like HDFS-1009.
