They have the same hues (ignoring the rounding), with different values of saturation and light. The intervals between them are identical to the ones on http://getbootstrap.com\n\nHue decides the primary color (i.e., green, yellow, orange). Green is chosen because the color theory suggests that green color gives an impression of stability and relaxation. Another reason is that from the HCI prospective, cold color schemes (e.g., green / blue backgrounds + white text) usually have good visibility on computer screens.\n\nIt is usually easy to see some code is better than the other, but it is subjective and subtle to tell which color is superior. I'm pretty open on what color schemes should be used in the UI, and I understand everybody has his / her favorite colors and I fully respect their choices. I sincerely appreciate putting the time to reasoning about the changes from the HCI prospective so that the end-users can have the best experience.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-30T07:29:01.103+0000","updated":"2014-01-30T07:29:01.103+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12692193/comment/13886355","id":"13886355","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stack","name":"stack","key":"stack","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stack","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This is green, as it was, only darkened so it is away from the problematic part of the green spectrum.

Thanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stack","name":"stack","key":"stack","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stack","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-30T16:10:01.612+0000","updated":"2014-01-30T16:10:01.612+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12692193/comment/13886844","id":"13886844","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I've uploaded color-rationale.png to visualize the intervals of the original color scheme.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-30T18:06:01.305+0000","updated":"2014-01-30T18:06:01.305+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12692193/comment/13886984","id":"13886984","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"(Disclaimer: I'm not an HCI expert, so please see the comments where it fits.)\n\nAs I have said, the preferences of colors are highly subjective. Every people have their own interpretations of colors. It is understandable that people (especially software engineers like us) associate a particular color to the logos they see everyday.\n\nHowever, I suspect that the end-users (which are a much wider audiences) generally share the same interpretations as we had here. Therefore, if I had to choose some color for the UI I would start with two things in mind:\n\n# The impressions of the colors of general populations, which are throughly studied in arts and architectures for centuries (e.g., green -> stability, red -> attacking, orange -> hot)\n# The color intervals chosen by one of the most popular front-end framework (i.e. bootstrap). The theory behind it has been quantitively studied for about 50 years \\[1\\].\n\nAfter that you'll need to balance the style, visibility, etc.\n\nThe original color is chosen to balance the visibility of the texts and the dropdown icon. Both of them can have two different colors with different lightness. The color harmony for all these cases \\[2\\] is achieved only through multiple trails. What I have learned so far is that the subtle issues do matter -- therefore I respect the ones that can get the issues right (like Bootstrap) and follow their leads.\n\nAs I have said, I understand everybody has his / her own favorite color. My focus here is to promote the reasoning behind the choices. I'm pretty open to the color schemes for the UI. I'm okay on changing the color if someone raises the concern that the colors can be misinterpreted -- as long as the choice that has been well thought through.\n\nPicking the politically correct color, however, is not my focus and I sincerely believe that it should not be the focus of this jira either.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Not sure how to react.  That color is subjective I 'know' instinctively and this subjectivity is recognized and is at the root of the original question asked by me out on the mailing list where I solicit if I am the only one having the reaction that, \"these colors seem way to close to the signature HWX colors\".   It seemed to me like a pretty basic question and it shouldn't take color theory making an answer.\n\nWhile you might ask that we avoid 'political correctness', as you call it, we do have an obligation to keep our work conflict-free, even though it require that we operate in areas in which we are inexpert: design or 'branding', to name two pertinent domains here.\n\nLet me close this issue as LATER.  Here is why:\n\nMy original question gleaned one direct answer only if I am making a proper accounting and though the judgement was passed on a low-fidelity copy, a PNG screen shot, the opinion was similar to what I had posited, that the banner color is 'darker' (I'll not infer any more than this).  My survey out on the mailing list has been distorted so I do not expect any more opinions to come in via that channel.  Asking the question here a few more times has not elicited any additional opinions.  I'm not in the game of committing patches unless clean agreement.  That is lacking here.\n\nLet me also close this issue because this arena is a minefield whether it is engineers making design choices (though I like the orange too and counting my vote, it has 4x+1) but also, this is a minefield in that we do not yet seem up to talking about the issue in a civil manner.\n\nFinally I'm closing this issue because I don't care that much about the color, whether or which, not enough to drive further along this contrib.  I was just wondering...\n\nThis issue has been good in that the provenance of the chosen color has been surfaced and can be put under the nose of anyone who might have my reaction in the future.  I also now know who I need to consult when color stumped going forward.\n\nThanks all for your contribs here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stack","name":"stack","key":"stack","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stack","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-30T20:31:43.142+0000","updated":"2014-01-30T20:31:43.142+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12692193/comment/13887557","id":"13887557","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Just to show how *inane* this is jira is, here are the colors measurements of Hortonwork's green, Cloudera Blue, and the original color using Mac's digital color meter:\n\n|| Attribute || Hortonworks Green || HDFS Color || Cloudera Blue ||\n| L | 69.52 | 33.94 | 34.4 |\n| A | -44.68 | -22.34 | -17.68 |\n| B | 60.91 | 26.88 | -19.98 |\n\nso Hortonworks Green - HDFS Color = 35.58 + 22.34 + 34.03 = 91.95\nand Cloudera Blue - HDFS Color = 0.46 + 4.66 + 46.86 = 51.98\n\nClearly we need to make the color greener to denote additional stability.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-31T07:56:22.155+0000","updated":"2014-01-31T07:58:31.550+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12692193/comment/13888089","id":"13888089","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cos","name":"cos","key":"cos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741"},"displayName":"Konstantin Boudnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Well, I am not even sure why the colors are set by PNG background file to start with.
