Most people don't keep careful track of how many blocks they scan each time the scanner runs, and would not have a clear idea of how to adjust it.  I can also see some people setting this incorrectly and ending up with a cluster where the block scanner falls further and further behind, and 99% of the blocks on the DN are never scanned.\n\nRather than introducing another configuration parameter, how about simply not adding the new blocks to the existing scan?  Perhaps {{BlockPoolScanner#addBlock}} could add the block to a secondary map that would get dumped into the main map when the current scan had terminated.  This way, scan() will always return at some point, when the current blocks are done, even if new blocks have been created.  The main point of the block scanner is to scan older blocks we haven't touched in weeks, not to re-read stuff we just wrote, so this seems like a better behavior anyway.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
