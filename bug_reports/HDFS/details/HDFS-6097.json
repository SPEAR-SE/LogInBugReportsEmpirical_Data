The value of curPos is never changed throughout the method, so it's always the same as pos. This is a synchronized method, so I don't expect pos to get mutated on a different thread.\n\nThis is actually an optimization I made.  I wanted to avoid making a memory access each time, since I use this variable a lot.  By copying it to a local variable, it becomes a lot more obvious to the optimizer that it can't change.  It's possible that Java will perform this optimization automatically, but I'm skeptical because we're calling a lot of functions here.  It seems like it would require a sophisticated optimizer to realize that there was no code path that changed this variable.\n\nbq. TestEnhancedByteBufferAccess: Let's remove the commented out lines and the extra indentation on the Assert.fail line.\n\nOK.\n\nbq. Let's use try-finally blocks to guarantee cleanup of cluster, fs, fsIn and fsIn2.\n\nI guess I've started to skip doing this on unit tests.  My rationale is that if the test fails, cleanup isn't really that important (the surefire process will simply terminate).  In the meantime, try... finally blocks complicate the code and often make it hard to see where a test originally failed.  Oftentimes if things get messed up, {{FileSystem#close}} or {{MiniDFSCluster#shutdown}} will throw an exception.  And you end up seeing this unhelpful exception rather than the root cause of the problem displayed in the maven test output.  On the other hand, I suppose going without try... finally could encourage people to copy flawed code, so I guess that's the counter-argument.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

This is actually an optimization I made.\n\nI see.  Thanks for explaining.  Would you mind putting a comment in there?\n\nbq. I guess I've started to skip doing this on unit tests.\n\nI got into the try-finally habit during the Windows work.  On Windows, we'd have one test fail and leave the cluster running, because it wasn't doing shutdown.  Then, subsequent tests also would fail during initialization due to the more pessimistic file locking behavior on Windows.  The prior cluster still held locks on the test data directory, so the subsequent tests couldn't reformat.  The subsequent tests would have passed otherwise, so this had the effect of disrupting full test run reports with a lot of false failures.  It made it more difficult to determine exactly which test was really failing.\n\nIf the stack traces from close aren't helpful, then we can stifle them by calling {{IOUtils#cleanup}} and passing a null logger.\n\nFWIW, my current favorite way to do this is cluster initialization in a {{BeforeClass}} method, cluster shutdown in an {{AfterClass}} method, and sometimes close of individual streams or file systems in an {{After}} method depending on what the test is doing.  This reigns in the code clutter of try-finally.  It's not always convenient though if you need to change {{Configuration}} in each test or if you need per-test isolation for some other reason.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-13T18:26:08.846+0000","updated":"2014-03-13T18:26:08.846+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12701101/comment/13933822","id":"13933822","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks, Colin.
