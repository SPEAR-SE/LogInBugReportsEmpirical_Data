Song","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"My initial solution\n\n1. As many other components may still refer to mkdirs (in Java sematic), let's keep it and create a new method called mkdir. The new \"mkdir\" will only create the specified directory *not including parents* so if all the parents don't exist, it will not allow you to create.\n\n2. This method is implemented at the NameNode side and requires a change in ClientProtocol. As a matter of fact, if I just use ClientProtocol.exist and ClientProtocol.mkdirs in combination to implement mkdir on the client side it is possible but that incurs a bit more round-trip operations. I think I can only spend a bit more time to make it better so let's go for the better one.\n\n3. You will have to hook up the new mkdir method in DFSClient to fix HADOOP-2391. What I do now to demonstrate the difference is just hooking up the mkdir method to  mkdir in the shell and move the old mkdir implementation (which actually is mkdirs in Java) to mkdirs\n\nSo in the shell,\nhadoop dfs -mkdir  <dir>                  will not create parent dirs\nhadoop dfs -mkdirs <dir>                 will create all the parents\n\n4. In the current implementation if you mkdir a directory which already exists, there will be no error message. This has to be fixed too.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pi_song","name":"pi_song","key":"pi_song","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pi Song","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-02-08T14:45:30.748+0000","updated":"2008-02-08T14:45:30.748+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12387580/comment/12567055","id":"12567055","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pi_song","name":"pi_song","key":"pi_song","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pi Song","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The patch","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pi_song","name":"pi_song","key":"pi_song","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pi Song","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-02-08T14:46:55.526+0000","updated":"2008-02-08T14:46:55.526+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12387580/comment/12567082","id":"12567082","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
