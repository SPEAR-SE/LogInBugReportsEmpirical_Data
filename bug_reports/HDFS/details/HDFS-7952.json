ZKFCs were kept running/started already before re-starting NNs with rollback option.\n2. When the first NN1 was rolling back, it calls, \n              {{this.editLog.discardSegments(discardSegmentTxId)}}; to discard the extra edits added during upgrade.\n3. And NN1 becomes Active immediately.\n4. Now NN2 restarted with '-rollingUpgrade rollback' option, this also will try to call \n              {{this.editLog.discardSegments(discardSegmentTxId)}};  and it continues to start as STANDBY.\n5. Now even though there are no edits to clean in journal nodes, {{discardSegments(..)}} call from standby NN2 will change the epoch in journalnodes which results in Active shutdown.\n\nThere is two workaround for this, \n1.  keep ZKFC stopped until both namenodes are rolledback completely. This needs a document update.\n2. Another way is checking for extra segments in QuorumJournalManager itself before issueing discardSegments() call to journal nodes from standby NN. But in this case, there is a possibility that already rolled back Active NN might have created new segments, these can be deleted by StanbyNN.\nSo I will go with document update, i.e. *both ZKFCs should be started only after both NNs are rolled back\"\n\nAny thoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-04-10T05:36:42.924+0000","updated":"2015-04-10T05:36:42.924+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12782840/comment/14496864","id":"14496864","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Resolve as duplicate after HDFS-7934 got committed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-15T20:23:18.009+0000","updated":"2015-04-15T20:23:18.009+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-7952/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i26wvj:"}}
