When Standby NN receive the messages, it's actually aware of what message it received, but as time goes by, the messages may become stale due to DN reformatting. That's what you meant, right?\n\nNope, that's not what I was referring to. I was referring to why we queue messages in the first place in the standby NN. This happens because the standby NN is always a bit behind by the active in its knowledge of the namespace and set of blocks which exist, so when the active NN allocates new blocks the DNs will report things about these blocks to both NNs but the standby won't yet know about the existence of the blocks those messages refer to. In some sense these messages are from the future from the DN's perspective, so we queue them up.\n\nbq. Since the DN that the queued messages are associated with is reformatted, these queued messages become stale and useless, and can be safely removed, right? or my real question is, are there any messages that need to applied even after DN reformatting?\n\nNo, if the storage ID of the DN is changing, we should assume that the DN no longer has the blocks that these messages were previously referring to.\n\nbq. I found a util function in DatanodeUtil.java...\n\nOK, I'll make this change when I do the next rev of this patch.\n\nbq.
