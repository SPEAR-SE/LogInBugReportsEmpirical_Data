However, this approach isn't going to work here. The bash script execs java. That means that any bash commands after the exec are not relevant, since the bash process is replaced by the Java process. If you want a signal handler or an atexit handler, you need to do it from java.\n\nIMO, its no need to handle in start-$daemon.sh script or from java. Each daemon have its own stop script provided along with them. Better to handle removal of pid file corresponding to a daemon there.\nFor ex: For balancer, even if the balancer is running or exited after re-balancing, let the pid file there. On error, stop script can be called, which internally check for the pid file and corresponding command is running or not. If some other process is running with same pid as in pid file, instead of killing the other process, just can remove the pid file. \nCheck of whether the process is same as command we are trying to stop, can be checked, by checking the existence of {{-Dproc_balancer}} in command line.\n\nSince this general problem for all daemons.

At least in trunk (and maybe branch-2?), this code won't work. It needs to know the name of the pid file which, at least today, is controlled by the shell code\nThanks [~aw] for the comments.  AFAIK pid file pattern contains {{COMMAND}} part, in case of balancer the pid file name will be ending with  => {{balancer.pid}} string. In my patch, I've used {{FilenameFilter}} which will be filtering out the balancer file by searching {{filename.endsWith(\"balancer.pid\");}} file pattern under the {{HADOOP_PID_DIR}} directory.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-02-05T12:07:18.642+0000","updated":"2016-02-05T12:07:18.642+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771205/comment/15134449","id":"15134449","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"The bash code in trunk allows for major parts of it to be replaced by the user.
