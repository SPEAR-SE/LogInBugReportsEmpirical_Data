I tried to address HDFS-5939 by adding \"return null\"\nfrom within the chooseRandom mehtod. Thanks to [~wheat9] who suggested that we need to file this JIRA for callers of this method to \nbe aware of that the method could return null when reviewing my HDFS-5939 fix. While we are still discussing the best solution for \nHDFS-5939, it's likely we will replace the \"return null\" I added with throwing an exception.\n\nPrior to my change, the method chooseRandom already has a piece of code that returns null under certain condition, So this JIRA is \nstill valid in that sense. However, we haven't got any report of null value returned from that piece of code yet, probably we can keep \nthis JIRA open until we have a real case.  \n\nThanks.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-20T06:43:35.390+0000","updated":"2014-02-20T06:43:35.390+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12695868/comment/13906813","id":"13906813","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"The plan sounds reasonable.
