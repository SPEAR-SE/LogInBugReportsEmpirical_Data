This will log an OP_DELETE to the edit log.\n# Some error happens triggering pipeline recovery, which log an OP_UPDATE_BLOCKS to the edit log.\n\nThe reason it's possible for this to happen is basically because the {{updatePipeline}} RPC never checks if the file actually exists, but instead just finds the file INode based on the block ID being replaced in the pipeline. Later, when we're reading the {{OP_UPDATE_BLOCKS}} from the edit log, however, we try to find the file INode based on the path name of the file, which no longer exists because of the previous delete.\n\nIt's not entirely obvious to me what the right solution to this issue should be. It shouldn't be difficult to change the {{FSEditLogLoader}} to be able to read the {{OP_UPDATE_BLOCKS}} op if we just change it to look up the INode by block ID. On the other hand, however, I'm not entirely sure we should even be allowing this sequence of edit log ops in the first place. It doesn't seem unreasonable to me that we might check that the file actually exists in the present file system in the {{updatePipeline}} RPC call and throw an error if it doesn't, since continuing to write to a file that only exists in a snapshot doesn't make much sense. Along similar lines, it seems a little odd to me that an INode that only exists in the snapshot would continue to be considered under-construction, but perhaps that's not unreasonable in itself.\n\nWould love to hear others' thoughts on this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

Maybe here we should also fail the {{updatePipeline}} call to make it consistent?\n\nBut in the meanwhile, I think in the future it will be better to weaken the dependency between the states of blocks and files, e.g., letting RPC calls like {{updatePipeline}} only update and check the state of blocks. This can make work like separating block management out as a service (HDFS-5477) easier.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-09T17:55:24.210+0000","updated":"2014-07-09T17:55:24.210+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12726257/comment/14056773","id":"14056773","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"It is already checking if the file is deleted.

I agree with what everyone has said here.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, does it not seem strange to anyone that we allow the INode to still be considered under construction in a snapshot after it's been deleted from the present FS? I'm thinking that perhaps in addition to this change that Kihwal has in this patch we should make delete finalize the INode as well. I think that would've prevented this issue as well, since the current check in {{checkUCBlock}} would have failed. We could of course do that as a separate JIRA, or perhaps not at all if we think this is sufficient as-is.\n\nThe patch that Kihwal provided looks good to me. One small comment is that it'd be good to use {{GenericTestUtils#assertExceptionContains}} in the test case to ensure the correct exception is thrown, but that's pretty minor. +1 once that's addressed, either by changing the patch or by telling me I'm being too pedantic.\n\nKihwal - can I go ahead and assign this JIRA to you?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
