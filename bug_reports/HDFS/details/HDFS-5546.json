Think of the following interleaving:\n\n1. Eddy issues \"hadoop fs -ls -R /\"\n2. ls command calls {{listStatus( /)}} and gets back status_a, status_b, status_c\n3. ls command uses status_a to print out a line describing /a\n4. Colin removes directory a\n5. ls command calls {{listStatus(\"/a\")}}\n6. {{FileNotFoundException}} aborts the whole ls command.  Nothing else is printed.\n\nBasically, this makes the {{ls -R}} command unusable in situations where files are changing.  From a user's perspective, this just translates to \"{{ls -R}} is broken\" since you effectively can't really use it.\n\nbq. If you are trying to make ls always forge ahead when it gets FNF while in a subdir, that has some peril associated with it. What if the item being listed isn't what was deleted? What if an ancestor directory was deleted? Should ls keep pounding on the NN to list every directory it thinks should be there? And then as it ascends back up the tree should keep trying to list other siblings it thinks should be there?\n\nWe're never going to be able to provide a 100% consistent view of the filesystem via {{ls -R}}.  HDFS simply doesn't have a way of getting back a snapshot an entire subtree (well, except HDFS snapshots, which I think we can all agree are overkill here.).  You are going to need multiple calls to {{listDir}}, and things may change in between those calls.  These are just the facts of life, and something we have to accept.\n\nAfter all, we can't even get back a 100% consistent view of a single large directory via {{listStatus}}.  Large directories will need multiple {{listStatus}} RPC calls in between and something may have changed in between RPCs.  The {{/bin/ls}} command on UNIX has similar issues.  But clearly, despite the lack of snapshot consistency, people do find {{ls}} to be a useful command, though.\n\nUnless I'm missing something, there is no major harm if we just do forge ahead and try to call {{listStatus}} on subdirectories we retrieved from the previous {{listStatus}} call.  The worst that can happen is we try to list something that isn't there and get an FNF which we ignore.  We could also print out the FNFs, but I'm not sure what the user would do with this information.\n\nbq. This is not an acceptable patch. It's not ok to swallow the FNF and return a success exit code.\n\nWe still throw an FNF if the directory where {{ls -R}} starts doesn't exist.  It's just that we don't shut down the whole enterprise if something underneath that directory changes during our recursion.  Does that make sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think what Daryn is advocating is that when attempting to recurse into a directory, we should catch IOE for the {{listStatus}} operation, not just FNF.\n\nAlthough this makes sense to me, there is a bit of a fly in the ointment-- if we have a glob expression like {{/\\*/\\*}}, the Globber internally will throw an exception if there is a path error while resolving the globs.  For example, if you have {{/a/b/c}} and {{/a/r/c}}, and /a/r is inaccessible to you, {{ls /\\*/\\*/c}} will fail with an {{AccessControlException}} before displaying anything.\n\nThis behavior has existed basically forever in the globber code (it wasn't added by the globber rewrite) and unfortunately, there is no good way to fix it now.  The problem is that there is no way to indicate that we got an error other than throwing an exception, and an exception terminates the whole glob operation, even if there were other valid results.  So in the interest of consistency, perhaps we should keep things the way they are, and only catch FNF?  {{ls /a/b/c /a/r/c}} seems similar conceptually to {{ls /\\*/\\*/c}}... it is tricky to explain why an exception should terminate one but not the other...\n\nEddy, can you take a look at the internal JIRA that prompted this and see if it was user error?

Colin Patrick McCabe shouldn't the globStatus() be out of scope for this JIRA? Maybe we should open another related JIRA?\n\nI'm not sure how the globber would report IOE other than throwing it.  We'd have to return a list of {{Option<FileStatus, IOException>}} or something?
