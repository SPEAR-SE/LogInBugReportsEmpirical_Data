However, I got the following error:\n\nrefreshNamenodes: HA does not currently support adding a new standby to a running DN. Please do a rolling restart of DNs to reconfigure the list of NNs.\n\nI checked the 2.6.0 code and the error was thrown by the following code snippet, which led me to this JIRA.\n\nvoid refreshNNList(ArrayList<InetSocketAddress> addrs) throws IOException {\nSet<InetSocketAddress> oldAddrs = Sets.newHashSet();\nfor (BPServiceActor actor : bpServices)\n{ oldAddrs.add(actor.getNNSocketAddress()); }\nSet<InetSocketAddress> newAddrs = Sets.newHashSet(addrs);\nif (!Sets.symmetricDifference(oldAddrs, newAddrs).isEmpty())\n{ // Keep things simple for now -- we can implement this at a later date. throw new IOException( \"HA does not currently support adding a new standby to a running DN. \" + \"Please do a rolling restart of DNs to reconfigure the list of NNs.\"); }\n}\n\nLooks like this the refreshNameNodes command is an uncompleted feature. \n\nUnfortunately, the new name node on a replacement is critical for auto provisioning a hadoop cluster with HDFS HA support. Without this support, the HA feature could not really be used. I also observed that the new standby name node on the replacement instance could stuck in safe mode because no data nodes check in with it. Even with a rolling restart, it may take quite some time to restart all data nodes if we have a big cluster, for example, with 4000 data nodes, let alone restarting DN is way too intrusive and it is not a preferable operation in production. It also increases the chance for a double failure because the standby name node is not really ready for a failover in the case that the current active name node fails.

Unfortunately, DNS alias does not really work or comes with a very high maintenance cost in some scenarios when the cluster is not maintained by system admin, but by software such as the case of auto provisioning and managing Hadoop cluster in cloud.

There are cases the new name node becomes active and the HDFS clients are broken, but we more concern about the data nodes themselves for a long running cluster.
