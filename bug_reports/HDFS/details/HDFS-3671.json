Or as I suggested before, use a file stat (or simple HEAD request) if the content-length is missing?  The latter will prevent a minimum 200s tail on the transfers.\n\n(An http server is required to close the connection when a transfer lacks a content-length is complete in order to avoid this ambiguity on the client side.  However it's strongly advised not to leave out the header since the client doesn't know if it only received a partial download, hence my suggestion to fallback to size from a file stat.)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-07-17T14:15:17.866+0000","updated":"2012-07-17T14:15:17.866+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599005/comment/13416892","id":"13416892","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I believe we can safely remove Content-Length check in ByteRangeInputStream.
