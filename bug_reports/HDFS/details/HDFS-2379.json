What happens to cases when volumeMap contains block but scanned block File does not exist or scanned block file exists but volumeMap does not contain it?\n\nThe goal of this JIRA is to preserve the existing semantics - ie to produce an identical block report as to what would have been produced if the whole scan had happened while under the lock. So:\n\n- If the block is in memory, but not on disk, the block is not reported. Note that we re-check the existence on disk when we see this situation, to make sure it wasn't just that the block was added after the scan. This code path handles the case where an administrator accidentally rm -Rfs some blocks - we want to make sure they don't show up in the block report, so that the NN can re-replicate.\n- If the block is on disk, but not in memory, we do report it, but only after checking that it's still there (with the lock held).\nI've updated the comments in the code to clarify the above behaviors.\n\nIn the above cases, it might make some sense to actually update the in-memory map based on what was seen on disk. But, that would change the semantics, which would be harder to verify.\n\nbq. In the end, the scanned block info is made to look same as the in memory state. I am just wondering, what is the need of the scan then?\nThe scan is made to look the same as the disk state. Anything places where we see a diff vs memory, we then _recheck_ the disk for those blocks while holding the lock. So the semantics should be the same as before.\n\nWill upload another patch momentarily with the above fixes. I'll also run through a basic manual test scenario of rm -Rfing some blocks and making sure they get re-replicated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-10-11T19:28:40.738+0000","updated":"2011-10-11T19:28:40.738+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525031/comment/13125325","id":"13125325","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Updated patch. I ran a manual test with 4 datanodes where I inserted a few hundred blocks, then on one of the datanodes did \"rm blk_*\" in one of the data directories.
