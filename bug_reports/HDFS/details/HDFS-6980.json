I had a few review comments:\n\n* I agree it's generally good practice to wrap all resource usage with try/finally like this. However, I think in this particular case, a bunch of leaks are caused by not cleaning up after expected errors. Changing just these, and avoiding places where there is no leak as long the test passes, would make the patch a lot smaller.\n* While we're in this file, it'd be good to convert the static initializer into a @BeforeClass method, and cleanup in an @AfterClass.\n\nBesides that though, +1.
