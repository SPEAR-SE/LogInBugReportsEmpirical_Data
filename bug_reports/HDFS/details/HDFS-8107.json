I'm not saying we do not need to fix the bugs during the development.

Too many jiras make it hard to follow the current development progress.

It's easy to fix each one of them more quickly.\nbq.Too many jiras make it hard to follow the current development progress.\nMay I understand this as, \"too many sub-task jiras under the master jira\"?
