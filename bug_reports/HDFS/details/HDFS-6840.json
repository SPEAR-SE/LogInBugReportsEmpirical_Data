My impression of the old pseudo-sort was that it was deterministic. AFAIK there wasn't a Random doing a shuffle.\n\nI'm familiar with the block location selection and helped debug this issue.  As Jason points out, the sort result used to be the node-local, rack-local, off-rack, decommed.  If the the first location isn't node/rack local, then it picked a random off-rack.  The rest of the list, yes, was deterministic.\n\nbq.  in case there were any nice page cache effects from directing reads to the same replica.\n\nGetting crushed by thousands of off-rack requests ruins any benefit from the page cache.  At a minimum, the network interface will be saturated at which point choosing another random replica off-rack replica is faster.  Let's say the first node is \"bad\" because of the load or for other reasons.  All off-rack tasks will be slowed until they fail over to the next node, which again will be the another deterministic node, which may cause it to be considered \"bad\", repeat.\n\nEven on the same rack, I'm not sure there's a benefit to deterministically picking the same node.  There's generally only 2 replicas per rack.  If a large number of rack-local tasks start up then dividing the load between the two replicas probably has better performance.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-08-12T14:43:43.873+0000","updated":"2014-08-12T14:43:43.873+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12733370/comment/14094340","id":"14094340","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Alright, I'm sufficiently convinced :) Is the fix as simple as switching the param to true?
