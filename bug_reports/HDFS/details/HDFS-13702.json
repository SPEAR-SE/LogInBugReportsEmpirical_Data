I recently worked on adding OpenTracing support to the HMS (HIVE-19685). I think we could do the same here. That said, regardless of trace framework, I think we can all agree that the current code path is too expensive as written today. I don't have time to do the heavy lifting of moving entirely to some new tracing framework, so in the meantime I think we should fix this perf issue by removing this heavy code path. I didn't remove all the other FS-operation-level trace annotations (eg open/close/listStatus/etc) since those are likely to be less high throughput and therefore overhead not an issue.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2018-06-27T20:25:55.715+0000","updated":"2018-06-27T20:25:55.715+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13168419/comment/16525612","id":"16525612","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stack","name":"stack","key":"stack","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stack","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
