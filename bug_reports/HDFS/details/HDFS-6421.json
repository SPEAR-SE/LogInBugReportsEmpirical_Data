P. McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I've actually never heard of anyone deploying Hadoop on RHEL4 (when it was released in 2005, Hadoop didn't exist).  However, I did manage to track down a RHEL4 virtual machine and try to compile.  I noticed that a bunch of stuff didn't work, not only {{vecsum}}.  For example, you get this error when building YARN:\n\n{code}\n     [exec] libcontainer.a(container-executor.c.o)(.text+0x593): In function `mkdirs':\n     [exec] /home/cmccabe/hadoop/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/native/container-executor/impl/container-executor.c:378: undefined reference to `mkdirat'\n     [exec] libcontainer.a(container-executor.c.o)(.text+0x5b4):/home/cmccabe/hadoop/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/native/container-executor/impl/container-executor.c:387: undefined reference to `openat'\n{code}\n\nIt's going to be tough to \"fix\" this since RHEL4 just doesn't have big pieces of necessary functionality, like cgroups.\n\nMaybe this is a dumb question on my part, but I wonder if compiling without {{Pnative}} is a possibility for you?  We dropped support for JDK5, which was released just a few months after RHEL4.  Is it realistic to compile trunk on a 10 year-old OS?  What do you guys think?\n\nI definitely think we should fix the malloc.h thing, though, to compile on modern BSD systems.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

When Red Hat says they \"support\" 10 year old operating systems, it doesn't mean they compile the trunk versions of projects on them.  It means they backport a carefully selected set of security and robustness patches.\n\nbq. Java should 'compile' with not too many issues, so we're really talking about the C code.\n\nI think the issues in Java are pretty similar to the issues in C.  We can choose to support old versions of stuff, or not.  The Java equivalent of supporting a 10-year-old OS would be supporting JDK5, which we did not choose to do in Hadoop trunk.  If we choose not to support JDK5 or RHEL4, we are telling admins that use those products that they need to upgrade to use the latest version of Hadoop, which might be annoying for some.  But we gain the ability to use additional features that were not present in RHEL4 or JDK5, and write simpler and less buggy code because there are fewer special cases.\n\nAs it turns out, we don't support JDK5.  So it seems clear that people feel that 10 years is long enough (and some people even think we should drop support for JDK6 in branch-2, although I am not one of them.)  All I am asking is that we apply the same standards to the C code that we apply to the Java code.\n\nbq. The last time I looked at the code, it wasn't that bad to rewrite the non-portable portions to be much more portable+feature/structure detection. If this was done, then I'd expect it to work on 10-year-old OSes without too much effort. The vast majority of calls we need to make aren't particularly new...\n\nAlan, the C code in YARN depends extensively on {{cgroups}}.  This is a Linux feature which is not present before RHEL6.\nYou can read the manual here: https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/ch01.html  This isn't just a system call that got a new argument or something, it's an entire subsystem which is simply missing in the older OS, and which YARN uses to isolate processes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
