The classes I'm interested in aren't utilities, they are part of the core of the NameNode.  For example, EditLogInputStream, FSEditLogOp, and so forth.\n\nThe current OEV and OIV code duplicates basically all of these core classes, and it's a real code smell.  Whenever something changes, we need to implement it in both parsers, which is silly.  Also any improvements and bugfixes we make to one parser don't improve or bugfix the other, etc.\n\nThe end goal here is to have a very minimal OEV that basically just pulls stuff from the EditLogInputStream and prints it.  No parsing, no tokenizing, nothing like that.\n\nPerhaps it is easier just to make the things I want public and use the interface annotations?  It seems to be done in a lot of other places.\n\nI do understand the desire to keep the packages small.

Here are the files I view as format-specific in the namenode package:\n{code}\nBackupImage.java\nBackupJournalManager.java\nEditLogBackupInputStream.java\nEditLogBackupOutputStream.java\nEditLogFileInputStream.java\nEditLogFileOutputStream.java\nEditLogInputStream.java\nEditLogOutputStream.java\nEditsDoubleBuffer.java\nFSDirectory.java\nFSEditLog.java\nFSEditLogLoader.java\nFSEditLogOpCodes.java\nFSEditLogOp.java\nFSImageCompression.java\nFSImageFormat.java\nFSImage.java\nFSImagePreTransactionalStorageInspector.java\nFSImageSerialization.java\nFSImageStorageInspector.java\nFSImageTransactionalStorageInspector.java\nJournalManager.java\nJournalSet.java\nJournalStream.java\nNNStorage.java\nNNStorageRetentionManager.java\n{code}\n\n\nAfter moving all of those into a separate namespace, org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.format, I found that I had to make a lot of interfaces public that I didn't really want to.

If moving the code out from the NameNode is not easy, you may make things public.  In such case, you should do it with other changes that you are going to make.\n\nThanks for taking a look.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-02-24T02:42:51.799+0000","updated":"2012-02-24T02:42:51.799+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543785/comment/13216149","id":"13216149","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
