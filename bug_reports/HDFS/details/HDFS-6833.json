Though the DirecotryScanner is only scheduled to run every 6 hours (by default), the FsDatasetAsyncDiskService's block deletion could be so delayed that DirectoryScanner can see some blocks already removed from memory but still exist on disk. I worked out patch that can possibly helps the slowness of the disk removal, see HDFS-6788. However, I think this jira should help from a different perspective.\n\nOverall the latest patch looks good to me. I have some comments here:\n\n0. suggest to have a version number when you upload new patch.\n\n1. suggest to change {{isDirectoryScanner()}} to {{isDirecotryScannerInited}}.\n\n2, using List<Long> for deletingBlocks may not be efficient since you do search in \n{{public void removeDeletedBlocks(String bpid, List<Long> blockIds)}} which means sequential search. You might consider using HashSet.\n\n3. DirectoryScanner.java. Not related to your change, but I saw it when looking at your change:\n{code}\nwhile (m < memReport.length && d < blockpoolReport.length) {\n  Block memBlock = memReport[Math.min(m, memReport.length - 1)];\n  ScanInfo info = blockpoolReport[Math.min(\n      d, blockpoolReport.length - 1)];\n{code}\n\nMath.min(m, memReport.length - 1) is guaranteed to be m and \nMath.min(d, blockpoolReport.length - 1) is guaranteed to be d,\nthe code can be simplified to not call Math.min.\n\n4. DirecotryScanner.java\n{code}\nwhile (d < blockpoolReport.length) {\n  if (!dataset.isDeletingBlock(bpid, blockpoolReport[d].getBlockId())) {\n    statsRecord.missingMemoryBlocks++;\n    addDifference(diffRecord, statsRecord, blockpoolReport[d++]);\n  } else {\n    deletingBlockIds.add(blockpoolReport[d].getBlockId());\n    d++;\n  }\n}\n{code}\nthe \"d++\" logic can be extracted out to be shared by both branches.\n\nThanks.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-15T07:07:32.684+0000","updated":"2014-08-15T07:07:32.684+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12732528/comment/14098673","id":"14098673","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sinchii","name":"sinchii","key":"sinchii","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shinichi Yamashita","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"body":"Hi [~yzhangal],\n\nThank you for your review and comments.\nI attach a renew patch which reflected your comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sinchii","name":"sinchii","key":"sinchii","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shinichi Yamashita","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"created":"2014-08-15T15:33:55.393+0000","updated":"2014-08-15T15:33:55.393+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12732528/comment/14099052","id":"14099052","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Originally I thought we could maintain deleteBlock in a way that it always just hold the blocks to be deleted and not yet deleted from disk (add a block to it when deciding to delete the block; and remove the block from it when deleted from disk). After further thought, I think your version 006 is reasonable. Because even though the block is not removed from the deleteBlock right after it's deleted from disk, the change you did in DirectoryScanner can identify the block and remove it from deleteBlock, in asynchronous fashion.\n\nI briefly looked at your version 7, I suspect there may be synchronization issue in the change made there. Version 6 looks fine to me. If you agree, I think we can get a second eye to look at version 6.\n\nThanks. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-19T07:04:20.957+0000","updated":"2014-08-19T07:04:20.957+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12732528/comment/14102812","id":"14102812","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Echoing earlier comments, I'm a bit confused about why {{DirectoryScanner}} has the responsibility to call {{FsDatasetSpi#removeDeletedBlocks}}.  This causes us to delete the block ID from the internal data structure tracking still-to-be-deleted-from-disk blocks.  This part of the code is logically disconnected from the code that actually does the delete syscall, so it has no way to guarantee that the delete has really finished.  It seems there would still be a race condition.  If the next scan triggered before the delete completed, then the scanner wouldn't know that the block is still waiting to be deleted.  (Of course, I'd expect this to be extremely rare given the fact that scan periods are usually quite long, 6 hours by default.)  Moving this logic closer to the actual delete in {{ReplicaFileDeleteTask}} would address this.\n\nI'm curious if you can provide any more details about why this is so easy to reproduce in your environment.  There is no doubt there is a bug here, but from what I can tell, it has been there a long time, and I'd expect it to occur only very rarely.  The scan period is so long (again, 6 hours by default) that I can't see how this can happen very often.  Your comments seem to suggest that you can see this happen regularly, and on multiple DataNodes simultaneously, resulting in data loss.  That would require scanners on independent DataNodes landing in a lock-step schedule with each other.  For a typical 3-replica file, this should be very unlikely.  For a 1 or even a 2-replica file, there is already a much higher risk of data loss due to hardware failure despite this bug.  Is there anything specific to your configuration that could make this more likely?  Have you configured the scan period to something much more frequent?  Are you very rapidly decommissioning and recommissioning nodes?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-18T18:11:10.579+0000","updated":"2014-11-18T18:11:10.579+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12732528/comment/14216546","id":"14216546","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Also related to the last comment, are you seeing anything in your environment that indicates the async deletions take an unusually long time to complete?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-18T18:25:30.709+0000","updated":"2014-11-18T18:25:30.709+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12732528/comment/14216563","id":"14216563","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

The {{DirectoryScanner#diffs}} is processed via calling {{dataset.checkAndUpdate}} in {{DirectoryScanner#reconcile}}. If a block is not in memory but on disk, the block will be re-added to memory and reported back to NN later. \n\nThe problem of the current flow:\n\n* Though DirectoryScanner is only scheduled to run every 6 hours by default, the asynchonous block removal from disk described could be so delayed that DirectoryScanner would see difference between in-memory record and disk, that a block to be deleted is not in memory but on disk, even though the block is to be deleted. In this case, the later block report sent to NN would say this block as a good block, this is the problem.\n\nThe solution that Shinichi worked out:\n\n# {{final ReplicaMap deletingBlock;}} is introduced in FsDatasetImpl to remember the blocks to be deleted. These blocks are recorded to this structure by  {{FsDatasetImpl#invalidateBlock}} when called by {{BPOfferService#processCommandFromActive}}. That is, right after a block is removed from in-memory volumeMap due to a invalidate request from NN, it's recorded in {{FsDatasetImpl#deletingBlock}}.\n# When  DirectoryScanner is running ({{DirectoryScan#scan}}), when it sees a block is not in memory but on disk, don't jump to conclusion that the block need to be recorded in  {{DirectoryScanner#diffs}}, instead, check against {{FsDatasetImpl#deletingBlock}} first.\n# At the end of each DirectoryScanner run, it will remove from the {{FsDatasetImpl#deletingBlock}} the blocks examined in step 2, by calling {{dataset.removeDeletedBlocks(bpid, deletingBlockIds);}}\n\nThe flaw that Chris pointed out:\n\n* In step 3 of the solution, removing from {{FsDatasetImpl#deletingBlock}} should happen after the disk block is removed.\n\nThis is a good catch here! Though the chance the blocks don't get removed from disk is slim, it is still possible.\n\nNicholas suggested to create map <block, ReplicaFileDeleteTask>, and manages it FsDatasetAsyncDiskService. Chris suggested to move the step 3 closer to the disk block removal. Both are nice.\n\nA proposed change to address the comments:\n\nSince the volumeMap is managed in FsDatasetImpl, I think it's not too bad to keep the {{FsDatasetImpl#deletingBlock}} as where it is put now (sitting together with the volumMap). \n\nThe key is that we want to be sure that we remove entries from it only after disk removal. There are two approaches:\n\n# Let FsDatasetAsyncDiskService assumulated the list of blocks whose {{ReplicaFileDeleteTask}} is FINISHED to a certain size, then call the FsDataset api to remove them from {{FsDatasetImpl#deletingBlock}}.\n# Let  FsDatasetAsyncDiskService call the FsDataset api to remove a block each time a {{ReplicaFileDeleteTask}}  finishes.\n\nSince these operations requires synchronization, it may be better to use approach 1 performance wise. \n\nTo go with approach 1, we need to add a data structure (assume a list) in {{FsDatasetAsyncDiskService}} to remember deleted blocks, and update the list in {{ReplicaFileDeleteTask#deleteFiles}} and {{ReplicaFileDeleteTask#moveFiles}} in a synchronized way as:\n\n* add block deleted to the list\n* when the size of the list reaches a certain number, call a similar API like {{dataset.removeDeletedBlocks(bpid, deletingBlockIds);}} in the patch to remove the list entries from  {{FsDatasetImpl#deletingBlock}}, and empty the list\n\nDo you guys think this proposal would addresses your comments? thanks a lot.\n\nI will leave to Shinichi to address the good questions about possible configuration issue.\n\nBTW, the same thought did come to me earlier, but my bad to let it slip away due to a later incorrect thought. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6833?focusedCommentId=14099884&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14099884.

And then call this new method within {{FsDatasetImpl#removeDeletedBlocks}} as a delegation.\n\n* About your concern of not having {{private boolean scanning}}, I think the relevant code in prior patch (that only removes deleted blocks from deletingBlock when this variable is true) is not correct, because the scan can start any time, and you would likely end up not removing some deleted blocks from deletingBlock. About locking, we need to protect access to {{deletingBlock}}, and {{deletedBlockIds}}, and make them in sync.

It might be possible that we need to have such an util in the future, if so, the method need to be implemented in the ReplicaMap protected with the internal mutex.\n\n*   About {{if (m != null) {}} in {{void removeBlocks(String bpid, Set<Long> blockIds)}}, it's better to check if m is null and return if so right after getting m, instead of doing the check again and again in the loop. Or you can put the loop within {{if (m != null) {...}.}}\n\nHI [~cnauroth] and [~szetszwo], thanks for your earlier review. Wonder if any of you would have time to take a look at the latest? thanks much.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-17T23:52:52.845+0000","updated":"2014-12-17T23:52:52.845+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12732528/comment/14251581","id":"14251581","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sinchii","name":"sinchii","key":"sinchii","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shinichi Yamashita","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"body":"Hi [~yzhangal],\n\nThank you for your review!
