If a new node is added, the partial block copy can make the ACKed size on the new node bigger than others. Although less likely, the same thing can happen without involving a new node. It can also happen in partial chunk cases, which the existing patch does not handle.\n\nI have a patch that was stress tested and internally reviewed. I am in the process of adding a unit test.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-05-08T13:26:18.548+0000","updated":"2015-05-08T13:26:18.548+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640242/comment/14534547","id":"14534547","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Canceling the existing patch and assigning it to me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-05-08T13:27:11.128+0000","updated":"2015-05-08T13:27:11.128+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640242/comment/14542862","id":"14542862","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"We saw this kind of corruption happening when the copied partial block data does not end at a packet boundary. The un-acked packets are resent from the client and if the end of the on-disk data is not aligned, corruption happens.  This is very difficult to reproduce in unit test without being too invasive.\n\nHowever, data corruption can be reproduced in a 10-node cluster. Here is how we reproduced it and verified the patch (Credit goes to [~nroberts]) :\n\n- Modify teragen to hflush() every 10000 records\n- Change datanode WRITE_TIMEOUT_EXTENSION from 5000 ms to 1ms - allows socket write timeout config to have full control over the write timeout\n- Config dfs.datanode.socket.write.timeout to 2000ms\n- Config dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.policy to ALWAYS so that write pipelines are always immediately reconstructed when a failure occurs\n- Run teragen with 100 maps, each outputting 10000000000\n- Success criteria is no \"Checksum verification failed\" in any datanode logs. This is from added checksum verification in recoverRbw(). A patch will be provided in HDFS-8395. \n- The write timeout is so aggressive that the teragen job will probably fail due to multiple, repeated failures eventually causing task attempts to fail, this is expected.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-05-13T22:40:07.692+0000","updated":"2015-05-13T22:40:07.692+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640242/comment/14543088","id":"14543088","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\\\\\n\\\\\n| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | pre-patch |  14m 35s | Pre-patch trunk compilation is healthy. |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | @author |   0m  0s | The patch does not contain any @author tags. |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | tests included |   0m  0s | The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
