The inheriting of permissions only applies to intermediate directories, so why isn't mkdirs simply passing the appropriate permissions as it iterates over the directory components to create?\n\nI moved the code that tweaks the permissions for intermediate directories up from INodeDirectory to FSDirectory's mkdirs.  I also removed the unnecessary inheritPermission argument from many method signatures.\n\nNote that if a file or symlink is created whereby it requires intermediate dirs to be auto-created, then the old inherit behavior is used to create the directories.  It's not possible for the namenode to correctly divine the permissions for the intermediate dirs from the permissions for the file.  I considered taking a swag at applying +x to each permission slot that was not 0.  However that can produce some bizarre cases.\n\nIn the end, I decided to not address the file and symlinks since it would be (imho) masking an underlying flaw in the api.
