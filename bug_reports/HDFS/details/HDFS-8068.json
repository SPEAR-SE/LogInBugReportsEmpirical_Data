If we are to support transparent retry and recovery, there has to be a way to tell the failover proxy provider to abandon underlying broken proxy and recreate on reception of  {{UnknownHostException}}. This can be a bit ugly.  An alternative way is to have the failover proxy provider check the address of the existing proxy object in {{getProxy()}} and recreate if it is bad. The newly created one may still be broken causing calls to throw {{UnklnowHostException}}, but if DNS recovers, it will eventually succeed after some number of retries(recreations). But it has a drawback of having to be fixed in the pluggable failover proxy provider level.  Is namenode HA also supposed to cover infrastructure outages? If not, the v1 patch should be sufficient.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-04-06T21:30:37.464+0000","updated":"2015-04-06T21:30:37.464+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12818674/comment/14482238","id":"14482238","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
