If you restart only the NN and not the DN, then the DN still has a reference to the blocks in the bbw directory. When the client closes the file (assuming that the client survived the NN restart), those blocks will send a blockReceived to the NN. If the client died, then the NN will start lease-recovery at some future point in time and that should make these datanodes send blockReceived messages to the NN. This sequence of events should make the blocks reappear in the NN.
