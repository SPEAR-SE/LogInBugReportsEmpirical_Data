This is one of those \"I can't believe this when unnoticed for so long\".\n\nExpired, ie. non-cancelled, tokens are discarded in a background thread.  The background thread is only started after leaving safemode.  No edits are produced unlike explicitly cancelled tokens.  So the 2NN loads up the image, applies edits, dumps out the image -- the 2NN never knows to discard the expired tokens, just the cancelled ones.  Now the NN loads up the mountain of tokens in the image, but then discards the expired ones after leaving safemode.  The fsimage just keeps bloating.  Forever.\n\n+Long Term Impact+\nThe severity of the problem is a 2NN was consuming ~15% more memory than the active NN and trashing in GC.  The 2NN holds less state, so that was surprising.  The image was discovered to contain ~42 MILLION tokens dating back to mid-2011.  Not 2012, yes, 2011.  Loading all the tokens added a significant ~8min to the startup time.\n\n+Aggravating Factors+\nThe main contributor to uncanceled tokens are a JT/RM conf hack to prevent cancellation of tokens after a job completes.  Otherwise an oozie job would have its tokens killed after the first sub-job completes.  It's not oozie/pig's fault that tokens aren't cancelled, it just aggravates the bug in the namenode.\n\nI'll dust off an old patch that reference counts tokens against jobs, so tokens will be cancelled but only when no other jobs are running with those tokens.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-02-08T00:01:40.510+0000","updated":"2013-02-08T00:01:40.510+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12631303/comment/13574076","id":"13574076","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Sigh, I think the problem also affects token secret keys.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-02-08T00:04:03.348+0000","updated":"2013-02-08T00:04:03.348+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12631303/comment/13574589","id":"13574589","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I'm updating for tokens and keys, and to handle startup discarding expired ones, and properly using the interrupts lock.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-02-08T16:21:00.956+0000","updated":"2013-02-08T16:21:00.956+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12631303/comment/13574948","id":"13574948","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Secret keys are never purged.

Some would have slightly unique properties.\n* Will also have to be careful to not break the JHS and RM that also use the ADTSM.  Changes to secret key management cannot impact them.\n* The 2NN changes from being a \"dumb\" data vessel, that only does what's it's told, to mutating state.  If the config values don't match the primary NN, the 2NN may start expiring tokens or secret keys too early.\n* The offline image/edit viewers may be misleading.  If I want to see what should be the state of the NN, for instance to verify this jira works, it will claim the NN is retaining tokens/secrets that it's not.\n\nI think writing expiration to the edit logs is a low-risk change because it simply parallels an explicit cancellation and avoids the concerns cited above.

Kihwal and have studied the problem and found it's much worse than originally thought.\n\nThe NN rolls the edits, followed by the 2NN downloading the image and rolled edits.  Tokens set to be expired during the duration of the download, but actually renewed during the download, will erroneously be removed from the image because the 2NN doesn't know about this edits.  The 2NN will now fail all future checkpoints when it can't apply edits for the non-existent token.  The 2NN will now start trying to checkpoint every minute, and always fail.\n\nTokens are renewed at 90% of the expiration.  With the default 24h, that's a 2.4h window in which the checkpoint downloads must occur.  If the window is blown, you can try to delete the current fsimage on the NN, bounce the 2NN to clear its internal state, and let the 2NN use the prior image and reapply all the older and newer edits.  However, if the checkpoint blew the 2.4h window because of anything but a transient load or network congestion, it's going to blow the window again.  It'll require NN downtime to force a save of the namespace.\n\nUnder normal load, some of our grids routinely take 1.5h+ to checkpoint due to the size of our images/edits and throttled download to avoid saturating the NIC.  Under heavy load, we are almost certain to lose the race.  Or if the 2NN is out of commission for long, we will hit this issue.  Incurring at least 15m of cluster downtime is not an option.\n\nWe need another solution...\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-02-28T18:44:06.990+0000","updated":"2013-02-28T18:44:06.990+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12631303/comment/13624111","id":"13624111","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Hey Daryn,\n\nAre you still working on the fix here?
