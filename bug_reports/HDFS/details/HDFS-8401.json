If your concern is ease of use, focusing on improvements to what we already have in HDFS might be more bang for the buck. We have the LAZY_PERSIST storage policy and directory-level cache directives which seem like a start. Colin also mentioned opportunistic cache directives, which would be a really nice enhancement.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-28T19:56:16.873+0000","updated":"2015-05-28T19:56:16.873+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12829890/comment/14564043","id":"14564043","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Consider the following use case:   one wants to run a few jobs and cache the input and the intermediate output just for the duration of these jobs. Today the user has to pin such data by changing the dir-file attributes, and when the jobs are finished he has to reset the attributes. It is easier to say \"jobxxx input = memfs://.../input tmp=memfs://.../tmpdir  output=\". Here setting the scheme is not inconvenient since it is part of parameters to a program.  Further this works with any existing application - Hive, Pig etc since the hint to cache is in the scheme of the pathname. Our existing policies and dir level setting work when things  are semi-permanent (ie this dir has dimension tables and please cache them - all jobs will benefit). In addition we could add or already have programmatic APIs to indicate that a file being read or written needs to be cached. But this requires change to the application code.   Once we get fully automated memory caching working we will not need  our existing storage policies nor layers like memfs since the system will just take care of it all - but it will take us some time to get there. \n\nI think both approaches have their own strengths and are complementary. Note  spark-tachyon uses a layered file system and the approach is viewed as a simple way to control which files get cached on a per-job basis.\n\nFurther one can also cache specific Hive  tables in hive meta store by giving a path name that has the memfs-scheme. Here the memfs-pathname or setting the dirs attribute are roughly equal from a ease-of-usage perspective.\n\nAn additional point about memfs for non-hdfs systems: the Memfs *abstraction* allows caching S3 data in a very similar fashion. Of course one will have to build a full caching implementation of memfs for S3 because the memfs proposed in this Jira is very very thin layer over HDFS because ALL the caching mechanism is already in HDFS. So I expect several implementation of the memfs interface for HCFS file systems.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-29T01:22:19.504+0000","updated":"2015-05-29T01:22:19.504+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-8401/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2eqin:"}}
