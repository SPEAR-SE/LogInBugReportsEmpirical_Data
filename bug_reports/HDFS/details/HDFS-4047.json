But if moving the sleep on IOE from the outer loop to the inner loop will make the interval of heartbeat sending longer. When IOE occurs during the process of heartbeat, the thread will sleep for 5s and during these time the NN will not receive any heartbeat from this DN. It will make some failure of test case. For example, if the NN waits for the block report and the DN report thread sleep due to the above IOE, it will takes more time to make NN exits safe mode. As far as I know, most of the test failure is caused by this reason. So I just remove the sleep on IOE based on your patch. If IOE is throw during the loop, just log it and continue the loop as soon as possible.
