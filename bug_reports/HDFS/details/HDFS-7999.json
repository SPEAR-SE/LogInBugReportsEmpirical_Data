Here is some explain of the logic of createTemporary() after applying the patch:\n1.

If there is a ReplicaInfo in volumeMap and its GS is newer than the passed in ExtendedBlock b, then throw the ReplicaAlreadyExistsException from line 1447.\n3.

We will release the FsDatasetImpl lock and try to stop the earlier writer w/o the lock.  \n4.  After the earlier writer is stopped, we need to evict earlier writer's ReplicaInfo from volumeMap, to that end we will re-acquire the FsDatasetImpl lock.  However,  since this thread has released the FsDatasetImpl lock when it tried to stop earlier writer, another thread might have come in and changed the ReplicaInfo of this block in VolumeMap.  This situation is not very likely to happen whereas we have to handle it in case.   The loop in the patch is just tried to handle this situation -- after re-acuire the FsDatasetImpl lock, it will check if the current ReplicaInfo in volumeMap is still the one before we stop the writer, if so we can simply evict it and create/insert a new one then return from line 1443. Otherwise, it implies another thread has slipped in and changed the ReplicaInfo when we were stopping earlier writer.  In this condition, we check if that thread has inserted a block with even newer GS than us, if so we throws ReplicaAlreadyExistsException from line 1447.
