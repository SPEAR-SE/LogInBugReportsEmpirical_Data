I think making the user experience of broken setups is a different task than this JIRA, which is just a bug fix. I don't want to scope creep this, since it's an important fix for data safety.\n\nAdditionally, always telling the admin to copy the data dir between nodes is dangerous -- once we're in an inconsistent state, an expert should really look at it to understand the correct recovery. Giving resolution advice in an error message is risky, since we're already in a bad state we may end up giving the wrong advice.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-08-06T18:38:40.337+0000","updated":"2013-08-06T18:38:40.337+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661447/comment/13731734","id":"13731734","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=azuryy","name":"azuryy","key":"azuryy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Fengdong Yu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Yes, Todd, I agree with you abosulotely.\n\nto slove this problem finally, we should sync all transactions on the ative NN to the SBN during shut down HDFS, right?\nso can we open another JIRA for it?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=azuryy","name":"azuryy","key":"azuryy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Fengdong Yu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-08-07T07:41:14.270+0000","updated":"2013-08-07T07:41:14.270+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661447/comment/13759126","id":"13759126","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"HDFS-5074 explains the way in which we end up with a mid-segment checkpoint and should also solve this issue -- it will return the 1-1000 segment from selectInputStreams and properly read it at startup.
