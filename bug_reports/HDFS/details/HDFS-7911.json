The use case has one flusher thread that keeps calling the hflush() on WAL file while other roller threads are trying to write concurrently to that same file handle.\n\nAs the class comments mentioned. *\"\"CryptoOutputStream encrypts data. It is not thread-safe.\"* I check the code and it seems the buffer overflow is related to the race between the CryptoOutputStream#write() and CryptoOutputStream#flush() as both can call CryptoOutputStream#encrypt(). The inBuffer/outBuffer of the CryptoOutputStream is not thread safe. They can be changed during encrypt for flush() when write() is coming from other threads. \n\nI have validated this with multi-threaded unit tests that mimic the HBase WAL use case. For file not under encryption zone (*DFSOutputStream*), multi-threaded flusher/writer works fine. For file under encryption zone (*CryptoOutputStream*), multi-threaded flusher/writer randomly fails with Buffer Overflow/Underflow.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Buffer Overflow when running HBase on HDFS Encryption Zone","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xyao","name":"xyao","key":"xyao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyu Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xyao","name":"xyao","key":"xyao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyu Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12780649/comment/14353967","id":"14353967","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Thanks [~xyao] for reporting this, I will take a look at this later.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-03-10T00:31:18.022+0000","updated":"2015-03-10T00:31:18.022+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12780649/comment/14354833","id":"14354833","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"{{CryptoOutputStream}} is not thread-safe as it declares.
