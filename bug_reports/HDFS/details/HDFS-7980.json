I think it works too. The first arrived incremental report only add a few block to NN. There is no need to calculate a toRemove list. We can still use processFirstBlockReport() even when storageInfo.numBlocks() > 0\n{quote}\n\nThe question is, with patch 001, how can  {{processFirstBlockReport()}} be used even when storageInfo.numBlocks() > 0? I mean, after the first use of {{processFirstBlockReport()}}, blockReportCount is incremented by 1, thus preventing {{processFirstBlockReport()}} from being used again for later reports.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-07T04:58:44.885+0000","updated":"2015-04-07T04:58:44.885+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12785131/comment/14482658","id":"14482658","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=walter.k.su","name":"walter.k.su","key":"walter.k.su","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Walter Su","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"When I said \"even when storageInfo.numBlocks() > 0\" I mean only for the first full report.
