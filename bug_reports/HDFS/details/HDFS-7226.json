fix. But the issue took me some time to understand. \n\nBasically, because of HDFS-7217 change, reporting of ReceivingBlock to NN is delayed, in the reported testcase, they are replaced by ReceivedBlock later (see comment in the comment I put in the patch). \n\nThanks Jing for the help on HDFS-7236.

So with the current fix, is it possible that the DN just happens to send out an IBR (after normal waiting) right after receiving the data? In that case, DN may still send out both the block receiving and received msg. Thus maybe we can still call {{triggerBlockReportForTests}} here in the tests to make sure a block receiving report is sent out.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-16T21:52:13.919+0000","updated":"2014-10-16T21:52:13.919+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12747365/comment/14174367","id":"14174367","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HI [~jingzhao],\n\nThanks for the review and comments. \n\nI actually had tried that before I came up with this new solution. The issue with calling {{triggerBlockReportForTests}} is, we would see 6 reports instead of 3 the test expects, even though we only have 3 BlockReceiving entries. I think the reason is about how {{triggerBlockReportForTests}} is implemented: it incurs a waiting loop for the 3 second heartbeat interval, at which time, it will do additional block reports than the original 3, and ends up 6 reports instead of 3.  But let me take a further look at this direction.\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-16T22:26:10.678+0000","updated":"2014-10-16T22:26:10.678+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12747365/comment/14175730","id":"14175730","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HI [~jingzhao],\n\nThanks for your earlier review comments.

So I incorporate these 3 in the expected number of messages in the new rev; \n* In addition, I found that the closeStream() call in the second block of code demonstrates the problem in a different way, because it doesn't call hflush as the first block does .
