The change in FSImage is just a few lines, and easily validated by inspection. \n\nHowever, providing a unit test for it was very difficult. The problem is that failure must be forced *within* the doUpgrade() method itself, which is buried in the Namenode startup code, and quite well protected.  First I tried to make the storage dir read-only, but that gets caught in recoverTransitionRead() well before invoking doUpgrade().  Second I looked at using Mockito, but it seems that in order to spy on the startup/upgrade process one would have to mock the entire stack of HDFS system objects.  The invocation of NNStorage.rename() at line 367 of FSImage would be a convenient spy target, but it is static and I saw no way to get hold of it.  Third, I rejected non-mock test parameters in production code.\n\nFinally I just tested it manually by temporarily hacking the code in doUpgrade() to force the error.  I was able to validate my patch, and also found and fixed an NPE bug in FSEditLog.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-06-17T07:35:36.698+0000","updated":"2011-06-17T07:35:36.698+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507671/comment/13050940","id":"13050940","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Should this call getNumEditStreams() [instead of \"(editStreams == null)\"], or maybe even better yet isOpen() which returns false if there are no edit streams?\n\nNo, the point of this insertion is solely to prevent NPE in the rare case where (as the comment notes) an error occurs on one or more sd's before editStreams has even been initialized.  The check for null is efficient and sufficient.\n\nbq. Would it make sense to move the call to reportErrorOnDirectories inside the if? Other callers of the method tend to not unconditionally call the method.\n\nAgreed.  New patch contains this change.\n\nbq. is there a race condition... Can isAlive return false because the thread already terminated before waitForThreads is invoked? I ask because won't the thread be left in limbo? In which case, should the while be a do-while?\n\nWe talked, and noted that Java thread join is not the same as pthread join.  There's no race, nor other issue, because both .isAlive() and .join() can be called on an already-terminated thread without any exception being thrown.  The only purpose of the loop is to deal with the possibility that an interruption may be received while this method is blocked on the join() call.  It doesn't matter whether the termination condition is checked at the beginning or the end of the loop.  So the existing code is acceptable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-06-29T01:20:05.212+0000","updated":"2011-06-29T01:20:05.212+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507671/comment/13056963","id":"13056963","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
