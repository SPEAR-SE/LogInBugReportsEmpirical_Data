patch, it was possible for a DN and NN to connect to each other with different build versions because DN only checked for build versions when it did a handshake() with the NN. \n\nNo new tests added because it seemed extremely difficult to add a manual test to verify this.\n\nThe way I verified this is as follows:\n1. start DN, NN\n2. stop NN and change buildVersion by manually changing saveVersion.sh file. \n3. start NN.\n4. When NN comes up and registers with DN, it keeps rejecting because of the version difference (this was not happening before).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnvijoe","name":"johnvijoe","key":"johnvijoe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John George","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-07-07T22:12:52.242+0000","updated":"2011-07-07T22:12:52.242+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12512384/comment/13061674","id":"13061674","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
