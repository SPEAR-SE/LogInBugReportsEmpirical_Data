The .meta header exists so that we can check the version of the block file.\n\nThanks for taking a looksee mighty [~cmccabe].\n\nWhat if we made a patch with a configuration to skip the reading of metadata?  Or, added a setSkipMetadata API as we have a setVerifyChecksum API?\n\nAgree, it is handy having blocks versioned so can be evolved at later date.  No harm having version in side file either since we are probably going to do an extra seek to get metadata anyways (would be coolio if DN cached block metadata so could save a seek but maybe this would be more trouble than it is worth -- we'd need to prove it useful in say a heavy random read scenario).\n\nBut the metadata doesn't look to have ever changed.  It is version 1 (It looks like the version used to be a define out of FSDataset before it was defined inside this file but even then the version was 1).  Meantime the lads here are paying a seek to learn something that is unlikely ever to change.  \n\n(Filename would be good place for version but would be a massive change).\n\nThanks Colin.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stack","name":"stack","key":"stack","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stack","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-09T04:21:07.718+0000","updated":"2013-07-09T04:21:07.718+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12656521/comment/13703745","id":"13703745","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
