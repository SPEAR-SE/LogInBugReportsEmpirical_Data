The 2nd datanode's socket read from the 1st datanode timed out in 60 seconds and disconnected. This caused a block recovery. The problem was, the 1st datanode hasn't written the last packet, but the downstream nodes did and ACK was sent back to the client. For this reason, the block recovery was issued up to the ACKed size. \n\nDuring the recovery, the first datanode was told to do copyBlock(). Since it didn't have enough data on disk, it waited in waitForMinLength(), which didn't help, so the command failed. The connection was already established to the target node for the copy, but the target never received any data. The data packet was eventually written, but it was too late for the copyBlock() call.\n\nThe destination node for the copy had block metadata in memory, but no file was created on disk. When client contacted this node for block recovery, it too failed. \n\nThere are few problems:\n- The faulty (slow) node was not detected correctly. Instead, the 2nd DN was excluded. The 1st DN's packet responder could have done a better job. It didn't have any outstanding ACKs to receive.  Or the second DN could have tried to hint the 1st DN of what happened. \n\n- copyBlock() could probably wait longer than 3 seconds in waitForMinLength(). Or it could check the on-disk size early on and fail early even before trying to establish a connection to the target.\n\n- Failed targets in block write/copy should clean up the record or make it recoverable.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"340328","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Write pipeline failures caused by slow or busy disk may not be handled properly.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659818/comment/14975142","id":"14975142","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"bq.
