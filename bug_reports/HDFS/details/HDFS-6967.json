Wide and/or many jobs overwhelm DNs (due to smaller heap) and sometimes the NN.  Either can OOM or go into full GC.

It would require some serious risky hacks to override jetty's behavior.\n\nI'd like to solicit comments on an internal approach we are trying:  rather than redirect clients to a DN with a replica, redirect to a random DN in a rack with a replica.  This distributes the jetty connections, DFSClients, and associated objects over many more nodes with an insignificant impact to throughput - esp. over higher latency links and compared to the time it takes for the client to timeout the connection and retry another node which may also be overloaded.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-09-04T16:26:21.289+0000","updated":"2014-09-04T16:26:21.289+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12737534/comment/14122071","id":"14122071","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~daryn], is this because some of the blocks are popular?\n\nAlso is there anyway the datanode load (number of xceivers assuming the local DFSClient access for webhdfs is counted towards load) can be factored into redirecting?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-09-04T22:10:09.094+0000","updated":"2014-09-04T22:10:09.094+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12737534/comment/14122937","id":"14122937","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Popular in the sense that wide jobs needed access to ~3 replicas, yes.  Jobs with 2-5k mappers that ran fine with hdfs cause significant problems with webhdfs.  We saw up to 20k jetty requests queued up while the DN was in the throes of GC.  Presumably the client is timing out and retrying the connection again, which further exacerbates the memory problem as the jetty queue is full of heavy objects for dead connections.\n\nWe could take the existing DN load into account, such that we pick the lightest xceiver loaded DN before picking a random rack local.  However the risk is that an onslaught of tasks will be distributed to the DNs with the replica before the DN can report their spikes in load.  This is already a minor issue for hdfs.  In the past we've considered using a \"predictive\" load where the NN artificially increases the DN's load stats as it gives out locations.  In the end, we chose to keep it simple with random rack-local.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-09-05T13:44:49.606+0000","updated":"2014-09-05T13:44:49.606+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12737534/comment/14123173","id":"14123173","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This is another case where it's a real shame that we're stuck on Jetty 6.
