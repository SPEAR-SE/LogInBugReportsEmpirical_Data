I don't think this is a problem.\n\nI agree, mostly because after thinking about this, I can't come up with a reasonable implementation for maintaining state outside the snapshot root while still retaining the current performance characteristics of snapshots.\n\n# To implement copy-on-write on symlink targets outside the snapshot root, we'd need an O\\(n\\) scan (n = # inodes) to find if there is a snapshot anywhere containing a symlink pointing to that inode.\n# We could optimize the above by storing back-references from the target inode to the symlink inode, but then we'd cause an O\\(n\\) increase in storage cost.\n# If we choose to reject creation of snapshots containing a symlink outside the snapshot root, then we need to scan the subtree under the snapshot root, so snapshot creation is no longer O\\(1\\).  (Again, we could throw storage at this problem to optimize, but it seems wasteful.)\n\nbq. Every other snapshotting filesystem (btrfs, ZFS, etc) allows snapshots to contain symlinks to paths outside the snapshot.\n\nI think there is a greater chance for user confusion with symlinks in HDFS snapshots (can be created for any arbitrary subtree) compared to other snapshotting file systems (can be created at the volume).  With a whole-volume snapshot, I believe the user still can assume immutability as long as the symlinks don't jump out of the volume.  (Full disclosure: I'm making some assumptions here.  I don't have much real experience using ZFS.)\n\nAt this point, I propose that the scope of this jira is to update the snapshot documentation to warn end users about the pitfalls of combining snapshots and symlinks.
