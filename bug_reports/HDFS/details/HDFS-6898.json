I thought it only manipulates metadata: http://linux.die.net/man/1/fallocate – \"this is done quickly by allocating blocks and marking them as uninitialized, requiring no IO to the data blocks\"\n\nIt depends on the underlying file system.  For a filesystem which uses extents, like ext4, not much I/O would be required.  For something like ext2, you have to allocate each ext2 block individually and link it to the rest of them, which could be quite a lot of I/O.  That's a fair point, though... it will not be 128 MB of I/O in either case... it would be less than that.  It's all metadata I/O essentially.\n\nbq.

The patch looks great.  I have just one comment.  In {{FsVolumeImpl#releaseReservedSpace}}, the failsafe logic could be subject to a data race.  If the {{addAndGet}} results in a negative value, and then another thread calls {{reserveSpaceForRbw}} before the reset to 0 executes, then we'd lose that second thread's reservation.  Another approach might be to use a loop that calculates the new value (or 0) and makes a single call to {{compareAndSet}}, repeating until successful.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-09-05T22:03:43.981+0000","updated":"2014-09-05T22:03:43.981+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12735607/comment/14123779","id":"14123779","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the review Chris.
