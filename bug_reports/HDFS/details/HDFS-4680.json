This is useful for after-the-fact root cause analysis and security. However, logging merely the username is insufficient for many usecases. For instance, it is common for a single user to run multiple MapReduce jobs (I believe this is the case with Hive). In this scenario, given a particular audit log entry, it is difficult to trace it back to the MR job or task that generated that entry.\n\nI see a number of potential options for implementing this.\n\n1. Make an optional \"client name\" field part of the NN RPC format. We already pass a {{clientName}} as a parameter in many RPC calls, so this would essentially make it standardized. MR tasks could then set this field to the job and task ID.\n2. This could be generalized to a set of optional key-value *tags* in the NN RPC format, which would then be audit logged. This has standalone benefits outside of just verifying MR task ids.\n3. Neither of the above two options actually securely verify that MR clients are who they claim they are. Doing this securely requires the JobTracker to sign MR task attempts, and then having the NN verify this signature. However, this is substantially more work, and could be built on after idea #2.\n\nThoughts welcomed.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12324809","id":"12324809","description":"2.1.1-beta

You're suggesting that the HDFS delegation token included in the job would have the job ID? I don't think that really works, since the HDFS delegation token is fetched by the client code at job submission time. Thus, the client could pick whatever job ID it wants to \"fake\", and there's no way for the NN to authenticate the job ID.\n\nAt the end of the day, the JT/RM is the one who can validate that a given job belongs to a given user, so it needs to somehow sign this before the client passes it to the NN, whether in the form of a signed MR token or some other infrastructure.

The instanceof for the default audit logger seems like it can/should be avoided.  It appears you did this in part to avoid the performance hit of looking up the token identifier and its tracking id every time you log a message.  We should probably think of a way to avoid that.\n\nOff the top of my head, conceptually it would be ideal if the connection knew the trackingId, and the audit logger would simply log it if not null.  I'll think about it more today since I'm trying to contemplate how a forward lookup would be an easy drop-in in the future and if there would be any rolling upgrade issues.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-08-09T18:22:46.819+0000","updated":"2013-08-09T18:22:46.819+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12641737/comment/13735331","id":"13735331","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I also noticed that ADTSM is taking the md5sum penalty for every token generation regardless of the conf setting.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-08-09T21:29:22.761+0000","updated":"2013-08-09T21:29:22.761+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12641737/comment/13749075","id":"13749075","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
