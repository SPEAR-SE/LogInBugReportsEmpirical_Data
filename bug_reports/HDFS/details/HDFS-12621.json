However, for any other file system, it returns a valid delegation token. For a normal user, it is very confusing and it takes substantial time to debug/find out an alternative.\r\n\r\n*Root Cause:*\r\n ViewFileSystem inherits the basic implementation from FileSystem.getDelegationToken() that returns \"_null_\". The comments in the source code indicates not to use it and instead use addDelegationTokens(). However, it works fine DistributedFileSystem. \r\n\r\nIn short, the same client call is working for hdfs:// but not for  viewfs://. And there is no way of end-user to identify the root cause.

In this case, the defaultFS is something like \"viewfs://..\". We need to find out the actual namenode and uses that to retrieve the delegation token.\r\n\r\n_Option 3:_ Open for suggestion ?\r\n\r\n*Last note:* My hunch is : there are very few users who may be using viewfs:// with Kerberos.

The router would maintain as part of its state a mapping from dummy DTs to real DTs. Then, when the dummy was used by a client, the router would look up the correct DT (based on which NN was being communicated with) and forward that along. I'm not sure if the same approach would work here but it may be worth considering.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xkrogen","name":"xkrogen","key":"xkrogen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526"},"displayName":"Erik Krogen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-10-10T18:28:08.054+0000","updated":"2017-10-10T18:28:08.054+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13108188/comment/16199793","id":"16199793","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Added Mohammad to contributor list and assigned this jira to him per his request.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-10-11T04:30:04.395+0000","updated":"2017-10-11T04:30:04.395+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13108188/comment/16202997","id":"16202997","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kamrul","name":"kamrul","key":"kamrul","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mohammad Kamrul Islam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~sureshms] for re-adding me.\r\n\r\n[~xkrogen] : thanks for your comments.

There is some reference in the design document for HDFS-10467, but not a lot of detail. As-is it actually will not work since it relies on an external state store. This is what I had in mind for ViewFS, loosely based off of their ideas:\r\n* Upon a call to {{ViewFileSystem#getDelegationToken()}}, make a call to each underlying Namenode. This is essentially the same as the behavior of  {{addDelegationToken()}}.\r\n* Since {{getDelegationToken()}} can only store one delegation token, we need a way to stuff all of the other tokens inside of it. Create a new {{ViewFSTokenIdentifier extends TokenIdentifier}} which will stores all of them.\r\n* When a {{ViewFileSystem}} method is called under a {{UserGroupInformation}} which is authenticated via a {{ViewFSTokenIdentifier}}, extract the underlying Token and send it along to the corresponding NN.\r\n* To serialize {{ViewFSTokenIdentifier}} for later use by other clients, we leverage the fact that all of the underlying Tokens are also serializable ({{Writable}}). The sequence of bytes that {{ViewFSTokenIdentifier}} serializes to can simply be a concatenation of the serialized bytes for each underlying Token, along with some information about which Token goes with which mount point and/or NN URI. This should enable, after deserialization, any other client to perform the same steps, assuming that it is using the same ViewFS mount table.\r\n\r\nIt would require a fair amount of effort / code change, but all isolated to within {{ViewFileSystem}} code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xkrogen","name":"xkrogen","key":"xkrogen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526"},"displayName":"Erik Krogen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-10-20T15:25:24.581+0000","updated":"2017-10-20T15:25:24.581+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13108188/comment/16291084","id":"16291084","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanishakoneru","name":"hanishakoneru","key":"hanishakoneru","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hanisha Koneru","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~kamrul], are you working on this Jira?
