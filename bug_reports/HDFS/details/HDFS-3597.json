That's an issue I was confused about too. I don't understand why the test has multiple checkpoint dirs, nor why my 2NN is running in snn.getCheckpointDirs().get(1) rather than .get(0). (If I corrupt the first checkpointdir, there is no perceptible effect on the testcase.) The println is a leftover from when I was still attempting to exercise the upgrade code.\n\nThe 2NN can be configured with multiple directories. Our tests make use of that feature:\n\n{code}\n        conf.set(DFS_NAMENODE_CHECKPOINT_DIR_KEY,\n            fileAsURI(new File(base_dir, \"namesecondary\" + (2*nnIndex + 1)))+\",\"+\n            fileAsURI(new File(base_dir, \"namesecondary\" + (2*nnIndex + 2))));\n{code}\n(from MiniDFSCluster source)\n\nI bet we have some bug/feature whereby if only one of the two is corrupted, the behavior depends on which of the two it was. My guess is we iterate over each of the dirs during startup, and load the properties from each, so it's the last one which takes precedence by the time we get to the version checking code. Might be worth fixing this in a separate JIRA (out of scope for this one)\n\nGiven the above, I think it makes sense to edit the VERSION file in both of those directories, though, since you're basically depending on some other bug in this test case currently.\n\nWill look at your new patch later this afternoon.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-07-05T22:29:33.556+0000","updated":"2012-07-05T22:29:33.556+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12597375/comment/13407630","id":"13407630","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
