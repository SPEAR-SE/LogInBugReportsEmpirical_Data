which is of type IMAGE_AND_EDITS.\nI traced this problem from 0.22 all the way back to 0.20. On trunk it is not a problem as far as I can see. \nIn 0.22 branch and below saveNamespace() iterates over all storage directories and updates either image or edits or both files depending on the directory type. That way if a failure occurs in the middle only one directory will need to be recovered, the rest will maintain consistent state.\nThe trunk differs because saveNamespace() independently updates first image directories then edits directories, which is valid because of txIds. If a failure occurs in the middle of updating the matching pair of image and edits in each directory should be found based on txIds.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-11-30T00:00:17.534+0000","updated":"2011-11-30T00:00:17.534+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506680/comment/13168167","id":"13168167","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Please use the \"Target Versions\" field, not the \"Fix Version\" field, to express where a bug should be fixed or where you intend to fix it.
