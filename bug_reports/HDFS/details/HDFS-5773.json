Create a MiniDFSCluster with 1 namenode and 3 datanode\n2. Make the heartbeat interval (DFSConfigKeys.DFS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_KEY, 7) too high.\n3.  Make the heartbeat recheck interval (DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_HEARTBEAT_RECHECK_INTERVAL_KEY)  low.\n4. Open a file.\n5. Sleep for an appropriate amount of time such that the namenode declares the node dead since the datanode didn't heartbeated within the  heartbeat recheck interval and datanode sent the block report.\n6. This will generate an IOException with the following stack trace\n    java.io.IOException: Got blockReceivedDeleted message from unregistered or dead node\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.BlockManager.blockReceivedAndDeleted(BlockManager.java:2238)\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNodeRpcServer.blockReceivedAndDeleted(NameNodeRpcServer.java:825)\n7. But when the datanode heartbeated to namenode (after the heartbeat interval), the namenode re registered the data node and added it to the topology and the namenode recovered from the Exception.\n\nSo according to my test case, the namenode recovered as it should.\nI was not able to reproduce the error that was mentioned in this jira\n\nSo closing the jira and feel free to reopen if it happened again.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-04-23T16:09:50.944+0000","updated":"2014-04-23T16:09:50.944+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-5773/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1rekn:"}}
