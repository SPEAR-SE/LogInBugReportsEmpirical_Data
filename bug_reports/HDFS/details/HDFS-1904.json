Were you able to reproduce this? I've only just started developing on Hadoop so I'm kind of curious if its a problem in my environment. I've tested this on atleast 3 other computers (environments).\nChanging the interval to 10 seconds (more than the heartbeat interval) doesn't solve the problem. \nAlso I might be hallucinating but it seems writing anything into HDFS crashes the SNN. e.g. creating the parent directory and then writing the file into the directory. Which is why I am more inclined to think that its a problem with the environments I am testing on.
