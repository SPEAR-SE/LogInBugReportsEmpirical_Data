In this case Standby NN will not know the Active NN's http port to do checkpoint.\n\nSee the comment in MiniDFSCluster\n{code}      // In an HA cluster, in order for the StandbyNode to perform checkpoints,\n      // it needs to know the HTTP port of the Active. So, if ephemeral ports\n      // are chosen, disable checkpoints for the test.\n      if (!nnTopology.allHttpPortsSpecified() &&\n          nnTopology.isHA()) {\n        LOG.info(\"MiniDFSCluster disabling checkpointing in the Standby node \" +\n            \"since no HTTP ports have been specified.\");\n        conf.setBoolean(DFS_HA_STANDBY_CHECKPOINTS_KEY, false);\n      }{code}\n\nEven though I agree that user also could disable checkpointing, but I don't think this is possible in real HA cluster. What user will do with checkpoints disabled ..? ;)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2014-07-21T09:32:21.142+0000","updated":"2014-07-21T09:32:21.142+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12725945/comment/14068353","id":"14068353","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dian.fu","name":"dian.fu","key":"dian.fu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dian Fu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Thanks very much for the comments, Vinay.
