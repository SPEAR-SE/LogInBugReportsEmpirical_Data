There is a potential problem, which was part of the original code.  There is a precondition check that can throw {{IllegalStateException}}, which is a {{RuntimeException}}.  This can cause offerService() to blow up in the middle of heartbeat response processing. For example, important command like {{DNA_ACCESSKEYUPDATE}} can be dropped.  Instead of blowing up in the middle, it should log {{ERROR}} and move on.  I suggest changing it to a combination of {{assert}} and conditional statement. {{assert}} will make sure it blows up in testing, so we will know if something is obviously broken.
