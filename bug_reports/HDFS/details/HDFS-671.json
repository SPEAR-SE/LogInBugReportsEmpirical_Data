In the process of debugging, I noticed a lot of deprecation warnings concerning \"fs.default.name\" and changed the references across the Pig codebase to use fs.defaultFS, just to silence the noise. No other code changes were made between compilations. Suddenly the errors dropped to 13. \n\nI believe the cause is that Pig plays pretty loose with switching between Conf and using Properties directly, and was using fs.default.name all over the place. Seems like the deprecation warning and docs should user stronger language -- using the old string anywhere but in the xml file is likely to cause problems, as illustrated by this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dvryaboy","name":"dvryaboy","key":"dvryaboy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dmitriy V.
