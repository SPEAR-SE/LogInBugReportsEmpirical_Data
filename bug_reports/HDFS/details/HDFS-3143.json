Exception messages are not APIs and so it can be changed anytime.  Also, test should avoid depending on the message format.  However, CLI error messages are a kind of public APIs.  They should not be changed unless there are bugs.\n\nSince the new CLI re-write is not out yet and it is better not to have the class name in the message, I think we should keep the current message format and fix the tests.
