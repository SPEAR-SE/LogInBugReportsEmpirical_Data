The issue is that the packet with lastPacketInBlock=true comes in an empty packet after the data has been read. Consider the following scenario:\n\n# Block is exactly N bytes\n# Client determines (or knows) the file length and thus reads exactly up to byte N, but not past. This is the case for MapReduce jobs when an inputsplit doesn't cross block boundaries (eg any input file <1block)\n# In this case, the server will still send the empty \"lastPacketInBlock\" packet, but the client will never read it (since it doesn't read ahead in any way)\n\nPoint 2 above is currently being enforced by DFSInputStream, since it calls getFileLength() before passing a read() call down into the BlockReader.\n\nA couple things to investigate:\n# Is the check currently done by DFSInputStream important for limiting the length visible to a reader for an in-progress block? Or can that limit be satisfied by passing only the visible length to the OP_READ_BLOCK call? If the length limitation can be ignored in the DFSInputStream layer, I think that would solve the issue fairly trivially.\n# Alternatively, can we invert BlockReader.readChunk so that it reads ahead a packet? That is to say, if after a read, the internal buffer is emptied, can we read the *next* packet at this point?
