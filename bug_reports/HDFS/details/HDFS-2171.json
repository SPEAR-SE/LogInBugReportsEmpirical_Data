If the balancing is taking too long (bandwidthPerSec is too low) or the balancing is taking up too much bandwidth (bandwidthPerSec is too high), the cluster must go into a \"maintenance window\" where it is unusable while all of the datanodes are bounced. In large clusters of thousands of nodes, this can be a real maintenance problem because these \"mainenance windows\" can take a long time and there may have to be several of them while the bandwidthPerSec is experimented with and tuned.\n\nA possible solution to this problem would be to add a -bandwidth parameter to the balancer tool.

This, in turn, would make it more complicated for a client to access multiple clusters from a single process/thread.\n\nSo, I'd like to outline the requirements as I see them and the proposed solutions:\n\n+*Requirements*+:\n   1. The _balancer_'s {{bandwidthPerSec}} parameter *must* be modifiable at runtime.\n   2. The solution between 0.20 and trunk *must* look the same from a user's perspective.\n   3. The {{DataTransferProtocol}} version *should not* be modified in a dot release.\n\n+*Proposed Solutions*+:\n   1. Add the {{bandwidth}} parameter to the _balancer_ CLI and pass it via the {{OP_REPLACE_BLOCK}} and {{OP_COPY_BLOCK}} protocol packtes.\n   1.1. Change the {{DataTransferProtocol}} version to indicate to the DN that these packets contain the {{bandwidth}} parameter.\n   2. Add the {{bandwidth}} parameter to the _balancer_ CLI and pass it via the {{OP_REPLACE_BLOCK}} and {{OP_COPY_BLOCK}} protocol packtes.\n   2.1. Instead of changing the {{DataTransferProtocol}} add a magic number to the {{OP_REPLACE_BLOCK}} and {{OP_COPY_BLOCK}} protocol packets before adding the {{bandwidth}} parameter to the packet. The DN could then check for the existence of the magic number and, if it exists, read the new bandwidth. This would alert the DN that the {{bandwidth}} parameter is there without the need of changing the version number.\n   3. Add a new _dfsadmin_ command that sets the {{bandwidth}} and passes it to eadh DN via the heartbeat ack from the NN.\n\nI have implemented option 1 and it works. Likewise, option 2 is a minor modification to option 1, but with the advantage of not having to change the version number.\n\nI will investigate option 3.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-07-21T14:12:09.120+0000","updated":"2011-07-21T14:12:09.120+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514714/comment/13068999","id":"13068999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+*Proposed Solutions*+:\n   4.

This would not necessarily require a change to the protocol version, since this new opcode will be _balancer_-specific. If a newer release of the _balancer_ jars is used with an older release of the DN daemons, the DN will throw an IOException because it doesn't recognize the opcode, but I don't think the DN will crash. I think the IOExeption in that case is logged and the DN continues.\n\nI'll have to investigate this further as well.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-07-21T14:35:14.733+0000","updated":"2011-07-21T14:35:14.733+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514714/comment/13070042","id":"13070042","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"In my tests, the dfsadmin solution (option 3) seems to work well.\n\nAfter thinking about it, I like the dfsadmin solution best because the balancer utility can keep running while the bandwidth is adjusted.\n\nI'll create a unit test and post a patch Monday.\n\n-Eric","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-07-23T20:07:18.696+0000","updated":"2011-07-23T20:07:18.696+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514714/comment/13071217","id":"13071217","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
