[~cmccabe] and [~andrew.wang], I see a few possible approaches:\n\n# Remove the precondition checks completely.  (This is probably undesirable, because the precondition checks are nice for enforcing guarantees at other layers.)\n# Provide an alternate constructor accepting just ID, and don't enforce the preconditions in that code path.  (It's stricter than #1, but you still have the risk of code paths accidentally getting passed a partially-initialized object.)\n# Go back to an API design accepting just the ID instead of the cache directive object.\n\nMy preference is #3, because it still maintains the invariant that a cache directive object used anywhere in the codebase is fully initialized.  There could be advantages to an API accepting a richer object as a filter for deleting multiple directives (potentially helpful for discussion on HDFS-5203), but I'd argue that such a filter object is something different in the domain model than the actual {{PathBasedCacheDescriptor}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-27T22:11:11.860+0000","updated":"2013-09-27T22:11:11.860+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12671023/comment/13784920","id":"13784920","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hey Chris, thanks for the report.
