The replication manager does a lot of stuff, and it really seems like we're asking for trouble if we don't shut it down at the end.\n\nWith #4 the replication manager is shutdown cleanly, it unwinds because all replication queues and the block map are shutdown. Ie rather than NPE in this case it finishes it's current cycle and bails cleanly. The only thing that BM#close does that prevents this is null out the array in BlocksMap.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-09-14T07:20:01.907+0000","updated":"2012-09-14T07:20:01.907+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12607570/comment/13455653","id":"13455653","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch attached.

The IE comes from the interrupt in BM#close which subsequently swallows the IE so it seemed equivalent. I could add Thread.currentThread().interrupt() so we throw an IE again but that will just get swallowed right?\n\nThe top-level RPC methods and test util methods turn the IE into an IOE, think those should be preserved as IE as well? IIUC the RPC code will marshal it into an IOE anyway.\n\nWhile looping TestDFSClientRetries I found a related issue. Interrupting out of the RM lock fixes the issue where the BM does not actually exiting and races with the replication monitor (since it now gets interrupted), but client RPCs can still race with NN shutdown.
