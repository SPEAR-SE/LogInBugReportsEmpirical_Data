I have some questions here.  The original report seems to indicate that the reported error message doesn't indicate the real reason of failure. My questions are,\n1. In the case reported initially, the real problem was said to be \"The zkfc cannot be startup due to ha.zookeeper.quorum is not met\". With your last update, can we say the real problem is a misconfiguration?\n2. What kind of misconfiguration caused the symptom?\n3. When misconfigured, user will still see the reported error message. Should we have the error message to tell that the symptom is caused by the possible misconfiguration?\n\nThanks.\n.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-21T20:29:26.565+0000","updated":"2014-07-21T20:29:26.565+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12728284/comment/14069247","id":"14069247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandonli","name":"brandonli","key":"brandonli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brandon Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~yzhangal], I should have added more explanation. \nIn the case, the 3 zookeeper was not correctly configured as an ensemble.
