Below is what I found. I would appreciate if you can tell if my analysis below makes sense to you.\n\nAs a refresher, below is the interesting part of the stack trace (reported in HDFS-6776) relevant to the discussion here.\n\n{code}\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem.run(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:440)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem.listStatus(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:1018)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.Globber.listStatus(Globber.java:69)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.Globber.glob(Globber.java:217)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.globStatus(FileSystem.java:1623)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.tools.GlobbedCopyListing.doBuildListing(GlobbedCopyListing.java:77)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.tools.CopyListing.buildListing(CopyListing.java:81)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.tools.DistCp.createInputFileListing(DistCp.java:342)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.tools.DistCp.execute(DistCp.java:154)\n{code}\n\nTo fix in fistcp, we should look into the boundary portion between distcp and file system in the above stack trace:\n\n{code\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.tools.GlobbedCopyListing.doBuildListing(GlobbedCopyListing.java:77)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.tools.CopyListing.buildListing(CopyListing.java:81)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.tools.DistCp.createInputFileListing(DistCp.java:342)\n{code}\n\nThe boundary code in {{GlobbedCopyListing.doBuildListing}} is below \n{code}\n  for (Path p : options.getSourcePaths()) {\n      FileSystem fs = p.getFileSystem(getConf());\n      FileStatus[] inputs = fs.globStatus(p); <================this is where the exception is thrown\n\n      if(inputs != null && inputs.length > 0) {\n        for (FileStatus onePath: inputs) {\n          globbedPaths.add(onePath.getPath());\n        }\n      } else {\n        throw new InvalidInputException(p + \" doesn't exist\");        \n      }\n    }\n{code}\n\nI assume your proposed solution is to catch the exception here and do a hacked file listing using the {{p}} in the above code. However, this hack won't work for *wildcard* case:, e,g,:\n\n{code}\n hadoop  distcp webhdfs://<insecureCluster>/path/* webhdfs://<secureCluster>\n{code}\n\nWe won't be able to find what the wildcard will expand to, which is supposed to be got by {{FileStatus[] inputs = fs.globStatus(p);}}. Unless we hack into the file system.\n\nDid I misunderstand your approach? I'd appreciate if you could comment. Thanks in advance.\n\nBTW, You asked what applications other than distcp could apply in your last comment, I answered you with the \"hadoop fs -lsr\" example. Would you please confirm whether it addressed your  question? Do you think we should fix it too?

The problem is that whether it should be the default behavior, which is up to debate. I can see the values of both sides of the arguments. Practically it has not been a concern as {{ls}} only involves one cluster, and it is fairly easy to work around by overriding the configuration at the command line.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-23T21:41:12.558+0000","updated":"2015-03-23T21:41:12.558+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12740318/comment/14377050","id":"14377050","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
