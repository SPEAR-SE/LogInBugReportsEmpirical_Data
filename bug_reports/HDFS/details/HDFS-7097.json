When a standby name node is checkpointing, RPC handler threads trying to process a full or incremental block report is blocked on the name system's {{fsLock}}, because the checkpointer acquires the read lock on it.  This can create a serious problem if the size of name space is big and checkpointing takes a long time.\n\nAll available RPC handlers can be tied up very quickly. If you have 100 handlers, it only takes 34 file creates.  If a separate service RPC port is not used, HA transition will have to wait in the call queue for minutes. Even if a separate service RPC port is configured, hearbeats from datanodes will be blocked. A standby NN  with a big name space can lose all data nodes after checkpointing.  The rpc calls will also be retransmitted by data nodes many times, filling up the call queue and potentially causing listen queue overflow.\n\nSince block reports are not modifying any state that is being saved to fsimage, I propose letting them through during checkpointing.

Does FSNameSystem.saveNamespace still need to take its readLock if it is called in Standby?\nIf we want external invocations of {{saveNamespace()}} to be remain as blocking, then yes.  I don't think we want it like this, but then it becomes a bit complicated and something beyond the scope of this jira.\n\n- External invocations of saveNamespace should be cancellable.\n- May be block report processing should be allowed even on active when saveNamespace is going on. Otherwise the rpc handlers will all be tied up up quickly and even if it acquires the read lock, no read ops (e.g. heartbeat) will go through. Incremental BRs are not much of a problem on active NN, since it needs to be in safe mode first. Incremental BR will settle down in a few seconds after going into safe mode. Full block reports can be a problem depending on the number of nodes, time it takes to save the name space and the full block report interval.  The rpc does timeout on DataNode, so full block reports can be resent multiple times if saveNamespace takes long. They will all take up a different handler or a call queue slot.\n- Ongoing external invocation of saveNamespace should be cancelled during HA transition. Queued (in call queue or waiting on the lock) saveNamespace requests should also be rejected for a while just like checkpointing is not allowed for some time after a cancellation.\n- Locking will be a bit tricky.\n\nI agree that we need to address the saveNamespace issue, but prefer doing it in a separate jira.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-02T17:59:24.957+0000","updated":"2014-10-02T17:59:24.957+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12742737/comment/14157064","id":"14157064","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Modified a test case to also check whether block reports are processed during checkpointing on standby nn.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-02T19:49:25.840+0000","updated":"2014-10-02T19:49:25.840+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12742737/comment/14157172","id":"14157172","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
