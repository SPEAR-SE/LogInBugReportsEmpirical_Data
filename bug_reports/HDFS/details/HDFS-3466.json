We need to do this because as soon as you add the same principal do a different keytab, earlier keytabs become invalidated.\n\nThat's not necessarily true. It's true by default with MIT kerberos, but it doesn't have to be the case. You can either use the '-norandkey' option when creating the second keytab in kadmin, or you can use ktutil to create a keytab totally offline (i.e. independently of the kadmin server) which contains whatever entries you want from several already-created keytabs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
