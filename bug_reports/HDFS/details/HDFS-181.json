Did anyone measure the performance impact on the patch? The check (!path.startsWith(\"/\")) introduced by the patch seems to be redundant since getPathNames(..) has the same check.\n\nI can't imagine this would have any discernible performance impact, since it simply accesses the first character of an existing String. This is nothing compared to the allocation and byte copying that occurs inside of getPathComponents.\n\nbq. After the patch, calling getPathComponents(null) will get a NPE but it was not before the patch.

For internally methods like getPathComponents(..), the parameters are often not validated for performance reason\n\nWhile I appreciate the importance of performance, I think in all but the very tightest loops, constant-time (O(1)) parameter validation is worth it. NN metadata ops are almost never the bottleneck of a cluster, and I can't imagine a case where an extra memory access or two would comprise a measurable portion of request latency. Given this, I think it's far more important to focus on stability, reasonable error messages, and preventing regressions due to API misuse than it is to worry about extra O(1) method calls.\n\nI do agree that parameter validation should be happening at the outer layers of the API, but since I somehow managed to get the NPE at this point, I figured this API was somehow publicly accessible. See below.\n\nRaghu said:\n\nbq. Regd throwing a runtime exception, is it really different from NPE? Wouldn't any runtime exception in NN indicate a bug in NN?\n\nYes. For me, the difference in IAE vs NPE is that it's explicitly \"intended\" and offers some helpful explanation to the developer about what went wrong in their code. An NPE on the other hand could be an unknown internal bug, or a misuse of API, or any number of other things.\n\nbq. Can a user commad/usercode actually trigger this NPE? If yes, then it probably should be regular error (IOException etc) rather than a runtime exception.\n\nYou can trigger this NPE if you have a reference to the NameNode (through ClientProtocol). It looks to me like you could even trigger it by DFSClient.exists or DFSClient.getFileInfo, though I'd have to write a test case. If people think this error should be caught in either NameNode, FSNamesystem, or FSDirectory, then I agree - just let me know which place makes the most sense and I'll move the code there and write an appropriate unit test.\n\nbq. How did you notice this NPE?\n\nI triggered it by calling namenode.getFileInfo() on a relative path from within my thrift contrib code (HADOOP-4707). This was an error in my code, since I was misusing the API, but it took me some serious digging to discover that the lack of initial '/' is what caused it. If the error had been the IAE instead I would have found my error much quicker.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-05-27T22:50:22.465+0000","updated":"2009-05-27T22:50:22.465+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12423154/comment/12713798","id":"12713798","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> I triggered it by calling namenode.getFileInfo() on a relative path from within my thrift contrib code (HADOOP-4707).\n\nThanks Todd.

As far as I knew, discussion of a better/new patch is supposed to go on in a new JIRA.\n{quote}\n\nThanks, Todd.  I think the right way is to revert the committed patch and work on a new patch in this issue.\n\n\nbq. I strongly disagree on the performance issue. I'd go into detail about why this cannot possibly cause a performance problem, but clearly this is an idealogical debate rather than a practical one for this case.\n\nFor practical reasons, we need numbers.  Without measurement, this becomes a debate.  getPathComponents(..) is one of the central internal methods in Namenode.  All accesses to the namespace use it.  Many of the accesses acquire the namespace lock beforehand.  Please try measuring the time required for lsr on a directory with 10 millions descendants before and after the patch.\n\n\nbq. ... a constant-time single-byte comparison.\n\nWhen we check the code of String.startWith(String), it is not a single-byte comparison.  If the patch uses the return-value of getPathNames(..), I won't have problems on it.\n\n\nbq. I think of IAEs as stricly more informative than NPEs for the developer who has committed the error.\n\nI agree that IAEs is more informative than NPEs for the developers but it is never worth to benifit developers by sacrificing the performance of production systems.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-29T17:47:29.122+0000","updated":"2009-05-29T17:47:29.122+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12423154/comment/12714532","id":"12714532","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am reverting it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-29T17:49:44.947+0000","updated":"2009-05-29T17:49:44.947+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12423154/comment/12714534","id":"12714534","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree with Nicholas.
