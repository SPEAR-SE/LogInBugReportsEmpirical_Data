Http error codes do not generate an exception.  If an exception occurs during the connect, something seriously went wrong.  Ie. connect error, could send request, SSL negotiation failed, etc.  Thus the client is left in a blocking read waiting for a response that will never come.  The methods like {{getInputStream}} read the response code and headers.\n\nOn a side note, it's also odd that the DN's jetty doesn't have a timeout while waiting for a request.  Maybe it does, but when the DN is getting jammed the timeout isn't kicking in.  To clarify for others, we are addressing three problems:\n# Socket is left dangling because the remote host closed the socket.  Not sure why unless there's a linux kernel bug (unlikely?) or the tcp FIN packets were somehow lost.\n# DN accepts the connection, but never sends a response.\n# DN host becomes a \"zombie\".  The host is inexplicably hung such that you can't even ssh or console into the box.  Sockets connect into the listen backlog, but are never accepted and processed.\n\nI'll work on a patch for 1.x.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-03-30T14:47:22.439+0000","updated":"2012-03-30T14:47:22.439+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548520/comment/13242577","id":"13242577","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
