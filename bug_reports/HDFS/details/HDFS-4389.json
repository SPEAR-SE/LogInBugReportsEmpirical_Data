The additional write to the stream after the NN restart throws the stored connect exception.\n\nThe end result is streams cannot survive a NN restart or network interruption that lasts longer than the time it takes to write a block.

I vaguely remember this being a conscious decision at some point, but maybe I made that up. Two thoughts that might be relevant:\n\n1) TestPersistBlocks seems to have started failing much more often recently, but I don't have evidence for this. Any chance something else might have caused a regression here?\n\n2) In the old code, which retried over the restart, wouldn't it end up just hitting a SafeModeException and then failing at that point, when the NN was restarted? Given that the NN usually takes 30+seconds to leave safemode after starting, any retrying clients would probably hit that and fail anyway, no?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-01-11T22:33:30.114+0000","updated":"2013-01-11T22:33:30.114+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627265/comment/13552611","id":"13552611","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"I think old retry policy used to be longer than 30s, so a restart of a small-mid cluster may not have been noticed\n\nThe short-term workaround is to change the retry policy to be something else & to block for longer.
