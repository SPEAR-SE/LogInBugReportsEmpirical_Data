I though I replied your comment. This is a problem identified in branch-1 in a few deployed environments. I will try your tests with trunk and get back to you soon.\n\nPart of the problem here is that getAdditionalBlock()(and thus addBlock()) is not real idempotent. When the client or namenode or the network between them causes error, it can leave an assigned blockID but not block created on datanode.\n\nIf addBlock() is really idempotent, the namenode can identified and delete the dangling blockID when it gets the repeated addBlock() request. To make this api idempotent is to add the offset as input parameter, so namenode can check the offset to validate if it's a repeated request. I will upload a patch for that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandonli","name":"brandonli","key":"brandonli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brandon Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-29T20:09:16.325+0000","updated":"2013-01-29T20:09:16.325+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616895/comment/13565877","id":"13565877","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Brandon.

As getAdditionalBlock() stands currently, since it is really not idempotent, new blocks can be allocated. This causes the issue of namenode reporting corruption for open files. I think changing getAdditionalBlock and adding an offset as suggested by Brandon will make it idempotent. On retry, for the same offset, from the same client, namenode can return the block that has already been allocated, instead of creating new ones.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-29T22:24:26.168+0000","updated":"2013-01-29T22:31:53.752+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616895/comment/13565925","id":"13565925","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> Actually it is a problem related to HDFS-4452.\n\nWhich problem?
