This application shows there is a very large slowdown in the processing of opens, writes, closes, and operations per second in the trunk when compared to the MR-279 branch\n\nThere have been some race conditions and locking issues fixed in trunk, which is a very good thing because these race conditions were causing the namenode to crash under load conditions (see HDFS:1257). However, the slowdown to the namenode is considerable.\n\nI am still trying to verify which changes caused the slowdown. It was originally suggested that the HDFS:988 may have caused the slowdown, but I don't think it was the culprit. I have checked out and built from SVN 3 revisions previous to HDFS988 and they all have about the same performance.\n\nHere is my environment:\nHost0: namenode daemon\nHost1-9: simulate many datanodes using org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DataNodeCluster\n \nLoadGenerator output on MR-279 branch:\nAverage open execution time: 1.8496516782773909ms\nAverage deletion execution time: 2.956340167046317ms\nAverage create execution time: 3.725259427992913ms\nAverage write_close execution time: 11.151860288534548ms\nAverage operations per second: 1053.3666666666666ops/s\n\nLoadGenerator output on trunk:\nAverage open execution time: 28.603515625ms\nAverage deletion execution time: 32.20792079207921ms\nAverage create execution time: 32.37326732673267ms\nAverage write_close execution time: 82.84752475247525ms\nAverage operations per second: 135.13333333333333ops/s\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113787","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Namenode in trunk has much slower performance than Namenode in MR-279 branch","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12513843/comment/14545870","id":"14545870","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Stale.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2015-05-15T17:52:36.316+0000","updated":"2015-05-15T17:52:36.316+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-2142/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0jtzb:"}}
