The current implementation maintains, for each priority level, an index into a list of blocks that are under-replicated.  Together, the lists compose a priority queue (see note later about branch-0.23).  In some cases when blocks are removed from a list, the caller (BlockManager) properly handles the index into the list from which it removed a block.  In some other cases, the index remains stationary while the list changes.  Whenever this happens, and the removed block happened to be at or before the index, the implementation will skip over a block when selecting blocks for replication work.\n\nIn situations when entire racks are decommissioned, leading to many under-replicated blocks, loss of blocks can occur.\n\n\nBackground: HDFS-1765\n\nThis patch to trunk greatly improved the state of the replication policy implementation.  Prior to the patch, the following details were true:\n\t* The block \"priority queue\" was no such thing: It was really set of trees that held blocks in natural ordering, that being by the blocks ID, which resulted in iterator walks over the blocks in pseudo-random order.\n\t* There was only a single index into an iteration over all of the blocks...\n\t* ... meaning the implementation was only successful in respecting priority levels on the first pass.  Overall, the behavior was a round-robin-type scheduling of blocks.\n\nAfter the patch\n\t* A proper priority queue is implemented, preserving log n operations while iterating over blocks in the order added.\n\t* A separate index for each priority is key is kept...\n\t* ... allowing for processing of the highest priority blocks first regardless of which priority had last been processed.\n\nThe change was suggested for branch-0.23 as well as trunk, but it does not appear to have been pulled in.\n\n\nThe problem:\n\nAlthough the indices are now tracked in a better way, there is a synchronization issue since the indices are managed outside of methods to modify the contents of the queue.\n\nRemoval of a block from a priority level without adjusting the index can mean that the index then points to the block after the block it originally pointed to.  In the next round of scheduling for that priority level, the block originally pointed to by the index is skipped.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[],"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12572930","id":"12572930","filename":"HDFS-4366.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagit","name":"dagit","key":"dagit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742"},"displayName":"Derek

anyway.\n\nWe could also guarantee the appropriate index is decremented properly on each call to remove.\n\nI do not think we can know in most cases whether a particular block lies to the left or right of the index since the random look-up of blocks is implemented as a hash, whereas the index is an index into a doubly-linked list.  We would have to walk from the head or tail of the doubly-linked list to find the answer.\n\nAlso, decrementing when we do not have to is not dangerous, since at worst it means we re-process a block that we would not have had to otherwise.  But we should also make sure to clamp the index at 0 to avoid unnecessary processing.

Thanks for looking into this.

(I think we also care if the set had been empty when the iterator was created, and then elements were added to the set in the meantime.)\n\nTwo concerns:\n\n* The iterator throws ConcurrentModificationException if the set has been modified since the iterator was created.  UnderReplicatedBlocks would need visibility into the iterator's internal modification version as well as the sets internal list in order to know the cases when the iterator's modification version should or should not be incremented on an add or remove to the set.\n\n* The behavior of the iterator is technically undefined if the set is modified without going through the iterator.  Even if we do manage the above correctly, we are not supposed to expect capital-I Iterators to behave when we use them this way.\n\n\nIt might be safer and cleaner to track the element in the set itself, so though we have coupling, at least it would be clearly defined via the methods provided.  We could make a new class or make small modifications to the LightWeightLinkedSet.\n\n\nI agree about the weak references.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagit","name":"dagit","key":"dagit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742"},"displayName":"Derek Dagit","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-16T16:22:36.766+0000","updated":"2013-01-16T16:22:36.766+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626665/comment/13555684","id":"13555684","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagit","name":"dagit","key":"dagit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742"},"displayName":"Derek Dagit","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Patch that removes the replication index and implements a bookmark instead.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagit","name":"dagit","key":"dagit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742"},"displayName":"Derek Dagit","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-17T00:48:51.293+0000","updated":"2013-01-17T00:48:51.293+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626665/comment/13555685","id":"13555685","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagit","name":"dagit","key":"dagit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742"},"displayName":"Derek Dagit","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Submitted to activate the QA Bot.\n\nComments welcome.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dagit","name":"dagit","key":"dagit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dagit&avatarId=25742"},"displayName":"Derek Dagit","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-17T00:49:22.355+0000","updated":"2013-01-17T00:49:22.355+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626665/comment/13555812","id":"13555812","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
