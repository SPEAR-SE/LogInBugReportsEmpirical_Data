This value is then used to populate the nnaddr parameter which is used in the web UIs and servlets. name.node.address is also used in some cases to get the UGI when nnaddr is not passed in the URL and we're not running in the NN context, eg DN jsp when security is enabled.\n\nSeems like the simplest and most compatible near term fix is to have the NN HTTP server set name.node.address to one of the IPs serving RPCs rather than the wildcard. We could make a self rpc and ask for the remote address or just resolve the IP of the NN hostname and assume there's an RPC server listening there. Tokens may use a different IP, or use the hostname if hostname based tokens are enable, though I think these already broken when the NN RPC servers bind to the wildcard because we'll currently be doing UGI lookups using the wildcard IP.\n\nA perhaps better but more involved approach would be to:\n# Separate out the \"name.node.address\" usage so it's only used when necessary (outside NN context, in NN context we can always use the \"name.node\" attribute to get the NN object directly)\n# In the cases where name.node.address is used outside the NN, think of these like clients and use the fs.defaultFs authority to determine the address of the NN. Unlike the NN (which will clobber fs.defaultFS with the wildcard) they can use it to determine the IP of the NN to talk to. This should work with security since we'll use the same IP clients would use.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-09-17T23:36:30.117+0000","updated":"2012-09-17T23:36:30.117+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12607364/comment/13458269","id":"13458269","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
