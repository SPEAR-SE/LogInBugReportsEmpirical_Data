Since the level of failure tolerance is dropped, this behavior probably should be enabled only by a flag.\n* When < 3 JNs survive, can failover still succeed and NN gets into a special mode?\n* Optionally, add a JN back once it recovers by triggering a log roll. Not trivial. See discussions in HDFS-3867.\n\n[~tlipcon], [~cmccabe], thoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jzhuge","name":"jzhuge","key":"jzhuge","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264"},"displayName":"John Zhuge","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-11-02T00:19:16.019+0000","updated":"2016-11-02T00:19:16.019+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12656125/comment/15627183","id":"15627183","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jzhuge","name":"jzhuge","key":"jzhuge","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264"},"displayName":"John Zhuge","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Somewhat related to HDFS-8298.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jzhuge","name":"jzhuge","key":"jzhuge","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264"},"displayName":"John Zhuge","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-11-02T00:24:34.460+0000","updated":"2016-11-02T00:24:34.460+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12656125/comment/15628097","id":"15628097","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Aliza","name":"Aliza","key":"aliza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aliza Itzkowitz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I am facing the following scenario:\nI have an HA HDFS setup where one of the JN is colocated on the same machine as the active NN.\nWhen I shut down the active NN machine, I expect he standby NN to become active.
