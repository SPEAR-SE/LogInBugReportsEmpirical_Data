If the user has access to the fsimage to run oiv, then they obviously can extract the state in other ways.\n\nThe oiv tool is useful in debugging the state of the fsimage.  Selectively omitting some of the state impedes debugging.  For instance, at least a year ago we discovered that expired tokens were never being purged from the fsimage.  We had clusters whose fsimage contained 2+ years of tokens which added significant time to NN startup.
