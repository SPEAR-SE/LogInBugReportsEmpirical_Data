correct replication count, and it calls {{invalidateCorruptReplicas}}:\n{code}\n    if ((corruptReplicasCount > 0) && (numLiveReplicas >= fileReplication))          \n      invalidateCorruptReplicas(storedBlock);                                        \n{code}\n\nThis function then calls {{invalidateBlock}} on the corrupt replicas (correctly). However, since it is the first block report after being active, the node which is block-reporting is still considered to have \"stale block information\", so this corruption invalidation is postponed:\n\n{code}\n2013-04-30 17:21:40,945 INFO BlockStateChange: BLOCK* invalidateBlock: blk_-XXX_5512300(same as stored) on XXX:1004\n2013-04-30 17:21:40,945 INFO BlockStateChange: BLOCK* invalidateBlocks: postponing invalidation of blk_XXX_5512300(same as stored) on XXX:1004 because 1 replica(s) are located on nodes with potentially out-of-date block reports\n{code}\n\nHowever, this code path in {{invalidateCorruptReplicas}} still runs:\n\n{code}\n    // Remove the block from corruptReplicasMap\n    if (!gotException)\n      corruptReplicas.removeFromCorruptReplicasMap(blk);\n{code}\n\nSo, after this function, all of the replicas of the block are considered live, rather than corrupt.\n\nThen, at the end of block report processing, it marks this node as no longer stale, re-processes the postponed invalidations, and sees that the block is over-replicated (6 replicas instead of 3). Since nothing is in {{corruptReplicasMap}} anymore, {{chooseExcessReplicates}} may mistakenly choose all of the good replicas for removal instead of the bad replicas.\n\nI'm working on a unit test and fix:\n- invalidateCorruptReplicas should not remove the replicas from the corruptReplicasMap unless the replicas were also removed from the blocks map.\n- separately, I think that the block-reporting node should not be considered stale during its block report -- i.e it's incorrect to postpone blocks in the above context, though I will target this as a separate patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-05-06T00:21:34.526+0000","updated":"2013-05-06T00:21:34.526+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646144/comment/13649468","id":"13649468","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Here's a hacky unit test with which I'm able to reproduce the issue (at least some of the time).
