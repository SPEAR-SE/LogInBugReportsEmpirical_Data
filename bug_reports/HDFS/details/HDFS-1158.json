The case when the datanode shuts down when it encounters a disk eror is more likely to result in \"missing\" blocks compared to the policy of decommissing first before shutting down.\n\nBut if the datanode shuts down when it encounters a disk error then the datanode does not tolerate disk failures (the point for HDFS-457). Or are you saying that we should make the datanode decomission itself rather than shutdown whenever it reaches the threshold of disk failures it is configured to tolerate? I agree, we should do that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-09-01T18:35:01.489+0000","updated":"2010-09-01T18:35:01.489+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12464735/comment/12905557","id":"12905557","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I would suggest that although you can work around the problem via HDFS-1161, which seems to effectively make HDFS-457 configurable that it would make sense to treat the primary partition as a special case.\n\nOne way to do that would be to modify HDFS-1161 to specify a list of critical volumes instead of just a minimum number.

How about the following?\n\n* A dn should decommission itself rather than shutdown whenever (a) the configured threshold of disk failures has been reached or (b) when a critical volume (specified in the config, eg the volume(s) that host the logs, pid, tmp etc) has failed. In practice an admin would specify a number of volume failures should be tolerated and specify the root volume as critical.\n\n* The configured failed.volumes.tolerated should be respected on startup.
