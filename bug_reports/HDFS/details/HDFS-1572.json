The 60 seconds is just to check if that call needs to be made, or if the duration-based checkpointing should be done.  The 60 seconds improves the granularity of the duration.  Currently it's duration+5 minutes at a maximum.  This moves it to duration+1 minute at a maximum.  The same number of RPC calls are being made since the getJournalSize() branch is only traversed every 5 minutes.  It is true that if the period has expired (once an hour by default, once a day on all production systems I've seen), we'd do a single extra RPC call.
