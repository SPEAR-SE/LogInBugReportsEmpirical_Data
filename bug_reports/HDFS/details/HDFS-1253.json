It hasn't been as common in environments in which I've worked. I'm afraid we're optimizing for a potential use case rather than a real use case. In any case, as you pointed out in IRC, if a user has an alias for hdfs, that will take precedence over their PATH setting, so it's unlikely that they'll get bitten too hard.\n\nThanks,\nJeff","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hammer","name":"hammer","key":"hammer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeff Hammerbacher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-06-22T21:44:54.667+0000","updated":"2010-06-22T21:44:54.667+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467516/comment/12881392","id":"12881392","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I know it is all over Y!'s and LI's wiki pages and internal (and sometimes external) presentations.
