I think the bug is that we're starting a new period way too frequently (every 5 seconds instead of every three weeks by default). DataBlockScanner#run calls scanBlockPoolSlice every 5 seconds, and it starts a new period every time. Instead I think we should only start a new period in BlockPoolSliceScanner#scan when the full period is up. Make sense? \n\nThanks,\nEli","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli2","name":"eli2","key":"eli2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli

Eli \nThanks for looking into this issue\n\nThis issue may be induced due to some federation related changes (I don't know which)\n\n{quote}I think the current behavior (rolling the log on each

I think the bug is that we're starting a new period way too frequently (every 5 seconds instead of every three weeks by default). DataBlockScanner#run calls scanBlockPoolSlice every 5 seconds{quote}\n\nI feel that code will be modified some thing like \n{code}\n//Sleep everytime except in the first interation.\n      if

10 blocks @time  14:53:46\nnow block scanner has scanned the blocks \nI wrote another set of blocks in 15:53:46 then this blocks will not be scanned by block scanner for next 3 weeks.\n\nNow in my change this is same as Hadoop 0.20.X behavior (Even new period is started logs are rolled only after reaching certain limit). \nwhere logs will be rolled only after certain number of blocks are reached in the logs.\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong :)\n\nThanks

Here we are persisting block scan times in verification log to track the blocks which are really completed 3weeks period or not. The problem what I got is, scan method is cleaning that verification log completely after every run. We have the behavior to take one level backup of verification log. \n\nso for every 15secs, we will lose the verification log history completely. From then onwards, blocks will be scanned again even though that blocks scanned just before 15sec back. I hope this will clear my scenario.\n\nI am not sure I am missing some thing here.\n\nEli or Andy, have tested this behavior with your patch? your patch solving that issue also?\n\nThanks\nUma","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-16T18:00:39.024+0000","updated":"2012-08-16T18:00:39.024+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12549470/comment/13436178","id":"13436178","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #2618 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/2618/])\n    HDFS-3194.

Latest patch from Amith should address this issue. \n\nI assume you're referring to HDFS-3194_7.patch .\n\nI've asked for a description before of how it solves the problem, because that was not obvious from the discussion nor from reading the diff.  I'm disappointed that nobody responded to that request, so I've gone and read the patch in detail, and I think I can finally explain the approach 7.patch is using.\n\nThe problem 7.patch is solving is: currently when we finish scanning a BP, we unconditionally rotate the log.  We keep two logs, the previous and the current logs.  We sometimes re-scan a BP before the scanPeriod completes.  If rescan happens twice within a single scanPeriod, the logs will rotate away and we will forget which blocks we previously scanned, so we will scan the first blocks again.\n\nTo fix this, 7.patch delays rotating the logs until the log has reached a predetermined size, rather than rotating when the scan completes.\n\n{code}\n+  static final int verficationLogLimit = 5;\n{code}\nWhat does this constant do?  It seems to govern the block verification log size, but I don't understand why we want to keep 5 log entries for every block in blockMap.\n{code}\n+  private static long BLOCK_SCAN_PERIOD_UNIT = 3600 * 1000;\n...\n-    this.scanPeriod = hours * 3600 * 1000;\n+    this.scanPeriod = hours * BLOCK_SCAN_PERIOD_UNIT;\n{code}\nI don't think adding a named constant here is an improvement, but if you feel that it helps, please use a more descriptive name for this constant, like MS_PER_HOUR or something similar.\n\nUma, Amith -- Have you tested 7.patch with multiple block pools and a full cluster restart?  I think the changed code will leave a dncp_block_verification_log.prev in multiple BP directories, and I suspect that the BLockPoolSliceScanner might resume from the wrong place if there are multiple verification_logs in the data directories.\n\nPer Eli's request, I'm going to close this Jira as resolved by my one-line patch which resolves the \"Block scanner runs too frequently\" bug, and open a new Jira to track the \"Block scanner repeatedly rescans blocks\" bug which is addressed by HDFS-3194_7.patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-21T19:38:21.453+0000","updated":"2012-08-21T19:38:21.453+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12549470/comment/13438999","id":"13438999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Created HDFS-3828 to track the repeated rescans issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-21T20:10:47.231+0000","updated":"2012-08-21T20:10:47.231+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12549470/comment/13439009","id":"13439009","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Andy,\nThanks for handling this issue.\nI am really sorry If you disappointed.
