Can you describe what kinds of problems you've seen \"for long-running daemons\"?  Is there a race condition where the renewer thread might not do the renewal ahead of the client operation that needs it?  Something else?\n\nA couple of questions/observations:\n# I have a question on this logic:\n{code}\n      } else {\n        token = getDelegationToken(null);\n        if (token != null) {\n          LOG.debug(\"Fetched new token: \" + token);\n        } else { // security is disabled\n          canRefreshDelegationToken = false;\n        }\n      }\n{code}\nIn the second else block, I don't see how we can reach this code path when security is disabled, because it's already guarded by an earlier check of {{canRefreshDelegationToken}}, which is initialized from {{UserGroupInformation#isSecurityEnabled}}.  Also, I seem to recall you mentioned to me offline seeing certain failures where a malformed response from the server can cause the JSON parser to return a null object.  If that happens, then this logic would turn off future attempts to refresh.  Would that effectively leave the file system instance in an unusable state, with the only workaround being to discard the instance and get a new one?\n# It's unfortunate that we have to parse the exception strings, but I don't see an alternative.  Do you know if these exception messages are consistent across prior versions?  Is there any chance that a 2.5.0 {{WebHdfsFileSystem}} instance would be incompatible with servers running earlier versions back to 2.2.0?\n# The latency of token renewal is now synchronous with the client operation.  It's probably no big deal if your internal testing on secure clusters didn't show a problem.\n# Unless I'm misreading, it seems like much of {{TokenAspect}} has become dead code.  Is there a need for further clean-up?\n# Thanks for adding those tests.  They're very thorough.  Do you think we need to add assertions that we're getting the correct token kind?  Is it also worthwhile to add some tests through swebhdfs too, and assert that they get {{SWebHdfsFileSystem#TOKEN_KIND}}?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-06-11T16:50:45.175+0000","updated":"2014-06-11T16:50:45.175+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12707492/comment/14028080","id":"14028080","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Good questions.  This design is the result of problems encountered by converting a mission critical production system to use webhdfs.  We've been internally running in production for months with this change on 0.23, and a sandbox 2.x grid.  A few of the issues: The renewer is hardcoded to assume 24h, which isn't a guarantee by any means.  The filesystem can go dead for up to a day.  Decreasing the token renewal on our QA clusters to 30s to stress token handling obviously didn't work either...  We've also encountered class loader leaks.   Filesystems would become unusable if the token expired, erroneously cancelled, or transient renewal failures such as during a NN restart.\n\n# A secure client is supposed to be able to talk to an insecure server which is why earlier logic had this same behavior.  Regarding malformed responses, NPEs used to be generated, not null returns.  My earlier work trapped and converted the NPEs, which in this case will trigger the retry loop.  Unlike the current implementation, the fs will attempt to re-acquire a token even after one operation fails which prevents the fs from becoming unusable - \n# Yes, very unfortunate, but I only did it for backwards compatibility with NNs, and also cross-compatibility with DNs that don't munge the token exception.  I checked earlier versions and it appears to have always been this way.\n# True.  We've become very performance conscience, but token renewal is infrequent if ever required by non-daemons so I consider the tiny latency worth the robustness.\n# TokenAspect is still used by hftp or I would have happily removed it...\n# I think this was covered by other tests.  I'll double check and add if necessary.
