Could you please describe your approach briefly to make the code review easier?\n\nSure.\n\nThere were multiple issues:\n1.  Storing and retrieval from {{blockMap}}. Basically problem was introduced when LightWeightGSet was used instead of HashMap for 'blockMap' in BlockPoolSliceScanner and BlockScanInfo.equals() was re-written.\n{{BlockScanInfo.equals()}} is strictly checking for the instance of BlockScanInfo, but in almost all retrievals from {{blockMap}} are done using instance of {{Block}}, so always will get null value and hence scan will happen again.\n\n2. {{logIterator.isPrevious()}} was mistakenly considering lastEntry in previous dncp log to be present in current. This was happening when prev log's last entry was read and before returning the entry, stream was being opened to read current dncp log. At that time  {{logIterator.isPrevious()}} was returning false. So every log roll was missing one entry from scan log info. Hence scan for these missed blocks will happen again before scan period (i.e. 21 days by default). \n\n3. After fix of earlier 2 issues, one more issue will come with the invalid value of {{bytesLeft}}. After one log roll, scanning itself will not happen until we write some bunch of blocks (actually equal to same number of bytes before roll) again. This is because {{bytesLeft}} should be incremented when the block was added and should be decremented when the block is scanned. But it was decrementing everytime roll happens. this was taking {{bytesLeft}} to negative value, hence scanner was just returning from {{workRemainingInCurrentPeriod()}} without scanning new blocks.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-08-28T04:37:21.864+0000","updated":"2013-08-28T04:37:21.864+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659793/comment/13763413","id":"13763413","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Vinay, thanks for the explanation!

I am still not convinced that the assignment to lastReadFile before the call to readNext is correct. Is lastReadFile meant to store the file from which the last line was read? If so then the call to readNext can change file, or did I understand it wrong?\nHere I agree that, {{readNext()}} will change the reference of {{file}}, but {{next()}} will return the {{curLine}} which was read in the previous call of {{readNext()}}, so since we are using the value of line before {{readNext()}} in current call, we should also have the previous value of {{file}} for {{lastReadFile}}. Otherwise, following problem will come.\n# Consider {{RollingLogsImpl#next()}} call is expected to return the last but one entry from {{dncp_block_verification.log.prev}}, during this time {{RollingLogsImpl#readNext()}} would read the last entry and keep in {{line}}\n# one more call to {{RollingLogsImpl#next()}}will return last entry read in previous call, but this time {{readNext()}} will open {{dncp_block_verification.log.cur}} and change {{file}} to {{dncp_block_verification.log.cur}}.\n# Now in {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#assignInitialVerificationTimes()}} while processing the last entry from prev dncp log, if {{logIterator.isPrevious()}} is called, then it will return false as the {{file}} have reference to current verification log. Hence this entry will not be appended to current verification log and block will be re-scanned after next roll.\n{code:java}                if (logIterator.isPrevious()) {\n                  // write the log entry to current file\n                  // so that the entry is preserved for later runs.\n                  verificationLog.append(entry.verificationTime, entry.genStamp,\n                      entry.blockId);\n                }\n{code}\n\nBut {{logIterator.isLastReadFromPrevious()}} will return the true in this case and no entry from prev dncp log will be missed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-09-18T09:47:52.912+0000","updated":"2013-09-18T09:47:52.912+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659793/comment/13771157","id":"13771157","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Okay that makes sense.
