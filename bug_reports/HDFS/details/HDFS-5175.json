We ended up using the approach that Lohit mentioned e.g., from application point of view, they will set the configuration property dfs.client.dscp.bit.intvalue and DSClient will call setTrafficClass before establishing the connection. Your suggestion of custom SocketFactory approach will also work. Each instance of DFSClient will create its own instance of DSCPSocketFactory; DSCPSocketFactory also needs to implement Configurable so that it can access the configured DSCP value. If we want to go with custom SocketFactory approach, we can add it to hadoop-common so that applications and other hadoop projects can use it directly.\n\nAt the higher level, there are different scenarios. The protocol could be based on DFSClient/DataTransferProtocol over TCP, or Hftp/WebHDFS over HTTP.  The data transfer should be read or write.\n\nThe primary use case for us is cross DC remote read scenario with Hftp. In order to config Socket for Hftp scenario, we ended up using httpclient.Protocol.registerProtocol with custom class of ProtocolSocketFactory, given HttpURLConnection doesn't provide a mechanism for custom SocketFactory.\n\nAs we try to open source our work to support WebHDFS, it brings up the question of \"how to config the socket in WebHDFS given httpclient isn't used by HDFS\". We did some investigation and found some possible approaches.\n\n1. HttpsURLConnection has setSSLSocketFactory. Need to test out if it works for regular http. \n2. Call Socket.setSocketFactroy() for the entire JVM. This requires custom SocketImplFactory to create custom socket based on webHDFS address.\n\nWe would like to get more inputs from others.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-08T21:40:47.223+0000","updated":"2014-10-08T21:40:47.223+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12667647/comment/14164835","id":"14164835","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

So with all these, httpclient seems to be most elegant approach, specifically org.apache.http.client.\n\nI'm a bit hesitant to take org.apache.http.client as a dependency.  My experience has been very positive with it.  It's a great library.  The problem is that it's pervasive.  I've worked in large enterprises where nearly every single application linked to it, and they didn't necessarily link to the same version.  This could set up a situation where it becomes more difficult for downstream applications to link to HDFS if they're already using org.apache.http.client.  It could turn into another dependency management challenge like Guava.  Since we publish a library rather than an application, we always need to be mindful of our dependencies and their impact on downstream applications.\n\nbq.

What additional information would you like to use?  It sounds like you want to detect HTTP URLs with the webhdfs scheme.  Is that everything, or is there more?\n\nHave you considered putting that information in a thread-local variable somewhere that your {{SocketFactory}} could access it?  This could end up being brittle code, but perhaps it's a way to work around the limitations of {{URLConnection}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-24T16:50:32.928+0000","updated":"2014-10-24T16:50:32.928+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12667647/comment/14183045","id":"14183045","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I might have been mistaken about something.

Really appreciate your input.\n\n1. Each http connection might have different DSCP values. It is a good idea to use thread local variable so that webHDFS use it to set the DSCP value and custom {{SocketFactory}} can access it . But yeah, the code might not be clean.\n\n2. For httpclient dependency, per https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-10105, I assume it is on its way out. If we keep httpclient, then we have to provide a way for webHDFS to use httpclient given its dependency on URLConnection. For example, we can make webHDFS configurable to use either URLConnection or httpclient. If people are ok that, then we are good. The other option is to have webHDFS switch from URLConnection to httpclient.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-24T17:57:12.510+0000","updated":"2014-10-24T17:57:12.510+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12667647/comment/14183233","id":"14183233","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, you're right.
