But unfortunately this specification is not true during the first phase of the\npipeline.  Overall we suggest that the namenode take into consideration the client's\nview of unreachable datanodes.  That is, if a client says that it cannot reach DN-X,\nthen the namenode might give the client another node other than X (but the namenode\ndoes not have to declare N dead). \n\nThis bug was found by our Failure Testing Service framework:\nhttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2010/EECS-2010-98.html\nFor questions, please email us: Thanh Do (thanhdo@cs.wisc.edu) and\nHaryadi Gunawi (haryadi@eecs.berkeley.edu)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113410","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Namenode returning the same Datanode to client, due to infrequent heartbeat","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467173/comment/12879859","id":"12879859","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Fixed by HDFS-630","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-06-17T17:38:36.892+0000","updated":"2010-06-17T17:38:36.892+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-1235/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0jrnj:"}}
