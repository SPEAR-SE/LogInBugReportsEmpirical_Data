Bouncing the DNs resolved the problem.\n\nIn the logs I see this exception:\n{code}\n2013-01-29 23:32:49,461 FATAL datanode.DataNode - Initialization failed for block pool Block pool BP-1852726028-<ip>-1358813649047 (storage id DS-60505003-<ip>-50010-1353106051747) service to <host>/<ip>:8020\njava.io.IOException: Failed on local exception: java.io.IOException: Response is null.; Host Details : local host is: \"<host>/<ip>\"; destination host is: \"<host>\":8020; \n        at org.apache.hadoop.net.NetUtils.wrapException(NetUtils.java:759)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client.call(Client.java:1164)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProtobufRpcEngine$Invoker.invoke(ProtobufRpcEngine.java:202)\n        at $Proxy10.registerDatanode(Unknown Source)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.io.retry.RetryInvocationHandler.invokeMethod(RetryInvocationHandler.java:164)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.io.retry.RetryInvocationHandler.invoke(RetryInvocationHandler.java:83)\n        at $Proxy10.registerDatanode(Unknown Source)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolPB.DatanodeProtocolClientSideTranslatorPB.registerDatanode(DatanodeProtocolClientSideTranslatorPB.java:149)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.register(BPServiceActor.java:619)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.connectToNNAndHandshake(BPServiceActor.java:221)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.run(BPServiceActor.java:661)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: Response is null.\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client$Connection.receiveResponse(Client.java:885)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client$Connection.run(Client.java:813)\n2013-01-29 23:32:49,463 WARN  datanode.DataNode - Ending block pool service for: Block pool BP-1852726028-<ip>-1358813649047 (storage id DS-60505003-<ip>-50010-1353106051747) service to <host>/<ip>:8020\n{code}\n\nSo somehow in BPServiceActor.connectToNNAndHandshake() we made it all the way to register(). Then failed in bpNamenode.registerDatanode(bpRegistration) with an IOException, which is not caught and has the block pool service fail as a whole.\n\nNo doubt that was caused by one of the NNs being a weird state. While that happened the active NN claimed that the FS was corrupted and stayed in safe mode, and DNs only registered with the standby DN. Failing over to the 2nd NN and then restarting the first NN and failing did not change that.\n\nNo amount bouncing/failing over the HA NNs would have the DNs reconnect to one of the NNs.\n\nIn BPServiceActor.register(), should we catch IOException instead of SocketTimeoutException? That way it would continue to retry and eventually connect to the NN.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"310664","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Datanode sometimes gives up permanently on Namenode in HA setup","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lhofhansl","name":"lhofhansl","key":"lhofhansl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Hofhansl","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lhofhansl","name":"lhofhansl","key":"lhofhansl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Hofhansl","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12629823/comment/14000999","id":"14000999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jyu%40cloudera.com","name":"jyu@cloudera.com","key":"jyu@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Juan Yu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think the patch for HDFS-2882 also fix HDFS-4455.
