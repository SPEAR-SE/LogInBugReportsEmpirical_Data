From several methods in FSNamesapce that may cause lease reassignment are now calling logSync() in their finally block after releasing the write lock.  It needs to be in a finally block, since lease recovery can throw an exception after lease reassignment.\n\nlogSync() was modified to look at a new thread local variable for determining whether there is any logged transactions by the thread.  When this variable is false, it returns right away. This variable is set whenever logEdit() is called and cleared when the log is synced. This is also unconditionally set for logSyncAll().  This does not indicate the sync state. I.e. even if it is true, another thread might have already synced all transactions by this thread.\n\nIn the lease monitor thread, logSync() is called after checkLeases() is done and the write lock is released.
