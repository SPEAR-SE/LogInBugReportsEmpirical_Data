Not Windows or MacOS X users, since those OSes don't have POSIX file names, especially when it comes to colons.  Linux users may expect posix names, but Hadoop is cross-platform.\n\nURIs are a good standard for our pathnames, a better standard than POSIX.  URIs can handle platform-dependent characters like colons just fine.  We have in the past made some exceptions in URI syntax to simplify platform compatibility.  In particular, we interpret \"C:\\foo\\bar\" as \"file:///c:/foo/bar\" without requiring escapes.  Perhaps we should continue this trend further, as Nicholas has proposed, perhaps any exceptions are a mistake, or perhaps we should not make any new exceptions.  That seems like a reasonable discussion.  But I don't see the case to abandon URIs entirely as our primary filename syntax specification.  Handling non-portable filename characters like colons with or without quotation seems a minor issue next to having an i18n-safe standard that extensibly handles protocols, hosts, ports, etc.  I don't consider that unwanted baggage.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-10-23T16:58:11.988+0000","updated":"2007-10-23T16:58:11.988+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12380564/comment/12558464","id":"12558464","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eric14","name":"eric14","key":"eric14","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"eric baldeschwieler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think it makes great sense to support a URI interface to the FS.

But we shouldn't let it limit what names are possible in various filesystems as we do today: we should support their full range, using escapes where necessary.  Unfortunately, with the current API, we can't tell when a character needs to be escaped or when it is intended as a URI meta-character.\n\nThe problem is that we construct paths in FileSystem independent code, so we don't know how to escape things.  Perhaps the solution is to remove the public Path constructor and force all Paths to be created by a FileSystem#createPath method, so that they can be escaped appropriately.\n\nThus, when running on Windows, if one passes a string with unescaped backslashes to LocalFileSystem#createPath(), the backslashes would be interpreted as directory separators, while on Linux or HDFS they'd be treated as literals.  Unescaped slashes in a Path URI will always be directory separators, since that's the URI standard we're using for interchange.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-01-14T18:03:26.251+0000","updated":"2008-01-14T18:03:26.251+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12380564/comment/12558928","id":"12558928","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eric14","name":"eric14","key":"eric14","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"eric baldeschwieler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Good idea.

If I understand it correctly, the reason for this custom URL class, is that the user can't be bothered escaping his paths. But I think the current interface leads to confusion. If FileSystem worked with just java.net.URI instead of its own Path class then it is absolutely clear on how to construct paths and when extra escaping is necessary, because Sun's/Oracle's javadocs are very clear. Of course, when working from the command line, it might still be convenient to have a convenience class like the current org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path to ease the burden of writing well formed path names.\n\nThe colon thing is not the only problem, I found, related to org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem and org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path. For example 'FileSystem.checkPath' does string comparisons on the authority part. The problem there has almost been fixed by using a case insensitive string comparison, but it will still give bad results if one of the authorities is written with an IP address while the other is written with a DNS name. \n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wjsuijle","name":"wjsuijle","key":"wjsuijle","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Wijnand Suijlen","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-12-21T11:49:43.592+0000","updated":"2011-12-21T11:49:43.592+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12380564/comment/13178272","id":"13178272","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"The latter problem you describe is seen frequently as well, when one tries to query the NameNode with a path that includes the IP instead of hostname.\n\nWijnand - Do you have a backwards-compatible solution in mind as well?\n\nAlso, am marking this as a duplicate as the ideal JIRA should be HADOOP-3257.
