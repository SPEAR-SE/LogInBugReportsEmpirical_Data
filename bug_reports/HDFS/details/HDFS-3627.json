I believe that the changes in this patch enable OIV to convert from xml back to binary image.  Our group needed this functionality, and so we made this change.

Latest patch modifies IndentedImageVisitor.java so that ImageElement.DELEGATION_KEY_EXPIRY_DATE is human-readable.  I checked the outputs for the other visitors, and only the IndentedImageVisitor and XmlImageVisitor output the Delegation Keys.\n3.
