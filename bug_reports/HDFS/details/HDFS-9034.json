In DatanodeStats.substract, we subtract the storage capacity only if it is NOT FAILED.

Storage failure will not be decided by namenode, it will reported by datanode in heartbeat.\nIf you see this code.\n\n{code}\n  synchronized void updateHeartbeat(final DatanodeDescriptor node,\n      StorageReport[] reports, long cacheCapacity, long cacheUsed,\n      int xceiverCount, int failedVolumes,\n      VolumeFailureSummary volumeFailureSummary) {\n    stats.subtract(node);\n    node.updateHeartbeat(reports, cacheCapacity, cacheUsed,\n      xceiverCount, failedVolumes, volumeFailureSummary);\n    stats.add(node);\n  }\n{code}\n\nBefore updating the new state of Storage in {{node}}, it will subtract all old storage which is in still good state. After this based on report it will update the storage state in {{node}} then again it will add the storage based on new state.\n\nSo after adding storage and before subtracting no chance of state change in storage.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=surendrasingh","name":"surendrasingh","key":"surendrasingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=surendrasingh&avatarId=30759","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=surendrasingh&avatarId=30759","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=surendrasingh&avatarId=30759","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=surendrasingh&avatarId=30759"},"displayName":"Surendra Singh Lilhore","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-12-18T19:00:51.854+0000","updated":"2015-12-18T19:00:51.854+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12862304/comment/15064719","id":"15064719","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=benoyantony","name":"benoyantony","key":"benoyantony","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benoy Antony","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Let say, node registers with  10 Storages of 2 TB.
