Later the same DN1 was requested for Decommissioning. \n* As part of Decommissioning, all the blocks residing in DN1 were requested for re-replicated to other DataNodes, so that DN1 could transition from ENTERING_DECOMMISSION to DECOMMISSIONED. \n* But, re-replication for few blocks was stuck for a long time. Eventually it got completed.\n* Digging the code and logs, found that the IN_MAINTENANCE DN1 was chosen as a source datanode for re-replication of few of the blocks. Since DataNode process on DN1 was already stopped, the re-replication was stuck for a long time.\n* Eventually PendingReplicationMonitor timed out, and those re-replication were re-scheduled for those timed out blocks. Again, during the re-replication also, the IN_MAINT DN1 was chose as a source datanode for few of the blocks leading to timeout again. This iteration continued for few times until all blocks get re-replicated.\n* By design, IN_MAINT datandoes should not be chosen for any read or write operations.
