that the Hadoop 1.0 dfshealth web page and its supporting .jsp classes did not have any security. \nWhile we can modify the web.xml file, its a temporary fix and can be accidentally removed in subsequent releases or patches. \n(/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/webapps/hdfs/WEB-INF/web.xml ) \n\nThe question is what code besides the web page for dfs health uses the _jsp.classes and if they can be removed. \n\nThe only downside that I can see is a loss of backwards compatability, along with now requiring that to view these pages, you must have an HTML5 capable browser.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=msegel","name":"msegel","key":"msegel","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=msegel&avatarId=22119","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=msegel&avatarId=22119","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=msegel&avatarId=22119","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=msegel&avatarId=22119"},"displayName":"Michael
