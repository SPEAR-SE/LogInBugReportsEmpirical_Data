At the datanode side, heartbeats are queued in the ack queue. A datanode treats a heartbeat the same as a regular data packet. The ack of a heartbeat packet is the same as a regular data packet as well. To distinguish a heartbeat from an end-of-block packet, receivePacket returns -1 when receiving an end-of-block packet.\n\nDhruba, please feel free to reach me if you need more explanation.
