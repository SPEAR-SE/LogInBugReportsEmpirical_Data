I will describe it as below.\n\n1. NN1 was Active and NN2 was Standby.\n2. NN2 was doing the checkpoint every one hour. Every time saving namespace was success, but uploading to Active was failing due to some security issue. This was continued for long time. As part of {{saveNameSpace()}} in NN2, edits from shared storage purged, which are not present in NN1's fsimage. At this time Active was having old fsimage itself, but it was running.\n3. After some time, NN1 got restarted, and NN2 became Active.\n4. The current Standby NN1, is having out of date fsimage and there is a gap between fsimage and edits in shared storage. So NN1 cannot to tailing/checkpoint.\n\n\nMy point is, Standby should not do any modifications to shared storage.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2012-12-03T05:46:51.481+0000","updated":"2012-12-03T05:46:51.481+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618137/comment/13508495","id":"13508495","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
