It was closed because, safemode checks done under fsn lock and hb also under fsn lock. So, they were protected with fsn lock. I think because of that fix, earlier issue closed. Do you see any cases, where they are running outside of fsn lock?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-25T19:15:19.822+0000","updated":"2014-01-25T19:15:19.822+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12691199/comment/13882189","id":"13882189","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"As mentioned in HDFS-5132, \nMoving SafemodeMonitor#run() checks under fsn write lock, will solve the issue. \n\n1. handleHeartbeat() is always done under fsn readlock\n2. incrementSafeBlockCount() and getNumLivedatanodes() will always will be called under writeLock().\n\nBy directly seeing the synchronization order it appears to be deadlock.
