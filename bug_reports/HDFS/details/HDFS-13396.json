executing the script produces this:\r\n{code:java}\r\nhdfs@msba02a ~ $ $HADOOP_HOME/sbin/start-dfs.sh\r\nStarting namenodes on [msba02a.bus.emory.ddns]\r\nStarting datanodes\r\n^/opt/hadoop/3: ssh: Could not resolve hostname ^/opt/hadoop/3.0.1/etc/hadoop/workers: Name or service not known\r\npdsh@msba02a: ^/opt/hadoop/3: ssh exited with exit code 255\r\nStarting secondary namenodes [msba02a]\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nIt misinterprets the value of HADOOP_CONF_DIR as one of the names of a machine it is supposed to access.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I developed involves the --hostnames option like so, changing the one-name-per-line workers file into a comma-separated list:\r\n{code:java}\r\nhadoop_uservar_su hdfs datanode \"${HADOOP_HDFS_HOME}/bin/hdfs\" \\\r\n    --workers \\\r\n    --hostnames `sed -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's/\\n/,/g' ${HADOOP_CONF_DIR}/workers` \\\r\n    --config \"${HADOOP_CONF_DIR}\" \\\r\n    --daemon start \\\r\n    datanode ${dataStartOpt}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nA similar change had to be made to stop-dfs.sh.
