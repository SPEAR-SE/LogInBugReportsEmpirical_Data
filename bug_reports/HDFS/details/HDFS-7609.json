It looks like in your case, you noticed the slowdown in the standby NN tailing the edits.  I had focused on profiling NN process startup as described in the original problem report.  I'll take a look at the standby too.\n\n{{PriorityQueue#remove}} is O\\(n\\), so that definitely could be problematic.  It's odd that there would be so many collisions that this would become noticeable though.  Are any of you running a significant number of legacy applications linked to the RPC code before introduction of the retry cache support?  If that were the case, then perhaps a huge number of calls are not supplying a call ID, and then the NN is getting a default call ID value from protobuf decoding, thus causing a lot of collisions.\n\nbq. If PriorityQueue.remove() took much time, can we utilize PriorityQueue.removeAll(Collection) so that multiple CacheEntry's are removed in one round ?\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think our usage pattern is amenable to that change.  We apply transactions one by one.  Switching to {{removeAll}} implies a pretty big code restructuring to batch up retry cache entries before the calls into the retry cache.  Encountering a huge number of collisions is unexpected, so I'd prefer to investigate that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-24T17:51:33.795+0000","updated":"2015-01-24T17:51:33.795+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12767389/comment/14290735","id":"14290735","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Specifically, the retry cache was added in 2.1.0-beta, so the theory in my last comment would only be valid if you're running RPC clients older than that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-24T17:58:37.405+0000","updated":"2015-01-24T17:58:37.405+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12767389/comment/14291438","id":"14291438","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=CarreyZhan","name":"CarreyZhan","key":"carreyzhan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carrey Zhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"same call stack is found in origin problem. sorry for not attaching it at the first moment;\n\n{noformat} \n\"main\" prio=10 tid=0x00007f03f800b000 nid=0x47ec runnable [0x00007f03ff10a000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n        at java.util.PriorityQueue.remove(PriorityQueue.java:305)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.util.LightWeightCache.put(LightWeightCache.java:217)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RetryCache.addCacheEntry(RetryCache.java:270)\n        -

That just fails fast though due to violating the protobuf spec for the message.  (I should have expected that.)  That rules out that theory.\n\nThe edit log replaying code looks to be correct for the case of old edits with a layout version before the RPC IDs were logged.  Even if that was a problem, it would just be a one-time slowdown during an upgrade, not an ongoing problem.\n\nMy next theory is that perhaps we have another case of thread-local storage biting us.  HDFS-7385 reported edit logs containing incorrect ACLs, and the root cause was that we had failed to reinitialize the thread-local op instance completely each time we used it.  Perhaps we have a similar situation here, where an op instance is getting logged, but some code path failed to update the op with a unique client ID + call ID.  If that's the case, then HDFS-7398 might help.  That patch guarantees the full state of the op gets reset on each use, including the RPC IDs.  I still don't have a repro of my own though, so I can't confirm or deny the theory.\n\nIf anyone has an edit log exhibiting the problem that they'd be willing to share, that would be a big help.  I'd be interested in seeing if there is any pattern to the kinds of ops that are hitting duplicate RPC IDs or the actual duplicate RPC ID values.  That could help narrow the problem down to a specific code path.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-12T20:35:56.770+0000","updated":"2015-02-12T20:35:56.770+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12767389/comment/14394599","id":"14394599","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"We have seen a related case. In a relatively small cluster, a user created a rogue job that caused a lot of transactions on namenode.  The edit log was rolling on its own by the ANN before reaching the regular rolling period.  Then the SBN was losing datanodes because it took incredibly long to replay the large edit segment. We normally see replay speed of about 30-80k txn/sec (this is still considerably slower compared to 0.23 or 2.x before introduction of RetryCache), but in this case it was down to 2k txns/sec, causing the one huge segment replaying to take several hours.  \n\nIn this case, the slowdown was caused by the fact that the cache was too small. Since the cache size is 0.03% of the heap by default, the hash table (GSet) had long chains in each slot during replaying the edit segment. Increasing the cache size would have made it better.  Since the transaction rate is not always a function of the size of namespace, the default cache size may not work in many cases.\n\nAlso, if the edit rolling period is greater than the cache expiration time (e.g. 10min), it may make sense to purge the entire cache in more efficient way before replaying the new segment. We could record the time when finished with a segment replay and check the elapsed time in the next segment replay.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-04-03T15:49:42.564+0000","updated":"2015-04-03T15:52:01.375+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12767389/comment/14523562","id":"14523562","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Small retryCache size can also impact the correctness, given the successful call result might have been removed from the cache by the time the client sends new retry of the same call to the new active NN.\n\nRegarding the earlier call stack showing any entry with the same client id and caller id has existed in retryCache during edit log replay, it could be due to the following scenario.\n\n1.

For example, suppose the following event sequence:\n# a delete request is served by the ANN but the client fails to receive the response \n# NN failover happens\n# the first retry request gets StandbyException since the old ANN becomes standby\n# the second retry request is sent to the other NN, which at this time has not started the transition yet\n# no cached entry has been found in the retry cache\n# before running {{FSNamesystem#delete}}, the transition starts, which blocks the {{FSNamesystem#delete}} call\n# the {{FSNamesystem#delete}} is called and fails\n\nIf the above scenario stands, maybe we can use this chance to fix it? In your patch, if the NN is in standby state, and there is no retry cache entry, should we directly throw StandbyException instead of checking it again in FSNamesystem?

In this way, we miss the chance to get the response directly from standby NN's retry cache and the client has to failover one more time. But looks like this chance is very small.

In addition, given the old ANN still keep its retry cache after it becomes standby, the application might get the cached result from the old ANN if we allow cache check when NN is in standby.\n* If we want to move the check, we might also want to move other things like checking if the system supports symlink; such  that UnsupportedOperationException can be thrown before StandbyException.
