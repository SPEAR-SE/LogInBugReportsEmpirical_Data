I re-create the file using the idea of json-bigint:\n\nI simply add 2 lines to JSON-js library ( that's how json-bigint does):\n{code}\n+                if (string.length > 15)\n+                   return new BigNumber(string);\n{code}\n{{patch-to-json-parse.txt}} shows that. I didn't change anything to {{BigNumber}}.\n\nUploaded 04 patch, tested in chrome/ie11/firefox. I still prefer 03 patch because it's simple. Both works for me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=walter.k.su","name":"walter.k.su","key":"walter.k.su","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Walter Su","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-07-21T03:17:50.655+0000","updated":"2015-07-21T03:17:50.655+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845217/comment/14634469","id":"14634469","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\\\\\n\\\\\n| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | pre-patch |   0m  0s | Pre-patch trunk compilation is healthy. |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | @author |   0m  0s | The patch does not contain any @author tags. |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | release audit |   0m 13s | The applied patch generated 2 release audit warnings. |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | whitespace |   0m  0s | The patch has no lines that end in whitespace. |\n| | |   0m 16s | |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Subsystem || Report/Notes ||\n| Patch URL | http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12746254/HDFS-8779.04.patch |\n| Optional Tests |  |\n| git revision | trunk / df1e8ce |\n| Release Audit | https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/11761/artifact/patchprocess/patchReleaseAuditProblems.txt |\n| Java | 1.7.0_55 |\n| uname | Linux asf904.gq1.ygridcore.net 3.13.0-36-lowlatency #63-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Wed Sep 3 21:56:12 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux |\n| Console output | https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/11761/console |\n\n\nThis message was automatically generated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-07-21T03:21:52.448+0000","updated":"2015-07-21T03:21:52.448+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845217/comment/14708973","id":"14708973","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=walter.k.su","name":"walter.k.su","key":"walter.k.su","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Walter Su","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Seems like we run out of options:\n1. change JsonString from server side.
