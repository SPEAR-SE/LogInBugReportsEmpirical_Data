Just reran on my laptop without triggering and it failed. This is actually where I spent most of the time. The problem is in {{commitBlockSync()}}, which I was about to file a jira for, but will explain here first.\nIn short {{commitBlockSync()}} does not remove locations from the block, which were not confirmed, that is not reducing them to {{newTargets}}.\nIn the test truncate recovery is happening _while_ DNs are restarting.  If recovery is handled _after_ the initial block reports from restarting DNs, the recovery will have only one new target, the node that was not restarted, but {{commitBlockSync()}} will not remove the other two. So {{waitReplication()}} will incorrectly show 3 replicas, but {{cluster.getBlockFile().length}} on the restarted node will show the old length 4, while it should be 3. So I had to trigger block reports after the recovery, which  removes the two invalid replicas from NN, then replication is triggered, and the test passes.\nNow, if truncate recovery happens _before_ the initial block reports from restarting nodes, then everything is fine and {{triggerBlockReports()}} is redundant.  When you see TestFileTruncate succeeds, look for block {{blk_1073742100}}, you should see that {{initReplicaRecovery}} for it is happening before {{processReport}} and succeeds on all three nodes. While in the failure case {{initReplicaRecovery}} throws exceptions on two DNs out of three.\nWe should remove {{triggerBlockReports()}} when we fix the {{commitBlockSync()}} problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-13T18:44:10.368+0000","updated":"2015-03-13T18:47:51.182+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12779661/comment/14362931","id":"14362931","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Thanks Konst for the explanation, you are right.
