going to the root cause lets see the read behavior for a file having more than 10 blocks in append case.. \nLogic: \n==== \nThere is prefetch size dfs.read.prefetch.size for the DFSInputStream which has default value of 10 \nThis prefetch size is the number of blocks that the client will fetch from the namenode for reading a file.. \nFor example lets assume that a file X having 22 blocks is residing in HDFS \nThe reader first fetches first 10 blocks from the namenode and start reading \nAfter the above step , the reader fetches the next 10 blocks from NN and continue reading \nThen the reader fetches the remaining 2 blocks from NN and complete the write \nCause: \n======= \nLets see the cause for this issue now... \nScenario that will fail is \"Writer wrote 10+ blocks and a partial block and called sync. Reader trying to read the file will not get the last partial block\" . \n\nClient first gets the 10 block locations from the NN. Now it checks whether the file is under construction and if so it gets the size of the last partial block from datanode and reads the full file \nHowever when the number of blocks is more than 10, the last block will not be in the first fetch. It will be in the second or other blocks(last block will be in (num of blocks / 10)th fetch) \nThe problem now is, in DFSClient there is no logic to get the size of the last partial block(as in case of point 1), for the rest of the fetches other than first fetch, the reader will not be able to read the complete data synced...........!! \n\nalso the InputStream.available api uses the first fetched block size to iterate. Ideally this size has to be increased\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12490392","id":"12490392","filename":"HDFS-1950.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-08-14T20:27:08.555+0000","size":16744,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12490392/HDFS-1950.1.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12481633","id":"12481633","filename":"hdfs-1950-0.20-append-tests.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-06-06T22:10:46.178+0000","size":6232,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12481633/hdfs-1950-0.20-append-tests.txt"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12480115","id":"12480115","filename":"HDFS-1950-2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ram_krish","name":"ram_krish","key":"ram_krish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ramkrishna.s.vasudevan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2011-05-23T14:43:47.244+0000","size":20113,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12480115/HDFS-1950-2.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12481632","id":"12481632","filename":"hdfs-1950-trunk-test.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-06-06T21:52:29.478+0000","size":3917,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12481632/hdfs-1950-trunk-test.txt"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12481631","id":"12481631","filename":"hdfs-1950-trunk-test.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-06-06T21:51:09.121+0000","size":4250,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12481631/hdfs-1950-trunk-test.txt"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"2577","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Blocks that are under construction are not getting read if the blocks are more than 10.

Having code like that in FSN scares me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-06-06T22:09:33.684+0000","updated":"2011-06-06T22:09:33.684+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507483/comment/13045162","id":"13045162","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"cleaned up tests on 0.20-append","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-06-06T22:10:46.228+0000","updated":"2011-06-06T22:10:46.228+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507483/comment/13045165","id":"13045165","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi,\n\n Fix is basically for two scenarios.\n  \n 1) DFSClient side changes is basically to ensure reading the partial block.\n\n 2) Problem here is, DFClient will go for next fetch based on the blocks size.\n\nConsider a corner boundary case (take prefetch size as 10 *blocksize), number of blocks are exactly same as 10.5 or 20.5 ...etc can create problem, because clinet will not even bother for next fetch because initially he will not know the size of that partial block. He will know only that 10blocks size. \n\nTo fix this problem, we have introduce on check in FSNameSystem.\n\n{code}\n     ......\n     ......\n     LocatedBlocks createLocatedBlocks = inode.createLocatedBlocks(results);\n\n     createLocatedBlocksForThePartialBlock(inode, blocks, curPos,\n\t\t\tcreateLocatedBlocks);\n\n     return createLocatedBlocks;\n  }\n\n\n   private void createLocatedBlocksForThePartialBlock(INodeFile inode,\n\t\tBlock[] blocks, long curPos, LocatedBlocks createLocatedBlocks) {\n\tint curBlk;\n\tif(blocks.length > PRE_FETCH_SIZE &&\n\t\t\tblocks.length % PRE_FETCH_SIZE == 1 && createLocatedBlocks.getFileLength() == curPos)\n    {\n\n   .........\n   ........\n{code}\n\nWhen blocks are exactly 10.5, then FSNameSystem will populate the 0.5th block id also. So, that client anyway will update the partial block size. Client can take care of reading this boundary partial block.\n\nThis patch is basically for review. Here one more problem i wanted to raise is that, prefetch size is configured.\nIn this patch i put that value as 10.\n\n{code}\n prefetchSize = conf.getLong(\"dfs.read.prefetch.size\", prefetchSize);\n {code}\nI am planning to include this property in server namenode as well, because of above reason. or Do yu have any other suggestion.\n\nOnce the patch is approved i will prepare it for 20Append and 205 branches with the provided suggestions.\n\n\nThanks\nUma\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-20T05:41:09.433+0000","updated":"2011-09-20T05:41:09.433+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507483/comment/13116307","id":"13116307","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Would be nice if the config parameter wasn't another string embedded in the src.
