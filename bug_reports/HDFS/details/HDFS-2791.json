Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"To start brainstorming a solution, here are a few scattered thoughts:\n\n- The basic requirement is that we should always accept a \"past\" valid state of the block, since we don't have any global barrier before the block is marked complete. So we need to support RBW-before-finalized even if it has a too-short length, for example. There might be other bugs similar to this if the file is re-opened for append (eg a block is reported with a too-young generation stamp racing with the re-open).\n- I think this can only happen in the _first_ block report after a block's state changes, since each block report freshly examines the DN state. So maybe we can use the block report timestamps to our advantage somehow? ie if the block changed state in between the previous block report was received and this one, the BR might have raced?\n\nThe floor is open for creative simple solutions :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-01-15T04:57:00.575+0000","updated":"2012-01-15T04:57:00.575+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538425/comment/13186421","id":"13186421","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Test illustrating the bug","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-01-15T05:38:48.058+0000","updated":"2012-01-15T05:38:48.058+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538425/comment/13191436","id":"13191436","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I've been thinking about this over the weekend and this morning. My current thinking is that the safest bet is the following approach:\n\nWhen an RBW block is reported for a finalized replica:\n- Case 1) if the block has a too-low generation stamp, mark it corrupt.\n- Case 2) if the block has the correct generation stamp, ignore it (don't add to block locations or mark it corrupt)\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n*Case 1* One of the DNs is reporting a stale generation stamp.\n\nThis means that the client must have either appended to the block or undergone pipeline recovery. There are two possibilities of why the DN is thus reporting an old genstamp:\n- 1a) it is a \"delayed block report\" as described in this JIRA. We will later see a correct/up-to-date BR for the same block.\n\nHere it is OK to mark the block as corrupt, since when we sent the \"invalidate\" message to the DN, we'll invalidate the old genstamp specifically. So when the DN receives the invalidation, it will not delete the new (correct) replica, but rather just ignore it.\n\n- 1b) the client lost its connection to this DN node and did a pipeline recovery before closing the file. In this case we will never see a correct/up-to-date BR.\n\nHere it's also OK to mark it as corrupt, because it really is corrupt (ie didn't participate in the block recovery).\n\n\n*Case 2* correct generation stamp, but RBW report on a FINALIZED block\n\nAs far as I can think, the only way we can get here is with the \"delayed report\" scenario described in this JIRA. The reasoning is as follows:\n- in order for the client to call completeBlock(), it must have gotten a successful pipeline close from all of the DNs in the current pipeline\n- if the pipeline nodes had changed, it would have gotten a different generation stamp. So, all of the nodes that have a block with the correct genstamp were in the closed pipeline\n- thus all of the nodes with the correct genstamp would have the correct length and state, and any report otherwise is because of a message delay.\n\nThe only other possibility is something like a machine crash which doesn't replay the ext3 journal causing some blocks to get rolled back to a prior state. In this case, upon restart, the DN would change it to be a RWR (ReplicaWaitingRecovery) and we could use the original logic of marking it corrupt.\n\n\nI think the above solution is safer and simpler than any other solutions I could come up with.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-01-23T20:46:26.943+0000","updated":"2012-01-23T20:46:26.943+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538425/comment/13191455","id":"13191455","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Attached implementation of the above along with a fleshed out unit test.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-01-23T21:12:44.790+0000","updated":"2012-01-23T21:12:44.790+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538425/comment/13191478","id":"13191478","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Seems to be a bug in this that's making some tests timeout.

Imagine the following sequence, with two NNs, NNA (active) and NNB(standby):\n\n1) file with replication count 1 is being written\n2) DN generates a block report with RBW and starts sending it to NNB. The network has a problem and this block report doesn't arrive for a while (eg DN is temporarily partitioned from NNB, so the DN keeps retrying for minutes)\n3) file is closed\n4) NNB tails edits, sees OP_ADD and OP_CLOSE, marks the block as COMPLETE, even though it hasn't seen any replicas yet.\n5) Network partition is resolved, and NNB receives the block report with an RBW replica, mistakenly marking it as corrupt.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-01-25T01:39:49.225+0000","updated":"2012-01-25T01:39:49.225+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538425/comment/13192778","id":"13192778","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":">> Case 2) if the block has the correct generation stamp, ignore it (don't add to block locations or mark it corrupt)\n> This looks ok at first sight.

I had originally thought about doing that, but ATM convinced me otherwise - our thinking is now that this case only occurs because of a temporary delay in transmission of the \"correct\" state. So we'll always expect to see the FINALIZED report come in soon after one of these RBW replicas. Given that, I think it is simpler/safer to ignore it in all cases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-01-25T01:45:16.042+0000","updated":"2012-01-25T01:45:16.042+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538425/comment/13192800","id":"13192800","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"+1 ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-01-25T02:21:28.601+0000","updated":"2012-01-25T02:21:28.601+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538425/comment/13192831","id":"13192831","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":">Case 2 ....\nI agree that it it is safer to ignore it if the gen-stamp AND length match rather than mark the replica as corrupt.\n\n>HA case .. block will be marked as corrupt till next full block report.\nIsn't this addressed by one of 2 events: \n* the AddBlock from the DN arrive at the NNB shortly after the Block report containing RBW.

Eli: >... overloading the notion of a corrupt block, eg it doesn't seem like receiving a RBR for a complete block implies that block is corrupt\nbq. Eli this patch ignores a RBW with same generation stamp but marks RWR as corrupt. Do you mean RWR should not be marked as corrupt (i.e. a typo s^RBR^RWR^).\n\nSanjay: correct, made a typo, s/RBR/RWR/. I meant that we are considering RWR blocks corrupt, even though a complete block under recovery is not necessarily corrupt right?  Ie we're not marking RWR blocks corrupt here because we think they are actually corrupt, but because we want them to be deleted. This is a separate issue from this patch since it does not change the behavior for the RWR case, however I mentioned it here because this is an example of where considering blocks corrupt that are not actually corrupt bit us.
