Once HDFS-4068 you can rebase on it and remove all the cleanup.\n\nComments:\n- We can remove the dnAddress check for null now that it looks like NNThroughputBenchmark always uses RPC \n- Rename getNodeNames something more explicit like getNodeNamesForHostFiltering?\n- Rather than have updateNodeAddr let's use the two setters explicitly, easier to follow the registration behavior (ie we explicitly clobber the ip and peer hostname). Hopefully we'll eventually be able to make DatanodeID immutable so we don't update it in place.\n- Let's update getNodeNames to include the DN hostname since that is the current behavior, and file a separate jira for removing the use of the DN reported hostname here (or perhaps removing the reported DN field entirely)\n- Let's update hashCode in a separate change. I think this will need some additional changes like modifying Host2NodesMap to use DataNodeID hashCode, it currently explicitly uses the IP addr for the hash and ignores DatanodeID#hashCode.\n- Add a javadoc to testDNSLookups indicating that we're testing that the NN does *not* do DN lookups after registration \n- Nit, I'd create the SM inline via \"System.setSecurityManager(new SecurityManager() {\" so it's clear it's only associated with this DNS tests (like TestDFSShell for eg)\n- Nit, rename \"lookups\" in the test to \"initialLookups\"","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-17T19:21:50.745+0000","updated":"2012-10-17T19:21:50.745+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12609538/comment/13478350","id":"13478350","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I'm making the changes, but I found that I cannot remove the null check for dnAddress in the nodemanager.

Unfortunately, this had an unintended side effect of breaking on Windows, at least for single-node developer setups, because of the code change to reject registration of an unresolved data node:\n\n{code}\n  public void registerDatanode(DatanodeRegistration nodeReg)\n      throws DisallowedDatanodeException {\n    InetAddress dnAddress = Server.getRemoteIp();\n    if (dnAddress != null) {\n      // Mostly called inside an RPC, update ip and peer hostname\n      String hostname = dnAddress.getHostName();\n      String ip = dnAddress.getHostAddress();\n      if (hostname.equals(ip)) {\n        LOG.warn(\"Unresolved datanode registration from \" + ip);\n        throw new DisallowedDatanodeException(nodeReg);\n      }\n{code}\n\nOn Windows, 127.0.0.1 does not resolve to localhost.  It reports host name as \"127.0.0.1\".  Therefore, on Windows, running pseudo-distributed mode or MiniDFSCluster-based tests always rejects the datanode registrations.  (See HADOOP-8414 for more discussion of the particulars of resolving 127.0.0.1 on Windows.)\n\nPotential fixes I can think of:\n\n# Add special case logic to allow registration if ip.equals(\"127.0.0.1\").  This is the quick fix I applied to my dev environment to unblock myself last Friday.\n# Add a check against NetUtils.getStaticResolution and register it with NetUtils.addStaticResolution(\"127.0.0.1\", \"localhost\") somewhere at initialization time.\n\nDo you have an opinion on the best way to fix it?  I have a Windows VM ready to go, so I can code the patch and test.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-12-03T17:14:03.437+0000","updated":"2012-12-03T17:14:03.437+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12609538/comment/13508879","id":"13508879","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"The check was floated up out of {{DatanodeManager.checkInList}} which rejected unresolvable nodes.
