We would have to re-create the file and write L/2 bytes, then close it.  However, the new file we create will be owned by bob, not by superuser.  This is an unfixable problem because bob's DFSClient may not even have the credentials to create the file as superuser.\n\nAnother consideration is that writing out L/2 bytes could be very expensive.  For example, if we have a 1GB file, that's 512 MB we have to buffer and re-write in order to perform the truncate operation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
