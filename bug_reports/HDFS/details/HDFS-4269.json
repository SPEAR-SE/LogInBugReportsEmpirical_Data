Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"We merged this change to branch-trunk-win on Friday, 11/30. Unfortunately, this had an unintended side effect of breaking on Windows, at least for single-node developer setups, because of the code change to reject registration of an unresolved data node:\n\n{code}\npublic void registerDatanode(DatanodeRegistration nodeReg)\n      throws DisallowedDatanodeException {\n    InetAddress dnAddress = Server.getRemoteIp();\n    if (dnAddress != null) {\n      // Mostly called inside an RPC, update ip and peer hostname\n      String hostname = dnAddress.getHostName();\n      String ip = dnAddress.getHostAddress();\n      if (hostname.equals(ip)) {\n        LOG.warn(\"Unresolved datanode registration from \" + ip);\n        throw new DisallowedDatanodeException(nodeReg);\n      }\n{code}\n\nOn Windows, 127.0.0.1 does not resolve to localhost. It reports host name as \"127.0.0.1\". Therefore, on Windows, running pseudo-distributed mode or MiniDFSCluster-based tests always rejects the datanode registrations. (See HADOOP-8414 for more discussion of the particulars of resolving 127.0.0.1 on Windows.)\n\nPotential fixes I can think of:\n# Add special case logic to allow registration if ip.equals(\"127.0.0.1\"). This is the quick fix I applied to my dev environment to unblock myself last Friday.\n# Add a check against NetUtils.getStaticResolution and register it with NetUtils.addStaticResolution(\"127.0.0.1\", \"localhost\") somewhere at initialization time.\n\nBelow is a short code sample that demonstrates the problem. This is a very rough approximation of the IPC Server/Connection and DatanodeManager logic. When I run this server on Mac, it prints \"connection from hostName = localhost, hostAddress = 127.0.0.1, canonicalHostName = localhost\" for any client connection.

HDFS-3990 made a code change to reject registration of datanodes for which the hostname corresponding to the IP address could not be resolved.  The reason for this change is that allowing registration of a datanode with an unresolved hostname caused performance problems later.  The namenode web UI's list of live datanodes would attempt a reverse DNS lookup for every unresolved data node.  For a cluster of thousands of nodes, the massive number of reverse DNS lookups would cause a performance problem.\n\nThis issue, HDFS-4269, specifically covers some fallout of the HDFS-3990 patch that we observed on Windows.  For Windows, a reverse DNS lookup of 127.0.0.1 does not resolve to localhost.  AFAIK, Windows is the only OS that has this behavior.  Since usage of localhost is common in the test suites, we added an escape hatch for 127.0.0.1 to keep the test suites passing on Windows.\n\nYou mentioned the specific case of running a VM with a DHCP-assigned address and bridged networking.  You're right that you need to arrange for the reverse DNS lookup to work.  When I've run this kind of setup, I've done it in one of two ways:\n\n# Edit /etc/hosts to map 192.168.1.94 (or any other DHCP-assigned address) to a specific hostname.\n# Run my own local name server to do the same.\n\nIn both of these cases, a VM reboot may invalidate your configuration (either the /etc/hosts entry or the A record in your local name server) by getting a different DHCP-assigned address.  In theory, you could write some automation to update /etc/hosts or the local name server with your current DHCP-assigned address on boot.  In practice, I've personally never bothered to take it this far, because my VMs change their IP addresses relatively infrequently, and a manual update isn't too cumbersome.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think there is anything we can do in the Hadoop code itself to simplify this.  I can't think of a reliable way to detect the difference between an unresolvable IP address and a \"testing\" IP address, for which name resolution isn't important.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-15T03:44:03.514+0000","updated":"2013-04-15T03:44:03.514+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618826/comment/13631498","id":"13631498","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jagane","name":"jagane","key":"jagane","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jagane Sundar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for your explanation, Chris.\n\nThe performance problem you mention is not in the data path or the metadata path of HDFS, right?\nRequiring a valid reverse DNS lookup for all datanode IP addresses seems like a drastic solution to a performance problem in an out-of-band management service.\n\nI am going to sound like the crusty curmudgeon that I am when I say this: For time immemorial, TCP services have worked with raw IP addresses that do not have valid reverse lookups. I think that HDFS should work with raw IP addresses.\n\nEditing /etc/hosts or creating a new DNS server are not solutions. The client machines now need to know of this new DNS mapping.

Performing the lookups outside of the namespace lock (a very good change in and of itself!) does not alleviate the performance penalty associated with say lookups of 4K nodes.\n\nbq.  Requiring a valid reverse DNS lookup for all datanode IP addresses seems like a drastic solution to a performance problem in an out-of-band management service.\n\nIt's bigger than that.  The allow and deny lists allow either hostnames or IP addresses to be specified.  Let's say you chose to reject or decommission nodes by _hostname_.  There's a DNS hiccup, DNS outage, packet loss that drop the udp requests, that causes a reverse lookup to erroneously fail - now that node slips back in and becomes active again!\n\nIf you want to allow unresolvable IPs, then you essentially have to ban hostnames in the allow and deny host lists.\n\nEditing /etc/hosts on the NN should be sufficient.

The TCP endpoint gives you an IP address, not a hostname. It seems like there are two places in the NameNode where you might want to convert these IP addresses to hostnames:\n\n1. If the hosts allow and deny files have hostnames, then the NameNode must do a reverse DNS lookup of the IP address and ensure that the hostname that the reverse DNS lookup returns is not in the deny file.\n\n2. In the web UI, the NameNode may want to display a human friendly name, instead of an IP address. (Even this could be an error, because the browser could resolve the hostname to an IP address that the DataNode is not listening on)\n\nMy belief is that the NameNode should operate exclusively using IP addresses. Only in the above two places should there be any DNS reverse lookups.\n\nWould it not be better to move 'does reverse lookup succeed' check to the inExcludedHostsList method in DatanodeManager.java? This way we will be saying:\n'We need to exclude host X, and we could not reverse lookup your IP, so we do not know whether you are in the excluded list or not. Sorry. We cannot allow a connection from you.'\n\nThe check is now in registerDatanode. What we are saying is:\n'We are unable to do a reverse lookup on your IP address. So we cannot allow any connections from you'\n\nThe problem is over by the east, and we blew out a big giant hole of functionality in the west.

I reviewed my change in HDFS-3990.  I didn't alter the handling of the allow/deny lists.\n\nThe original implementation always did a reverse lookup in {{DatanodeManager.checkInList}} – this caused massive dns lookups for the web pages and new node registrations.  {{checkInList}} when called via {{inHostsList}} returned false if the host was unresolvable.  Within {{DatanodeManager#registerDatanode}}, the check {{!inHostsList(nodeReg)}} would throw a {{DisallowedDatanodeException}}.\n\nAll I did was hoist the reverse lookup from {{checkInList}} up into {{registerDatanode}}, and store the resolved hostname for later use by {{checkInList}} to prevent unnecessary reverse lookups.  The localhost bug was introduced because I accommodated tests faking the hostname.  I compared the ip and hostname instead of checking {{InetSocketAddress#isUnresolved}}.  On non-windows systems, 127.0.0.1 resolves to localhost; windows wrongly claims 127.0.0.1 resolves to 127.0.0.1, hence it appeared unresolved.\n\nRegarding your points:\n# Not requiring hosts to resolve if there are only IPs in _both_ lists may be feasible.\n# If you have multiple A records for your datanodes that confuse your browser, I think the {{DFSClient}} will be equally confused.\n# Long ago, the NN operated only on IPs.  It was changed to support grids using public IPs, and a private intra-grid network with different IPs, where the public and private networks resolved a hostname to the correct IP.\n# The 'does reverse lookup succeed' cannot be only for exclusion.
