This explained why I started seeing spikes of getEZForPath calls when we don't even use encryption zones!\n\nIMHO, rename should throw an IOE-derived IncompatibleEncryptionZonesException instead a bland IOE.  This would allow a client to blindly attempt the rename, catch the specific exception, fallback to copy if required.  In the vast majority of cases that removes 2 junk calls for non-existence EZs.\n\nIn the name of compatibility, I lean towards reverting the incompatible change.  This is one of the reasons 2.8 certification has ground to a halt.  One could argue that most calls throw FNF because they query or manipulate a specific path.  If it's not there, game over.  But in the case of encryption zones and erasure coding, these features are tree-based.  Properties are inherited by searching up the ancestor paths so it's more about asking \"what _is or would_ the EC or EZ be for this path?\".\n\nIn any case, it now requires 3X rpcs to do a simple rename.  I want specific exceptions to eliminate the 2 junk calls.  The trend of new \"always on\" features... with direct or indirect non-trivial performance costs... for common operations... when not used... is becoming rather irritating.

So let's say I want to rename from /dir1/file to  /dir2/dir-with-EZ.  The result may be /dir2/dir-with-EZ/file.  If the parent is queried, ie. /dir2, the rename will look like it should succeed (src and dest have no EZ) but will fail.  The old debatably broken semantics cover this case.\n\nI realized another similar use case to consider.  Let's I want to create a file only if the path is under an EZ.  Should I have to query the parent's EZ, catch FNF, repeat until I find an EZ or hit the root dir?  The no-FNF semantics require 1 RPC.\n\nIn the end we may need to consider preserving the no-FNF semantics and add specific exceptions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-09-29T15:46:19.961+0000","updated":"2016-09-29T15:46:19.961+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13003933/comment/15533208","id":"15533208","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"+1 on revert.
