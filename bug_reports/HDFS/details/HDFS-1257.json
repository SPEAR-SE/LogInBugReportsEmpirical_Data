In my case, it is a case of iteration and modification of recentInvalidateSets happening at the same time (reference the stack traceback). I can reproduce this fairly often using an environment that stresses the namenode.\n\nWas there a resolution to this issue? I agree that there needs to be a general solution to protect recentInvalidateSets.\n\nIf you don't have any objections, I will go ahead and post a patch that is (possibly) more of a general solution.\n\nThanks,\n-Eric","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-06-28T16:38:28.882+0000","updated":"2011-06-28T16:38:28.882+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467604/comment/13059347","id":"13059347","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aderen","name":"aderen","key":"aderen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"ade","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"hi,\n\nI believe that I am running into this problem 2 times.  \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aderen","name":"aderen","key":"aderen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"ade","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2011-07-04T07:26:36.895+0000","updated":"2011-07-04T07:26:36.895+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467604/comment/13082477","id":"13082477","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I am still seeing this race condition on trunk.\n\nI have attached a patch that seems to fix it for me.\n\nI have synchronized() around the recentInvalidateSets Map in the BlockManager class.\n\nMost of the changes are whitespace that needed to happend because the code is now contained within synchronized() blocks.\n\nSince iterations through Map lists will cause the ConcurrentModificationException if something is modifying the list, I synchronized() around adds, removes, and iterations to the Map.\n\nI have not yet included a unit test.

However, that assumption is based on a dependency that the underlying implementation doesn't iterate in order to do the \"get\" or \"size\". So, I went ahead and put a synchronized() around these places as well, just as you suggested.\n\n\n> Please use junit 4 in the test (i.e. org.junit.* instead of junit.framework.*).\nDone\n\n\n> Suggestion: how about move recentInvalidateSets and the related method to a standalone class?\nI looked into doing this, and the methods that manipulate the recentInvalidateSets object are fairly dependent on and intertwined with the BlockManager class.

Thanks for your patience in getting through the reviews of this.\n\nI'm confused as to why 1) you are seeing this error and 2) it is timing out for you. I'm not seeing that error in my environment. And, as for the timeout, even before when it was taking 3 minutes, it should not have timed out. There are a lot of unit tests that take longer than 3 minutes.\n\nAnyway, as for taking it out, the reason for doing so would be that the test is not sufficient to thoroughly test the race condition. A unit test just can't stress the namenode in the MiniDFSCluster enough to exercise this race condition. To hit this race condition, a test must be in a large cluster with a very active set of DFS actions happening over an extended period of time. There just isn't enough memory on a single host to create enough DNs in the MiniDFSCluster. And, even if there were enoubh memory, a unit test should not be running for a very long period.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-08-17T15:56:10.465+0000","updated":"2011-08-17T15:56:10.465+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467604/comment/13086423","id":"13086423","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> ... 1) you are seeing this error ...\n\nThe error is in the Jenkins machine.
