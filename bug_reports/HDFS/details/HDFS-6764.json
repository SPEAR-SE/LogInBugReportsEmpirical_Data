Skipping missed intervals + entropy is exactly what Nathan and I considered as the solution.  We haven't had a chance to verify.  The entropy required is probably an random delay for the first heartbeat.  That'll spread out DNs that all connected and blocked while the NN is blocked during something like lengthy BR processing.\n\nThe more interesting part of the puzzle, which the aforementioned changes will probably mask/fix, is what causes heartbeats to an active to clump together in a semi-rhythmic cycle?  I suspect full BRs but I think I saw a similar jagged pattern on another cluster...
