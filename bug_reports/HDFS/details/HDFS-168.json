May be also related to \"tmp\" directories discussion in HADOOP-4663.\nWhen I open a file for append the last block of the file is copied from the main storage to a tmp directory to be treated as if it is just being created. Then on the next blockReport since the block is not in the main storage it will not be reported to the name-node. And the name-node should mark it as under-replicated triggering replication process. Replication will not be able to proceed as all replicas on other machines are in the same state, that is in tmp directory. Is that a problem?\nThe main problem here I think is that the name-node removes the location of the replica if it was not reported during a block report. If all 3 nodes report that they don't have the block, the block will become not readable, that is the name-node cannot give clients any locations of the block.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-01-27T17:34:23.766+0000","updated":"2009-01-27T17:34:23.766+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12412344/comment/12667771","id":"12667771","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":">When I open a file for append the last block of the file is copied from the main storage to a tmp directory to be tre\n\nThe block also gets a new generation stamp. \n\n> And the name-node should mark it as under-replicated triggering replication process\n\nNamenode does not trigger re-replication for blocks that belong to files that are being written (or appended to).\n\nLet me try to explian this with an example. Suppose a file has one block blk_10_25. The generation stamp of this block is 25. Suppose this block is not full and is the only block in the file. Suppose a client wants to append a few bytes to this file. The client instructs the datanode to stamp this block with a generation stamp of 26. The block now becomes blk_10_26 and is moved from the real block directory to \"blockBeingWritten\" directory (see HADOOP-4663). The namenode metadat is also updated to record the block for this file to be blk_10_26. Block reports from this datanode will not have the block blk_10_25, but this is not a problem blk_25_10 is not a valid block anymore. These details are explained in th design doc for appends (HADOOP-1700).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-01-27T19:40:25.114+0000","updated":"2009-01-27T19:40:25.114+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12412344/comment/12667782","id":"12667782","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> Block reports from this datanode will not have the block blk_10_25\n\nThe block report from the data-node will not have neither blk_10_25 nor blk_10_26 or any block with id 10.\nBut the name-node has this block in its block map.
