If we don't find enough targets to place replicas in the first attempt then second attempt is invoked with the aim to use stale nodes in order to find the remaining targets. This second attempt breaks node group rule of not having two replicas in the same node group.\n\nInvocation of the second attempt looks like this:\n{code}\nDatanodeDescriptor choseTarget(excludeNodes,...) {\n  oldExcludedNodes=new HashMap<Node, Node>(excludedNodes);\n\n  // first attempt \n\n  // if we don't find enough targets then\n  if (avoidStaleNodes) {\n    for (Node node : results) { \n      oldExcludedNodes.put(node, node); \n    } \n    numOfReplicas = totalReplicasExpected - results.size();\n    return chooseTarget(numOfReplicas, writer, oldExcludedNodes, blocksize, maxNodesPerRack, results, false);\n  }\n}\n{code}\nSo, all excluded nodes from the first attempt which are neither in oldExcludedNodes nor in results will be ignored and the second invocation of chooseTarget will use an incomplete set of excluded nodes. For example, if we have next topology:\n dn1 -> /d1/r1/n1\n dn2 -> /d1/r1/n1\n dn3 -> /d1/r1/n2\n dn4 -> /d1/r1/n2\n and if we want to choose 3 targets with avoidStaleNodes=true then in the first attempt we will choose 2 targets since we have only two node groups. Let's say we choose dn1 and dn3. Then, we will add dn1 and dn3 in the oldExcudedNodes and use that set of excluded nodes in the second attempt. This set of excluded nodes is incomplete and allows us to select dn2 and dn4 in the second attempt which should not be selected due to node group awareness but it is happening in the current code!\n\nRepro:\n - add CONF.setBoolean(DFSConfigKeys.DFS_NAMENODE_AVOID_STALE_DATANODE_FOR_WRITE_KEY, true); to TestReplicationPolicyWithNodeGroup.\n - testChooseMoreTargetsThanNodeGroups() should fail.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"348286","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"BlockPlacementPolicyWithNodeGroup does not work correct when avoidStaleNodes is true","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nikola.vujic","name":"nikola.vujic","key":"nikola.vujic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nikola Vujic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nikola.vujic","name":"nikola.vujic","key":"nikola.vujic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nikola Vujic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12668055/comment/14038630","id":"14038630","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nikola.vujic","name":"nikola.vujic","key":"nikola.vujic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nikola Vujic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"This is fixed in HDP 2 with the new implementation of the block placement policy with node group.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nikola.vujic","name":"nikola.vujic","key":"nikola.vujic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nikola Vujic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-06-20T09:54:39.795+0000","updated":"2014-06-20T09:54:39.795+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-5184/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1o06v:"}}
