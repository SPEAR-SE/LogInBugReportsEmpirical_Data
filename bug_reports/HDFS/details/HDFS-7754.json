However, this can be done with better tools for class like BackupImage. IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC's has false alarm issue as described in its doc. It has a limited support of exclusion rule, which only allows to ignore checking lock for a member variable rather than whitelist/blacklist of locked/unlocked methods. Unfortunately, that is what is supported findbugs 3.0. Based on that, I think [~ajisakaa]'s proposed fix is reasonable. Please feel free to share your thoughts on a better fix.

IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC's has false alarm issue as described in its doc. \n\nI'm unsure the value of introducing a (possible benign) race either. Does the race improve the performance significantly? Does it sit on the critical path?\n\nI think that the values of the time of developer / maintainers are under-appreciated. Note that it takes the time of developers / maintainers to reason about it even if it's a false alarm -- unfortunately it is error-prone and ineffective [1]. Arguably putting the related code in a critical section is not the greatest fix, but given that fact that it is not in a performance-critical path I think it is okay to fix the race and to save the time of every developers and maintainers. If it is indeed a performance issue we can revisit it.\n\nReference:\n\n1. S. Savage et al.. Eraser: A Dynamic Data Race Detector for Multithreaded Programs. In SOSP'97.
