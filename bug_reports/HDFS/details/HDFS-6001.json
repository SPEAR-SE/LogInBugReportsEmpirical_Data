(Again, we don't have the larger context here, but I'm going to take a guess that this is your goal.)  In a federated deployment, this is complicated by the fact that the namesystem is spread across multiple hosts, so the host \"behind\" the file system is going to be sensitive to a specific path.\n\nYou could potentially use {{FileSystem#resolvePath}} to get the fully-qualified {{Path}} for a specific file system path:\n\nhttp://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.html#resolvePath(org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path)\n\nThis method fully resolves through the client-side mount table and also symlinks.  Then, you could call {{Path#toUri}} to change the {{Path}} back into a {{URI}}:\n\nhttp://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/Path.html#toUri()\n\nAt this point, you'd have a URI containing the real host that backs that part of the namespace.\n\nTherefore, in addition to statements from others that this is not a bug, I'd also say that there is no functionality gap that needs to be filled.\n\nDoes that answer your questions?  If so, then I'd like to resolve as won't fix later today.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-24T17:30:28.768+0000","updated":"2014-02-24T17:30:28.768+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12696847/comment/13910863","id":"13910863","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jinghe","name":"jinghe","key":"jinghe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jerry He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for all the comments.
