That is when you start the checkpoint, and fail NN before modifying anything in the namespace.\n\nDeleting editsNew, is probably valid, but not consistent, since at this stage NN is in read-only mode. That is if something goes wrong we should leave the storage directory in exactly the same state as it was before the startup.\n\nI propose to increment numEdits if editsNew exists. This will trigger saving namespace after loading. So just one line change:\n{code}\n. if (editsNew.exists() && editsNew.length() > 0) {\n+   numEdits ++;\n    edits = new EditLogFileInputStream(editsNew);\n    numEdits += loader.loadFSEdits(edits);\n    edits.close();\n  }\n{code}\nWell, may be not one line as you need to increment even if {{editsNew.length() == 0}}.\n\nYour test should work in this case as well.
