being recovered, which interrupts the current writer thread (receiving the block) at FsDatasetImpl.recoverRbw(FsDatasetImpl.java:738).\n* This hold FSDatasetImpl lock and calls for writer.join() at ReplicaInPipeline.stopWriter(ReplicaInPipeline.java:157)\n# Writer thread is interrupted.

Since the FSDataset lock is held, which is crucial for the datanode, the heart beat thread, data transceiver threads are blocked waiting on FSDataset lock.\n\nHere is a simple patch that adds timeouts to the join call.
