However, we are seeing environments where Hadoop Admins want to provide repcount=1 (with resilient writes) transparently to Hadoop applications - in particular, those for which it is not feasible to modify the file creation process (HBase, etc.).  Having a server-side configuration parameter seems like a cleaner way to accomplish this.  Server-side enforcement of pipeline size also seems somewhat more complementary to where HDFS is headed with server-side tiered storage policies (HDFS-4672).\n\nWould you be more amenable to a patch that exposed the {{minPipelineSize}} as a _client_ property ({{dfs.client.minPipelineSize}}) that implements the algorithm you suggest above?  This would give the us the end application transparency we need, but still allow clients ultimate control of the pipeline depth.  This approach does have a few downsides compared to the server-side approach:\n* Does not allow the temporary replicas can be pruned incrementally as the file is written (must wait until the file is closed)\n* The replication remains at 2 if the client crashes before the file is closed\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sirianni","name":"sirianni","key":"sirianni","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sirianni&avatarId=16970","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sirianni&avatarId=16970","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sirianni&avatarId=16970","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sirianni&avatarId=16970"},"displayName":"Eric Sirianni","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-11-01T18:07:24.959+0000","updated":"2013-11-01T18:07:24.959+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12676121/comment/13811661","id":"13811661","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

If the target storage is reliable then what do we gain by adding an extra replica in the pipeline?\nbq. Resiliency against transient network errors.\n\nYes, network errors, but also host failure.  In the architecture we are targeting, we use:\n* RAID for resiliency to disk failure \n* Shared storage for resiliency to host failure (this is enabled via an {{FsDatasetSpi}} plugin that my team is developing)\n\nThese combine to make replicaCount=1 a viable alternative for some use cases.  However, the host failure resiliency via shared storage is only applicable once the block is finalized after the initial write.  Therefore, for a being-written block, this architecture is still susceptible to data loss via host failure.  The solution proposed by this JIRA is to _temporarily_ use replicaCount=2 during the initial write pipeline (for host failure resiliency) and then drop back to replicaCount=1 post-block-finalize (for storage efficiency).  \n\nThe initial proposal was to control this in the NameNode by vending a pipeline of length 2 even if the client requested replicaCount=1.  In many ways, this is a cleaner solution as it more directly models the desired architecture (replicaCount is always 1, but pipeline length is forced to be > 1) .  However, Colin expressed some concerns about \"overriding\" the client's request at the NameNode.  We are considering at a client-side only approach as a fallback alternative.

I am not sure what you mean here. Can you add more details?\n\nMy observation was that HDFS-4672 seems to imply/propose moving towards having the client specifying the desired service level of a file in terms of the _\"what\"_ (e.g. a  class of storage/service) instead of the _\"how\"_ (replication count, disk type, caching).  With this backdrop, it seems reasonable for the server to guarantee a certain degree of write resiliency (the \"what\") independent of the replication count (the \"how\").  Perhaps I'm misinterpreting where things are headed, but moving to a more \"policy based\" model seems like step in the right direction.\n\nbq. RAID setup without spare disks to rebuild the array could cause more data loss.\nbq. I feel that this looks more like a hack\nLet's try to decouple the enhancement suggested in this JIRA from the sensibility of running with replicaCount = 1.  We probably shouldn't have titled the JIRA the way we did.\n\nAt its core, we are proposing decoupling the replication factor from the pipeline length.  This does not seem like a hack to me.  There are legitimate uses cases for having them be controllable independently, as each attribute can provide different protection and performance characteristics.  For example:\n* For the MapReduce job files, a short pipeline is wanted in tandem with a high replication factor (to keep writes fast, but have many replicas available for the job definition file).  Currently this is implemented by a client side workaround (which, incidentally, doesn't work quite right for files larger than 1 block (which probably never occurs for JAR files anyway)).\n* In the repCount=1 use case, the client wants a low replication factor for the file (for storage efficiency), but does not want ingest to fail due to a host failure.\n\nWith this perspective, another potential fix for this JIRA would be to add an optional {{pipelineSize}} parameter to {{ClientProtocol.create()}} and default it to the same as the {{replication}}.  Not sure there is appetite for this as it would involve a protocol change, but I wanted to throw this idea out there for consideration.  Thoughts?\n\nbq. Have you considered using BlockPlacementPolicy? We could give additional state to BlockPlacementPolicy (whether new block allocation existing). From a quick look, the client and NN will use any extra replicas returned by BlockPlacementPolicy.\nThis looks promising and we will investigate this.

To be frank, we haven't fully implemented append yet.  Our current design approach relies on shared storage (see HDFS-5318) in our {{FsDatasetSpi}} plugin in order to provide a multi-node pipeline in the append case for {{repcount=1}}.  With shared storage, the single physical replica is reported via _multiple_ DataNodes to the NameNode.  For append, the NameNode should include _all_ those DataNodes in the append pipeline (see caveat below).  Note that this requires some _out-of-band_ coordination in our {{FsDatasetSpi}} plugin in order to actually persist the appended data to the shared replica in a consistent manner.\n\nSo, to summarize, we would not rely on the {{BlockPlacementPolicy}} extension to enforce a multiinode append pipeline with {{repcount=1}}.  Instead, we would rely on shared storage and multiple replica reporting to accomplish this.  I realize that this asymmetry somewhat invalidates my earlier assertion that a general solution for divorcing the repcount from the pipeline length is achievable.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense or if any clarifications are needed - I may be assuming too much context here.\n\nh5. Caveat:\nActually only those on Storages reported as {{READ_WRITE}} should be included in the append pipeline.  This may be a gap in the current NameNode append code - I'll follow up on this.  This also illustrates why your suggestion on HDFS-5318 of reporting only a _single_ {{READ_WRITE}} node for a given shared replica may be problematic - we wouldn't get a multi-node pipeline for append in this case.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sirianni","name":"sirianni","key":"sirianni","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sirianni&avatarId=16970","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sirianni&avatarId=16970","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sirianni&avatarId=16970","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sirianni&avatarId=16970"},"displayName":"Eric Sirianni","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-12-20T01:40:01.803+0000","updated":"2013-12-20T01:40:01.803+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12676121/comment/13854381","id":"13854381","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
