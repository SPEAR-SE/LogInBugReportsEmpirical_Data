As you said, setting this config to something > 1.0 will prevent the replication queues from being initialized in the middle of block report processing.  Since the main loop of SafeModeMonitor in trunk/branch-2 and leaveSafeMode() called by SafeModeMonitor in branch-0.23 are acquiring FSN lock, nothing will get in the way between replication queue initialization and leaving safe mode and cause delays. \n\n+1 The patch looks good.
