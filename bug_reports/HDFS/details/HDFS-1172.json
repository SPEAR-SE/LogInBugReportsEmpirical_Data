We often have seen this issue after doing a largescale decrease in replication count, or a large directory removal, since the block deletions hold up the blockReceived call in DN.offerService. But this isn't a full solution - there are still other ways in which the DN can be slower at acking a new block than the client is in calling completeFile\n- Scott's solution of making the primary DN send the blockReceived on account of all DNs would work, but sounds complicated, expecially in the failure cases (eg what if the primary DN fails just before sending the RPC? Do we lose all the replicas? No good!)\n- UnderReplicatedBlocks could be augmented to carry a dontProcessUntil timestamp. When we check replication in response to a completeFile, we can mark the neededReplications with a \"don't process until N seconds from now\" which causes them to get skipped over by the replication monitor thread until a later time. This should give the DNs a bit of leeway to report the blocks, while not changing the control flow or distributed parts at all.\n\nDhruba's workaround of upping min replication indeed helps, but as he said, it's at a great cost to the client, *especially* in the cases where it would help (eg if one DN is 10 seconds slow)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-05-25T18:45:00.093+0000","updated":"2010-05-25T18:45:00.093+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12465184/comment/12871353","id":"12871353","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"> UnderReplicatedBlocks could be augmented to carry a dontProcessUntil timestamp. \n\nTo expand on this idea, we can delay replication of a block until a few seconds (configurable) after the modification time of the file.

This part of the test wasn't succeeding reliably, since it was running into a different bug: HDFS-2283\n\n- added the test code from HDFS-1197 which allows the DNs to artificially delay blockReceived calls in the tests. This exposed some other bugs with the patch\n\n- the new replicateLastBlock code needed to be called in a different place:\n-- the original patch called this on every attempt of completeFile(), rather than on only the final/successful attempt. This meant that, if the replicas were very slow to check in, the targets would be added to pendingReplication many times, yielding a pending replica count much larger than the actual replication factor\n-- the code needs to be called for all blocks, not just the last block in a file\n\nI looped the new tests for a while and they pass reliably.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-08-25T00:36:21.851+0000","updated":"2011-08-25T00:36:21.851+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12465184/comment/13099604","id":"13099604","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Todd for taking care of this! :)\n\n+1 to the patch\n- Nitpicking, should we just have a boolean cached for the isLastBlockOfUnderConstructionFile calls on 1131 and 1063?\n- Is line 1225 {noformat}return lastBlock == block;{noformat} the same as an equality check?\n- In TestReplication.java:testReplicationWhileUnderConstruction(), after marking one block as bad (line 588), is there a quick check we can do to verify that indeed a block was added to the pending queue?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-07T22:03:10.710+0000","updated":"2011-09-07T22:03:10.710+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12465184/comment/13104755","id":"13104755","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I looked more closely.
