Some comments on the patch:\n# In {{setGenerationStampAndVerifyReplicas}}, {{staleReplicas}} is just a temporary list holding all the stale replicas. Thus updating this list seems unnecessary.\n# A UC replica reported by DN with GS greater than the one recoded in NN may be valid. This is because the original writing may fail before the file gets closed and a writing pipeline recovery may still be in progress. Thus some DN may have bumped the GS while that GS has not been persisted in the NN yet (see {{DataStreamer#setupPipelineInternal}}). If those DataNodes restart, these un-finalized replicas will still be reported to NN. Later when recovering the block, actually these replicas will still be used as valid replicas (see {{DataNode#recoverBlock}}).
