On the surface, this appears like a great, convinent feature:\n\n* hdfs.h is the same header for both libraries\n* API calls are the same so documentation is the same.\n\nHowever:\n* Users CANNOT (effectively) link both libraries in the same program\n\nSo your program either does HDFS RPC or WebHDFS REST.  It cannot do both.  Worse, neither library actually exposes all of the APIs that have been declared public.
