We do have it in the FileStatus, but some of the client APIs only return a BlockLocation and don't query a FileStatus.\n\nThe most efficient solution is to add preferredBlockSize to the LocatedBlock proto. We already have some EC-specific fields for the LocatedStripedBlock subclass. It's hard to plumb this though, since LocatedBlock is created pretty far down in BlockManager, and the preferredBlockSize comes from the file in FSNamesystem.\n\nWe could also make the client make another RPC to get the FileStatus for EC files. This would be for the APIs that take a path and return a BlockLocation, since the LocatedFileStatus APIs already have a FileStatus. This comes at a performance cost.\n\nI lean toward the efficient option. I didn't have time to plumb preferredBlockSize into the LocatedBlock today. I'm going to unassign myself for now in case [~HuafengWang] or someone else would like to pick this up.\n\nSidenote for [~vanzin], I checked S3AFileSystem and it looks like we just return a single location per file (the dummy FileSystem implementation), which [~fabbri] confirmed.
