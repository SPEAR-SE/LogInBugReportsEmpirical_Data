A WebHdfsFileSystem call can get StandbyException if it hits the SBN, and we can use it for WebHdfsFileSystem side's failover. This is the same logic with current DFSClient's failover and retry mechanism.\n\nbq. 4* If the hostname is a logical name, resolve to any of the NN hosts, do a cheap FS call using the chosen hostname.\nbq. 4.1**If it works cache the chosen hostname and use it for all subsequent FS operations while successful. \n\nAfter the cheap call, we cannot guarantee that the subsequence calls can succeed since the NN failover can happen in between. So I think we can skip the cheap call here.\n\nThe current WebHDFSFileSystem retry logic does not consider the NN failover. So I think we only need to add the failover (between the 2 NN URL) and retry logic, and use FailoverOnNetworkExceptionRetry as the retry policy in WebHDFSFileSystem for HA setup.
