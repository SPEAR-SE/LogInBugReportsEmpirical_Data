Block size is 10B and total cluster capacity is 6000B ( 3000B on each datanodes). It create 180 data blocks with replication factor 2. Then, a node datanode is created and balancer starts to balancing the cluster considering rack locality. However, once balancer starts, HDFS creates a /system/balancer.id file (30B) to track the balancer. After balancer successes, HDFS should delete the /system/balancer.id file which is composed of 6 data blocks (2 replication for each data block). But HDFS failed to delete 1 data block of this /system/balancer.id file. This is why it reports 1810 data blocks instead of 1800.

There are two ways to reduce the side-effect of the balancer.id file in this test method. \n1) increasing the block size to reduce the impact of balancer.id file( this is what I did);\n2) introduce two new nodes, one in rack0 and one in rack1. \n\nThe failure in this JIRA is because of the balancer.id file's block (blk_181) that should be deleted. We have to wait until that block is deleted. I  created a sub-task HDFS-6342 to redesign this test method. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=airbots","name":"airbots","key":"airbots","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730"},"displayName":"Chen He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-05T15:23:46.164+0000","updated":"2014-05-05T15:23:46.164+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708820/comment/13990440","id":"13990440","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi [~airbots], please see my comments about HDFS-6159\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6159?focusedCommentId=13990433&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13990433\nThe fix in HDFS-6159 and this jira seems to be suboptimal, we may need to reconsider the approach.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2014-05-06T08:53:13.301+0000","updated":"2014-05-06T08:53:13.301+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708820/comment/13990491","id":"13990491","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"I maded a patch to address this jira and HDFS-6159, along with a minor fix in balancer.id ralated doc, changes:\n1. make CAPACITY to 5000 rather than 6000, so it remains same ratio to block size as before, make DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE useful\n2. change validate method in testBalancerWithRackLocality so it doesn't depends on balancer.id file\n3. there is a doc error about  balancer.id, fixed\nWith the change the test now runs only about 7 seconds, rather than 20+ seconds.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2014-05-06T09:50:45.428+0000","updated":"2014-05-06T09:50:45.428+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708820/comment/13990619","id":"13990619","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"The new patch sounds a good direction for me.

However, in this test case, no block on rack0 is good. Should the balancer keep node0 always over-utilized (assume it is caused by balancer.id file)? There should be priority for the data block moving policies. I will double check it today.
