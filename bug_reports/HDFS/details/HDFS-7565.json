My windows user is some random alphanumeric id not relevant here. \n\nThe \"hari\" user was created by me in this standalone integrated Kerberos realm with backing LDAP directory which manages the Hadoop cluster. The Hadoop cluster authenticates to this standalone authentication realm created by me.\n\nSo the \"hari\" user and its 10002 UID were set up by me and appear as local native user on the cluster nodes.\n\nThis is why you see the two UIDs. What I was trying to do was map the 4 billion UID to the 10002 UID using the recently added static map in the other jira HDFS-7563.\n\nThe problem here is that when the NFS gateway receives the 4 billion UID from the Windows workstation it overflows and results in the -2 UID.\n\nAccording to HDFS-6361 that -2 is set because it's outside the int range, but it's not clear what the fix is in this instance since it was marked resolved in version 2.4.1 and I'm running 2.6.0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=harisekhon","name":"harisekhon","key":"harisekhon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hari Sekhon","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-12-23T21:16:32.048+0000","updated":"2014-12-23T21:16:32.048+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12763256/comment/14257557","id":"14257557","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=harisekhon","name":"harisekhon","key":"harisekhon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hari Sekhon","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Also, note that 4 billion UID does not result in user \"hari\" - that's the user  I'm trying to make it resolve to via the static mapping file in the other ticket.\n\nThat 4 billion UID results in user \"nobody\" with UID -2.
