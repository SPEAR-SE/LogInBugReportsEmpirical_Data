This is crucial for block placement to consider space and load.  It's completely broken for decomm nodes.\n\nThe heartbeat manager substracts the prior values before it adds new values.  During registration of a decomm node, it substracts before seeding the initial values.  This decrements nodesInService, flips state to decomm, add will not increment nodesInService (correct).  There are other math bugs (double adding) that accidentally work due to 0 values.\n\nThe result is every decomm node decrements the node count used for block placement.  When enough nodes are decomm, the replication monitor will silently stop working.  No logging.  It searches all nodes and just gives up.  Eventually, all block allocation will also completely fail.
