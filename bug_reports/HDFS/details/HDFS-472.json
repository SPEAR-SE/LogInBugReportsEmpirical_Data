I uploaded the new patch.\n\n* The \"advantages\" and \"disadvantages\" in the comparison w/ H(S)FTP could be formatted more clearly in a list or table.\n    --> yes. I listed them.\n* 6.6.1 and 6.6.2 are missing a line break before the \"ant clean tar\" shell command\n   --> good catch. I corrected a couple more.\n* There are several occurrences of \"Ip address\" (e.g. 4.2.2 sub 3) that should read \"IP address\"\n  --> changed\n* Why are dfs.block.size and io.file.buffer.size important parameters for the proxy?\n  --> They are not crucial to the functionality of proxy. Fine tuning these parameters could affect the transfer performance to some degree. This should have been documented in hdfs-client. \n* -There are three \"hdfsproxy-default.xml\" tables and all tables are labeled \"Table 1\"- (the structure is much clearer in the HTML rendering than in the PDF; looks like a forrest quirk)\n--> seems <caption> tag inside <table> block is causing the problem. Replaced it with <strong> out of the <table> block. Now all look the same in HTML and PDF.\n* Has someone unfamiliar with the details of the project successfully configured an instance of HDFS proxy from this documentation?\n--> I did that. But maybe not fair since I am relatively familiar with it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhiyong1","name":"zhiyong1","key":"zhiyong1","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhiyong zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-08-31T17:03:01.629+0000","updated":"2009-08-31T17:03:01.629+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424651/comment/12749563","id":"12749563","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 The latest version looks good.\n\nWould it make sense to update the README as part of this issue?
