It's not a cache issue, but client code is misusing the filesystem.\n\nSystems encountering OOM for the {{FileSystem}} cache are not properly calling {{FileSystem.closeAllForUGI(ugi)}}.  If {{UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser(user)}} is called and the resulting ugi is used to obtain filesystems, then {{FileSystem.closeAllForUGI}} _must_ be invoked when the created ugi is no longer needed.  I'm preparing to do this in the NM.\n\nCaching the UGI is fraught with peril.  Tokens will be unexpectedly shared.  Reusing a token in a cached ugi risks using an old expired token.  To compound the issue, tokens can be added but not removed from a ugi.  Thus even if a new token is obtained & added to the ugi, then it's non-deterministic whether the new token or the old expired token will be used for a connection.\n\nThere are also possible security issues related to allowing multiple jobs for a client using a union of all acquired tokens in a cached ugi.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-06-21T15:43:14.689+0000","updated":"2012-06-21T15:43:14.689+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595088/comment/13452488","id":"13452488","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm curious to know if doing an FS.closeAllForUgi() fixes this problem.
