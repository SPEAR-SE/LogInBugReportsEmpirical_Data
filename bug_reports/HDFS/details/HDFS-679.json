Let me try to explain. \n\nSuppose that a file has one byte 'a'. It is open for append. The client writes one byte 'b' and calls hflush. A packet containing 'b\" gets pushed to a datanode. The datanode reads 'a' and its checksum from disk, validating its on-disk data, then recaculates the checksum for \"ab\", writes 'b' to disk, and overwrites the checksum for the chunk. So far so good. However, when the client writes another byte \"c\" and calls hflush again, the client send a packet \"bc\" not \"c\" to the datanode side. When the datanode reads \"a\" and checksums from the disk, checksum validation fails because the checksum on disk is not the checksum for \"a\" but for \"ab\". The write fails at the following lines in BlockReceiver#computePartialChunkCrc:\n\n{noformat}\n    if (partialCrc.getValue() != FSInputChecker.checksum2long(crcbuf)) {\n      String msg = \"Partial CRC \" + partialCrc.getValue() +\n                   \" does not match value computed the \" +\n                   \" last time file was closed \" +\n                   FSInputChecker.checksum2long(crcbuf);\n      throw new IOException(msg);\n    }\n{noformat}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-10-07T18:39:53.750+0000","updated":"2009-10-07T18:39:53.750+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437442/comment/12763192","id":"12763192","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I'd like to propose a solution to the appending to a partial checksum chunk problem. The client reads in the partial chunk into its buffer before any write and they will be part of the packets sent to the datanode side before the chunk gets filled up.

This would not increase complexity at the client side but would completely eliminate the handling of appending to partial chunk at the datanode side. \n\nAnother optimization to a block receiver at the datanode is not to overwrite block file if a packet starts with data that the replica file already has.

The client needs READ permission to read the partial chunk which a writer does not require to have.\n\nSo instead of using a different solution, I focus on making the existing solution to work. Here is the plan:\n1. The client does not set appendChunk to be false until the first chunk has been sent;\n2. If datanode receives a request to append \"bcd\" to a partial chunk \"a\" but \"bc\" have already been written to disk in a previous hflush, the datanode will read \"abc\" from disk and computes the checksum of \"abcd\" and then write \"c\" and the new checksum to the disk. In the current trunk and 0.21, the datanode mistakenly computes the crc of \"abcbcd\".\n\nI will also implement the proposed optimization:  a block receiver at the datanode is not to overwrite block file if a packet starts with data that the replica file already has. For the crc file, only the last 4 bytes are allowed to be overwritten. This optimization makes it easy to implement datanode side fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-10-13T01:30:29.674+0000","updated":"2009-10-13T01:30:29.674+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437442/comment/12764914","id":"12764914","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"A patch for review.
