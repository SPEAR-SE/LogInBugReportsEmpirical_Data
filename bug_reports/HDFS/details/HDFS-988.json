Thus dir.getFileInfo may actually return incorrect info (or even fail if it races with someone deleting the file)\n- same goes for setOwner\n- I think it's OK, but can you verify that the top synchronized block in getAdditionalBlock can never have side effects?

Additions:\n- commitBlockSynchronization no longer allowed in safemode. Konstantin, do you still prefer that we open a new issue for this? Dhruba seems to agree that it should be disallowed.\n- startCheckpoint, endCheckpoint, and updatePipeline also check safemode now\n- the new delegation token logging methods check safemode as well.\n\nSome questions for review:\n- Will logUpdateMasterKey be OK with the SafeModeException?\n- Are there some asserts we could add to make it easier to catch these bugs in the future? For example, we could assert !namesystem.isInSafeMode() in FSEditLog.logSync(). Then if we ran assertions on unit tests we'd probably notice if we were accidentally making edits while in safe mode.\n\nSome responses to review above:\n\nbq. FSNamesystem.getAdditionalBlock() checking isInSafeMode() should be before calling chooseTargets(). I would not change getAdditionalBlock() at all.\n\nRight now, getAdditionalBlock is split into two synchronized blocks. The safe mode status could switch between the two. Are you suggesting that we check safemode in both, or we combine the blocks into one? I assumed the intent was to avoid doing the potentially CPU-heavy chooseTarget work while synchronized.\n\nbq. renewLease() shouldn't be under FSNamesystem lock? leaseManeger has its own lock\n\nThis is to prevent safemode from switching while calling renewLease. If we decided that renewing a lease under safemode is not allowed, then we need to synchronize here. Otherwise the check is prone to races.\n\nRegarding deadlock potential, I think we're safe since LeaseManager.Monitor synchronizes on FSNamesystem before synchronizing on the lease manager.\n\nbq. Your changes to permission methods incorporate HDFS-133.\n\nResolved that one as dup, thanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-04-28T07:34:57.986+0000","updated":"2010-04-28T07:34:57.986+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12456712/comment/12861703","id":"12861703","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Marking this as blocker for the upcoming release.

In the case of computeReplicationWork, it might schedule some replications. This seems OK - worst case we get some extra replicas which will get fixed up later. In the case of computeInvalidateWork, it calls invalidateWorkForOneNode which takes the write lock and then checks safe mode before scheduling any deletions.\n\nIn heartbeatCheck, I think we can simply put another \"if (isInSafeMode()) return\" in right after it takes the writeLock if it finds a dead node. That way if it races, it still doesn't take any actions based on it. Either way, I don't think this could corrupt anything since it won't write to the edit log.\n\n\nSome other notes:\n- isLockedReadOrWrite should be checking this.fsLock.getReadHoldCount() rather than getReadLockCount()\n- FSDirectory#bLock says it protects the block map, but it also protects the directory, right? we should update the comment and perhaps the name.\n- various functions don't take the read lock because they call functions in FSDirectory that take FSDirectory.bLock. This seems incorrect, since, for example, getListing() racing against open() with overwrite=true could return the directory with the file deleted but the new one not there yet. I guess what's confusing me is that it's not clear why some functions don't need readLock when they perform read operations. When is just the FSDirectory lock sufficient? It looks like a lot of the test failures above are due to this.\n- handleHeartbeat calls getDatanode() while only holding locks on heartbeats and datanodeMap, but registerDatanode mutates datanodeMap without locking either.\n- getDataNodeInfo seems like an unused function with no locking - can we remove it?\n- several other places access datanodeMap with synchronization on that object itself. unprotectedAddDatanode should assert it holds that monitor lock\n- when loading the edit log, why doesn't loadFSEdits take a write lock on the namesystem before it starts? then we could add all of the asserts and not worry about it.\n\n\n- it looks like saving the image no longer works, since saveFilesUnderConstruction now takes the readLock, but it's being called by a different thread than took the write lock in saveNamespace. So, it deadlocks. At first I thought this could be solved by just making saveNamespace take a read lock instead of write lock, but that actually doesn't work due to fairness -- what can happen is that saveNamespace takes readLock, then some other thread comes along and queues up for the write lock. At the point, no further readers are allowed to take the read lock, because it's a fair lock. So, the image-writer thread locks up.\n\n\nOptimizations to address later:\n- When create() is called with the overwrite flag true, that calls delete() which will logSync() while holding the lock. We can hold off on fixing it since it's a performance problem, not correctness, and the operation is fairly rare.\n- getAdditionalBlock doesn't logSync() - I think there's another issue pending about that since it will affect HA. Let's address later.\n- checkFileProgress doesn't really need the write lock\n- seems like saveNamespace could safely just take the read lock to allow other readers to keep working\n\n\nNits:\n- Typo: \"Cnnot concat\"\n- rollEditLog has comment saying \"Checkpoint not created\"\n- rollFSImage has the same issue, but at least has to do with checkpoints, so could be correct\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-06-02T05:25:23.254+0000","updated":"2011-06-02T05:25:23.254+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12456712/comment/13042615","id":"13042615","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Added a comment in computeDatanodeWork with the rationale.\n\nbq. In heartbeatCheck, I think we can simply put another \"if (isInSafeMode()) return\" in right after it takes the writeLock if it finds a dead node...\n\nAgree, added the additional check, and a comment above the first lock aquisition.\n\nbq. isLockedReadOrWrite should be checking this.fsLock.getReadHoldCount()\nrather than getReadLockCount()\n\nFixed.\n\nbq. FSDirectory#bLock says it protects the block map, but it also protects the directory, right? we should update the comment and perhaps the name.\n\nCorrect. I renamed it dirLock to be consistent with FSNameSystem and to reflect that it protects the entire directory, not just the block map. Updated the comment too.\n\nbq. various functions don't take the read lock because they call functions in FSDirectory that take FSDirectory.bLock. This seems incorrect..\n\nI think the FSN methods do need to get the readlock before calling into FSD methods that get the read lock. In the latest patch I added this to the places where it was missing (getFileInfo, getContentSummary, getPreferredBlockSize, etc), hopefully the new asserts make it clear that we have the FSN lock we calling into FSD (where necessary). For HADOOP-7362 we should assert the lock hierarchy is obeyed.\n\nbq. handleHeartbeat calls getDatanode() while only holding locks on heartbeats and datanodeMap, but registerDatanode mutates datanodeMap without locking either.\n\nI modified handleHeartbeat to take the read lock so it's synchronized with register datanode. I also added a missing synchronization of datanodeMap to wipeDatanode. I think the locking in FSN needs to be revisited (eg the way heartbeats and datanodeMap are locked) need to be reconsidered in light of this locking. I'll file a jira for that, that's probably out of scope for this jira.\n\nbq. getDataNodeInfo seems like an unused function with no locking - can we remove it?\n\nYes. Done.\n\nbq. several other places access datanodeMap with synchronization on that object itself.  unprotectedAddDatanode should assert it holds that monitor lock\n\nMade unprotectedAddDatanode datanodeMap synchronize on datanodeMap, per above I think we need to revisit how this datastructure is accessed.\n\nbq. when loading the edit log, why doesn't loadFSEdits take a write lock on the namesystem before it starts? then we could add all of the asserts and not worry about it.\n\nDone. It now takes the namesystem and dir locks, and I modifed all the unprotected methods to assert the lock is held.\n\nbq. it looks like saving the image no longer works, since saveFilesUnderConstruction now takes the readLock, but it's being called by a different thread than took the write lock in saveNamespace.\n\nYup, TestEditLogRace quickly found this deadlock. I removed the new locking from saveFilesUnderConstruction.\n\nbq. When create() is called with the overwrite flag true, that calls delete() which will logSync() while holding the lock. We can hold off on fixing it since it's a performance problem, not correctness, and the operation is fairly rare.\n\nFiled HDFS-2052.\n\nbq. getAdditionalBlock doesn't logSync() - I think there's another issue pending about that since it will affect HA. Let's address later.\n\nSince getAdditionalBlock doesn't do anything that writes to the log the sync is not currently needed. I updated HDFS-978 to indicate it will be needed when block allocations are logged.\n\nbq. checkFileProgress doesn't really need the write lock\n\nYup, modified it to use a read-lock.\n\nbq. seems like saveNamespace could safely just take the read lock to allow other readers to keep working\n\nYup, modified to take the read lock.\n\nFixed the nits.\n\nThe tests should be passing, I'm going to do some testing with jcarder enabled. Have also run TestNNThroughputBenchmark, the numbers are noisy, mostly better than w/o the patch (not sure I believe that).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-06-09T07:14:38.846+0000","updated":"2011-06-09T07:14:38.846+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12456712/comment/13046369","id":"13046369","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Btw test-patch is +1 for hdfs-988-b22-1.patch on branch 22 and all the tests pass.
