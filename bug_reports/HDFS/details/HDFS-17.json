It is intended to permit admins to set permissions after upgrade while leaving the filesystem available for use.  If this use case is really important, then we should mark this \"won't fix\".\n\nNigel expressed concerns about displaying permissions in \"ls\" that are not enforced would be confusing to users, that returning 777 would be better for that reason too.  But if dfs.permissions is only meant to be used during transition, this may not be a serious issue.\n\nI'm beginning to think that dfs.permissions should be 'true' by default, and that the default permission on upgrade should be 777.  That is back-compatible.  Then, if folks like, they can set more prohibitive permissions and/or disable permission checking.  If this is the default behavior then I am okay marking this issue \"won't fix\".  Currently dfs.permissions is 'false' by default, so perhaps that should change.  I am not yet certain what the default file permission is after an upgrade...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-01-08T19:09:22.031+0000","updated":"2008-01-08T19:09:22.031+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12385626/comment/12556983","id":"12556983","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Okay, I found it: the default permissions on upgrade are 777, with both user and group set to HadoopAnonymous.
