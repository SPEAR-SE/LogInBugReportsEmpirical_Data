In the transient instances this warning goes away, but in the persistent instances every invocation of the {{fs -count -q}} command yields the above warning.\n\nI've seen instances where the actual disk usage of a directory is 25% of the cached value in INodeDirectory, which creates problems since the quota code uses this cached value to determine whether block write requests are permitted.\n\nThis isn't easy to reproduce -
