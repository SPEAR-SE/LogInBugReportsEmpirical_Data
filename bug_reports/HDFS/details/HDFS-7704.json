Also, it will be nice if the bad block reporting portion of the change can aggregate multiple such reports and make a single namenode rpc call, if multiple bad block reports are present in the queue.  The queue, {{bpThreadQueue}}, also needs a proper synchronization.

Except when one is created, the rest of the code won't have to know the specific type of the instance.  It will make batching bad block reporting difficult.\n\nIn the current patch, the way {{bpThreadQueue}} is synchronized will block {{bpThreadEnqueue()}}, if RPC call blocks.  Instead, you could create a new collection containing the content of the queue in a synchronized block, and then call the report() method of each one outside the synchronized block.\n\nIf you want to make batching of bad block reporting work, it may not be worth trying to introduce the unified {{BPServiceActorAction}} concept.  For bad blocks, \"{{enqueue()}}\" or \"{{add()}}\" can put thing directly to an ArrayList, which simplifies the aggregation on reporting time.  If you believe  {{BPServiceActorAction}}-based abstraction will provide more value in the future, giving up on batched bad block reporting is okay. After all, datanode is not doing it today.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-02T22:29:55.541+0000","updated":"2015-02-02T22:29:55.541+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771044/comment/14303895","id":"14303895","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks [~kihwal] and [~clamb] for your valuable comments.\nAttaching a new patch.\nIn this patch, I have not accumulated all the bad blocks in one ReportBadBlock rpc call since it is not doing in current implementation.\nPlease review and comment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-02-03T20:14:40.887+0000","updated":"2015-02-03T20:14:40.887+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771044/comment/14304313","id":"14304313","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
