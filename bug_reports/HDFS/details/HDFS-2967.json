A Jenkins build machine might experience a JVM crash because of an out-of-memory condition, and then find that all builds turned red because a unit test failed to clean up the state which it created.\n\nI think that in HDFS tests which alter persistent state, we probably should invoke the @After functions from a @Before function, just to make sure that the necessary cleanup is done.
