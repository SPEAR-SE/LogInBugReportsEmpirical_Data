However it seems unnecessary to maintain an exact count of the pending requests when all we care about is whether or not there are any requests. The patch replaces the counter with a boolean.\n\n{quote}\nAndrew Wang also pointed out offline that it is perhaps incorrect to be subtracting the number of deleted blocks from pendingReceivedRequests in BPServiceActor#reportReceivedDeletedBlocks, but the result of that is somewhat less serious, since in that case the worst case is just that we send a somewhat delayed IBR.\n{quote}\nThis behavior looks odd but it was probably by design. {{pendingReceivedRequests}} was not incremented for deleted requests to avoid sending an IBR for just deleted blocks before the timeout interval has elapsed. However when we failed to send an IBR we reinserted all pending entries into the queue and set {{pendingReceivedRequests}} to be the count of all pending requests - deleted+received - presumably to avoid waiting for another timeout interval before retrying.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-23T01:34:50.616+0000","updated":"2014-02-23T01:34:50.616+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12694372/comment/13909671","id":"13909671","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
