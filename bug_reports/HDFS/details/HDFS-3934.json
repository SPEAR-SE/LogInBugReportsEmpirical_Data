Why does the reader need to instantiate dummy DatanodeID?\n\nYou're right.  Re-using {{DatanodeID}} for this purpose doesn't reall ymake sense.  I created a new type called {{HostFileManager#Entry}} to represent host file entries.\n\nbq. It appears to be for repeatedly making the somewhat fragile assumption that xferAddr is ipAddr+port? If that relationship changes, we've got a problem...\n\nFixed to use getIpAddr() + \":\" + getXferPort() in all cases.\n\nbq. Patch appears to have dropped supported for the node's registration name. Eli Collins wanted me to maintain that feature in HDFS-3990. If we need to keep it, doing a lookup and a canonical lookup (can trigger another dns lookup) isn't compatible with supporting the reg name.\n\nThanks for pointing this out.  I talked to Eli and he explained the distinction between registration names and hostnames to me.  I added back support for \"registration names\" and added a unit test to ensure this works properly.\n\nbq. Doing a lookup followed by getCanonicalName is a bad idea. It does 2 more lookups: hostname -> PTR -> A so it can resolve CNAMES to IP to hostname. With this change I think it will cause 3 lookups per host.\n\nOne key feature of this change is that all the lookups happen when the include and exclude files are read.  *No* lookups happen during {{DatanodeManager#getDatanodeListForReport}}, or any of the other cases where we check the host file entries.\n\nOn the advice of Eli, I removed the call to {{getCanonicalName}}.  We can just use the name the user specified in the hosts file; that should be fine.\n\nbq. Question about \"// If no transfer port was specified, we take a guess\". Why needed, and what are the ramifications for getting this wrong? Just a display issue?\n\nWe just don't have the information.  If the datanode is dead, we only know what the entry says in the hosts file(s).  If the entries don't have the port, we have to guess.  I don't see any way around this.  It might be more elegant if the web UI could understand the concept of \"port is unknown,\" but adding that seems out of scope.\n\nIn addition to the unit tests, I did some manual testing on this and verified that it got rid of the double-counting of nodes in the web UI for me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

I don't want {{DatanodeManager}] to be able to mutate this set.  I was considering using an {{ImmutableMap}}, but unfortunately, {{ImmutableMap#Builder}} chokes when you try to feed it two identical keys with different values.  There might be a more elegant way of doing this, but for now, this seemed like a nice way to give DatanodeManager a read-only view without doing a lot of copying.\n\nPoint 11: I see what you're getting at here, but it's a little trickier than it might seem.  If I used {{Map#containsValue}}, I'd have to create a DatanodeInfo object which compared equal to what I was looking for.  Then I have to start thinking about what fields {{DatanodeInfo#equals}} looks at, which I kind of wanted to avoid.  It would work, but it feels kind of messy (I'd be creating a temporary DatanodeID where a lot of the fields were set to dummy values because {{DatanodeInfo#equals}} doesn't \"care\" about them, and I don't either.)  So I dunno.  Maybe there is a better way to do, but it's not obvious to me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
