I found that other reason caused this test case failure if number of blocks before cluster restart are more than one. It because that the MiniDFSCluster used by this case only have two DataNodes in the test source code. According to the BlockPlacementPolicy, if the total DataNode numbers of the cluster is less than the min replication, the real replication will equal to the smaller one(in this case is the total DataNode numbers).\n\nSo if you just modified the min replication to 3 and the total number of DataNode is still 2, then the real replication will still 2.\nModify the test scenario\n------------------------\n1. Modify the number of DataNode in MiniDFSCluster to 3.\n2. Write a file with min replication as 2 and replication factor as 2.\n3.

So the above function will return true and then NameNode will hang in the safeMode.\n\nBecause of the replication before the cluster restart is persistent stored in the metadata of each file, I think we can calculate safe block number with the former replication rather than the modified one. Then the cluster will exit safe mode and execute replicate operation to achieve required replication. If this scenario is ok, I can fix it.
