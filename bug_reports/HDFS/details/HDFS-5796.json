With that in mind, I don't see how the static user concept proves itself as a vulnerability, cause the user is already aware their web console is not authenticating anyone for anything, including the web browser.\n\nWe have customers who need generic user (dr.who, etc. - this is configurable) file browsing on the NN UI without authentication just as it had existed prior to the WebHDFS file browser introduction, even though their kerberos authentication is turned on in the cluster.\n\nWould that be OK to place back as a feature (turned off by default if needed), as the new file browser has regressed?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-01-27T11:47:50.406+0000","updated":"2015-01-27T11:47:50.406+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12689518/comment/14293957","id":"14293957","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

Does the user need to able to read all files in the HDFS cluster in order for the UI to work?

From a security prospective, I think that it is a no-go if users that are using the browser and users that are using standard RPC interfaces are treated differently – it can easily lead to misconfiguration and security vulnerabilities.\nWrt. Misconfiguration, I agree that it would be a security issue.. but I am infact reusing the existing {{AltKerberosAuthenticationHandler}} which does browser check based on user agent.. I would be happy to take a shot at fixing that up if you find any vulnerabilities in it.

If you need something that isn't the default, the whole system falls apart.  The fundamental problem is that if you use something like the AltKerberos filter, it flat out doesn't work.  There two key problems we've noticed:\n\na) filter parameters don't get passed down to either AltK's SPNEGO filter or a user's custom one\nb) after we did some custom hacking, we noticed that cookie secret handling is broken.\n\nThus, using a browser to peruse HDFS with custom auth is completely broken in 2.6  and up due to the removal of the old UI.\n\nbq. with HDFS-5716, you can turn the KerberosAuthFilter off and replace it with PseudoAuthFilter, but then the UI as well as applications always thinks you are dr.who.

I don't quite follow – I wonder, why setting the secret provider can solve this problem?\n\nIt's more than that.  The current code passes in zero properties into the configured handler, which means that if they need other configuration bits they can't get them.  In our case, we are passing on other information that allows connection to our centralized web-based auth solution.\n\nThe signature matters because the cookie in the Kerberos (alt or otherwise) filter matters:  these are done on a per-host/domain+per auth filter basis, so if the same host+filter combo are in play, the secret file needs to be the same across all services that use that auth filter.  It likely works in 2.6 with the generic Kerberos filter because it is continually re-auth'ing against Kerberos rather than relying upon the cookie. \n\nbq. I starts to wonder whether we should use the same signer for the authentication filters of both UI and WebHDFS in the NN (like the one proposed in HADOOP-10670) since both filters handle URLs coming from the same origin.\n\nThis is an interesting question.  I'm actually inclined to say no, since the other web elements are almost all strictly interactive.  In other words, if I'm using something like SAML for my normal web auth and only have Kerberos deployed for internal hadoop stuff, there's no need to put a Kerberos filter in front of those other UIs.\n\nThere's also the issue of what to do about the 2NN->NN connection if that is configured to use the same auth method....","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2015-03-11T01:00:21.826+0000","updated":"2015-03-11T01:00:21.826+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12689518/comment/14356253","id":"14356253","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

I'm actually inclined to say no, since the other web elements are almost all strictly interactive. In other words, if I'm using something like SAML for my normal web auth and only have Kerberos deployed for internal hadoop stuff, there's no need to put a Kerberos filter in front of those other UIs.\nCurrently, if you configure a different Auth filter via AuthFilterInitializer and a different one (Kerb) for dfs.web.authentication, The user still has to go thru the Kerberos authentication.. Basically, the user has to pass thru the stricter scheme anyway.. So why not use a single AuthenticationFilter as [~wheat9] suggested ?\n\nPlease Also note, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, the there is a THIRD filter involved here which is initialized by {{HttpServer2#initSpnego()}}. This ends up being the same filter as dfs.web.authentication, but a filter is still initialized none the less ..

In secure set up, the old UI allows an anonymous user to be authenticated as \"dr.who\", while WebHDFS never allows authentications like this.\n\nFWIW, I've never seen this in practice with the Kerberos authenticator.  I have a suspicion this might be a Y! special with backyard.\n\nbq. Allow configurable WebHDFS authentication filter (in HDFS-5716). The users can work around the problem using a customizable filter but it won't work out of the box.\n\nYes and no.  Yes you can make it work if you decide to build an *entire alternative* to the normal hadoop-auth mechanisms that are in place or if your auth is VERY VERY VERY VERY simple.  But in reality the answer is no because frankly that's just a stupid thing to do after we've beat into users heads for the past 3 years, across the entirety of the Hadoop ecosystem, and across multiple major versions of Hadoop that set of methods X is how we're handling auth.   \n\nbq. Merging authentication filters – proposed in HADOOP-10703. Users can configure to use AltKerberosAuthenticationHandler for WebHDFS, so that the anonymous users can be authenticated as \"dr. who\". The issue is that the user can no longer be authenticated as itself.\n\nThose are three independent threads.  One can merge the filters, but unless it is done correctly, this is all still potentially broken.  AltKerberos allows for SPNEGO + some other auth.  If that other auth is implemented such that anon gets Dr. Who, so be it, but it is usually coded such that users do auth as themselves.\n\nbq. Getting a delegation token in the UI before issuing WebHDFS requests – proposed in this jira. It unifies the security model for both UI and WebHDFS, but it requires the auth filter for WebHdfs to be able to authenticate users as dr.who and it requires changes in the UI.\n\nThis was just confusion in this JIRA as folks mixed two different issues.
