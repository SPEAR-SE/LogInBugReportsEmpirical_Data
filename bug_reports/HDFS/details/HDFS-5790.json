When the original lease holders disappear, the lease holders are changed to namenode for block recovery.

The paths managed by LeaseManager are supposed to be updated on deletions and renames, so there is no point in searching there when the reference to inode is already known. For all user-initiated calls, the inode is obtained using the user-supplied path and then checkLease() is called before calling findPath(). So if something is to fail in findPath(), it should fail earlier in the code path.
