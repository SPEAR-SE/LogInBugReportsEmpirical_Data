Second, when two datanodes crash at the second phase of the pipeline.\n \n- Details:\n \nIn this setting, we set the datanode's heartbeat message to be 1 second to the namenode.\nThis is just to show that if the NN has declared a datanode dead, the DFSClient will not\nget that dead datanode from the server. Here's our observations:\n \n1. If the two crashes happen during the first phase,\nthe client will wait for 6 seconds (which is enough time for NN to detect\ndead datanodes in this setting). So after waiting for 6 seconds, the client\nasks the NN again, and the NN is able to give a fresh two healthy datanodes.\nand the experiment is successful!\n \n2. BUT, If the two crashes happen during the second phase (e.g. renameTo).\nThe client *never waits for 6 secs* which implies that the logic of the client\nfor 1st phase and 2nd phase are different.  What happens here, DFSClient gives\nup and (we believe) it never falls back to the outer while loop to contact the\nNN again.  So the two crashes in this second phase are not masked properly,\nand the write operation fails. \n \nIn summary, scenario (1) is good, but scenario (2) is not successful. This shows\na bad retry logic during the second phase.  (We note again that we change\nthe setup a bit by setting the DN's hearbeat interval to 1 second.  If we use\nthe default interval, scenario (1) will fail too because the NN will give the\nclient the same dead datanodes).\n\nThis bug was found by our Failure Testing Service framework:\nhttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2010/EECS-2010-98.html\nFor questions, please email us: Thanh Do (thanhdo@cs.wisc.edu) and\nHaryadi Gunawi (haryadi@eecs.berkeley.edu)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113412","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Client logic for 1st phase and 2nd phase failover are different","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467189/comment/12879863","id":"12879863","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"If both DNs crash in a pipeline of 2 DNs, of course the pipeline does not recover.
