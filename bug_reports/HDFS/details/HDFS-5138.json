Since there has been a layout version change between 2.0.x and 2.1.x, starting NN in upgrade mode was necessary when deploying 2.1.x to an existing 2.0.x cluster. But the only way to get around this was to disable HA and upgrade. \n\nThe NN and the cluster cannot be flipped back to HA until the upgrade is finalized. If HA is disabled only on NN for layout upgrade and HA is turned back on without involving DNs, things will work, but finaliizeUpgrade won't work (the NN is in HA and it cannot be in upgrade mode) and DN's upgrade snapshots won't get removed.\n\nWe will need a different ways of doing layout upgrade and upgrade snapshot.  I am marking this as a 2.1.1-beta blocker based on feedback from others.  If there is a reasonable workaround that does not increase maintenance window greatly, we can lower its priority from blocker to critical.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12326143","id":"12326143","description":"2.4.0 release","name":"2.4.0","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2014-04-07"}],"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12636281","id":"12636281","filename":"HDFS-5138.branch-2.001.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-24T00:44:33.157+0000","size":182964,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12636281/HDFS-5138.branch-2.001.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12623607","id":"12623607","filename":"HDFS-5138.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

I will throw out initial ideas to start the discussion. After some discussion, we can divide and retarget the work if necessary.\n\n1) layout upgrade support in HA mode\n\nThis is required since previous 2.0.x Apache releases have the HA support.  I think it is reasonable to incur down time for this.  We could allow ANN to come up in the layout upgrade mode. In this mode, SBN should be down and automatic failover should probably be disabled for safety. This may be checked using an admin tool or ANN in this mode may try to talk to SBN.  If this condition is met, ANN can do the layout upgrade, write out a new image and start a new edit segment (in shared edits directory too). After this point ANN can continue with the normal startup process and start serving.  SBN should do bootstrapStandby before attempting to start with the new version of NN. Once SBN is up, automatic failover can be re-enabled.\n\n\n2) Online upgrade snapshot in HA mode that can be used in rolling upgrade.\n\nIt seems not everyone cares about this feature, but for those who do it is important.\nOne high-level idea is that NN rolls edit, saves a copy of fsimage and edits, and the cluster goes into \"no block deletion\" mode. Some coordination is required among NNs and DNs. Also, blocks created after this \"snapshot\" won't be deleted in this mode. For blocks being written or get appended afterwards, we could make a copy or ignore them.  Depending on how nodes are coordinated, it may not provide a strictly consistent global snapshot, but still be enough to survive major disasters, which is what this feature is for.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-09-12T17:55:39.471+0000","updated":"2013-09-12T17:55:39.471+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12665812/comment/13765713","id":"13765713","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

This will do the local metadata upgrade and trigger the JNs to do the upgrade on their nameservice-specific directories.\n# Start the second NN, which upon connecting to the JNs will notice that it needs to perform an upgrade itself on its local on-disk metadata, much as the DNs currently do when connecting to an NN with a higher layout version.\n# Run for a while as normal to make sure it's all working.\n# Finalize the metadata upgrade.\n\nStep #2 will likely require that we expand the internal Journal API to have a few upgrade-related methods. Right now, most (all?) of the upgrade-related functionality is baked directly into the FileJournalManager or implemented elsewhere in the NN assuming that the FileJournalManager is the one being used.\n\nHow does this look from a high level?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

Myers","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here's a preliminary patch for folks to take a look at to get an idea of what I'm thinking here.\n\nThe patch makes a few changes to the way upgrade works in order to support HA upgrades. In particular:\n* Normal, non-HA upgrade is left unchanged.\n* I've removed the \"-finalize\" startup option, and instead running with this will direct users to use the `hdfs dfsadmin -finalizeUpgrade' command. Supporting both styles of finalization seems unnecessary, and makes HA finalization more difficult.\n* Starting the NN with the '-rollback' flag will perform the rollback just as before, but it will not then proceed to start the NN daemon. Supporting this mode also makes HA rollback more difficult, and doesn't seem to be necessary or helpful, since to perform a rollback we don't need to load the fsimage/edit log, and thus performing the actual rollback should be quick. Operators can then start the NN as normal after rolling back the FS.\n\nTo perform upgrade in the HA case, this patch does the following:\n* Both NNs must be started with the '-upgrade' flag.\n* On start, each one of the NNs will first try to create a special lock file, either in the shared edits dir in the NFS case or on each of the JNs in the QJM case. This lock file will contain the CTime that that NN would like to upgrade the FS to.\n* One of the NNs will win the creation of this file, and the other will lose. Whichever one loses will use the CTime stored in this file as the CTime to upgrade its own local dirs.\n* After either creating or reading the shared lock file, each NN will perform an upgrade just as normal of all its local storage dirs.\n* At the time when either NN is transitioned to the active state, that NN will perform an upgrade of the shared log, either on NFS or on the JNs.\n* To finalize an HA upgrade, an operator will just use hdfsadmin as described before. The active NN at the time this happens will perform the upgrade of the shared log. Finalization will also remove the shared log lock file previously described.\n* To perform a rollback in the HA case, both NNs should first be shut down. The operator should run the roll back command on one of the NN boxes, which will perform the rollback on the local dirs there, as well as on the shared log, either NFS or on the JNs. Afterward, this NN should be started and the operator should run `-bootstrapStandby' on the other NN.\n\nAs far as how the code is structured, much of the actual local file system upgrade code is refactored out of FSImage and into a new class, NNUpgradeUtil. This is so that this code can be called both from FSImage, and from FileJournalManager. Then, a few new upgrade-related methods are added to the JournalManager interface and the QJournalProtocol, so as to support generic upgrade of the shared log, however that shared log is implemented.\n\nPlease have a look. This patch definitely needs some cleanup and more tests, but I think the majority of it should roughly work and folks can hopefully get the gist.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

I've removed the \"-finalize\" startup option, and instead running with this will direct users to use the `hdfs dfsadmin -finalizeUpgrade' command.

Starting the NN with the '-rollback' flag will perform the rollback just as before, but it will not then proceed to start the NN daemon. Supporting this mode also makes HA rollback more difficult, and doesn't seem to be necessary or helpful, since to perform a rollback we don't need to load the fsimage/edit log, and thus performing the actual rollback should be quick. Operators can then start the NN as normal after rolling back the FS.\nSorry I am not sure I understand this. Why does HA rollback become more difficult?\n\nbq. On start, each one of the NNs will first try to create a special lock file, either in the shared edits dir in the NFS case or on each of the JNs in the QJM case.

Why cannot NN just write an editlog about upgrade intent, including the new layout version? During rollback we can discount the editlog starting from the upgrade intent log. Infact we can also consider requiring users to save namespace with empty editlogs? With this, perhaps we can avoid the following:\nbq. At the time when either NN is transitioned to the active state, that NN will perform an upgrade of the shared log, either on NFS or on the JNs.\n\nbq. To finalize an HA upgrade, an operator will just use hdfsadmin as described before. The active NN at the time this happens will perform the upgrade of the shared log.

Can you transfer this comment somewhere into the docs, perhaps hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/site/apt/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithQJM.apt.vm or a new page? Perhaps with a slightly more user-facing angle.\n\n- what would happen if the admin called finalizeUpgrade() when neither node had yet transitioned to active? I don't see any sanity check here.. is it possible you'd end up leaving the shared in an orphaned \"upgrading\" state and never end up finalizing it? Similarly, what happens if you start one NN with -upgrade, and you start the other one without -upgrade. It seems to me it should check for the upgrade lock file in the shared dir and say \"looks like an upgrade is in progress, please start the SBN with -upgrade\".\n\n- there are a few TODOs in the code that probably need to be addressed - nothing big, just a few things you may have missed.\n\nJournalManager.java:\n- would be good to add Javadoc on the new methods, so that JM implementors know what the upgrade process looks like. i.e what is pre-upgrade, etc?\n\nQuorumJournalManager.java:\n- \"Could not perform upgrade or more JournalNodes\" error message has some missing words in it.\n\n+    throw new IOException(\"Failed to lock shared log.\");\n- this line should be unreachable, right? maybe an AssertionError(\"Unreachable code\") would make more sense? Also this same exception message is used down below in canRollBack which isn't quite right.\n\nJournal:\n- when you upgrade the journal, I'd think you'd to copy over all the data from the PersistentLongFiles into the new dir?\n\nFileJournalManager:\n- worth considering a protobuf for the shared log lock, in case we want to add other fields to it later (instead of the custom serialization you do now)\n- need try...finally around the code where you write the shared log lock. On the read side you're also forgetting to close it.\n- the creation of the shared log lock file is non-atomic... I'm worried that we may hit the race in practice, since the AtomicFileOutputStream implies an fsync, which means that between the exists() check and the rename to the lock file, you may really have a decently long time window. Maybe we can use locking code like Storage does? Feel free to punt to a follow-up.\n\n\nFSNamesystem.java:\n- can you add a doc on doUpgradeOfSharedLogOnTransitionToActive()?\n\nNNUpgradeUtil.java:\n- why are some of the functions package-private and others are public?\n- make it an abstract class or give it a private constructor so it can't be instantiated, since it's just static methods\n- brief javadocs would be nice for these methods, even though they're straight refactors of existing code.\n\nFSEditLog.java:\n- in canRollBack(), you throw an exception if there is no shared log. That doesn't seem right...\n- capitalization of \"RollBack\" vs \"Rollback\" is a little inconsistent. Looks like Rollback is consistently used prior to this patch, so probably best to stick with that.\n\nFSImage.java:\n- in the switch statement on the startup option, I think you should keep the ROLLBACK case, but just have it throw AssertionError -- just to make sure we don't accidentally have some case where we're passing it there but shouldn't be.GA\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2014-01-07T09:34:16.279+0000","updated":"2014-01-07T09:34:16.279+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12665812/comment/13864509","id":"13864509","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

Please let me know if anything is unclear, or if you have any more questions.\n\nbq. Can you describe what is the difference between this vs older version of finalize? The command -finalize is fairly well know and this change will be backward compatible.\n\nI'm guessing you mean \"incompatible\" here. There's no \"this vs. older version of finalize.\" For as long as I can remember, we've always supported two ways of finalizing an upgrade: either by shutting down the running NN and then starting it again with the \"-finalize\" startup option, or by just running `hdfs dfsadmin -finalizeUpgrade' which makes an RPC to a running NN. The trouble with the startup option in an HA scenario is that an NN can't guarantee that it will be active at the time it starts, since determining who is active and who is standby is handled externally to the NN. I don't see any reason to prefer using the startup option even in a non-HA setup, so seemed like we could remove it here. I could certainly just remove support for it in the HA case, if you'd prefer.\n\nbq. Sorry I am not sure I understand this. Why does HA rollback become more difficult?\n\nIn the case of the '-upgrade' flag it's reasonable to only do the upgrade on transition to active, since we have to load the current fsimage/edits anyway before doing the upgrade, and the act of upgrading moves the transaction ID forward. In the case of '-rollback', however, it doesn't make much sense to start up in the standby state, load the full fsimage/edits, and then roll back everything, and reload the old fsimage upon becoming active. Given that the act of rolling back does not require loading the fsimage/edits at all, just moving some directories around, seems to make sense to me that this should not be a \"mode\" but rather just a standalone command that runs and then exits.                \n\nbq. Why is the lock file required? Why cannot NN just write an editlog about upgrade intent, including the new layout version? During rollback we can discount the editlog starting from the upgrade intent log. Infact we can also consider requiring users to save namespace with empty editlogs? With this, perhaps we can avoid the following:\n\nThis is again because an HA NN that is just starting up should not be writing to the shared log, but two HA NNs that are starting up need to synchronize/agree on the new CTime to use during upgrade. This needs to be known before doing the saveNamespace which is part of the upgrade process. You could imagine writing the new CTime to the edit log upon transitioning to the active state, but this would require the NNs to do the saveNamespace upon transitioning to active and/or when reading from the shared log as part of being the standby. It seems quite problematic to do the long, blocking operation of writing out a potentially large fsimage file in either of these places.\n \nbq. You mean finalize of the shared log in above?\n \nYep, sure did.

Can you transfer this comment somewhere into the docs, perhaps hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/site/apt/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithQJM.apt.vm or a new page? Perhaps with a slightly more user-facing angle.\n\nGood thinking. Done.\n\nbq. what would happen if the admin called finalizeUpgrade() when neither node had yet transitioned to active? I don't see any sanity check here.. is it possible you'd end up leaving the shared in an orphaned \"upgrading\" state and never end up finalizing it?\n\nGreat point. I've now added support for running finalizeUpgrade() on each NN from DFSAdmin, and made the DFSAdmin command also check to ensure that one NN is indeed active before it will finalize the upgrade.\n\nbq. Similarly, what happens if you start one NN with -upgrade, and you start the other one without -upgrade. It seems to me it should check for the upgrade lock file in the shared dir and say \"looks like an upgrade is in progress, please start the SBN with -upgrade\".\n\nGood thinking. Fixed.\n\nbq. there are a few TODOs in the code that probably need to be addressed - nothing big, just a few things you may have missed.\n\nYes, as I said, this was a prelim patch to make sure folks were OK with the direction. All of them are pretty trivial and have been addressed in the latest patch, except for this one, which I'd love to hear your thoughts on:\n{code}\n+    // TODO(atm): What should we do here in the case of multiple shared edits\n+    // dirs, which isn't actually possible at the moment?\n{code}\nMy suggestion is that until we do actually support having multiple shared edits dirs (perhaps never) that we should just assert that there is in fact only a single one here.\n\nbq. would be good to add Javadoc on the new methods, so that JM implementors know what the upgrade process looks like. i.e what is pre-upgrade, etc?\n\nYep, good thinking. Done. Please have a look at the new javadocs.\n\nbq. \"Could not perform upgrade or more JournalNodes\" error message has some missing words in it.\n\nEagle-eye Lipcon. Good catch. Done.\n\nbq. this line should be unreachable, right? maybe an AssertionError(\"Unreachable code\") would make more sense? Also this same exception message is used down below in canRollBack which isn't quite right.\n\nGood thinking. Done.\n\nbq. when you upgrade the journal, I'd think you'd to copy over all the data from the PersistentLongFiles into the new dir?\n\nGood catch. Done. I've also updated the tests to ensure that this happens during upgrade of JNs.\n\nbq. worth considering a protobuf for the shared log lock, in case we want to add other fields to it later (instead of the custom serialization you do now)\n\nI thought about this, but concluded that with just two fields it probably wasn't worth it. Do you feel strongly about this?\n\nbq. need try...finally around the code where you write the shared log lock. On the read side you're also forgetting to close it.\n\nGood catch. Fixed.\n\nbq. the creation of the shared log lock file is non-atomic... I'm worried that we may hit the race in practice, since the AtomicFileOutputStream implies an fsync, which means that between the exists() check and the rename to the lock file, you may really have a decently long time window. Maybe we can use locking code like Storage does? Feel free to punt to a follow-up.\n\nNote that in the case the lock file is being created on a JN, that the creation of the shared lock file is within a synchronized section. I agree that this could still be an issue in the NFS case, but seems to me like we can reasonably punt that to a later JIRA.\n\nbq. can you add a doc on doUpgradeOfSharedLogOnTransitionToActive()?\n\nYep, done.\n\nbq. why are some of the functions package-private and others are public?\n\nThat was an error. You're right that the one that was public can be package-private. Fixed.\n\nbq. make it an abstract class or give it a private constructor so it can't be instantiated, since it's just static methods\n\nDone. Made it abstract.\n\nbq. brief javadocs would be nice for these methods, even though they're straight refactors of existing code.\n\nSure. Added.\n\nbq. in canRollBack(), you throw an exception if there is no shared log. That doesn't seem right...\n\nIt actually is correct, since we only ever call this method in the event that HA is enabled, so there really should be a shared log. In the event that HA is not enabled, the upgrade of the edits dirs will be done directly on the storage dirs, instead of going through the edit log upgrade code path. The same is true FSEditLog#doPreUpgrade, doUpgrade, doFinalize, etc. I've changed the names of these methods to have \"OfSharedLog\" at the end to make this clear.\n\nbq. capitalization of \"RollBack\" vs \"Rollback\" is a little inconsistent. Looks like Rollback is consistently used prior to this patch, so probably best to stick with that.\n\nI attempted to consistenly use \"Rollback\" (one word) when it's used as a noun, and \"RollBack\" (two words) when it's used as a verb, which I believe to be grammatically correct. Perhaps it's best to stick with just one capitalization scheme for method/variable names, for consistency, even if it is technically incorrect English. Do you have an opinion here?\n\nbq. in the switch statement on the startup option, I think you should keep the ROLLBACK case, but just have it throw AssertionError – just to make sure we don't accidentally have some case where we're passing it there but shouldn't be.GA\n\nGood thinking. Done.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

Because after NN rollback you need to start NameNode as -regular, while DataNodes with -rollback startup option.\n\nIt's different, but not obvious to me that it's necessary less intuitive. I've personally always found it a bit strange that to roll back you need to start the NN _once_ with the '-rollback' option, which will result in it doing some things at startup, and then starting up as normal. This might seem to imply that the NN is running in some sort of \"rollback mode\", when in fact the act of rolling back has already completed, and thereafter you should always start the NN without the '-rollback' option.\n\nbq. Also just mentioning there could be some collisions with the rolling upgrade design, which I just finished reading. I think HDFS-5535 assumes current (pre-your-patch) behaviours of -rollback and -finalize. For -finalize the problem could be that you remove it as a start up option. May be Suresh can elaborate better on this.\n\nNeeding to roll back should (hopefully!) be such a rare occurrence that it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to not do that in a rolling way. Removal of the '-finalize' startup option, I would think, should make the whole thing easier, and doesn't seem to me to have any benefits vs. just using the finalizeUpgrade RPC.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

In documentation you say \" [[2]] Both NNs must be started with the <<<'-upgrade'>>> flag.\" Does this mean both the namenodes should be available during upgrade or does it just mean that namenodes must be started with -upgrade. One of the namenode can first upgrade (and possibly be finalized) and later second NN can be upgraded?\n\nCloser to the latter. OneNN can first upgrade, and even do the upgrade of the shared log, and later the second NN can be started with the -upgrade flag. It will see that an upgrade is in progress by presence of the shared log lock  and do its local upgrade with that CTime. One cannot, however, start the second NN with the -upgrade flag after the upgrade has been finalized, since doing so removes the shared log lock.\n\nbq. When active namenode is performing shared edits upgrade, if it fails, does fail over occur to the standby and does the new active resume the upgrade? Same question for finalize and rollback.\n\ni.e. if it fails to upgrade the shared log? That NN woud shut down and when the other NN became active (either manually or automatically) yes, it would try to upgrade the shared log at that time. Finalization - no, failure of that procedure would require the admin to re-attempt the finalization once the system was back up, and finalization requires both NNs to be running.\n\nbq. In documentation \"The operator should run the roll back command on one of the NN boxes,...\", could have issues related to which NN is chosen. It must be on the one where upgrade has been previously done right?\n\nWell, I had been assuming that both NNs had already been upgraded, in which case no, it doesn't matter which NN does the rollback. If the NN you tried to run rollback from had not in fact already been upgraded then it won't let you start with the '-rollback' option.\n\nbq. Given the rollback procedure, where bootstrapStandby muste be done on one of the NNs, why not just upgrade a single namenode (without worrying about two namenodes racing to upgrade etc.) and just follow the same procedure as rollback to simplify this?\n\nThat would certainly simplify the code quite a bit, since we could just assume that only one NN is running during the actual upgrade procedure, and I considered this option. Doing so means that there'd be some asymmetry between the two nodes involved in the whole HA upgrade procedure, e.g. you would then _have_ to do the rollback on the NN where you initiated the upgrade, but perhaps that's acceptable since layout version upgrades are relatively rare. If you'd be more comfortable with this approach then I can think about what it would take to rework the patch.\n\nbq. Another thing that comes mind is, the lock files are created on JNs. What if lock file was created on all but was deleted only on two. How does the presence of lock file on a JN affect the system?\n\nIn that case the finalization would fail and would need to be re-attempted.\n\nbq. FSNamesystem.java. I see that IDEs expand a.b.c.* imports to individual imports. You are changing it back to a.b.c.* in your patch.\n\nYea, that's where I recall resolving import conflicts. I'll take a look and fix those once I hear back from you on the above.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

I had brought up one issue about potentially losing editlogs on JournalNode. I thought that would be addressed before this jira can be committed. I have been very busy and have not been able to provide all my comments. Reviewing this patch has been quite tricky. Here are my almost complete review comments. While some of the issues are minor nits, I do not think this patch and the documentation is ready.\n\nI am adding information about the design, the way I understand it. Let me know if I got it wrong.\n*Upgrade preparation:*\n# New bits are installed on the cluster nodes.\n# The cluster is brought down.\n\n*Upgrade:* For HA setup, choose one of the namenodes to initiate upgrade on and start it with -upgrade flag.\n# NN performs preupgrade for all non shared storage directories by moving current to previous.tmp and creating new current.\n#* Failure here is fine. NN start up fails. Next attempt at upgrade the storage directories are recovered.\n# NN performs preupgrade of shared edits (NFS/JournalNodes) over RPC. JournalNodes current moved to previous.tmp and new current is created.\n#* If one of the JN preupgrade fails and upgrade is reattempted, editlog directory could be lost on the JN. Restarting the JN does not fix the issue.\n# NN performs upgrade of non shared edits by writing new CTIME to current and moving previous.tmp to previous.\n#* If one of the JN preupgrade fails and upgrade is reattempted, editlog directory could be lost on the JN. Restarting the JN does not fix the issue.\n# NN performs upgrade of shared edits (NFS/JournalNodes) over RPC. JournalNodes current has new CTIM and previous.tmp is moved to previous.\n# We need to document that all the JournalNodes must be up. If a JN is irrecoverably lost, configuration must be changed to exclude the JN.\n\n*Rollback:* NN is started with rollback flag\n# For all the non shared directories, the NN checks for canRollBack, essentially ensures that previous directory with the right layout version exists.\n# For all the shared directories, the NN checks for canRollBack, essentially ensures that previous directory with the right layout version exists.\n# NN performs rollback for shared directories (moving previous to current)\n#* If rollback of one of the JN fails, then directories are in inconsistent state. I think any attempt at retrying rollback will fail and will require manually moving files around. I do not think restarting JN fixes this.\n# We need to document that all the JournalNodes must be up. If a JN is irrecoverably lost, configuration must be changed to exclude the JN.\n\n*Finalize:* DFSAdmin command is run to finalize the upgrade.\n# Active NN performs finalizing of editlog. If JN's fail to finalize, active NN fails to finalize. However it is possible that standby finalizes, leaving the cluster in an inconsistent state.\n# We need to document that all the JournalNodes must be up. If a JN is irrecoverably lost, configuration must be changed to exclude the JN.\n\nComments on the code in the patch (this is almost complete):\nComments:\n# Minor nit: there are some white space changes\n# assertAllResultsEqual - for loop can just start with i = 1? Also if the collection objects is of size zero or one, the method can return early. Is there a need to do object.toArray() for these early checks? With that, perhaps the findbugs exclude may not be necessary.\n# Unit test can be added for methods isAtLeastOneActive, getRpcAddressesForNameserviceId and getProxiesForAllNameNodesInNameservice (I am okay if this is done in a separate jira)\n# Finalizing upgrade is quite tricky. Consider the following scenarios:\n#* One NN is active and the other is standby - works fine\n#* One NN is active and the other is down or all NNs - finalize command throws exception and the user will not know if it has succeeded or failed and what to do next\n#* No active NN - throws an exception cannot finalize with no active\n#* BlockPoolSliceStorage.java change seems unnecessary\n# Why is {{throw new AssertionError(\"Unreachable code.\");}} in QuorumJournalManager.java methods?\n# FSImage#doRollBack() - when canRollBack is false after checking if non-share directories can rollback, an exception must be immediately thrown, instead of checking shared editlog. Also printing Log.info when storages can be rolled back will help in debugging.\n# FSEditlog#canRollBackSharedLog should accept StorageInfo instead of Storage\n# QuorumJournalManager#canRollBack and getJournalCTime can throw AssertionError (from DFSUtil.assertAllResultsEqual()). Is that the right exception to expose or IOException?\n# Namenode startup throws AssertionError with -rollback option. I think we should throw IOException, which is how all the other failures are indicated.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-25T22:57:07.528+0000","updated":"2014-01-25T22:57:07.528+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12665812/comment/13882273","id":"13882273","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #462 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/462/])\nHDFS-5138.
