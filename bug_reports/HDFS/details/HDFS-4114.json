Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Konstantin: could you please elaborate on how you use the BackupNode?\n\nAs discussed in the thread, it's difficult to see how it's usable in its current state, and there has been no work in Apache to move it forward.\n\nHere are the issues I see with the backupnode:\n\n- It doesn't provide a hot standby, since it doesn't get any block information. I've seen your prototype using a \"load duplicator\", but that software is not available in Apache, and I don't think it would correctly handle the majority of the corner cases we had to solve during HDFS-1623 development.\n\n- Even with the above addressed, there is no functionality to \"promote\" a backup node to active, so it doesn't provide HA at all.\n\n- Because it uses RPC to transfer edits, it ties the availability and response time of the Active to the availability and response time of the Backup. Up until recently (HDFS-3126) there was no RPC timeout configured at all on the backup stream, so if the backup lost its network connection or otherwise froze, the active would freeze for several minutes if not indefinitely. Thus it actually _reduces_ availability in all currently released branches.\n\nAfter adding the timeout, there is now the possibility that the active and backup are not synchronized. Without external synchronization there is no way to know whether the two nodes are synchronized, and thus even if we _had_ a way to promote the backup, there's be no safe way to do so automatically without risking rollback of the namespace. So the backup cannot be used for automatic failover in its current form without substantial design changes.\n\n- Even if you are using the BN in an older version or a private fork, it is clear that you aren't maintaining it in current releases. The backupnode tests were failing for many months earlier this year with no one stepping up to fix them. Other contributors have had to step in and maintain the code, eg with fixes like HDFS-2666, HDFS-2764, HDFS-3625.\n\nSo, to summarize, please justify your -1 with an explanation of how you are using the BackupNode to provide some feature which is not already more mature and production-ready elsewhere in Hadoop 2.x.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-11-01T18:40:12.670+0000","updated":"2012-11-01T18:40:12.670+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613670/comment/13489078","id":"13489078","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Another example from today where the BackupNode test is failing and taking contributors' time: HDFS-4138","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-11-01T22:22:29.486+0000","updated":"2012-11-01T22:22:29.486+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613670/comment/13489318","id":"13489318","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> I'll re-purpose this jira to just remove the CheckpointNode.\n\nI wonder what that means. CheckpointNode is just a role of the BackupNode in which it performs checkpoints like SNN and does not keep the in-memory state in sync with the primary NN.\nSo changing the subject doesn't change the purpose.\n\nEli:\nFrom formalistic perspective you cannot just remove something from core Hadoop. You first need to deprecate it and then may remove in the next major version. That is the rule I was following for the last 7 years. Let me know if it has changed recently. And that is why particularly SNN was not removed but deprecated, otherwise we would have had a more efficient checkpointing engine, see below.\n\nTodd: \nI see BackupNode as a better way of creating checkpoints. SNN uploads the image and the edits from NN, merges them in memory and then sends back the new checkpoint.\nBN needs only to saveNamespace() from memory and then sends back the new image. This reduces the network traffic and local disk IOs on the upload of two large files. I have seen on multiple large clusters NameNode running much slower, when the checkpoint is in progress.\nIt is beneficial for HDFS performance to switch from SNN to BN for checkpointing. Therefore I would advocate re-re-deprecating SNN instead of removing BN.\nI accept your criticism that BackupNode code path was getting less attention from me personally and the community at large. Will have to work on that on my side.\nI would be glad to go into design discussion and potential enhancements of BackupNode with you. Would appreciate it given your experience with HA, as I believe the HA story for Hadoop isn't over with the implementation of Quorum Journal.\nAlthough this issue is not about it. Sticking to the point, what are your arguments for removing (or better say deprecating) BN besides that it has bugs? Software tends to have bugs. E.g. you do not propose to remove BlockScanner just because it couldn't been fixed over a series jiras.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-02T09:08:57.523+0000","updated":"2012-11-02T09:08:57.523+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613670/comment/13489627","id":"13489627","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"{quote}\nI see BackupNode as a better way of creating checkpoints.

As it stands today BackupNode is the only extension of the NameNode in the current code base.\nI do not think it is a sufficient reason to retain BackupNode. If you really want to show how Namenode can be extended, you could contribute another simpler, easier to maintain example that extends Namenode. In fact some of the constructs that are used only by BackupNode, I reckon, are not what extensions of Namenode would use. Some examples:\n# It  uses JournalProtocol and NamenodeProtocol to co-ordinate checkpointing. This is no longer necessary with the improvements in edits, where checkpointing can be done any time without the need to roll, start checkpoint, end checkpoint.\n# A lot of code in FSImage and FSEditLog caters to this, just for BackupNode. This code is not well documented. Adds unnecessary complexity.\n\nAs you see from the early patch, we can remove approximately 5000 lines of code. This code belongs to a functionality that no one tests or uses. In fact I will not be surprised that there are bugs lurking in that functionality that might cause major issues for a misguided user that ends up using it.\n\nGiven that I believe BackupNode should be removed. As regards to is any code that helps extending namenode is being removed, I would like to see a proposal on what extending a namenode means, which of the functionality relevant to that is being removed in my patch.\n\nbq. You are right it's been a while and I have a debt to provide proper ones, which is on my todo list.\nI fail to understand what the plans for BackupNode are and why is it relevant anymore. Describing that would help.\n\nbq.  If you wish we can assign this issue to me so that I could take care of it in the future.\nI wish just assigning a bug to you would have been that easy. When making changes in the code, with a feature in mind, there are lot of these unused code and tests that also need change. This is currently a tax that feature developers are paying. The folks working on a feature have a time frame that they are working towards. Having to depend on you for related changes means, having to co-ordinate the work with you, getting the work done within the timeline. This will not only be work for you, but also work for people working on features. It is hard for me to reason why spend all that effort?\n\nI can give you few examples where folks had to do all this unnecessary work:\n- When we did protobuf support we had to add support for all the protocols that is only used by BackupNode.\n- In HA, considerable coding and testing effort went into supporting BackupNode.\n- Recently, when I worked on retry cache, I spent a lot of time just understanding how all this works and added support for retriabiliity.\n- I also know that [~jingzhao] and [~wheat9] spent time on BackupNode specific functionality when working on http policy and https support related cleanup.\n\nUnless there are justified reasons for retaining this functionality, regular contributors of HDFS will have to continue pay this cost. We have waited almost an year for a plan for taking BackupNode forward. I also think with Namenode HA stabilizing, even if there is a plan, I am not sure how relevant it would be.\n\nA suggestion is to move this functionality to github and as HDFS changes you could maintain it. This in essence is equivalent to involving you to maintain BackupNode related functionality for features added to HDFS, without the cost of co-ordination.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-06T19:46:17.478+0000","updated":"2013-12-06T19:54:07.484+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613670/comment/13963596","id":"13963596","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Rebased","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-08T23:13:29.798+0000","updated":"2014-04-08T23:13:29.798+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613670/comment/13963721","id":"13963721","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

The 001 patch looks good to me as a first step. +1.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-11T23:50:34.133+0000","updated":"2014-04-11T23:50:45.858+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613670/comment/13967261","id":"13967261","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~jingzhao] for the review.

It might not be widely used at the moment, but it provides certain benefits to some of us in the community.\nBackupNode was introduced in 2008/2009. I do not see any one using it. [~cos], have you used it?\n\nComing to benefits, can you explain what they are? Please review my comments. I do not see any benefits at this time, other than serving to confuse and create unnecessary work. What are the plans you have for BackupNode and please help us understand the reason for retaining it.\n\nbq. BackupImage class had two tiny patches since February 2013.BackupJournalManager has been touched 5 times in 2+ years. BackupNode was modified 6 times in about the same time, and so on.\nBackupNode related code just does not exist in these classes only. It is in FSEditLog, FSImage etc. as well. There are also many unnecessary protocols. Please review the patch posted to see the extent of code associated. If you count all these places, there are many other changes that had to be made during HA, retry Cache, FSImage and editlog related work. That said, even a single unnecessary change made to parts that are no longer relevant is one too many.\n\nThis issue has been brought up by several folks. Active committers to HDFS no longer see any reason to retain this functionality. Other active committers and contributors, if you disagree, please speak up.\n\nThese are possible things I can see going forward:\n- Please post responses to my comments earlier. Please post what you plan to do with BackupNode. Please justify your veto based on technical reasons.\n- We can comment out the code or we can start creating jiras for BackupNode changes only to be picked up by [~shv]. The problem I see with the second option is, having to wait for [~shv] to make progress on any work that requires change to BackupNode.\n\nGoing silent and not responding to comments in a timely manner and only responding when code changes are about to be made (with someone putting all the effort to make the changes) is not being nice to others in the community.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-17T18:12:15.011+0000","updated":"2014-04-17T18:12:15.011+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613670/comment/13976091","id":"13976091","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~sureshms].\n# I thought I answered all of your questions here in this jira and in the hdfs-dev@ thread that was happening around the same time.\nI thoroughly reviewed the comment you are citing.
