Looks like the issue is like this:\n1. After NN1 got suspended, NN2 started the transition. It first tried to stop the editlog tailer thread.\n2. The editlog tailer thread happened to trigger NN1 to roll its editlog right before the transition, and this rpc call got stuck since NN1 was suspended.\n3. It took a relatively long time (>1min) for the rollEditlog rpc call to receive the connection reset exception.\n4. During this time, NN2 waited for the tailer thread to die, and the fsnamesystem lock was held by the stopStandbyService call.\n5. haadmin's getServiceState request could not get response (since the lock was held by the transition thread in NN2) and timeout (its default socket timeout is 20s).\n\nIn summary, it is possible that the rollEditlog rpc call from the standby NN to the active NN in the editlog tailer thread may delay the NN failover.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-11T22:12:54.489+0000","updated":"2014-03-11T22:12:54.489+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700823/comment/13931048","id":"13931048","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Since in active NN we already have a NameNodeEditLogRoller thread triggering the editlog roll, I guess the standby NN doesn't need to trigger the active namenode to roll the editlog.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-11T22:15:13.732+0000","updated":"2014-03-11T22:15:13.732+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700823/comment/13931136","id":"13931136","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Simple patch to remove the editlog roll from SBN.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-11T23:22:14.931+0000","updated":"2014-03-11T23:22:14.931+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700823/comment/13931275","id":"13931275","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

I guess I understand your concern now: only rolling on ANN based on edits # may cause issue in some scenario. This is because if we don't have further operations it is possible that SBN will wait a long time to tail that part of edits which is in an in-progress segment.\n\nbq. Checkpointing combines the edit log with the fsimage, and we purge unnecessary log segments afterwards.\nBut I'm still a little confused about this part. I fail to see the difference of the based-on-time rolling from SBN and ANN. In the current code, SBN triggers rolling still through RPC to ANN. Also this does not affect checkpointing and purging: when SBN does a checkpoint, both SBN and ANN will purge old edits in their own storage (SBN does the purging before uploading the checkpoint, and ANN does it after getting the new fsimage).\n\nSo I guess a possible solution may be: just letting ANN does rolling every 2min. I think this can achieve almost the same effect as the current mechanism, without delaying the failover. Or you see some counter examples with this change?\n\nBack to the changing the rpc timeout solution. Looks like we have not set timeout for this NN-->NN rpc right now (correct me if I'm wrong). Setting a timeout (e.g., 20s just like the default timeout from client to NN) of course can improve the failover time in our test case, but I still prefer the above solution because it makes the rolling behavior simpler and more predictable (especially it removes the rpc call from SBN to ANN).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-19T06:23:15.213+0000","updated":"2014-03-19T06:23:15.213+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700823/comment/13940834","id":"13940834","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hmm, let me try to explain one more time.

In this scenario, the ANN will keep rolling every 2mins, generating a lot of edit log segments that aren't being cleared out. I've seen oblivious customers run for a month while checkpointing was nonfunctional, and 2 min rolling would lead to an awful lot of files. This is one reason why the ANN autoroller rolls on a size basis rather than time. It should generates fewer, larger segments, which is more manageable.\n\nThis isn't a super major issue, but I thought I'd bring it up as a reason why we might prefer a different solution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-19T18:53:36.338+0000","updated":"2014-03-19T18:53:36.338+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700823/comment/13941117","id":"13941117","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

Yes, we cannot do auto rolling simply based on time, and the reason is just like [~andrew.wang] pointed out.\n\nHopefully this is my last question, just want to make sure: the current SBN auto roller can cause the same issue like \"a lot of edit log segments aren't being cleared out\" in case that checkpoints are broken (but the SBN is not down), right?\n\nAnyway I will post a patch to add rpc timeout later.
