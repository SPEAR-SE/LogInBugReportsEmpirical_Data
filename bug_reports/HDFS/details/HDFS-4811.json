Thread 2 attempts to rename ckpt to curFile.  On Linux and OS X, the rename succeeds, but now the fsimage file has incomplete content, because thread 1 hasn't finished writing into it.  On Windows, the rename fails, so we delete the existing fsimage.  However, the second attempt at renaming also fails because thread 1 holds a lock on the file.\n\nThe problem is more visible on Windows.  We see an intermittent failure in {{TestStandbyCheckpoints#testBothNodesInStandbyState}}.\n\nOne potential solution would be for {{GetImageServlet}} to take the namesystem lock while downloading the image from the other namenode and renaming.  {{StandbyCheckpointer#doCheckpoint}} already acquires the namesystem lock, so doing the same in {{GetImageServlet}} would enforce mutual exclusion.\n\nNote that we are already protected against multiple put image calls by {{GetImageServlet}} tracking currently downloading checkpoints and rejecting duplicated requests.  This is just a race condition with the namenode running its own checkpoint.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-09T21:50:29.591+0000","updated":"2013-05-09T21:50:29.591+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646892/comment/13653281","id":"13653281","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~tlipcon] and [~andrew.wang], yes, it sounds like it would.
