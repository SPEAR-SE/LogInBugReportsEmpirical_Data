If so, then using decommissioning might not work in the current scenario.\n\n@Allen: HDFS currently assumes that the entire disk space on the cluster is readable/writable. This keeps the accounting of used space/free space, etc pretty simple. If there is aviailable disk space, then it can be used to store new files in HDFS. The entire space available in the data directories are free disk space. If we allow the datanode to remember read-only disks, then there will be some changes in accounting. Similarly, there will be some changes needed for reporting and alerting adminstrators. This means that the \"adminstration\" of the cluster becomes slightly more complex. The advantage is that the last bit of disk space gets to be used.\n\nSo, my question is: are you seeing this to be a real problem on production clusters?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2008-10-22T05:56:44.002+0000","updated":"2008-10-22T05:56:44.002+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406944/comment/12641869","id":"12641869","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Yes, we're seeing this to be a problem.

There is a very good chance that if you have multiple disks, you have swap spread across those disks.  In the case of drive failure, this means you lose a chunk of swap.  Loss of swap==less memory for streaming jobs==job failure in many, many instances.  So let's not get distracted with the issues around MR, job failure, job speed, etc.\n\nWhat I'm seeing is that at any given time we have 10-20% of our nodes down. The vast majority have a single failed disk.  This means we're leaving capacity on the floor, waiting for a drive replacement.  Why can't these machines just stay up, providing blocks and providing space on the good drives?  For large clusters, this might be a minor inconvenience but for small clusters this could be deadly. \n\nThe current fix is done with wetware, a source of additional strain on traditionally overloaded operations teams.  Random failure times vs. letting the ops team decide when a data node goes down?  This seems like a no brainer from a practicality perspective. Yes, this is clearly more difficult than just killing the node completely.  But over the long haul, it is going to be cheaper in human labor to fix this in Hadoop than to throw more admins at it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2008-10-27T18:23:01.431+0000","updated":"2008-10-27T18:23:01.431+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406944/comment/12776511","id":"12776511","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chansler","name":"chansler","key":"chansler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Chansler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HDFS-457 is a close approximation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chansler","name":"chansler","key":"chansler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Chansler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-11T16:55:14.487+0000","updated":"2009-11-11T16:55:14.487+0000"}],"maxResults":10,"total":10,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-138/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0iv13:"}}
