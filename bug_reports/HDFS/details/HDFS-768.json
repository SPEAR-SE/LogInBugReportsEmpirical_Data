Some of the raid dependencies were on incompatible versions of libraries; I've updated these as follows:\n\n* aspectj: upgraded 1.5.3 to 1.6.4\n* commons-httpclient: DOWNGRADED 3.1 to 3.0.1\n\nThere were three dependencies that I couldn't fix -- servlet-api-2.5.jar, slf4j-log4j12-1.4.3.jar, and jsp-api-2.0.jar.\n\nI don't know why, but ivy complains that it can't find the specified versions of these if I use the properties from the main project. Maybe someone who's better with ivy than I could take a look, or a raid-project maintainer should update the rest of the dependencies. In either case, I don't think this is a blocker for inclusion of this patch.
