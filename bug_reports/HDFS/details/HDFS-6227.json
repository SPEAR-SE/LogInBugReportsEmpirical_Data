See this code in {{ShortCircuitCache#unref}}:\n\n{code}\n      int newRefCount = --replica.refCount;\n      if (newRefCount == 0) {\n        // Close replica, since there are no remaining references to it.\n        Preconditions.checkArgument(replica.purged,\n            \"Replica \" + replica + \" reached a refCount of 0 without \" +\n            \"being purged\");\n        replica.close();\n{code}\n\nNotice that we would throw a precondition exception if the replica hadn't been purged.  (\"Purged\" means that it has been removed from the cache and will not be handed out to new readers.)  There is no other path to calling {{ShortCircuitReplica#close}}.\n\nCan you say a little bit more about the platform and version that you saw this on?  Can you reproduce it?
