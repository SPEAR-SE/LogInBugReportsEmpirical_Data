A given file may have other non-equal URIs too.  For example, one may use a hostname, a second an IP address, and a third an HFTP uri.\n\nHowever, like HTTP URLS, whenever possible we try to elide the default HDFS port from URIs.  We could alternately try to always insert them, but eliding seemed more user-friendly, and, regardless, both versions are unambiguous URIs for a single file.\n\nOne improvement might be to change Path#equals() to use a registry of default ports per scheme, so that the Paths could be equal in this case.  Alternately we could abandon the idea of a default port.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-02-09T17:35:46.271+0000","updated":"2010-02-09T17:35:46.271+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12455786/comment/12831554","id":"12831554","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"That would be reasonable.
