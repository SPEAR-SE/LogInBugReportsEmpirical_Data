We saw a case where cluster admin wants to reduce HBase RegionServer read timeout so as to detect DataNode crash quickly, but did not realize it affects write acknowledgement timeout.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the effective DataNode write timeout is shorter than the effective client write acknowledgement timeout. If the last two DataNodes in the write pipeline crashes, client would think the first DataNode is faulty (the DN appears unresponsive because it is still waiting for the ack from downstream DNs), dropping it and then HBase RS would crash because it is unable to write to any good DataNode. This scenario is possible during a rack failure.\r\n\r\nThis problem is even worse for Cloudera Manager-managed cluster. By default, CM-managed HBase RegionServer sets {{dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable = false}}. Even one unresponsive DataNode could crash HBase RegionServer.\r\n\r\nI am raising this Jira to discussÂ two possible solutions\r\n # add a new config for write acknowledgement timeout. Do not depend on read timeout\r\n # or, update the description of dfs.client.socket-timeout in core-default.xml so that admin is aware write acknowledgement timeout depends on this configuration.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12909080","id":"12909080","filename":"HDFS-13103.001.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-02-03T04:13:24.864+0000","size":7142,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12909080/HDFS-13103.001.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HDFS Client write acknowledgement timeout should not depend on read timeout","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"CDH5.7.0 and above + Cloudera Manager.
