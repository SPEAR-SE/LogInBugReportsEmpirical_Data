P. McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"So, the intention when writing {{XMLUtils#mangleXmlString}} was that it would handle stuff that the normal XML parser didn't.  Basically XML says that there's just no way to have certain code points in your document, so it fails to provide a standard way to escape them.  One example is the first few code points like code point 0, 1, 2, etc.  There IS a standard way to escape things like <, >, %, etc. so we didn't handle those.  {{org.xml.sax.XMLReader}} already escapes those code points.\n\nSince you're not using XMLParser, you don't get the benefit of this \"built-in\" escaping.\nYou could get it manually with this:\n\n{code}\npublic static string XmlUnescape(string escaped) {\n    XmlDocument d = new XmlDocument();\n    var node = d.CreateElement(\"root\");\n    node.InnerXml = escaped;\n    return node.InnerText;\n}\n\npublic static string XmlEscape(string unescaped){\n    XmlDocument d = new XmlDocument();\n    var node = d.CreateElement(\"root\");\n    node.InnerText = unescaped;\n    return node.InnerXml;\n}\n{code}\n\nOr we could add this functionality to XMLUtils#mangleXmlString.  But we'd have to handle all the XML code points that need escaping (I think <, >, &, and maybe some of the quote signs).  Also it would need to be optional, to avoid double-escaping for callers who are using {{org.xml.sax.XMLReader}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

If you look at: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/  it says, \"XML 1.1 can represent certain control characters, but it cannot represent the null byte or unpaired Unicode surrogate codepoints, even after escaping. escapeXml11 will remove characters that do not fit in the following ranges...\"  So we can't use this function since it simply removes a bunch of code points rather than trying to represent them.  There are also serious compatibility issues in upgrading commons-lang 2.6 to 3.0, so I think it may have to wait until Hadoop 3.0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
