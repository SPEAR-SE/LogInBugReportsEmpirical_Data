Because HDFS-6825 count on the namespace checking (whether dirX exists in its parent dir) to decide whether a file has been deleted, the newly created dirX defeats this checking, thus OP_CLOSE for the already deleted file gets into the edit log, due to delayed block removal.\n\nWhat we need to do is to have a more robust way to detect whether a file has been

Now I am  thinking about a possibly cleaner one: if we have a dir/file creation time, then we can compare the creation time to determine that a dir is newer than the file.  I searched and found HADOOP-1377, which initially introduced creation time but dropped later per the discussion there. Due to the nature of delayed block removal, the scenario described in this jira is a valid case to handle. It seems having creation time would make the detection of deleted file much easier.\n\nWell, when we copy file, if we use -p option to preserve attributes, including creation time, then the creation time of a file under a dir may be older than the dir's creation time. So this might not be foolproof.  If files/dirs under a dir have newer creation time than the parent, then it would work. Even if it works, existing clusters don't have creation time, it won't be a backward compatible solution. On the other hand, the first possible solution will be backward compatible.\n\nJust throw the thoughts here, if any one has insight, I'd appreciate if could share.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-01T20:31:57.657+0000","updated":"2015-02-01T20:31:57.657+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771185/comment/14301639","id":"14301639","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"[~yzhangal] Can you post the test case for reference?

The code you pasted there indicates that the release you are running has HDFS-6527 but not HDFS-6825. \n\nHDFS-7707 is to remedy HDFS-6825 fix, for the special the case that a new dir is created with the same name as the previously deleted dir. It's possible HDFS-6825 alone can solve your issue (you can try now to see if that's the case since HDFS-6825 fix is already committed), or you need to wait for HDFS-7707 fix and combine with HDFS-6825 fix. \n\nThanks.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-03T14:48:58.982+0000","updated":"2015-02-03T14:48:58.982+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771185/comment/14303443","id":"14303443","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"If snapshot is not involved, the parent of the file inode will be null, so the existing check should work.
