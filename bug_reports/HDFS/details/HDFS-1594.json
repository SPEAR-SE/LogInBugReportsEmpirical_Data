I left the memory checking in this reworked patch, but I think this feature should probably be removed. Unclear how this would interact with Java GC, and unclear if entering safemode would actually help the situation.\n# Todd mentioned that he's seen edit log corruptions from the log volume filling up. Perhaps we should add an additional configuration option to let the user specify arbitrary volumes to check, besides just the volumes containing the edits/name dirs?\n# I switched the configuration of disk space amount from a percentage to a number of bytes remaining, since volume sizes may differ, and thus a fixed amount of space reserved seems more appropriate. Perhaps there should be a way to specify the threshold per-volume?\n# I'm a little concerned that we might see a problem where the NN will reach the threshold and then thrash in and out of safemode as it sits on the cusp of the configured free space. Perhaps we should not automatically leave safemode in the event the resources later return to normal? Or make this behavior configurable? It seems to me that an NN volume running out of space should be a cause for concern, so it might be reasonable for an admin to have to manually force the NN out of safe mode.\n\nI should also mention that I did some manual testing of this patch by setting the reserve amount to a little less than the amount of space free on my hard drive, and then creating a large file from /dev/urandom to observe the NN entering/leaving safemode as the threshold was reached.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

The original JIRA description indicated that this problem was caused only by the disk filling up, yet the original patches also monitor for a near-full JVM heap. I left the memory checking in this reworked patch, but I think this feature should probably be removed. Unclear how this would interact with Java GC, and unclear if entering safemode would actually help the situation.\n\nI agree, should be pulled out to a separate jira.\n\nbq. 3. Todd mentioned that he's seen edit log corruptions from the log volume filling up. Perhaps we should add an additional configuration option to let the user specify arbitrary volumes to check, besides just the volumes containing the edits/name dirs?\n\nGood idea, there's nothing edits specific here. Would need to add a test that if the admin does pass in the volume that hosts the edits log it doesn't conflict with the default behavior (eg double monitoring).\n\nbq. 3. I switched the configuration of disk space amount from a percentage to a number of bytes remaining, since volume sizes may differ, and thus a fixed amount of space reserved seems more appropriate. Perhaps there should be a way to specify the threshold per-volume?\n\nWhat's the intended behavior if there are n disks and one fills up before the others? Seems like this volume should be taken off-line and the NN does not enter SM. If there's just a global threshold would this cause the overall threshold to drop (because the removed volume's free space not longer counts towards the total), causing a cascade where the other volumes go off-line? This would suggest a threshold per volume. Though if we can make a single, simple threshold work that seems better from a usability perspective.\n\nbq. 4. I'm a little concerned that we might see a problem where the NN will reach the threshold and then thrash in and out of safemode as it sits on the cusp of the configured free space. Perhaps we should not automatically leave safemode in the event the resources later return to normal? Or make this behavior configurable? It seems to me that an NN volume running out of space should be a cause for concern, so it might be reasonable for an admin to have to manually force the NN out of safe mode.\n\nSeems there are two scenarios here:\na. The admin can easily free up some space\nb. The admin can not easily free up space (eg needs to compact the log because the 2NN wasn't running for a while, need to resize the volume, replace the disk etc).\n\nIn both cases I think the admin would want to have to manually tell the NN to leave SM while they are working (eg w/o them explicitly telling it to do so). If they want automatic behavior they can continuosly monitor/roll on these volumes so they don't get into this scenario, and they don't want the monitoring/rolling to race with the free space detection (eg they'd want to have to take action if this process ever crosses the threshold they set). Ie seems like once you've gone into SM due to lack of free space you should stay there until the admin has had a chance to rectify.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-04-15T17:46:07.283+0000","updated":"2011-04-15T17:46:07.283+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12496536/comment/13020375","id":"13020375","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Another test to add: the interaction between this detection and the CN check-pointing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-04-15T17:51:09.079+0000","updated":"2011-04-15T17:51:09.079+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12496536/comment/13021345","id":"13021345","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

I disagree. I think losing one of the (supposedly redundant) volumes is sufficient cause for alarm as to warrant the whole thing being put into SM.\n\nThe NN can tolerate the failure of an edit log volume and continue operation, why is running out of disk space warrant a differetn outcome?  You could make the case that running out of disk space is a correlated failure (is likely to affect the other disks equally if they have similar capacities), but it may not be (eg the network mount may run out early or have more free space) in which case we'd be less available than we otherwise could me.

I'm in favor of the current implementation - a single configurable threshold, which applies to each volume separately.\n\nThat sounds good to me. Since the threshold is a factor of how much slack the NN needs (ie is independent of the volume size) a single value enforeced across all volumes makes sense.\n\nI'll check out your latest patch. In the mean time note that the TestStartup and TestEditLog failures are due to the patch (the NN is going into SM, looks like the threshold is getting crossed).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-04-21T19:34:44.342+0000","updated":"2011-04-21T19:34:44.342+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12496536/comment/13022896","id":"13022896","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cos","name":"cos","key":"cos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741"},"displayName":"Konstantin Boudnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Aaron, for the test case you can check HDFS-1566, perhaps","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cos","name":"cos","key":"cos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741"},"displayName":"Konstantin Boudnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-04-21T20:04:46.600+0000","updated":"2011-04-21T20:04:46.600+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12496536/comment/13022920","id":"13022920","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Looks great.
