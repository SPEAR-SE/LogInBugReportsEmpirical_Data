HADOOP-1869 is long and a bit unclear.  A number of people did advocate posix compliance.  My reading is there was concern over lots of atime updates for directories, however posix just requires atime to set at creation time.  Using a directory's mtime in place of atime, thus removing atime, really violates posix.  Banning setTimes on a directory also violates posix.\n\nBreaking all these posix semantics could spell trouble for filesystems that do want to adhere to posix, including FUSE implementations.\n\nAs a related aside: For performance reasons, I can see not updating a directory's mtime when its contents are altered, but why aren't we updating mtime when the owner/group/permissions are changed?
