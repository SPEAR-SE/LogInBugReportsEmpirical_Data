While current implementation doesn't do this.  Unless those temporarily-down-DNs are restarted again and NN receives block report from them, NN will mark replicas of that block *corrupt*.\n\nThis results in that user could get blocks with corrupt locations of different lengths or genStamp as you said, it's an critical issue.\n\nAs I, you and Plamen discussed in HDFS-7886, in those tests, we rely on block report indeed happens after DN restarted, the reason is that NN will mark the replicas on bad DN corrupt and truncated block will be replicated to the bad DN after it restarted.

I took further look and found more:\n*1.* {quote}  but I don't know what is the reason for postponing replica deletion. Postponing should probably be avoided in this case, since the commitBlockSync() is as good as block report for the particular block.{quote}\n\nThe result is as following:\n  * The postponing log in {{invalidateBlock}} called by {{markBlockAsCorrupt}} is not by result of block recovery, and it's by result of block report from {{dn0}} after it restarts. \n  * Because as discussed, we will call {{setDataNodeDead}} after {{dn0}} shutdown, it results in NN checks heartbeat and finds {{dn0}} dead then remove {{dn0}}. Later we do truncate, block recovery happens, and genStamp of last block is increased.  Then {{dn0}} restarts successfully and block report happens, but it's replica of last block has old genStamp, so it will be marked as corrupted, when NN invalidates it's block replica, {{nr.replicasOnStaleNodes() > 0}} is *true*, which is because {{DatanodeStorageInfo#blockContentsStale}} for {{dn0}} in NN is *true* at this time.  {{blockContentsStale}} is set to *false* in {{DatanodeStorageInfo#receivedBlockReport}} which is called after we finish processing block report in {{BlockManager}}.\n\n*2.*\n{quote}\notherwise NN can schedule recovery (with 1/3 probablity) on the dead DN as a primary. It will wait for the heartbeat from it, but will never receive it because it is down.\n{quote}\nYes, the {{checkBlockRecovery()}} timeout is because of this.  Currently when starting block recovery, NN chooses a DN (we say dn0) as primary, {{dn0}} can get the {{BlockRecoveryCommand}} through the response of it's heartbeat to NN. but if the {{dn0}} is dead, blockrecovery will not happen. Until {{expiredHardLimit{}}} is *true* in {{LeaseManager#checkLeases}}, then a new DN will be chosen as the primary and schedule a new block recovery for that last block.\n\n*3.*\n{quote}\nYou need to call setDataNodeDead() after shutdown()\n{quote}\nOur modification to {{testTruncateWithDataNodesRestart}} is to assert replicas is decreased by 1 because replica of last block on {{dn0}} should be marked as corrupt in NN after block recovery.\nIf we set {{setDataNodeDead}} after {{dn0}} shutdown and before {{truncate}}, the replicas is already decreased by 1, then new added assertion doesn't make sense.\n\n*4.*\n{quote}\nBTW, your change completely eliminates the failure of testTruncateWithDataNodesRestartImmediately() from HDFS-7886, which I ran without triggerBlockReports().\n{quote}\nRight :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-03-19T05:33:55.704+0000","updated":"2015-03-19T06:14:08.164+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12781904/comment/14368562","id":"14368562","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"I think it's fine to remove the modification to {{testTruncateWithDataNodesRestart}} in the patch, the reason is as #2, #3 above.
