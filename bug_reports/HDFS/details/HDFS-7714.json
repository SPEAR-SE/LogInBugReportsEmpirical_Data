I saw that the main {{BPServiceActor#run}} loop was active for one NameNode, but for the other one, it had reported the fatal \"Initialization failed\" error from this part of the code:\n\n{code}\n      while (true) {\n        // init stuff\n        try {\n          // setup storage\n          connectToNNAndHandshake();\n          break;\n        } catch (IOException ioe) {\n          // Initial handshake, storage recovery or registration failed\n          runningState = RunningState.INIT_FAILED;\n          if (shouldRetryInit()) {\n            // Retry until all namenode's of BPOS failed initialization\n            LOG.error(\"Initialization failed for \" + this + \" \"\n                + ioe.getLocalizedMessage());\n            sleepAndLogInterrupts(5000, \"initializing\");\n          } else {\n            runningState = RunningState.FAILED;\n            LOG.fatal(\"Initialization failed for \" + this + \". Exiting. \", ioe);\n            return;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n{code}\n\nThe {{ioe}} was an {{EOFException}} while trying the {{registerDatanode}} RPC.  Lining up timestamps from NN and DN logs, I could see that the NN had restarted at the same time, causing it to abandon this RPC connection, ultimately triggering the {{EOFException}} on the DataNode side.\n\nMost importantly, the fact that it was on the code path with the fatal-level logging means that it would never reattempt registration with this NameNode.  {{shouldRetryInit()}} must have returned {{false}}.  The implementation of {{BPOfferService#shouldRetryInit}} is that it should only retry if the other one already registered successfully:\n\n{code}\n  /*\n   * Let the actor retry for initialization until all namenodes of cluster have\n   * failed.\n   */\n  boolean shouldRetryInit() {\n    if (hasBlockPoolId()) {\n      // One of the namenode registered successfully. lets continue retry for\n      // other.\n      return true;\n    }\n    return isAlive();\n  }\n{code}\n\nTying that all together, this bug happens when the first attempted NameNode registration fails but the second succeeds.  The DataNode process remains running, but with only one live {{BPServiceActor}}.\n\nHDFS-2882 had a lot of discussion of DataNode startup failure scenarios.  I think the summary of that discussion is that the DataNode should in general retry its NameNode registrations, but it should instead abort right away if there is no possibility for registration to be successful.  (i.e. There is a misconfiguration or a hardware failure.)  I think the change we need here is that we should keep retrying the {{registerDatanode}} RPC if there is NameNode downtime or transient connectivity failure.  Other failure reasons should still cause an abort.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-30T21:05:25.983+0000","updated":"2015-01-30T21:05:25.983+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771422/comment/14299338","id":"14299338","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"On a related note, I've seen similar symproms when the two namenodes' ctimes in their storage are different. After a datanode registers with one nn, it won't be able to register with the other and cause the actor thread to die. Depending on whom each datanode talk to first, they will be divided into two sets, each of which talking to only one namenode, thus creating a split brain situation.  Of course, running two namenodes with different storage version is a mistake, but I've seen people making this kind of mistake multiple times. Whenever it happened, I wished for a way to start the actor thread back up.
