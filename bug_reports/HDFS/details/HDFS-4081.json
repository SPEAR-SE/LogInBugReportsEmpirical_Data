The inconsistency arises\nbecause in some cases the NN code uses the Java getHostName call to\nretrieve the NN's hostname (returns n01) to form a principal name while\nclients connecting to the NN use the Java getCanonicalName call (returns\nn01.region....) to form principal names. We tried to address this issue by\nexplicitly setting the NN's principal via *dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.\n*\n\nUnfortunately, the key *dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal *has different\nmeanings depending on the context in which it is used. In one case, the\nNamenode uses it to establish the principal its server principal name. In\nthe other case, the same Namenode uses the same key to figure the principal\nname to use with an incoming (client) connection. I believe the Hadoop\nSecurity docs I have seen recommend that you create a unique (host\nqualified) principal per machine (at least the CDH docs recommend this).\nSo, in this scenario you have different principal names for the NN and the\n2NN (as an example). If someone uses the *dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal *key\nto set an explicit principal name for the NN, authentication with the 2NN\nbreaks because the code in ServiceAuthorizationManager is unable to\nconstruct a proper principal name for the 2NN from the explicit name set\nfor the NN.\n\nPerhaps the short term fix is to better document how to use the *\ndfs.namenode.kerberos.principal* config key. If you set its value to be an\nexplicit principal name, then you have to use the exact same principal name\nacross all nodes that try to authenticate with the secured NN protocol. If\nyou are using host qualified principal names for each node in the cluster,\nthen you must specify a pattern based principal name in\n*dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal\n*that can be used by the NN to both establish its own principal name and an\nincoming client's principal name.\n\nWe worked around the issue by changing our NN / 2NN hostnames to match the\nfully qualified names returned by DNS. Longer term, I would recommend that\nwe (a) fix the code in the NN to consistently use getCanonicalName whenever\nit tries to use a hostname for the purposes of forming a principal name and\n(b) perhaps split *dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal *into *\ndfs.namenode.kerberos.principal* and *\ndfs.namenode.kerberos.client.principal. *\n\nI apologize for the lengthy answer :-)\n\nAhad.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahadr","name":"ahadr","key":"ahadr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahad Rana","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-10-19T17:14:11.365+0000","updated":"2012-10-19T17:14:11.365+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12612531/comment/13480234","id":"13480234","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahadr","name":"ahadr","key":"ahadr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahad Rana","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Hi Owen,\n\nUpon further thought, perhaps it is best just to fix the canonical name\nissue (a) and leave the DFS_NAMENODE_USER_NAME_KEY as it is (a single key).\nIt seems that the NN and everybody else  (clients) should be able to use\nthe same consistent principal naming scheme to login as the hdfs user.\nPerhaps this was the intention all along. This does beg the question as to\nwhy there is a need for a DFS_SECONDARY_NAMENODE_USER_NAME_KEY, as the 2NN\nis basically a client of the NN ? Also, what is your recommended policy\nwith regards to hdfs principal names ? Should they be host qualified or not\n? The host qualified scheme makes a lot of sense when you are distributing\nkeytabs to each host in the network, but it seems a bit inconvenient that\nyou cannot mix the two forms, especially in the case of an admin (for\nexample) that would like to use password auth to get an HDFS TGT for the\npurposes of using a tool like DFSAdmin.\n\nThanks,\n\nAhad.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahadr","name":"ahadr","key":"ahadr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahad Rana","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-10-19T18:42:11.427+0000","updated":"2012-10-19T18:42:11.427+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-4081/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0akyv:"}}
