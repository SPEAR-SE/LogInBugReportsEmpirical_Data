Also when a block report comes in, and a new replica is found but it is marked as invalid, this new replica does not get added to the blocks map.\n\nThis probably needs more details.\n\nWe have so many maps : blocksMap, neededReplications, excessReplications etc. These are all supposed to be consistent in some way. What the consistency requirements are or how the requirements are enforced in not explicitly defined anywhere. I am afraid if we make one isolated change now, it is very hard say for sure that we are not introducing issues similar to HADOOP-4556. \n\nWe could probably do something smaller to avoid HADOOP-4556. But to change a policy that been there since the beginning as this jira proposes, I think we need to consider more.
