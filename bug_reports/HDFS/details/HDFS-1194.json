At the same time disk and network are OK since I can copy at 50 mb/s using scp.\nI was taking jstacks of the namenode while the transfer is in process and we found that every stack trace has one thread of jetty sitting in this place:\n\n{code}\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native Method)\n\tat

org.mortbay.thread.QueuedThreadPool$PoolThread.run(QueuedThreadPool.java:522)\n{code}\n\nHere is a jetty code that corresponds to this:\n\n{code}\n// Look for JVM bug \n                    if (selected==0 && wait>0 && (now-before)<wait/2 && _selector.selectedKeys().size()==0)\n                    {\n                        if (_jvmBug++>5)  // TODO tune or configure this\n

workaround for a JVM bug that doesn't handle select() properly.\n\nThere is a jetty JIRA for this http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-937 (it actually introduces the workaround for the JVM bug that we are hitting)\n\nThey say that the problem was fixed in 6.1.22, there is a person on that JIRA also saying that switching to using SocketConnector instead of SelectChannelConnector helped in their case.\nSince we are hitting the same bug in our world we should either adopt the newer Jetty version where there is a better workaround, but it might not help if we are still hitting that bug constantly, the workaround might be better though.\nAnother approach is to switch to using SocketConnector which will eliminate the problem completely, although I am not sure what problems that will bring.\n\nThe java version we are running is in Environment\n\nAny
