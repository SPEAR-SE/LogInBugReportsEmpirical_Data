Events such as node membership change and decommission management will cause the state to change.\n\nYour #1 suggestion is to have {{Dead, DECOMMISSION_INPROGRESS}} transition to {{Dead, DECOMMISSIONED}} upon timeout. Not sure if that is the best approach. Your #2 suggestion have {{Dead, NORMAL}} transition directly to {{Dead, DECOMMISSIONED}} upon decomm event. That sounds like like a good idea to address your situation.\n\nHowever, we still have the situation regarding which state {{Live, DECOMMISSION_INPROGRESS}} should be transitioned to when DN becomes dead. HDFS-6791 makes it transition to {{Dead, DECOMMISSION_INPROGRESS}}. It seems you want to make sure it eventually gets to {{Dead, DECOMMISSIONED}} state.\n\nSome more ideas on this.\n\n1. If the node stays in {{Dead, DECOMMISSION_INPROGRESS}} for too long, have the higher layer application remove the node from exclude file and thus abort the decommission process.

When nodes become dead, mark them DECOMMISSIONED and fix the replication to handle this case.

I agree with everyone's discussion thus far, thanks especially to [~mingma] for weighing in with insights from HDFS-6791. I think Zhe's proposal #2 is good, and we should work on getting it in. As a follow-on, we could also consider trying to expose more information to operators to help them decide if they should \"force decom\" by messing with the exclude file. The core issue IIUC is knowing if a force decom will result in data loss, which could probably be pieced together from fsck, but is by no means cheap to do.\n\nWith that, some light patch comments:\n\n* I think the logic is a bit wrong right now, since it can shortcut a node from (DEAD, DECOM_IN_PROGRESS) to (DEAD, DECOMMED) if refresh is called when the node is in the exclude file, where IIUC what we want is to only allow (DEAD, NORMAL) to (DEAD, DECOMMED).\n* Because of the above, would be good to move this logic into startDecommission instead, we also want to be doing some log prints even in this situation\n* We can use GenericTestUtils#waitFor to do the waitForDatanodeState, it prints a nice stack trace as a benefit.\n* Could clean up the imports in TestDeadDatanode, TestDecommissioningStatus\n* TestDecomm, could remove the println, line longer than 80chars, could also add a test timeout\n\nThanks for working on this Zhe!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-14T00:28:05.689+0000","updated":"2014-11-14T00:28:05.689+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12753461/comment/14211888","id":"14211888","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhz","name":"zhz","key":"zhz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493"},"displayName":"Zhe Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~andrew.wang] for the review!

We can safely transition even dead nodes to DECOMMED in this situation.\n\nGoing backwards from (DEAD, DECOMMED) back to (LIVE, D_I_P) feels a little weird. IMO DECOMMED should mean that a node can safely be removed from the cluster, even for dead nodes.

If it is based on full scan of blockmap, the chance of getting \"all blocks fully replicated\" condition might be low given it also includes those newly added blocks for which not all DNs have sent IBR; in addition, it has to take the FSNameSystem lock for longer period of time. If it is based on {{BlockManager}}'s {{pendingReplicationBlocksCount}} +  {{underReplicatedBlocksCount}}, then the chance might be higher; and it is faster.\n\nOn the \"track the blocks of those DECOMM_IN_PROGRESS DNs\" note, it might be useful to add the feature later. It also helps another scenario, something [~kihwal] and [~daryn] mentioned before. {{isReplicationInProgress}} currently rescan all blocks of a given node each time the method is called; it isn't efficient as more blocks become fully replicated.\n\nWe can have a separate list of DECOMM_IN_PROGRESS blocks which points to the DECOMM_IN_PROGRESS DNs.  {{DecommissionManager}} will scan this list regularly. Each scan will reduce the list as blocks become fully replicated and calculated the latest list of DECOMM_IN_PROGRESS DNs. In normal decomm operations, the # of DECOMM_IN_PROGRESS DNs should be much smaller than the # of total DNs in large cluster; so the extra memory overhead might be acceptable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-15T04:52:44.030+0000","updated":"2014-11-15T04:52:44.030+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12753461/comment/14214340","id":"14214340","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhz","name":"zhz","key":"zhz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493"},"displayName":"Zhe Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The failure is in {{testDecommissionWithNamenodeRestart}} and points to an interesting case: when the NN restarts, its DN {{isAlive}} bits are not turned on immediately.
