However, it *will* break some downstream user code that worked before. A good sign of this is that it broke some code maintained by the Hadoop community, ostensibly those most familiar with how HDFS works.\n\nIt's important that we properly document when we change things in a way that might break downstream users (wether or not they were doing the correct thing before) so that they can make appropriate adjustments before upgrading, especially when those changes are in a minor version.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=busbey","name":"busbey","key":"busbey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233"},"displayName":"Sean Busbey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-05-15T13:09:47.974+0000","updated":"2015-05-15T13:09:47.974+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12827562/comment/14545800","id":"14545800","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This is very strange.  It appears that this only \"worked\" because the RPC proxy is still operable even after calling {{RPC#stopProxy}} inside {{DFSClient#closeConnectionToNamenode}}.  This is not what I would have expected.  I thought that this patch by calling {{checkOpen}} consistently just changed a failure to give a more descriptive error.\n\nThis is going to be a gray area for compatibility.  Code that uses a {{FileSystem}} after closing it is incorrect code.  Many operations already fail fast.  We might be within the letter of the law for the compatibility policy by making this change, but there is an argument that callers could be dependent on the existing bug.\n\nIn this kind of situation, I like to consider if the risks outweigh the benefits.  This change isn't an absolute requirement to fix a critical bug or ship a new feature.  Considering that, I think a conservative approach would be to re-target this patch to trunk/3.0.0 and revert from branch-2.

So users simply using even closed fs for some operation like setReplication. This we noticed from test cases already.\nSince this is not so critical issue, we can revert from branch-2. I am fine with that.  Even though issue comes with wrong usage, some users might have that wrong code already in their app. So, upgrading system would expect code change from users. In this perspective we can mark this as incompatible change. Let's revert from branch-2 and leave it from trunk.
