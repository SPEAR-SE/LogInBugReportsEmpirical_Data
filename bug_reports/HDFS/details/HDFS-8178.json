I have one comment, and one question for you:\n\nComment: I'm a tad concerned that the current patch be be over aggressive in terms of purging edit log segments, if somehow we ended up with two in-progress segments, both of which were required to form the complete history of edit log transactions. Unless we're somehow guaranteed that that's not a state we could end up in, I think we should do something to guarantee that the in-progress edits file(s) that we're considering purging definitely overlap with finalized edit log segments so that they don't contain any edits that we can't afford to lose. Or, perhaps we should move them aside with a different name until such time as we can be sure that we don't need their transactions anymore, i.e. their transaction is less than minTxIdToKeep, and so we can definitely safely discard them.\n\nQuestion: In the patch for HDFS-5919, we introduced a new regex for identifying stale in-progress files. I'm not familiar with why that was necessary in that patch, but can you please comment on why it's not necessary in this case? Naively, I'd expect either both or neither the FJM and JN to require accounting for that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

After looking at HDFS-5919 more closely, we are actually trying to solve a different problem here. The objective of HDFS-5919 is sorely to save disk space (since FJM doesn't try to process those corrupt/empty files anyway). It's a safe cleanup, making sure the tx ID of empty / corrupt files are old enough before purging. So I think we should do the same in QJM.\n\nOur main target here is _stale_ in-progress edit log files, which are not necessarily empty/corrupt (so they won't be mark as so). As the updated description states, we want to properly take care of those files so QJM doesn't try to process them. I like your proposal of rename / move aside those files and remove them when they are older than {{minTxIdToKeep}}. I'll update the patch based on this idea.\n\nI also propose we do the same for corrupt / empty files, for both FJM and QJM.
