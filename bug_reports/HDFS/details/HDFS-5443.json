Some were already filed recently.\n\nHere snapshotted under-construction files are getting loaded as INodeFile instead of INodeFileUnderConstructionWIthSnapShot\nBecause of this blocktotal  is not getting decremented for this files, so NN is not exiting safemode.\nHDFS-5283 was fixed as workaround to increment the safeblockcount of reported block is associated to snapshotted file and it is unserconstruction. But here special case is, block wa allocated only in Namenode but pipeline not established to DNs Yet, so, physical block is not created in Datanodes. So, DN will not report any blocks. But due to loading underconstruction snapshotted file as INodeFile if original INodefile deleted, it is expecting this block also to reported.\n\nCouple of points to discuss in solving this issue.\n\nOption 1) Why can't we save underconstuction boolan flag for all INode as true or false.\n    So, while reading the INodes itself we can place INodeFilesUnderConstruction in tree and we can increment the underconstruction block count here and use it for decrements from blockTotal. Currently this count is getting calculated as blockMap.blocktotal- [lease file block total] . So, we need not depend on lease files.\n\nOption 2) May be we have to deal snapshotted underconstruction files with some special care here. If original file deleted with out finalizing etc, may leads to have such files in snapshot as underconstuction but no track on them  for safeblock counts etc. May be we can collect the files which were deleted originally but present in snapshot with underconstuction state and save them and load them separately.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-29T19:05:54.231+0000","updated":"2013-10-29T19:05:54.231+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12676460/comment/13808561","id":"13808561","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandonli","name":"brandonli","key":"brandonli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brandon Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"{quote}...block wa allocated only in Namenode but pipeline not established to DNs Yet, so, physical block is not created in Datanodes.{quote} \nThis happens too even when snapshot is not involved.

That's why I think maybe we should fix this part in a separate jira.

Also it will keep \n\nbq. 2. re-generating all the INodeFileUC when loading fsimage\nThis will happen as loading leases. and also blocksmap will be updated with UNDERCONSTRUCTION state\n\nbq. 3. using a similar workaround as in HDFS-5283.\nAs we already excluding under construction blocks, this workaround no more required.\n\nbq. To avoid the incompatibility of fsimage, we can put the extra information to the \"under construction files\" section of the fsimage.\nYes. exactly because of this reason I went for the approach of storing these files as leases. Because this section will be \nstored from the leases and leases will be loaded from this section.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-11-05T08:54:59.546+0000","updated":"2013-11-05T08:54:59.546+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12676460/comment/13814483","id":"13814483","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Upload a simple patch that tries to delete the 0-sized block for INodeFileUC.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-06T01:10:55.564+0000","updated":"2013-11-06T01:10:55.564+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12676460/comment/13814570","id":"13814570","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
