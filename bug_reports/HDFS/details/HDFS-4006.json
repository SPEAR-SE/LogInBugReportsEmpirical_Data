This was causing a race where the snn.close() call caused SecondaryNameNode.storage.close() to get called, which cleared the list of storage directories. Hence the getFsImageName() call was returning null if it raced with the completion of a checkpoint. I was able to reproduce this reliably by adding a sleep before the getFsImageName call, and then adding a join on the thread at the end of the test.\n\nThe fix is to actually make the checkpointer thread a member of the SecondaryNameNode, so that it can be properly shut down.\n\nI also added code to the test that checks for any leftover checkpointer threads between tests as an extra safeguard against this kind of test bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-10-06T00:35:48.271+0000","updated":"2012-10-06T00:35:48.271+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12610418/comment/13470864","id":"13470864","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
