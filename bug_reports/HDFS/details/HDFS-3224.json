Now the caller assumes that it knows how the node is keyed when fetching the node.  Two possible approaches to decouple them are: 1) the caller specifies the map key for the node, and again specifies the same key when fetching a node.  Or the node is passed to the fetch so {{Hosts2NodesMap}} can extract the same key as it did when adding the node to the map.\n\nIt's kind of the same situation where the {{TokenCache}} assumed it knew how the fs token would be keyed in the {{Credentials}}.  When the assumption went out of sync in some cases, it caused extra tokens to be fetched.
