When a corrupt replica is reported, BlockManager removes the block from blocksMap. If the block is already removed (that is, the corrupt replica is reported twice), return; Otherwise (that is, the corrupt replica is reported the first time), remove the block from corruptReplicasMap (The block is added into corruptReplicasMap in BlockerManager#markBlockAsCorrupt) Therefore, after the second corruption report, the corrupt replica is removed from blocksMap, but the one in corruptReplicasMap is not removed.\n\nI can’t tell what’s the impact that they are inconsistent.
