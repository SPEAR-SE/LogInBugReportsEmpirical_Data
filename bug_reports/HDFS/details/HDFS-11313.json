On large clusters the current trend is to decrease FBR frequency, sending FBRs once in 6, 10, or even 12 hours. It would be beneficial to split FBRs into smaller even though more frequent RPC calls.\n\nIf a DataNode were to split its FBR into multiple RPCs arbitrarily, then NameNode wouldn't be able to distinguish between replicas which do not exist on the DataNode from those that have not been yet reported (see 4 above).\nTherefore, the proposal is to introduce segmented block reports (SBR), where each report includes a segment of IDs. So the DataNode reports all its replicas in the given range of blockIDs, and if some block is not present in the report, the respective replica must be removed from the NameNode.\nMore details:\n* NameNode allocates blockIDs sequentially. It should partition the set of allocated so far block IDs into reasonably sized segments. The last segment is open ended.\n* BlockReportCommand is a new DatanodeCommand, which NameNode should send to a DataNode (in reply to a heartbeat) to order a block report within a specified segment.\n* When DN receives a BlockReportCommand it forms SBR for the requested segment and sends it to NN. The report also includes the segment boundaries. This could be done per storage.\n* NN processing of SBR is similar to FBR, but bounded to the reported segment.\n* NN can eventually start optimizing to request SBRs when it is less busy.\n* Periodic FBRs, can eventually be removed, but for now should remain for backward compatibility. That is if a DN does not receive any BlockReportCommands from NN, it should send FBR.\n\nP.S. There is a lot of jiras discussing partial block reports since prehistoric times. I scanned through many, but found only one mentioning of a similar proposal.

Need to think through race conditions because the current naive design (snapshot in time), is easy to reconcile state in the NN.  Not saying I like it, just that we need to think hard about new races esp. with IBRs.\n\nIt must include provisions for negative block ids so it's not just the last segment that is open ended.  Not a contrived use case, we have many 2.x clusters with legacy negative block ids esp. archival clusters.\n\nWhat would be the basic design?  Is it predicated on the NN sorting block ids?  If yes, I have strong concerns I'll outline.  How are the segment ranges computed?  Fixed size?  How will very sparse block ranges be handled, esp. in the case of negative block ids?\n\nWhat I've long wanted to do is invert the block report processing.  The NN sends BRs to the DN, and DN reconciles inconsistencies with IBRs.

Restricting the block data structures, by design, to some form of a tree does not scale well compared to other data structures. Ex. hashed or indexed.  In fact it completely eliminates them.\n\nThe answer may be much simpler.\n\nBack when the ipc handlers processed the IBR and FBRs, yielding the fsn lock was not possible, but awhile back I offloaded the BRs into a queue for processing by a dedicated thread.  This reduced fsn lock contention (1 vs n-many waiters), and increased throughput via batching multiple BRs under the same write lock subject to a time limit.  I think this may be extended to yield the lock during FBR processing.  The serialized nature of BR processing removes the IBR races.\n\nThere's probably just a few races to consider with systems like the decom manager, repl monitor, etc.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-04-12T19:29:31.307+0000","updated":"2017-04-12T19:29:31.307+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13033573/comment/16104184","id":"16104184","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Moving target version to 2.7.5 due to 2.7.4 release.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-07-28T00:32:34.027+0000","updated":"2017-07-28T00:32:34.027+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-11313/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i38j3j:"}}
