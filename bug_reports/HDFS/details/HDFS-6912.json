Colin Patrick McCabe: this is a machine without any swap.\n\nI took another look at the code, and it looks like we're creating a sparse file by using {{ftruncate}}.  That, in turn, leads to the SIGBUS later when we try to access the offset in the file, and no memory is available to de-sparsify it.  To remedy this, I added a call to {{posix_fallocate}}.  This will lead to the space in memory being allocated at the time we create the shared file descriptor, rather than later when we read from it.\n\nBecause you are out of memory, you'll still get a failure... but the failure will happen during allocation, not later, and it will be an exception which is handled cleanly, not a SIGBUS which shuts down the JVM.  See if this patch works for you.\n\nbq. The commit seems to be one of yours, can you explain why this suggests /dev/shm?\n\nThe configuration default is in {{/dev/shm}} because that is present on every modern Linux installation.  We always want the shared memory segment FD to be in memory, rather than on disk.  We have to read from this thing prior to every short-circuit read, so it needs to be fast.  ramfs would have been better, but this would require special setup which most users don't want to do right now.  Maybe this will change if we start recommending ramfs for HDFS-5851.   Anyway, ramfs and tmpfs will behave similarly when swap is off, as in your case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Looking at the kernel git history, it was only added in mid 2012 (e2d12e22c59ce714008aa5266d769f8568d74eac) corresponding to version 3.5. So, I'm not sure if it would be supported on el6 for example (maybe they backported it, maybe not).\n\nI believe the glibc {{posix_fallocate}} wrapper falls back to using {{write()}} calls when {{fallocate}} itself is not supported by the kernel.  There is some discussion here:  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-05/msg00207.html which talks about:\n\nbq. i.e. fall back to using write() as the glibc posix_fallocate() implementation does.\n\nBut, I think it's simpler to just use {{write}} here.  Any performance advantage to using {{ftruncate}} + {{fallocate}} is going to be extremely tiny (or nonexistent) since this file is only 8192 bytes.  And {{write}} is much more portable.  So here is a new version that does that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
