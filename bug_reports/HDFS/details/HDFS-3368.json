Your question about complexity is similar to one of why do we bother introducing all the HA complexity if all NameNodes primary and standby can fail at once.\n\n:-) I do not see the relationship of this to my comments.\n\nI am not saying this problem should not be solved. Given how rare it is, why change the default behavior. If others feel this makes sense, I am okay with it.
