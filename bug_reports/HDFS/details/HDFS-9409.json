It is more of a problem for tests, because it makes it impossible to write reliable assertions that these threads exited cleanly.

Then, later in {{shutdown}}, these are passed to {{BlockPoolManager#shutDownAll}}, which eventually stops and joins each {{BPServiceActor}} thread.  There are a few problems:\n\n# {{BlockPoolManager#getAllNamenodeThreads}} returns an unmodifiable wrapper over its underlying list, so callers can't mutate the list, but it's still the same shared backing list.  Later during shutdown, the {{BPServiceActor}} is told that it can exit its main loop.  Part of that is a call on the {{BPServiceActor}} thread to {{BlockPoolManager#remove}}.  This effectively removes it from the backing list returned by {{BlockPoolManager#getAllNamenodeThreads}}, so it will appear to vanish from the list before the call to {{BlockPoolManager#shutDownAll}}.\n# Even if point 1 is fixed by changing {{BlockPoolManager#getAllNamenodeThreads}} to return a deep copy, there is a similar problem in that {{BPOfferService#shutdownActor}} will remove the actor from its internal tracking list.\n\nBecause of these 2 problems, {{DataNode#shutdown}} might no longer have a reference to the {{BPServiceActor}} threads when it tries to stop and join on them.  Therefore, those threads might still be alive even after completion of {{DataNode#shutdown}}.  I noticed this while trying to write a test that asserts a particular thread has exited after DataNode shutdown.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-10T20:13:43.027+0000","updated":"2015-11-10T20:13:43.027+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12911962/comment/15819152","id":"15819152","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"{{BlockScanner}} is the same way. It removes a thread from its tracking data structure after a timed join. This is probably less problematic because the timeout in each {{join()}} is 5 minutes.  Although this wait may be good for unit tests, waiting up to 5 minutes per each volume scanner thread is unreasonable when the datanode needs to be restarted quickly.  We actually internally reduced it down to 100ms and the rolling upgrades works a lot better.\n\nPerhaps we need a flag in datanode that tells whether it should wait until everything is terminated or quickly shutdown without waiting a long time for daemon threads to terminate.  The shutdown code of each subsystem would then check this flag and behave differently. We would turn it on for unit testing and off for production.
