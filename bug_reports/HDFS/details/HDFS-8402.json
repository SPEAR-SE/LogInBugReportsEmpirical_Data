I'll elaborate further on why the exit code for the new feature is completely broken, and I'd say incompatible with posix standards and user expectations.\n\nThe existing path scan output has a last line of \"The filesystem ... is (HEALTHY|CORRUPT)\".  Fsck client solely checks the last line to determine the exit code.  Quite fragile but it is what it is.\n\nThe new block scan does not emit a final line - which this patch adds.  The block scan feature naively relies on the final line of \"Block replica ... is (HEALTHY|CORRUPT)\".  That means fsck returns:\n# Success even if any of the 1..n-1 scanned blocks have corrupt replicas.  It gets worse.\n# Success even if the last block's 1..n-1 replicas are corrupt.  It gets worse.\n# Success even if the last block's last replica is CORRUPT.  Fsck checks \"endsWith\" CORRUPT which doesn't match \"Block replica .. is CORRUPT Reason:blah\".\n# Summary: Always success even if blocks are corrupt.  How useful is that?\n\nThe options for fixing the exit code are either pattern match all lines to determine a block scan's exit code, which makes fsck even more fragile and doesn't fix old clients.  Or emit a final line similar to the path scan that allows both old and new fsck clients (compatible?) to return the correct exit code.  I chose the later based on it's a 2.7 feature and doubtful anyone is relying on the last line since it means nothing.\n\n(The test failure isn't related)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-05-18T18:29:25.255+0000","updated":"2015-05-18T18:29:25.255+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12829966/comment/14548474","id":"14548474","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"An incompatible change is an incompatible change, even if under the best of intentions.
