FileSystem returns an FSDataOutputStream, which implements Syncable. Its implementation either does a real hflush, or just calls flush.

FSDataOutputStream implements Syncable, so you can't query with {{instanceof}}. There's currently no public way of querying the wrapped stream either. I think it was a mistake to add {{Syncable}} to FSDataOutputStream, we should have forced users to check with {{instanceof}} and cast it.\n\nI don't like changing DFSStripedOutputStream#hflush to simply call flush, since then HDFS users who turn on EC will silently stop getting real hflush/hsync.

I'd like to file a blocker on HBase 2.0 to make use of it where it is present, specifically so that we can avoid deploying the HBase WAL on filesystems that don't support hflush/hsync (such as EC). The lack of ability to reliably flush/sync doesn't appear to be called out in the Erasure Coding docs as a concern for those who might deploy it and I'd rather HBase bring the risk to operators' attention by failing fast when it finds the configuration.\n\nBut I can't find any guidance on using this feature (or that it exists) in the 3.0.0-alpha4 release notes nor in the filesystem docs.  I also can't tell from the javadocs on StreamCapabilities what I'm even supposed to query for to check on the fundamentals that this jira is addressing (hflush / hsync).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=busbey","name":"busbey","key":"busbey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233"},"displayName":"Sean Busbey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-08-02T03:35:07.755+0000","updated":"2017-08-02T03:35:07.755+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13063341/comment/16111674","id":"16111674","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eddyxu","name":"eddyxu","key":"eddyxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lei (Eddy) Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~busbey]\n\nI filed HDFS-12251 for the filesystem docs.   \n\nIn the meantime, I have a question for hbase.
