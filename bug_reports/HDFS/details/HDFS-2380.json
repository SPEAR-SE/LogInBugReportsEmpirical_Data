It appears to have been merged into 205 to support webhdfs.\n\nPrior to HADOOP-7119, the web service used by hftp/hsftp would validate tokens using long kerberos user names.  Now the realm is truncated from the user name which caused hftp/hsftp to break.  The {{JspHelper}} in the namenode rejected the token validation due to the mismatched comparison between a now short user (from the web service) and a long user (in the token).  Subsequently, HDFS-2361 changed {{JspHelper}} to use the token's short user when comparing against the now short web user.\n\nThe security ramification is it now appears to be easier to spoof other users and access their files.  Based on commentary in HDFS-2361, the case can be made that other parts of hadoop are insecure with respect to user names, so it doesn't matter that security has been further downgraded.  I don't know if this true, or whether higher layers effectively guard against lower level insecurities.  In any case, this logic makes me uneasy, especially when it comes to changing the security of a \"front door\" to hadoop.\n\nIs there a technical reason why {{KerberosAuthenticationHandler}} should not be changed (1-liner) to return the long user name?  This would allow HDFS-2361 to be reverted and return the former level of security to token validation.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"74115","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Security downgrade of token validation","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-2380/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0d23b:"}}
