fixed by changing configuration settings to 2k.\nHowever - one thing that bothered me was that even after datanodes recovered from overload and most of client servers had been shut down - we still observed errors in the logs of running servers.\nFurther investigation showed that fix for HADOOP-1911 introduced another problem - the DFSInputStream instance might become unusable once number of failures over lifetime of this instance exceeds configured threshold.\n\nThe fix for this specific issue seems to be trivial - just reset failure counter before reading next block (patch will be attached shortly).\n\nThis seems to be also related to HADOOP-3185, but I'm not sure I really understand necessity of keeping track of failed block accesses in the DFS client.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12394193","id":"12394193","filename":"4681.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ibolotin","name":"ibolotin","key":"ibolotin","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Igor

I just looked at HADOOP-1911 and I don't think it fixed the real problem. The loop is because of combination of reset of dead nodes in chooseDataNode() and 'while (s != null)' loop in blockSeekTo().  Note that actual failure occurs while trying to create BlockReader().. not in chooseDataNode(). The problem is that chooseDataNode() can not decide if the datanode is ok or not.. just an address for DN is not enough. we also need connect(), 'success reply' and at least a few bytes read from the datanode. So HADOOP-1911 fixed the infinite loop, but not for right reasons.\n\nWe could define successful datanode conenction as 'being able to read non zero bytes that we need'. A failure count keeps growing until there is a 'successful connection', and should be reset after that. (Some what similar approach to HADOOP-3831).\n\nI think this time we should have a explicitly stated policy of when a hard failure occurs (and may be when we refetch the block data etc).\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-27T04:17:10.649+0000","updated":"2009-05-27T04:17:10.649+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408776/comment/12713656","id":"12713656","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stack","name":"stack","key":"stack","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stack","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":".bq We could define successful datanode conenction as 'being able to read non zero bytes that we need'.

It is an improvement, but only on the same lines as the current structure (no explicit policy, hard to see what happens and when).  For e.g. it looks like 'a failure' is defined as not being able to connect/fetch from all the replicas. Also success is defined as just being able to get 'ok' from datanode. Which implies it might again go into infinite loop in some conditions (say all replicas are corrupt, thus only one is remaining, and it fails checksum at one particular position).\n\nThe final fix could be as simiple as moving resetting 'failures' to readBuffer().  But I would prefer to add things like 'failures' to be incremented for every failure with a replica and limit the count to something like min(#replicas, large value like 10).\n\nFinally, I am mainly proposing an explicit policy in a code comment. 0.21 is fine.. big users like HBASE can have it backported.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-27T19:15:12.181+0000","updated":"2009-05-27T19:15:12.181+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408776/comment/12713704","id":"12713704","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stack","name":"stack","key":"stack","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stack","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":".bq For e.g. it looks like 'a failure' is defined as not being able to connect/fetch from all the replicas.

There is no danger that it \"...revert[s]- and reintroduce[s]- HADOOP-1911?\" because the patch removes the catching of exceptions inside chooseDataNode while loop.\n+ I am of the opinion that this patch should not be gated on the necessary work HDFS-656 \"Clarify error handling and retry semantics for DFS read path\" (nor HDFS-378 \"DFSClient should track failures by block rather than globally\").  This patch should actually help some as it narrows scope of the failures variable.  But maybe we can do even more as part of this patch (See below).\n\nIf a new patch is cut, the following might be considered:\n\n+ There is no documentation of \"dfs.client.max.block.acquire.failures\" nor of what local counter 'failures' means.  Above its suggested that we at least doc. what a failure is (\"For e.g. it looks like 'a failure' is defined as not being able to connect/fetch from all the replicas. Also success is defined as just being able to get 'ok' from datanode.\")\n+ By default, \"dfs.client.max.block.acquire.failures\" is 3.  If more than 3 replicas, we could fail though good replicas out on cluster.  Should DFSClient set this.maxBlockAcquireFailures default to max of dfs.replication/dfs.client.max.block.acquire.failures?\n+ I'd put these two LOG.info messages together rather than have two LOG.info lines:\n\n{code}\n          if (nodes == null || nodes.length == 0) {\n            LOG.info(\"No node available for block: \" + blockInfo);\n          }\n          LOG.info(\"Could not obtain block \" + block.getBlock()\n              + \" from any node.

I've taken the approach of resetting the failure counter at the start of the user-facing read and pread calls in DFSInputStream. The logic here is that the failure counter should limit the number of internal retries before throwing an exception back to the client. As long as the client is making some progress, we don't care about the total number of failures over the course of the stream, and it should be reset for each operation.\n\nI've also included two new unit tests. The first, in TestCrcCorruption, guards against the error we saw with the original patch. It reliably reproduces the infinite loop with the broken patch that was originally on branch-20. The second new unit test, in TestDFSClientRetries, verifies the new behavior, namely that a given DFSInputStream can continue to be used even when the _total_ number of failures exceeds maxBlockAcquires, so long as the number of retries on any given read() operation does not.\n\nTo accomplish the second test, I pulled in the mockito dependency via ivy.
