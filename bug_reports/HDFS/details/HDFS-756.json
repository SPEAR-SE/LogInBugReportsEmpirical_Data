The project split means the libhdfs test needs to access both the hdfs and common respos. The test lives in and is run out of the hdfs repo, however it runs an instance of hdfs, and therefore needs access to the common repo's bin directory. test-libhdfs.sh runs the hdfs instance out of the common repo (build/test/libhdfs and sub-directories get created there) since hadoop-daemon.sh makes doing otherwise a pain. \n\n*This means the test now requires setting HADOOP_CORE_HOME.* Once HDFS-621 is checked in it would be nice to convert this test to run a MiniDFS cluster and no longer depend on a common repo.

Using the snapshot jar should work and removes the dependency on a common repo. Since the snapshot jar is updated from maven this approach will still work if you've also got changes in a common repo that should be used when running the test.
