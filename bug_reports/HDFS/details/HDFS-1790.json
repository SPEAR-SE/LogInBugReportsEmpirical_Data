Is this a left-over from the conversion to read/write lock in FSNamesystem?\n\n2. isInSafeMode() and isPopulatingReplQueues() are also synchronized on the FSNamesystem instance (monitor lock), but the SafeModeInfo methods they call (safeMode.isInSafeMode() and safeMode.isPopulatingReplQueues() are synchronized on the SafeModeInfo instance.  Is synchronizing on the FSNamesystem instance necessary?  What does it add?  If it is necessary, should it be using the read/write lock?\n\n3. In SafeModeInfo, these methods are synchronized on the SafeModeInfo instance:\n- isOn\n- isPopulatingReplQueues\n- leave\n- initialize\n- canInitializeReplQueues\n- canLeave\n- setBlock\n- incrementSafeBlockCount\n- decrementSafeBlockCount\n- setManual\nbut these are not:\n- enter\n- needEnter\n- checkMode\n- isManual\n- isConsistent\n\nRegarding these:\n- isOn() asserts isConsistent(), but is otherwise an atomic read operation.\n- isPopulatingReplQueues() is an atomic read.  Does it need synchronization?\n- leave() is complex, but shouldn't it be synchronized with enter(), which is also a write operation?  Yet enter() is unsynchronized.\n- initializeReplQueues() calls blockManager.processMisReplicatedBlocks(), which can take minutes to run.  By synchronizing on the SafeModeInfo instance, it prevents essentially all of the other safeMode methods from running for the duration!  Is this desirable or needed?\n- canInitializeReplQueues() is a read-only operation, although it does compare two read values.  needEnter() compares four read values, and is unsynchronized.  Does either need synchronization?\n- canLeave() is a compound operation, it's good that it is synchronized.\n- checkMode() is a big compound read/write operation.  Doesn't it need synchronization if the other methods do?\nand so on.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113681","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"review use of synchronized methods in FSNamesystem and SafeModeInfo","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502434/comment/13011564","id":"13011564","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"The setting of safemode should be done inside the FSNamesystem write lock.
