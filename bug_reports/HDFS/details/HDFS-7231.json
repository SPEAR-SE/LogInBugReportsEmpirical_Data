The series of events as given to me (I was out of town, so didn't witness firsthand) was:\n\n# Build a 2.0.5/2.1.0/etc cluster where rolling upgrade is not an option.\n# Upgrade it to 2.2\n# Do not \\-finalizeUpgrade\n# Upgrade binaries to 2.4.1 \n# Run namenode \\-upgrade\n# watch it fail.\n# Leave 2.4.1 DNs running\n# Downgrade binaries on NN to 2.2\n# Start NN\n# DNs now do a partial roll-forward, rendering them unable to continue\n# admins manually repair version files on those broken directories\n\n...\n\nThere were clearly a few mistakes made in the above procedure, most of which were driven by a belief that the NN *had* to be out of safemode to do a finalize.  So they attempted to do that, which of course led to other things going wrong. I'm not sure what triggered the DNs to basically render their VERSION files broken.  I haven't been able to duplicate it, but I've only tried on a much smaller scale so that might be related.  I also suspect there was an attempt to rollback the binaries on the DNs and I haven't tried that yet either. \n\nMy own testing of this scenario has given me a few insights.\n\n* DNs should not start rolling while there is a directory there to finalize.  \n\nOutside of just inconsistent filesystem state, if you do what appears (to me, at least) to get the system back up (bring down the namenode, namenode \\-finalize, bring up namenode): hdfs dfsadmin \\-finalizeUpgrade afterward doesn't appear to send the message to the DNs to clean up their space, requiring manual intervention. \n\n* Suprise! DNs exit if the 'proper' NN is brought up with \\-upgrade.\n\nDoing the 2.2 NN \\-finalize and then bringing 2.4.1 NN up with \\-upgrade, results in the 2.4.1 DNs all coming down.  This was a bit of a surprise given they were perfectly happy staying up with a broken 2.2 NN in \\-upgrade mode before.\n\nI'm sure there are other things here, but these are the two big ones that stuck out. I'm doing some other manual testing using the above procedures with a few other changes to see what else sticks out.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2014-10-10T21:24:47.171+0000","updated":"2014-10-10T21:50:30.786+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12747400/comment/14167545","id":"14167545","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"One other thing about rolling while there is a finalize dir there:  it's worth pointing out that -rollback becomes a \"please shoot me now\" command.
