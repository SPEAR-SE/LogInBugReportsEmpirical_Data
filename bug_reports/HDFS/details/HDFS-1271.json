Currently they are marked as dead after a restart.\n\n\nDetails:\n\nNodes can be safely removed from a cluster by marking them as decomissioned and waiting for their data to be replicated elsewhere. This is accomplished by adding a node to the filed referenced by dfs.hosts.excluded, then refreshing nodes.\n\nDecomissioning means block reports from the decomissioned datanode are no longer accepted by the namenode, meaning for decomissioning to occur the NN must have an existing block report. That is, a datanode can transition from: live --> decomissioning --> dead. Nodes can NOT transition from: dead --> decomissioning --> dead.\n\nOperationally this is problematic because intervention is required should the NN restart while nodes are decomissioning, meaning in-house administration tools must be more complex, or more likely admins have to babysit the decomissioning process.\n\nSomeone more familiar with the code might have a better idea, but perhaps the first block report for dfs.hosts.excluded hosts should be accepted?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113429","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Decommissioning nodes not persisted between NameNode restarts","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=traviscrawford","name":"traviscrawford","key":"traviscrawford","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=traviscrawford&avatarId=26745","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=traviscrawford&avatarId=26745","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=traviscrawford&avatarId=26745","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=traviscrawford&avatarId=26745"},"displayName":"Travis Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=traviscrawford","name":"traviscrawford","key":"traviscrawford","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=traviscrawford&avatarId=26745","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=traviscrawford&avatarId=26745","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=traviscrawford&avatarId=26745","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=traviscrawford&avatarId=26745"},"displayName":"Travis Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467993/comment/12883655","id":"12883655","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This is a *real* problem that we have faced on our clusters's too.

Whenever we detect a failed component on a node that is going to necessitate someone taking it down for repairs, we decommission as a preventative measure, because our SiteOps team could do the repair at any time after that. Occasionally I have seen nodes take hours or days or more to decommission, if they are unlucky recipients of a block from a file from some very long-running job.\n\nIIRC it's not just NN restarts that are a problem, DN restarts also have the same problem because when the DN comes up it will be denied communication by NN and immediately shut down, even if it hasn't finished decom'ing. Then you have to un-exclude and re-exclude to get the blocks flowing again.
