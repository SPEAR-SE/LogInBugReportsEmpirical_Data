We found quite a few response format problems in the past, in a painful way, because we don't have enough end to end tests.\n\nTestOutOfOrderWrite is an end-to-end test but it doesn't provide a framework or class to be used by other tests.\n\nSpecifcally, we need a few things. We may want to create more JIRAs to split the work:\n1. utilities to package every NFS/mountd requests\n2. utilityes to parse every NFS/mountd response\n3. a test UDP client and TCP client, which can deliver request to NFS and get response. \n\nOnce we have these utilities, we can create tests easily.

If those are to be avoided, I think we need to call 'mnt' and create a mount point (e.g., /mnt/test_hdfs/), and create regular FileInputStream/FileOutSstream out of it. Then we can test read, write, readdir, and client access privilege. Let me know if you think that's the right direction.

The RPC request could have any right or wrong format combination to test server's reaction. The requests sequence can also be made to test regression of some specific bugs.\n\n2. do operations from shell.

The current working copy is attached. It is based on the original {{TestOutOfOrderWrite}} class. The problem I'm getting is that the {{messageReceived()}} method still receives RPC message with the fragment header you mentioned above. Shouldn't it be taken off by {{RpcFrameDecoder}} before reaching {{messageReceived()}}?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhz","name":"zhz","key":"zhz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493"},"displayName":"Zhe Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-21T22:31:30.389+0000","updated":"2014-08-21T22:31:30.389+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12665762/comment/14107757","id":"14107757","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandonli","name":"brandonli","key":"brandonli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brandon Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~zhz], the fragment decoder will always send the whole buffer to the next message handler, but the buffer read position will be moved by 4 bytes.\nIn your case, the XDR is built on a ByteBuffer instead of ChannelBuffer, e.g:\n{noformat}\n    @Override\n    public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {\n      \n      ChannelBuffer buf = (ChannelBuffer) e.getMessage();\n      ByteBuffer b = buf.toByteBuffer().asReadOnlyBuffer();\n      XDR rsp = new XDR(b, XDR.State.READING);\n      // Get handle from create response\n      ...\n        RpcReply reply = RpcReply.read(rsp);\n      ...\n{noformat}\n\nAlso, in order to support parallel testing, the test should use a ephemeral port:\n    config.setInt(\"nfs3.server.port\", 0);\n\nIf currently there is not way to know which port is bound by NFS, we should add a method to either Nfs3/RpcProgramNfs3 to get it. \nPlease feel free to create sub-tasks for your patches.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandonli","name":"brandonli","key":"brandonli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brandon Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-23T00:38:12.855+0000","updated":"2014-08-23T00:38:22.391+0000"}],"maxResults":18,"total":18,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-5135/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1nm4f:"}}
