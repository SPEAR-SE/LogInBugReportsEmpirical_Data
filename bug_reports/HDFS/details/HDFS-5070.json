This is noticed when checkMode() is called and it causes the replication queues to be initialized. \n\nThe safe mode monitor will try to check and leave the safe mode, but can be far behind the write lock, if the initialization takes long (e.g. large number of blocks) and more block reports come in and get queued before it.  In this state (replication queue initialized but still in startup safe mode), block report processing can take a long time.
