Files under the root directory of the encryption zone will be encrypted/decrypted transparently upon HDFS client write or read operations. \n\nGenerally, it does not support rename(without data copying) across encryption zones or between encryption zone and non-encryption zone because different security settings of encryption zones. However, there are certain use cases where efficient rename support is desired. This JIRA is to propose better support of two such use cases “Scratch Space” (a.k.a. staging area) and “Soft Delete” (a.k.a. trash) with HDFS encryption zones.\n\n“Scratch Space” is widely used in Hadoop jobs, which requires efficient rename support. Temporary files from MR jobs are usually stored in staging area outside encryption zone such as “/tmp” directory and then rename to targeted directories as specified once the data is ready to be further processed. \n\nBelow is a summary of supported/unsupported cases from latest Hadoop:\n\n* Rename within the encryption zone is supported\n* Rename the entire encryption zone by moving the root directory of the zone  is allowed.\n* Rename sub-directory/file from encryption zone to non-encryption zone is not allowed.\n* Rename sub-directory/file from encryption zone A to encryption zone B is not allowed.\n* Rename from non-encryption zone to encryption zone is not allowed.\n\n“Soft delete” (a.k.a. trash) is a client-side “soft delete” feature that helps prevent accidental deletion of files and directories. If trash is enabled and a file or directory is deleted using the Hadoop shell, the file is moved to the .Trash directory of the user's home directory instead of being deleted.  Deleted files are initially moved (renamed) to the Current sub-directory of the .Trash directory with original path being preserved. Files and directories in the trash can be restored simply by moving them to a location outside the .Trash directory.\n\nDue to the limited rename support, delete sub-directory/file within encryption zone with trash feature is not allowed. Client has to use -skipTrash option to work around this. HADOOP-10902 and HDFS-6767 improved the error message but without a complete solution to the problem. \n\nWe propose to solve the problem by generalizing the mapping between encryption zone and its underlying HDFS directories from 1:1 today to 1:N. The encryption zone should allow non-overlapped directories such as scratch space or soft delete \"trash\" locations to be added/removed dynamically after creation. This way, rename for \"scratch space\" and \"soft delete\" can be better supported without breaking the assumption that rename is only supported \"within the zone\".

A few questions:\n\n* Have you thought about simply allowing rename between EZs with the same settings? This would be a much smaller and easier change with similar properties. Your proposal I think is still better in terms of ease-of-use and also ensuring security invariants around key rolling (if/when we implement that).\n* If we keep the APIs superuser-only, how does a normal user add their trash folder to an EZ? Same for scratch folders, e.g. if the Hive user is not a superuser.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-07-30T18:30:15.170+0000","updated":"2015-07-30T18:30:15.170+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12843985/comment/14649486","id":"14649486","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xyao","name":"xyao","key":"xyao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyu Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~andrew.wang] for reviewing. \n\nbq. Have you thought about simply allowing rename between EZs with the same settings? This would be a much smaller and easier change with similar properties. Your proposal I think is still better in terms of ease-of-use and also ensuring security invariants around key rolling (if/when we implement that).\n\nYes. We've discussed this simpler work around. But there are many limitations such as security invariants you mentioned above. We don't want to limit different EZs to share the same zone key just to support rename as they may have different policies. Encryption zone as a security concept should be managed consistently with a single entity. Based on that, support adding additional roots to encryption zone is a natural enhancement and better solution.\n\nbq. If we keep the APIs superuser-only, how does a normal user add their trash folder to an EZ? Same for scratch folders, e.g. if the Hive user is not a superuser.\n\nI think we should keep this API as superuser-only. It can still be useful even though we keep it as superuser only. The trash folder/scratch folder can be per-created and added to encryption zone by super user as needed. This removes the limitation for hive scratch folder, which currently has to be configured under the single root of the encryption zone. We can discuss more on this for HDFS-8831.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xyao","name":"xyao","key":"xyao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyu Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-07-31T17:08:57.687+0000","updated":"2015-07-31T17:08:57.687+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12843985/comment/14649805","id":"14649805","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

There can be many users on a cluster accessing a variety of EZs, such that it's unmanageable for the super-user to set up all the Trash folders beforehand.\n\nThree solutions have been discussed in \"Design->Soft Delete\" section of the spec. My initial take is on \"Option 1: Per User Trash Namespace\", which is mostly for compatibility and simplicity. If pre-create trash folder for many users is a concern,  \"Option 2: Global Trash Namespace\" which is similar to the idea proposed in Hadoop-7310 can be used. It will not be compatible with current Trash behavior where users find their deleted files under /user/username/.Trash/Current/.... These solutions can be implemented as pluggable trash policy for admin to choose with configurable keys when the default one may not be appropriate for their deployment.\n\nbq. Another question, how would this work if a user's homedir is already an EZ? Do you plan to add support for nested encryption zones?\n\nNo we don't plan to support nested encryption zones. If we take \"Option 1\", this will not be supported. But if we take \"Option 2\", it will not be a problem as the trash namespace for encryption zone will be separated from user's homedir.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xyao","name":"xyao","key":"xyao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyu Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-07-31T21:55:44.302+0000","updated":"2015-07-31T21:55:44.302+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12843985/comment/14651474","id":"14651474","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"The design looks good overall.
