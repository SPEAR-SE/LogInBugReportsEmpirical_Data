I don't see any reason why shuffle(a) could not be equal to shuffle(b), for two completely unrelated DatanodeIDs a and b.\n\nThat's true, equality is possible.  It's very unlikely given that we're choosing N items (where N is the replication count of a block, so nearly always 3, sometimes 10, possibly as absurdly high as 50) from the range of {{Random#NextInt}} which is about 2**32.  The algorithm does something reasonable in the case that the shuffle has a collision (it puts the items in some order, either stable or not, and either result is fine for the rest of the algorithm). It would be possible to remove the possibility of collisions, but I don't know how to do that quickly with minimal code.  So the current implementation seemed to strike a nice balance between the desired behavior, efficient and easily understandable code, and low algorithmic complexity.\n\nbq. It also seems better to just use hashCode, rather than creating your own random set of random ints associated with objects.\n\nIt's important that we get a different answer each time {{pseudoSortByDistance}} is invoked; that randomization is what spreads the read load out across the replicas. So using a stable value like hashCode would defeat that goal of this change.  (Possibly it might be true that hashCode ordering would be different in different {{DFSClient}} instances on different nodes, but I see no guarantee of that, and even if it's true, depending on such a subtle implementation detail would be dangerous. And it still doesn't resolve the issue that a single DFSClient should pick different replicas from a given class, for various reads of a given block.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-12-15T02:16:38.321+0000","updated":"2012-12-15T02:16:38.321+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618381/comment/13533132","id":"13533132","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
