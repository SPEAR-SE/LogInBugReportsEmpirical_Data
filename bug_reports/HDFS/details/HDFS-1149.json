I also think it would be clearer if we inverted its meaning and renamed it to {{heartbeatsDisabledForTests}} - that way when reading the code later it will be clear that this is always false in normal operation.\n- Same goes for all of the new public members in LeaseManager/Lease -- I think you can just move the getLeaseByPath function into NameNodeAdapter, then it can all stay package-protected, right?\n- In the test case, I think it's better to call {{stm.hflush()}} after the writer has lost its lease -- this is a DN-only operation, which means that it's verifying that the lease recovery has gone all the way through, not just a NN state change. The fact that you check isUnderConstruction should already do that as well, but just a double-check. Then you can close the stream as well and check for the same exception.\n- I think the new NAMENODE_LEASE_MANAGER_SLEEP_TIME is probably better named NAMENODE_LEASE_RECHECK_INTERVAL (more consistent with other variables like {{heartbeatRecheckInterval}} and {{replicationRecheckInterval}})\n\nOther concern:\n- Does this interact correctly with lease maintenance on rename/delete? I think so... but it would be good to add the following tests:\n\nTest A:\n1) client creates file /dir_a/file and leaves it open\n2) client renames /dir_a to /dir_b   (this calls LeaseManager.changeLease)\n3) client dies, so lease recovery happens\n4) NN reassigns lease to NN_Recovery\n5) NN restarts and loads edits: NN_Recovery should own the lease on the new location of the file\n\n[ this tests that on edit log replay, the lease is properly tracked to the new name of the file ]\n\nTest B:\n1) client creates file /file and leaves it open\n2) client deletes file /file\n3) client dies, so lease recovery happens\n4) NN reassigns lease to NN_Recovery\n5) NN restarts and loads edits: no NPEs or anything\n\n\nI'm also wondering if we have an issue with regards to safeMode. In theory we should never write anything to the edit log while in safemode, but I don't see safemode checks in internalReleaseLease. This is similar to the bugs seen in HDFS-988 if you want some background\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-06-02T02:34:55.082+0000","updated":"2011-06-02T02:34:55.082+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12464382/comment/13044994","id":"13044994","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
