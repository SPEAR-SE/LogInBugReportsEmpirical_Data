This JIRA is created to discuss/improve disk failure handling in a better/consistent manner.\n\nFor one thing, disks can fail in multiple different ways: the hardware might be failing, disk space is full, checksum error ... For others, hardware abstracts out the details, so it's hard for software to handle them.\n\nThere are currently three disk check mechanisms in HDFS, as far as I know: {{BlockScanner}}, {{BlockPoolSlice#checkDirs}} and {{DU}}. Disk errors are handled differently. \n\nThis JIRA is more focused on {{DU}} error handling. {{DU}} may emit errors like this:\n{noformat}\n2016-02-18 02:23:36,224 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.FsDatasetImpl: Caught exception while scanning /data/8/dfs/dn/current.\nWill throw later.\nExitCodeException exitCode=1: du: cannot access `/data/8/dfs/dn/current/BP-1018136951-49.4.167.110-1403564146510/current/finalized/subdir228/subdir11/blk_\n1088686909': Input/output error\ndu: cannot access `/data/8/dfs/dn/current/BP-1018136951-49.4.167.110-1403564146510/current/finalized/subdir228/subdir11/blk_1088686909_14954023.meta': Inp\nut/output error\n{noformat}\nI found {{DU}} errors are not handled consistently while working on HDFS-9908 (Datanode should tolerate disk scan failure during NN handshake), and it all depends on who catches the exception.\n\nFor example, \n* if DU returns error during NN handshake, DN will not be able to join the cluster at all(HDFS-9908);\n* however, if the same exception is caught in {{BlockPoolSlice#saveDfsUsed}}, data node will only log a warning and do nothing (HDFS-5498).\n* in some cases, the exception handler invokes {{BlockPoolSlice#checkDirs}}, but since it only checks three directories, it is very unlikely to find the files that have the error. {{BlockReceiver#(constructor)}}\n\nSo my ask is: should the error be handled in a consistent manner? Should data node report to the name nodes about the disk failures (this is the BlockScanner approach), and should data node takes this volume offline automatically if DU returns an error? (this is the {{checkDirs}} approach)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Datanode disk failure handling is not consistent","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12948145/comment/15197085","id":"15197085","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Apparently Todd has seen it before.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-03-16T09:31:40.317+0000","updated":"2016-03-16T09:31:40.317+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12948145/comment/15201988","id":"15201988","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HADOOP-8640 is another incidence of the same issue.\nAs Todd found in HADOOP-8640,\nThe current behavior of DU which propagates the error to callers is not a good idea, because the callers have no way of knowing how to handle it.\n\nWhat about logging the error, but don't propagate the error to the caller.
