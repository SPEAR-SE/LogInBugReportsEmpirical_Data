Remove the shorter size replica from the blocks map.\n \nCase1  typically happens when the lazy flush of OS buffers in the datanode encounters a transient error and one copy of a good replica is truncated on disk.\n\nCase 2 could occur because a datanode prematurely (because of buggy code somewhere) sends a block Received to the NN. In this case, it is safe to not treat the replica as corrupt because the existence of the lease indicates that the NN does not \"own\" this block.
