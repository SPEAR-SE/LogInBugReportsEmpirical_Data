Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"After compare the pros and cons of the existing lease recovery logic and the proposed one, I found the existing one actually is actually better. \n\nThe existing approach: new appender wait (soft limit) and retry OR explicitly force reclaim other appender's lease.\nPros: appender has better control and less thrashing\nCons: appender will have to wait or force reclaim lease from others.\n\nThe proposed: allowing one appender to implicitly reclaim other appender's lease as long as the last block is COMPLETE.\nPros: Guarantee fairness among appenders\nCons: Very aggressive, may causes unnecessary thrashing among appenders.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xyao","name":"xyao","key":"xyao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyu
