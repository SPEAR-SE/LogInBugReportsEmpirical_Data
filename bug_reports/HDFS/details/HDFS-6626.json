But it isn't intuitive. The scenario is like this, you try to decommission a node; when the node is being decommissioned, the node becomes dead from NN's point of view; right after that NN will mark this node decommissioned. On the webUI, administrators will consider the decommission has completed successfully. That is because when there is no block left for the DN, decommission is considered done.\n\n{noformat}\nBlockManager.java\n  boolean isReplicationInProgress(DatanodeDescriptor srcNode) {\n    boolean status = false;\n...\n    final Iterator<? extends Block> it = srcNode.getBlockIterator();\n    while(it.hasNext()) {\n...\n// set status if there is block under replication\n    }\n...\n    return status;\n}\n{noformat}\n\nThe question is whether we should mark the dead node as decommission completed (the current behavior), or mark the dead node \"decommission aborted\". From administrators' point of view, when they are doing decomm, they want to know the status of decomm and the health of those decomm-in-progress nodes. If they can detect decommission failure earlier, they might be able to take actions earlier; for example if the TOR switch has issues during decomm, administrators will be able to quickly find out a bunch of \"decommission aborted\" nodes from the same rack. People can still find this information by doing the join between decomm node list and recent dead node list on the webUI; just not as convenient.\n\nSuggestions?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"403613","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Node is marked decommissioned if it becomes dead when it is being decommissioned","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12725409/comment/14064408","id":"14064408","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Ming,\n\nI think the main goal of decommissioning is to shift blocks off of a DN, which is done at low priority to avoid disrupting the cluster. However, if a DN dies while decommissioning, HDFS is forced to immediately re-replicate all of its blocks at a high priority. Thus, the end result of a successful decommission vs an \"aborted decommission\" as you term it is the same: no blocks on that DN.\n\nWhat additional actions would the admin be able to take if we also had a \"decommission aborted\" state? If you're interested in process / host health, that's typically handled by dedicated monitoring tools like CM or ganglia.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-17T00:35:19.491+0000","updated":"2014-07-17T00:35:19.491+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12725409/comment/14069811","id":"14069811","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks, Andrew.
