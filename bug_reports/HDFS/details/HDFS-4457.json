The client thinks it contacted the proxy host for the token, but the token as returned by the server will have the \"real\" host, so later the client won't find the token when it uses the proxy.\n# You can't assume how the token should be keyed in the Credentials.  The key is a private implementation detail.  Guessing wrong will cause the job to fail to submit when MR tries to get the token again.\n\n-1 to the approach because I've invested a significant effort in ensuring that 0.20.5+ clients all set the service in the token.  I paved the way for a backwards-compatible change to token selection.  I want to better support HA, CNAMEs, multiple A-names, and multi-interface hosts.  The server will set the service to an opaque value and newer clients will use that for token selection, but older clients will continue to set the service and work the same as they ever did.  We can also get rid of all the use_ip stuff.  This patch would ruin that feature...\n\nI'd suggest using something like fetchdt that uses the standard token acquisition apis that will populate the credentials for you.  There is a -tokenCacheFile in {{GenericOptionsParser}} that will allow the binary credentials to be passed into a command.

The token will contain the hostname that the proxy used to contact the server, not the hostname the client used to contact the proxy.  The proxy, or even some form of NAT may be redirecting the port.  The server doesn't know this, only the client knows what port it thinks it contacted.\n\nThe remote server also doesn't have the ability to know if the client has use_ip enabled or disabled.  \n\nBasically, only the client that requested the token knows the exact host:port authority it used to request the token.  When it attempts to re-contact that service, it needs to match the service with the authority.\n\nMy second concern is that you must be assuming the key to store the token in the credentials.  It currently happens to be the token's service, but it's a private implementation detail.  If the key format changes, and the passed-along token is added to the credentials with the old format, then job submission will attempt to reacquire the token and fail.

This is just an example of where the server doesn't know how the client originally tried to contact it.\n\nFor the creds key issue, if you insert a token into the creds with the wrong key, the fs will try to fetch a token again during job submission.  The creds key typically matches the service, but doesn't have to, ex. HA tokens contain the logical uri's authority.  If/when webhdfs implements HA, this will be a problem.
