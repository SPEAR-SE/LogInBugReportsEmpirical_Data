So, here is a proposed solution:\n* Change the server to disregard the showprogress option, and send out dots every N (=10) seconds no matter what.\n* Change the client to filter out any line that has only dots in it, if the showprogress option is not specified.\n* Maybe take as N an additional option (e.g. progressFrequencySec), or make it configurable in hdfs-site.xml, or leave it at 10 (for now at least).\n\nIf this sounds fine, I can work on a patch to do this.
