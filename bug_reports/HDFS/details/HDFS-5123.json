discussion in one place.\n\nWe're thinking of two approaches:\n1) Fixing the hdfs-client when the hftp is used to use a retry mechanism to fail over to the active NN\n2) Use URL re-direction from the standby to the active NN.\n\nAdvantage of 1) is that it will work even if the (previously) active NN host is completely down, or if the NN process is not running at all.\n\nAdvantage of 2) is that it will give some benefits / resilience, even if Hadoop 1.0 clients are not modified.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jrottinghuis","name":"jrottinghuis","key":"jrottinghuis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joep
