into bad states. The exact failure mode depends on the state of the file, but at the least one DFSOutputStream will \"win\" over the others, leading to data loss in the sense that data written to the other DFSOutputStreams will be lost. While this is perhaps okay because of overwrite semantics, we've also seen other cases where the DFSClient loops indefinitely on close and blocks get marked as corrupt. This is not okay.\n\nOne fix for this is adding some locking to DFSClient which prevents a user from opening multiple concurrent output streams to the same
