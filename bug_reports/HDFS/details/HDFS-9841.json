_modified_ or _access_ time. In Hadoop 2.5, the method [metadataEquals|http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-hdfs/2.5.0/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/INodeFileAttributes.java#INodeFileAttributes.SnapshotCopy.metadataEquals%28org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.INodeFileAttributes%29] was added to _org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.INodeFileAttributes_. The *hdfs snapshotDiff* command seems to use the method to show a list of snapshot metadata diff's, but because the method doesn't check for the times, you CANNOT see the time-based FileDiff's in the comparison. This used to work before Hadoop 2.5.
