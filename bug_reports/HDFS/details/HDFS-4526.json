So, eventhough you call hsync, NN will not know the length of the block as client would have written the data to DN but DNs will not report intermittently again to NN with the length for every flush.\n\nHsync ensures all the packets should stream to DN and persist the block details. Here block length still would be 0 in NN. \n\nWhen readers trying to read the block, client will directly talk to DN for the last block length. \n\nAlso you can see the code path at client side, that we will call fsync to NN only once per the block. Here my proposal is, if we enable persistBlocks feature, addBlock call itself persisting the blocks in NN. then there is no need to explicite fsync call to NN at all. Only we have to ensure is that, Client should stream all packets to DN till the fsync length.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-01T04:56:41.391+0000","updated":"2013-03-01T04:56:41.391+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633740/comment/13592882","id":"13592882","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the in-depth explanation Uma, it really helped me know where to look.
