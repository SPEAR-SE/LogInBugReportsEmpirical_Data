Or at least provide a configuration option to do so if people are worried about the overhead of maintaining checksums of these files. Even if we assume dfs.name.dir is reliable storage this guards against operator

Therefore, we should never alter the signature within the same checkpoint process.\nWe should probably make the JavaDoc for CheckpointSignature more explicit on that.\n\nCurrent implementation is inconsistent in two ways.\nOn the one hand, rollImage for SNN sends back a new checkpoint signature with the digest of the new image.
