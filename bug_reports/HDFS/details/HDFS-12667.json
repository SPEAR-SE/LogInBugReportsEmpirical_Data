perhaps you already know most.\r\n\r\nThe problem HDFS-11210 tries to solve is the semantic guarantee a key rollover provides.\r\n\r\nBefore HDFS-11210, if someone:\r\n# roll a EZ key (from v1 to v2)\r\n# generate EDEK of that EZ key\r\nIt is possible to see the generated EDEK is encrypted with the v1 EZ key. If lucky enough, they could generate, see a v2 EZ key (returned by the synchronized call), then later generate another, see a v1 EZ key (from the async thread).\r\n\r\nSince key rolling is for security purpose, it would be good to ensure EDEKs are generated with the new version EZ key. Also, re-encryption only makes sense if the versioning guarantee exists for key rolling. For this reason, we need to keep this semantic.\r\n\r\nOn the implementation, perhaps the locking could be more sophisticated, and do things smarter in the during the async fetching phase. Better approaches welcome.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-10-17T06:17:47.205+0000","updated":"2017-10-17T06:17:47.205+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13109761/comment/16211324","id":"16211324","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"The requirement to ensure new edeks is fine.  The problem is the implementation.  It may severely penalize the common case performance for a rare event.  We are investigating alternate designs because the locking has to go.\r\n\r\nFirst, the new locks protecting access to key's blocking queue negates concurrency.  When the queue is being refilled, all edek requests are blocked until the refill is done – even if there are still edeks available.  Furthermore the striped locking causes edek requests for other requests to unnecessarily block too.  This is an unacceptable penalty to the common case.\r\n\r\nSecond, the base requirement motivating the locks was to ensure after a reencrypt starts that no new creates will use old edeks.  However it appears to not be correct.  A create op may release the fsn lock, fetch an old edek, a reencrypt is issued which drains the queue and now expects new edeks, the in-progress create reacquires the lock and uses the old edek.  The race condition is tight, probably only an issue if the waiting creates should have been in the first batch, but it's wrong.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to integrate a internal patch for an async policy to prevent blocking a handler – doesn't matter that the fsn lock is released, blocking a handler is unacceptable.  The new locking model is incompatible.  Namely it forces the poll to be protected by the lock so the edek fetch cannot short out.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-10-19T16:38:22.793+0000","updated":"2017-10-19T16:38:22.793+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13109761/comment/16211418","id":"16211418","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~daryn] for elaborating.

That's a pretty head scratching scenario - generate again may solve it, but keyversion, being a String, can only be compared in an equalsTo fashion (rather than greaterThan / lessThan), so if someone roll the key on the KMS again during re-encryption (say v1->v2, and the re-encryption was submitted for the v0->v1 roll), every create after that point will have to generate twice - because re-encrypt isn't aware of the roll and still compares with v1, while the new creates are on v2, which for equalsTo comparison is indifferent than v0 v.s. v1.\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-10-19T17:46:08.346+0000","updated":"2017-10-19T17:46:08.346+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13109761/comment/16211463","id":"16211463","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bq.

Happy to see this fix also brought in simplification:\r\n{{2 files changed, 170 insertions(+), 295 deletions(-)}}  :)\r\n\r\nbq.  I am thinking to remover CacheLoader in the first place.\r\nNot sure I understand the proposal correctly, could you elaborate? We should keep the expireAfterAccess logic for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\nSome comments on the patch, mostly nits:\r\n- {{PolicyBasedQueue}} and some of its methods could be private. This includes the class definition, {{size()}} and {{drain()}}.\r\n- Please keep the old thread naming convention, and initialize this with a {{ThreadFactory}}. (aka.{{.setNameFormat(REFILL_THREAD)}}).  {code}executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numFillerThreads);{code}\r\n- {{copiedElements}} can be declared inline when {{queue.drainTo}} happens\r\n- ok with the drain logic. Suggest to add some comments in the catch {{ExecutionException}} block.\r\n- about {{drainAgain}}:\r\n{code}\r\n// It is possible that future reloaded the queue even if we cancel\r\n// the fututre.\r\n{code}\r\nWhat is the exact scenario that this could happen? And why drain again at the next {{getAtMost}} solves this?\r\n\r\nTest comments:\r\n- I was initially surprised to see we had to change a lot of existing tests. But upon further looking, it seems it's mostly a side-effect due to the removal of sync-then-async. Given we only {{queue.take()}} up to {{numToFill}}, I think it should be okay. Only tradeoff is now it has to go through the process of submitting a future and let the executor to actually run it, instead of the old synchronized way - but I think that's okay too.\r\n- There are some {{println}} saying size = 9. Maybe we can just assert it?\r\n- Existing issue, {{testgetAtMostPolicyATLEAST_ONE}} javadoc comment should say {{Policy = ATLEAST_ONE}} instead of ALL.\r\n- {{testgetAtMostPolicyATLEAST_ONE}}, after we {{getAtMost(\"k1\", 10}}, we should then also verify there is another async filler running.\r\n- {{testgetAtMostPolicyALL}}'s comment (Synchronous call: 1. 2.) is obsolete.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-11-16T06:56:24.776+0000","updated":"2017-11-16T06:56:24.776+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13109761/comment/16407058","id":"16407058","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=genericqa","name":"genericqa","key":"genericqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=genericqa&avatarId=33630","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=genericqa&avatarId=33630","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=genericqa&avatarId=33630","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=genericqa&avatarId=33630"},"displayName":"genericqa","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\r\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue}  0m  0s{color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\r\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} patch {color} | {color:red}  0m  5s{color} | {color:red} HDFS-12667 does not apply to trunk.
