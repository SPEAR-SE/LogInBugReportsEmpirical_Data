If an inode id is provided and it exists, it replaces the provided path.  If it doesn't exist, it has the broken behavior of falling back to the supplied path.  A supplied inode id must be authoritative.  A FNF should be thrown if the inode does not exist.  (HDFS-10745 changed from string paths to IIPs but preserved the same broken semantics)\r\n\r\nThis is broken since an operation specifying an inode for a deleted and recreated path will operate on the newer inode.  If another client recreates the path, the operation is likely to fail for other reasons such as lease checks.  However a multi-threaded client has a single lease id.  If thread1 creates a file, it's somehow deleted, thread2 recreates the path, then further operations in thread1 may conflict with thread2 and corrupt the state of the file.\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12342772","id":"12342772","description":"","name":"3.2.0","archived":false,"released":false}],"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Operations based on inode id must not fallback to the path","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13109278/comment/16216091","id":"16216091","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=subru","name":"subru","key":"subru","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=subru&avatarId=21709","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=subru&avatarId=21709","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=subru&avatarId=21709","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=subru&avatarId=21709"},"displayName":"Subru Krishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~daryn], pushing it out from 2.9.0 as it's still unassigned and we are nearing 2.9 code freeze.
