As for what the code is doing in TestSecureNameNode#testName, I am trying to mirror the intent of the original test case - after Kerberos authentication, the root user can create new directories, but a user other than root cannot create directories where it does not have write access (substituting current user for user1).\nOkay. The only minor concern would be the test fails if the logged in user is {{hdfs}}. How about generating a random user name?\n\n{code}\n@@ -82,7 +83,7 @@ public static void initKdc() throws Exception {\n     kdc.start();\n\n-    String userName = UserGroupInformation.getLoginUser().getShortUserName();\n+    String userName = RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(8);\n{code}\n\nAlso an assertion message in {{testName}} still references user1.\n\n{code}\n        Path p = new Path(\"/users/mydir\");\n        fs.mkdirs(p);\n        fail(\"user1 must not be allowed to write in /users\");\n{code}\n\nLooks good otherwise.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-08T20:51:23.526+0000","updated":"2015-04-08T20:51:23.526+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12726709/comment/14486042","id":"14486042","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vijaysbhat","name":"vijaysbhat","key":"vijaysbhat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vijay Bhat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"[~arpitagarwal] Ah of course - I see what you meant in your earlier comment about checking for UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled().\n\nI will make the changes you suggest and resubmit the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vijaysbhat","name":"vijaysbhat","key":"vijaysbhat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vijay Bhat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-04-08T21:07:02.266+0000","updated":"2015-04-08T21:07:02.266+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12726709/comment/14486180","id":"14486180","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thank you for the patch, [~vijaysbhat].\n\nIt's not necessary to call {{LOG.error}} before throwing the exceptions.  The exceptions will propagate out and get logged at a higher layer before the process terminates.  The log statements here would cause the error to get logged twice.\n\nOn the NameNode side, I recommend changing the existing code in {{BlockManager#createBlockTokenSecretManager}} instead of adding new code to the {{NameNode}} class.  The existing code currently logs an error.  We'd just need to change it to throw an exception.\n\nIn the test, I recommend using JUnit's {{ExpectedException}} with the expected message set to something like \"Security is enabled but block access tokens\".  For an example of this, see {{TestSaslDataTransfer#testDataNodeAbortsIfNoSasl}}.  This will help us guarantee that the exception is thrown from the right place and for the right reason.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-08T22:13:48.601+0000","updated":"2015-04-08T22:13:48.601+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12726709/comment/14486404","id":"14486404","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vijaysbhat","name":"vijaysbhat","key":"vijaysbhat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vijay Bhat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks for the feedback [~cnauroth].
