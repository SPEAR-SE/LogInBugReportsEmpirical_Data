That's why we should have one patch for branch-2/branch-2.8 and have a different patch for trunk later.\n\nbq. Like I said before too, since 2.9.0 isn't imminently being released, I'd prefer the default action be \"fix HDFS-13715\" than \"maintain the hack of HDFS-11431\". It's also easy to revisit this when 2.9.0 is closer to an RC.\nI don't see HDFS-13715 will get immediately fixed in short term also - it even haven't get any assignee yet. \n\nMy key points here:\n1. HDFS-13715 is somethings TBD, for branch-2. better to have HDFS-11431 patch than nothing.\n2. HDFS-13715 is not a blocker but something nice to have for 2.9. As I mentioned earlier, the whole feature to make hdfs-client jar thinner is not a must given many features on 2.9 are also in pipeline.\n3. If you really think tracking the revert of this patch (when we have HDFS-13715) is a big problem, then we could file a separated JIRA and mark that one as a blocker for 2.9 to revisit reverting patch here when we are in RC stage.\n\nMake sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2017-03-17T00:04:21.770+0000","updated":"2017-03-17T00:04:21.770+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13044369/comment/15929757","id":"15929757","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"OK.

Thanks!\n\nThe issue title said:\nbq. hadoop-hdfs-client JAR does not include ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider\n\nAnd the description said:\nbq. The hadoop-hdfs-client-2.8.0.jar file does include the ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider class. This breaks client applications that use this class to communicate with the active NameNode in an HA deployment of HDFS.\n\nSince for {{2.8.0}} the jar does include the class so there is no problem for that version right? But the target and fix versions were marked as {{2.8.0}}, which is why I'm confused.\n\nAnyway, for trunk, this is left to be fixed in HDFS-11538, where we would have an elegant fix that only moves the needed class into {{hadoop-hdfs-client}} jar but without introducing the NN server side classes, so we have to refactor the codes in {{ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider}}.

This pulls all the server JARs back in. It was committed as a quick fix to get 2.8.0 released.\n\nAs you noted, HDFS-11538 is intended as a better long term solution that moves CFPP to hadoop-hdfs-client, so it no longer needs to pull in the full hadoop-hdfs dependency (the server-side jar).\n\nThis also highlights a significant lack of testing of the hdfs client artifact. The hdfs client split didn't also split the tests, so we have essentially no test coverage for the client module by itself. It'd be great for HDFS-11538 to include hdfs client unit tests to help address this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-23T23:09:45.741+0000","updated":"2017-03-23T23:09:45.741+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13044369/comment/15939516","id":"15939516","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drankye","name":"drankye","key":"drankye","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kai Zheng","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Chongqing"},"body":"Thanks Andrew for the help!
