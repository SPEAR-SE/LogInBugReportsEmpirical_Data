This is to support cases with small clusters or replication being set intentionally high.\n# We should probably go for option (1) with min-replication. This has an advantage that there will be no change in semantics with current implementation. The disadvantage is that once file is opened for append the ongoing replications of the last block will fail, because of the genStamp change.\n# In the end our main goal is to make append fail earlier to prevent the file from being under construction while nobody can use it, which happens when the last  block has 0 replicas.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-12T00:54:14.632+0000","updated":"2014-05-12T00:54:14.632+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12712035/comment/13994738","id":"13994738","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch review comments:\n# Need to change full-replication to min-replication.\n# You should not check sufficient replication if the last block is already under construction.\n# JavaDoc comment for isSufficientlyReplicated() is not clear and the comment in the body is redundant.\n# The test looks good.
