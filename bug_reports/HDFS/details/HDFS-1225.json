Why?\nAfter dn1.recoverBlock crashes at rename, what left at dn1 current directory is:\n1) blk_X                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n2) blk_X_1001.meta_tmp1002\n==> this is an invalid block, because it has no meta file associated with it.\ndn2 (after dn1 crash) now contains:\n1) blk_X                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n2) blk_X_1002.meta\n(note that the rename at dn2 is completed, because dn1 called dn2.updateBlock() before\ncalling its own updateBlock())\nBut the command namenode.commitBlockSynchronization is not reported to namenode,\nbecause dn1 is crashed. Therefore, from namenode point of view, the block X has GS 1001.\nHence, the block is lost.\n\nThis bug was found by our Failure Testing Service framework:\nhttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2010/EECS-2010-98.html\nFor questions, please email us: Thanh Do (thanhdo@cs.wisc.edu) and \nHaryadi Gunawi (haryadi@eecs.berkeley.edu)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113400","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Block lost when primary crashes in recoverBlock","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467156/comment/12881938","id":"12881938","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This is very similar to HDFS-1263.
