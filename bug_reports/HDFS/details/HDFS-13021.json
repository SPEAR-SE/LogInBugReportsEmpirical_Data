So old policies (on snapshot) may not be accurately reflecting how the blocks are placed (even without snapshot, it may also not be accurate, for example if it's changed and mover not run yet), but they can be accurate on what the metadata was when the snapshot was created, and immutable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-01-26T22:38:28.976+0000","updated":"2018-01-26T22:38:28.976+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13131008/comment/16341999","id":"16341999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=GeLiXin","name":"GeLiXin","key":"gelixin","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gelixin&avatarId=31833","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gelixin&avatarId=31833","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gelixin&avatarId=31833","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gelixin&avatarId=31833"},"displayName":"LiXin Ge","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Personally，It's a hassle to deal with snapshot more or less, not only in distributed file system like HDFS, but also in local file systems. Even so, we still have to deal with it, or just to explain it clearly :)\r\n FYI, some personnal opinions:\r\n\r\n\r\n First of all, the definition of HDFS snapshots in [hadoop wiki |https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsSnapshots.html] are *read-only, point-in-time* copies of the file system. If the file/directory status in a snapshot changes with the origin file/directory, it breaks the semantic of *read-only* and *point-in-time* to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n Secondly, It may bring some confusions to the admin users. For example, people set a directory's storage policy to {{All_SSD}} to store it in SSD for better performance and take a snapshot. Afterwards the policy changed back to {{Hot}} for some reason, and months later the admin forgets the {{All_SSD}} policy exist in the past(or just is another admin) and want to find out why the SSD is full of data, he looks over all the directories include the snapshots, only to find {{HOT}} policy which will not use the SSD, and there is no clue or document to remind him to run the mover for a try – seems like a bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=GeLiXin","name":"GeLiXin","key":"gelixin","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gelixin&avatarId=31833","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gelixin&avatarId=31833","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gelixin&avatarId=31833","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gelixin&avatarId=31833"},"displayName":"LiXin Ge","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2018-01-27T06:54:08.423+0000","updated":"2018-01-27T06:54:08.423+0000"}],"maxResults":10,"total":10,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-13021/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3owyf:"}}
