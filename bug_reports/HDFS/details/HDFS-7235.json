However, because of the bad disk, the DN would detect the source block to be transfered as invalidBlock with the following logic in FsDatasetImpl.java:\n\n{code}\n/** Does the block exist and have the given state? */\n  private boolean isValid(final ExtendedBlock b, final ReplicaState state) {\n    final ReplicaInfo replicaInfo = volumeMap.get(b.getBlockPoolId(), \n        b.getLocalBlock());\n    return replicaInfo != null\n        && replicaInfo.getState() == state\n        && replicaInfo.getBlockFile().exists();\n  }\n{code}\n\nThe reason that this method returns false (detecting invalid block) is because the block file doesn't exist due to bad disk in this case. \n\nThe key issue we found here is, after DN detects an invalid block for the above reason, it doesn't report the invalid block back to NN, thus NN doesn't know that the block is corrupted, and keeps sending the data transfer request to the same DN to be decommissioned, again and again. This caused an infinite loop, so the decommission process hangs.\n\nThanks [~qwertymaniac] for reporting the issue and initial

The JavaDoc for {{FsDatasetSpi#isValid}} says that it checks if the block \"exist\\[s\\] and has the given state\" and it's clear from the code that this is what it actually implements.\n\nWe start by calling isValid...\n{code}\n  private void transferBlock(ExtendedBlock block, DatanodeInfo[] xferTargets,\n      StorageType[] xferTargetStorageTypes) throws IOException {\n    BPOfferService bpos = getBPOSForBlock(block);\n    DatanodeRegistration bpReg = getDNRegistrationForBP(block.getBlockPoolId());\n\n    if (!data.isValidBlock(block)) {\n      // block does not exist or is under-construction\n      String errStr = \"Can't send invalid block \" + block;\n      LOG.info(errStr);\n\n      bpos.trySendErrorReport(DatanodeProtocol.INVALID_BLOCK, errStr);\n      return;\n    }\n    ...\n{code}\n\n{{isValid}} checks whether the block file exists...\n{code}\n/** Does the block exist and have the given state? */                                                                \n  private boolean isValid(final ExtendedBlock b, final ReplicaState state) {                                           \n    final ReplicaInfo replicaInfo = volumeMap.get(b.getBlockPoolId(),                                                  \n        b.getLocalBlock());\n    return replicaInfo != null                                                                                         \n        && replicaInfo.getState() == state                                                                             \n        && replicaInfo.getBlockFile().exists();\n  }   \n{code}\n\nSo there's no need for a new function.  isValid already does what you want.\n\nbq. The key issue we found here is, after DN detects an invalid block for the above reason, it doesn't report the invalid block back to NN, thus NN doesn't know that the block is corrupted, and keeps sending the data transfer request to the same DN to be decommissioned, again and again. This caused an infinite loop, so the decommission process hangs.\n\nIs this a problem with {{BPOfferService#trySendErrorReport}}?  If so, it seems like we should fix it there.\n\nI can see that BPServiceActor#trySendErrorReport calls {{NameNodeRpc#errorReport}}, whereas your patch calls {{NameNodeRpc#reportBadBlocks}}.  What's the reason for this change, and does it fix the bug described above?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Actually for this case, the state has to be FINALIZED. We don't want to report badBlock for state that's RBW for example.\n\nIf we make the change in SendErrorReport, that means we need to change the behavior of this method, to also call reportBadBlocks from there conditionally, which is not clean to me, because SendErrorReport is supposed to just send error report.\n\nWonder if this explanation makes sense to you?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-13T18:33:55.982+0000","updated":"2014-10-13T18:33:55.982+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12747474/comment/14169850","id":"14169850","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

I was in a rush to leave when I put the previous comment with patch yesterday. Here is some more info to share:\n\n* You said that external user might be deriving FsDatasetSpi interface, any change to this interface might imply compatibility. This is a very good point. So indeed it'd be nice if we can avoid changing FsDatasetSpi.\n* If we use {{FsDatasetSpi#getLength}} method to check file existence, it's not guaranteed that the replica state is FINALIZED. So it's not sufficient for the fix here. \n* Without changing FsDatasetSpi, we need to add similar logic as I did in rev 001 to DataNode.java. To check replica state in DataNode.java, I had to use the deprecated method getReplica(). \n* Having this logic in DataNode.java is a bit concern to me, DataNode is supposed to use FsDatasetSpi interface only, now we incorporate logic specific to FsDatasetImpl in DataNode.java.  If user derives FsDatasetSpi and write their own version, the logic may not be the same as FsDatasetImpl. This might cause potential problem. This is the point I was trying to make in last comment.\n\nWould you please comment again?\n\nThanks.\n \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-14T15:11:27.822+0000","updated":"2014-10-14T15:11:27.822+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12747474/comment/14171379","id":"14171379","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"FYI [~cmccabe], I found a related jira HDFS-5194 and posted a comment there.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-14T19:13:06.566+0000","updated":"2014-10-14T19:13:06.566+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12747474/comment/14177518","id":"14177518","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Yongjun,\n\nThanks for your patience here.  I don't think the current patch is quite ready.  I could point to a few things, like this:  {{ReplicaInfo replicaInfo = (ReplicaInfo) data.getReplica(}}  We shouldn't be downcasting here.\n\nI think the bigger issue is that the interface in FsDatasetSpi is just not very suitable to what we're trying to do.  Rather than trying to hack it, I think we should come up with a better interface.\n\nI think we should replace {{FsDatasetSpi#isValid}} with this function:\n\n{code}\n  /**\n   * Check if a block is valid.\n   *\n   * @param b           The block to check.\n   * @param minLength   The minimum length that the block must have.  May be 0.\n   * @param state       If this is null, it is ignored.  If it is non-null, we\n   *                        will check that the replica has this state.\n   *\n   * @throws FileNotFoundException             If the replica is not found or there \n   *                                              was an error locating it.\n   * @throws EOFException                      If the replica length is too short.\n   * @throws UnexpectedReplicaStateException   If the replica is not in the \n   *                                             expected state.\n   */\n  public void checkBlock(ExtendedBlock b, long minLength, ReplicaState state);\n{code}\n\nSince this function will throw a clearly marked exception detailing which case we're in, we won't have to call multiple functions.  This will be better for performance since we're only taking the lock once.  This will also be better for clarity, since the current APIs lead to some rather complex code.\n\nWe could also get rid of {{FsDatasetSpi#isValidRbw}}, since this function can do everything that it can.\nAlso UnexpectedReplicaStateException could be a new exception under hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/datanode/UnexpectedReplicaStateException.java\n\nI think it's fine to change FsDatasetSpi for this (we did it when adding caching stuff, and again when adding \"trash\").\n\nLet me know what you think.  I think it would make things a lot more clear.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
