The file locking could actually be a desirable behavior for preventing accidental deletion of a replica.

Instead, I'm uploaing patch version 2 to skip the test on Windows.\n\nMy only other concern was around the potential for concurrent deleteBlockPool operations.  However, the CLI documentation for deleteBlockPool states that the operator must use refreshNamenodes first so that there is no live activity on the block pool.
