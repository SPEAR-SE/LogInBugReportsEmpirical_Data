I am able to reproduce the following:\n\n- NN is writing to three dirs: /data/1/nn, /data/2/nn, and /data/3/nn\n- I modified the NN to inject an IOException when creating \"edits.new\" in /data/3/nn, which causes \"removeEditsForStorageDir\" to get called inside {{rollEditLog}}\n- Upon triggering a checkpoint:\n-- all three logs are closed successfully\n-- /data/1/nn and /data/2/nn are successfully opened for \"edits.new\"\n-- /data/3/nn throws an IOE which gets caught. This calls {{removeEditsForStorageDir}}, which removes the wrong stream (augmented logging):\n{code}\n12/07/12 16:23:54 INFO namenode.FSNamesystem: Roll Edit Log from 127.0.0.1\n12/07/12 16:23:54 INFO namenode.FSNamesystem: Number of transactions: 0 Total time for transactions(ms): 0Number of transactions batched in Syncs: 0 Number of syncs: 0 SyncTimes(ms): 0 0 0 \n12/07/12 16:23:54 WARN namenode.FSNamesystem: Removing edits stream /tmp/name1/nn/current/edits.new\n12/07/12 16:23:54 WARN common.Storage: Removing storage dir /tmp/name3/nn\njava.io.IOException: Injected fault for /tmp/name3/nn/current/edits.new\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSEditLog$EditLogFileOutputStream.<init>(FSEditLog.java:146)\n{code}\n- The NN is now _only_ writing to /tmp/name2/nn/current/edits.new, but considers both name1 and name2 to be good from a storage-directory standpoint. However, {{/tmp/name1/nn/current/edits.new}} exists as an empty edit log file (just the header and preallocated region of 0xffs)\n- When {{rollFSImage}} is called, it successfully calls {{close}} only on the name2 log - which truncates it to the correct transaction boundary. Then it renames both {{name2/.../edits.new}} and {{name1/.../edits.new}} to {{edits}}, and opens them both for append (assuming they've been truncated to a transaction boundary).\n- The NN is now writing to name1 and name2, but name1's log looks like this:\n\n{code}\n<valid header> <preallocated bytes of 0xffffffffffff.....> <transactions>\n{code}\n\n- Upon the next checkpoint, the 2NN will likely download this log, since it's listed first in the name directory list. Upon doing so, it will see the 0xff at the head of the log and not read any of the edits (which come after all of the 0xffs)\n- The 2NN then uploads the \"merged\" image back to the NN, which blows away the \"edits\" file. Thus, its in-memory data has gotten out of sync with the disk data, and the next time a checkpoint occurs or the NN restarts, it will fail.\n\nThis is not an issue in trunk since the code was largely rewritten by HDFS-1073.\n\nThe workaround for existing users is simple: rename the directories to eg /data/1/nn1 and /data/2/nn2. The fix is also simple. I will upload the fix this afternoon.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-07-12T23:36:51.820+0000","updated":"2012-07-12T23:36:51.820+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598643/comment/13413342","id":"13413342","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Attached patch is for branch-1.\n\nI modified the existing storage dir failure test so that all of the name dirs have the same name, and it started to fail.
