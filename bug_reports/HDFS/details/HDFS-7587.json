Out of sync quota is better than a corrupted in-memory state.  Also, in-sync quota is better than out of sync quota.  We could have both in-sync quota and uncorrupted in-memory state.

Also make changes based on Nicholas's comments, i.e., first verifying the quota and updating the quota after the action.\n\nWith fix from HDFS-7943 we will not have blocks with size greater than the preferred block size. Thus we can avoid \"earning back\" quota scenarios.\n\nTruncate may have similar issue when the data to truncate is only part of the original last block. Will update the patch later to fix this part.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-17T18:51:37.414+0000","updated":"2015-03-17T18:51:37.414+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12765196/comment/14365990","id":"14365990","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Add fix for truncate.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-17T20:22:02.780+0000","updated":"2015-03-17T20:22:02.780+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12765196/comment/14366016","id":"14366016","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Is it possible for the last block size to be greater than the preferred block size?\n{code}\n+      final long diff = (file.getPreferredBlockSize() - lastBlock.getNumBytes())\n+          * file.getBlockReplication();\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-03-17T20:29:54.983+0000","updated":"2015-03-17T20:29:54.983+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12765196/comment/14366135","id":"14366135","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the comment, Kihwal.
