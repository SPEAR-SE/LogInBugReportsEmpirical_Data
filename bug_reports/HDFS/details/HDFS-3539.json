Including extra header files slows down compilation and may complicate matters for library users.\n\n* libhdfs.h: we don't need tTime, a typedef to a type that is itself a typedef, time_t.  Just use int64_t, which reflects the fact that HDFS deals with time as a 64-bit number.  (Note that time_t is 64 bits on most modern systems, but we shouldn't be relying on that.)\n\n* do not expose the fields of hdfsFile_internal in the header file.  Instead, offer accessors to things that might be interesting to library users, like whether a file is open for read, open for write, using direct read, etc.\n\n* set LIBHDFS_VERSION to 1.0.0","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
