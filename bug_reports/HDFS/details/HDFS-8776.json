There might be some operational impact with disabling DecommissionManager on standby. admins usually update dfs.namenode.hosts.exclude and then call \"dfsadmin -refreshNodes\" on both active and standby around the same time; in that way if NN fails over, decomm can continue. If DecommissionManager isn't running on standby, nodes will stay in decommission_inprogress state without any progress on standby. As long as admins know to ignore decommission state on standby, that should be ok (even if we keep DecommissionManager running, decommission states between active and standby could be different at any given time).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-07-16T05:46:14.344+0000","updated":"2015-07-16T05:46:14.344+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845066/comment/14630185","id":"14630185","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Related question to Ming's, this means node state will could flip back to decom in progress from decommissioned on failover right?
