But seems like issue can happen.\n\n Reason for deadLock:\n\n  1) refreshVolumes will be called with DN lock and after at the end it will also trigger Block report. In the Block report call, BPServiceActor#triggerBlockReport calls toString on bpos. Here it takes readLock on bpos.\n DN lock then boos lock\n\n2) BPOfferSetrvice#registrationSucceeded call is taking writeLock on bpos and  calling dn.bpRegistrationSucceeded which is again synchronized call on DN.\nbpos lock and then DN lock.\n\nSo, this can clearly create dead lock.\nI think simple fix could be to move triggerBlockReport call outside out DN lock and I feel that call may not be really needed inside DN lock.\n\nThoughts?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12329057","id":"12329057","description":"2.8.0
