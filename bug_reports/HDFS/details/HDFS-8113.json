The problem is that if you delete the file, the block will not be in {{blocksMap}}, then we won't be able to reproduce it.\n\nTo reproduce this, we must make sure that the {{blockInfo}} is in {{blocksMap}} and {{blockInfo.bc == null}}. I tried several test sequences with no luck.\n\nI just tried cleaning the rbw directory and restarted the DataNode. However, the problem still exists. Maybe you have ideas about this?\n\nAnd [~cmccabe], are you suggesting the patch here is ok or we should additionally check nullity for each {{storedBlock.getBlockCollection()}}?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chengbing.liu","name":"chengbing.liu","key":"chengbing.liu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chengbing Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-04-16T05:58:55.455+0000","updated":"2015-04-16T05:58:55.455+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12819640/comment/14498553","id":"14498553","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

In case of deletion, after dis-associating from file in main writeLock, blocks are kept in blockmap until aquiring different writelock in the same RPC, and it will be removed from blocksMap.\nThis is just to avoid holding writelock for long time in case of deletion of big directory.\nBut I dont see any case where its kept in blocksmap for long time without any file
