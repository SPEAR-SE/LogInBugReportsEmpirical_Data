NN allows users to go a bit over quota due to this bug.

(WARN is printed on 2NN)  If replaying of edits on top of this namespace state meets a quota exception, it gets into the unrecoverable loop of retry. \n\nIt seems that 2NN state needs to be reset when an exception occurs during replaying edits. Then 2NN will load everything from scratch and create an accurate state without losing any edits. We will still see WARN messages revealing bugs that cause NN state to be inaccurate.\n\nSince 2NN retries every minute, it can cause generation of a huge number of edit files. 2NN should give up after  rolling and creating new edit, say, 100 times. This is related to HDFS-280, but in this case we do not download everything all over again.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-02-24T16:10:55.923+0000","updated":"2013-02-24T16:10:55.923+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613955/comment/13590155","id":"13590155","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"The patch keeps count of merge errors.
