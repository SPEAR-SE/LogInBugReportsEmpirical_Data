CPU and java version? Looks like AtomicLong has scalability issues under specific CPUs and java versions, it may cause this serious 70% CPU usage, in normal cases, there may be some cache coherency effect, but not so

When incrementing, no locks need to be taken-- each thread simply increments its thread local value.  The read operations sum up the thread-local data.\n\nNote that it is not necessary to use {{AtomicLong}}.  We only need {{volatile}}.  This is because we only ever have one thread updating the thread-local statistics.  So there is no \"lost updates\" problem and no need for {{CAS}} or {{LOCK}], etc.  We only need a read barrier, which is provided by {{volatile}}.\n\nGive this a try and see if it addresses the performance problem.

It might be worthwhile to generalize the approach.\n\nBut before that, I'm wondering what would the performance look like if you simply mark the variable as volatile? The performance might not be as good the thread-local approach since the JVM specification enforces memory fences at access of volatile variables, but it is the simplest approach and it can be easily generalizable through the code base.\n\nI appreciate if you can test the volatile approach on the same set up and report the result.

We can't modify the thread-local data... only the threads themselves can do that, or else there's a race condition.  I added a comment explaining this better.\n\nbq.

Iterating over all the {{StatisticsData}} objects is complex and I would not want to duplicate that code.
