Your suggestion to distinguish decommissioned from decommissioning makes sense. Given liveness state is separated from admin state, it appears the suggestion is \"a block should be considered missing if and only if {{live, normal}} + {{live, decommissioning}} == 0\". The live attribute is implicit given fsck only gets the list of live replicas; but it might be useful to call it out.\n\nIf that is the case, both fsck and jmx metrics need to be changed. Also depending on how you interpret it, it seems more like incompatible change than just bug fix. That will decide if we want to fix it only in trunk.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-06-07T00:25:05.947+0000","updated":"2016-06-07T00:26:04.836+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12852723/comment/15318646","id":"15318646","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks a lot [~mingma] for your valuable suggestions.\nLet me close this jira as duplicate since this jira was created not to alert the block as missing if all the replicas are on Decommissioning node.\nThis work is done via HDFS-7933.\nI will create a new jira to alert a block as missing if all the replicas are on Decommissioned nodes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-06-07T15:10:54.682+0000","updated":"2016-06-07T15:10:54.682+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12852723/comment/15318657","id":"15318657","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bq.
