So your argument is like the old \"if a tree falls in a forest, and no one is there, does it make a sound?\"\nActually that is your argument :-) If an incompatible change does not affect any one, is it an incompatible change? I say it is.\n\nbq. What's the purpose of labeling it if no one cares?\nThe purpose is clearly to say, the wire protocol change is incompatible. The second part, this may not affect if one is using public interfaces or DFSClient is to alleviate the concern and indicate that they should not see any issues.\n\nbq.  Doesn't it just dilute the \"incompatible changes\" section of our release notes with information that no one cares about?\nWe have handful of these. So it should not dilute the value of of the section. There are many types of incompatible changes today. API, wire protocol, logs, semantic behavior, even log changes. Users take a look at the list of changes. If it is of no concern to them, they disregard it.\n\nBy this argument our changes.txt is replete with things that does not matter to users at all. Some of them are very specific java changes to specific classes, only relevant to developers. Most users do not care about them either. We still put them in changes.txt right?\n\nbq. Wouldn't they just be diffing the .proto files between versions to see what new fields are added, etc?\nIf I am building some thing based on proto, I may not diff or worry about looking at the change unless it is flagged as incompatible. Why would you diff .proto from release to release?\n\nbq. Maybe we need separate tags instead of just one \"incompatible change\" checkbox? I've always understood the purpose of this checkbox to alert users and operators who are upgrading between versions of things they need to be aware of that can break their applications. \nI think the current box serves the purpose. Like I said, it draws people's attention to such changes. The users can then make a decision for themselves whether it affects them or not, and how it affects them, instead of we making that decision for them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-17T00:55:51.900+0000","updated":"2013-01-17T00:55:51.900+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626151/comment/13555704","id":"13555704","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This is not worth arguing.
