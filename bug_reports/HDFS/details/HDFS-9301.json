Many of the above dependency comes as transitive dependency from hadoop-common. They are not needed from hadoop-hdfs-client. They can be excluded as what have been done in hadoop client. Just to give an example, we cleaned up the implementation of log4j in the module (HDFS-6564). I don't see how this can be done correctly without the breakdown.\n\nAs the refactor continues to break down hadoop-common into server / client modules, I anticipate that this is a non-issue.
