Actually postponed blocks haven't used {{LightWeightHashSet}} in our test cluster yet.\n\nNow I rather think HDFS-8792 (and HDFS-8674) may solve this problem. I will upgrade our cluster and do tests again. If this problem appears again, I will create another jira.\n\nSorry for my mistakes and thanks for paying attention to this jira.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tasanuma0829","name":"tasanuma0829","key":"tasanuma0829","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Takanobu Asanuma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"created":"2016-12-06T09:00:08.888+0000","updated":"2016-12-06T09:00:08.888+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-11179/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i36tqf:"}}
