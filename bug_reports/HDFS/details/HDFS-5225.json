The point I mentioned was:\n\n{code}\n        if (((now - getEarliestScanTime()) >= scanPeriod)\n            || ((!blockInfoSet.isEmpty()) && !(this.isFirstBlockProcessed()))) {\n          verifyFirstBlock();\n        } \n{code}\n\nbut this is not problem, because isFirstBlockProcessed() checks whether blockInfoSet is empty or not with synchronization correctly. LGTM.
