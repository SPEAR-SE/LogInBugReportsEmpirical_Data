But here the change is, DNs are available more than replication. So, ideally block should get replicated.\nThe problem here is, you have 2 live replicas and in remaining 2 DNs you have partial block present in RBW. So, when NN tries to replicate, DN will reject them saying block already exist in RBW. So, your replication may not happen even though you have more nodes.\n\nHere I think the possible fix could be that, we should change the below condition \n*if (countNodes(b.stored).liveReplicas() >= bc.getReplication()) {*\n\nto something like *if ((countNodes(b.stored).liveReplicas() + countNodes(b.stored).corruptReplicas())  > bc.getReplication()) {*\n\nSo, the extra corrupted blocks(more than replication) will get invalidated and later replication can work normally.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-02T18:04:09.842+0000","updated":"2012-07-02T18:04:09.842+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12596661/comment/13405293","id":"13405293","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Konstantin,\n What is your suggestion on this issue?\nDo you have any alternative idea in your mind?\n\nThanks\nUma","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-02T19:56:30.545+0000","updated":"2012-07-02T19:56:30.545+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12596661/comment/13405404","id":"13405404","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Uma, I think that the RBW replicas on DN3 and DN4 should eventually be transformed into corrupt replicas, because they should have a wrong generation stamp.\nThen you are right it is similar to HDFS-3493.

Ideally having whole cluster filled with corrupt replica and good replicas is a very rare case and almost no possibility in bigger clusters. Worth considering for smaller clusters also.

Now if the number of live replicas are more than minimum required and total replicas (live+corrupt) is more than replication factor, we invalidate the extra corrupt replica(s). Also, if the replica happens to be one that was discarded during a pipeline recovery, this will be invalidated if there are minimum number of live replicas irrespective of total replica count.\n\nHowever, there is one possibility that can result in NN sending replication requests to copy a block to a DN with a write-pipeline-failed-replica. This is if the block is still being written when the reconnected DN sends a block report with an RBW/RWR replica for this block. I discussed this scenario in more detail in HDFS-2932.
