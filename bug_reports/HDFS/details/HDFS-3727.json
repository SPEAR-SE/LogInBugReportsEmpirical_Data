I tested this patch by ensuring that the KSSL principals were commented out when testing checkpointing with SPNEGO, and likewise that the SPNEGO principals were commented out when testing checkpointing with KSSL.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
