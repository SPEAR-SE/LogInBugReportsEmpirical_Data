I wonder though...  Since a default of a wildcard address is permissible if security is off, does this change introduce inconsistent behavior when security is enabled?  Kerberos requires a hostname, so should it just sub in the resolved host name (ex. {{NetUtils.getConnectAddres(addr).getHostName()}}) if the default is a wildcard and security is enabled?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-05-11T17:14:35.237+0000","updated":"2012-05-11T17:14:35.237+0000"}],"maxResults":12,"total":12,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-3395/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i018tj:"}}
