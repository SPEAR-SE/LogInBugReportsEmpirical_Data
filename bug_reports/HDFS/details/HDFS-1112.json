If it is bigger than or equal to the initial buffer size, which is 512K for now, all edit log streams are automatically flushed and synced to disks.\n\nThis proposal does allow edit log buffer to grow beyond the initial buffer size, but the max buffer size is really bounded the max length of an edit log entry. In most cases, I believe that the buffer can grow up to 1M bytes. The advantage of not shrinking the edit log buffer is that it won't cause frequent buffer allocations & deallocations, so avoiding frequent GCs if a large amount of open hits NameNode in a short time.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-04-30T22:29:03.164+0000","updated":"2010-04-30T22:29:03.164+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12463145/comment/12863102","id":"12863102","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"sounds like the best approach!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-05-02T08:36:27.241+0000","updated":"2010-05-02T08:36:27.241+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12463145/comment/12867332","id":"12867332","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"It turns out that the edit output stream for backup NN does not serialize edit logs when an edit log entry is written.
