But i don't see any delete commands logs namenode log files. But namenode added that blocks to invalidateSets and DNs deleted the blocks.\n   When restart of the namenode, it went into safemode and expecting some more blocks to come out of safemode.\n\n   Here the reason could be that, file has been deleted in memory and added into invalidates after this it is trying to sync the edits into editlog file. By that time NN asked DNs to delete that blocks. Now namenode shuts down before persisting to editlogs.( log behind)\n   Due to this reason, we may not get the INFO logs about delete, and when we restart the Namenode (in my scenario it is again switch), Namenode expects this deleted blocks also, as delete request is not persisted into editlog before.\n\n   I reproduced this scenario with bedug points. *I feel, We should not add the blocks to invalidates before persisting into Editlog*. \n\n    Note: for switch, we used kill -9 (force kill)\n\n  I am currently in 0.20.2 version.

However no record of deletion exists in editlog.\n\nWith HDFS-173, the behavior changed to:\n# Delete directory, files and blocks holding the lock. This could trigger the deletion of blocks * if number of blocks is small * at the datanodes\n# Then add editlog entry outside the lock.\n# * New change to * delete the blocks if the number of blocks is large.\n\nNote the part that Uma is talking about is from the step 1.
