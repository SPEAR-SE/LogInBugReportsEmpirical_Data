I still think this is incompatible. Let me know if I understand this correctly.\n\nThis feature was introduced by HDFS-3637 in 2.0.2-alpha and works as follows:\n# Server returns null if dfs.block.access.token.enable is false or dfs.encrypt.data.transfer is false\n# Client methods that use DFSClient#getDataEncryptionKey() check server defaults and calls ClientProtocol#getDataEncryptionKey if dfs.encrypt.data.transfer is set true\n#* These calls hit null pointer exception, if on the server, dfs.block.access.token.enable is false and dfs.encrypt.data.transfer is true. When we fix server, this hits protobuf exception on the client side.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-09T21:16:35.331+0000","updated":"2013-01-09T21:16:35.331+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626701/comment/13549050","id":"13549050","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

Clearly no existing (2.0.2) deployment could be running with such a configuration since HDFS reads/writes would not work. Given that, all existing deployments which are using this feature must have dfs.block.access.token.enable set to true if they have dfs.encrypt.data.transfer set to true. This would mean that, even after this change, all 2.0.2 clients could still communicate with 2.0.3 servers, and vice versa. Hence, this change should not be considered incompatible.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
