The description of HDFS-6353 states the main motivation scenario:\n\nbq. One of the failure patterns I have seen is, in some rare circumstances, due to some inconsistency the secondary or standby fails to consume editlog. The only solution when this happens is to save the namespace at the current active namenode. But sometimes when this happens, unsuspecting admin might end up restarting the namenode, requiring more complicated solution to the problem (such as ignore editlog record that cannot be consumed etc.).\n\nThus the feature aims to prevent users from stopping namenode while the standby/secondary NN failed to checkpoint due to corruption. With new changes in HDFS-7991, if the feature is on, the shell code will exit if the checkpoint fails and the NN will not be stopped.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-30T20:34:34.824+0000","updated":"2015-03-30T20:34:34.824+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12786251/comment/14387431","id":"14387431","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Duping this to HDFS-7991.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2015-03-30T21:22:05.629+0000","updated":"2015-03-30T21:22:05.629+0000"}],"maxResults":7,"total":7,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-8003/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i27gkv:"}}
