For example, let's say that we have a cluster that is running 0.20 release of hadoop. When you restart a datanode, all files in the \"tmp\" directory need to be moved to the real block directory. The reason being that a FileSystem.sync() call demands that data once written to the datanode should persist. Thus, the problem you are seeing is not related to cluster upgrade.\n\n≥these files end up failing block verification and eventually get deleted. But cause incorrect over-replication at the namenode before that.\n\nMaybe we should try to improve the situation here. Is it possible to put the blocks that got moved from \"tmp\" to the real block directory at the head of the block-to-verify list so that their CRC validation occur first? \n\nAnother optimization (that i do not particularly like) is that the client can tell the datanode if the client has invoked FileSystem.sync(). The Datanode can persist this information. At datanode startup time, the Datanode moves only those blocks that were marked as \"synced\" earlier.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2008-11-17T19:23:24.363+0000","updated":"2008-11-17T19:23:24.363+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408551/comment/12648271","id":"12648271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Dhruba, these files are invalid at least on 0.17,  and should not used next restart, no?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-11-17T19:28:40.968+0000","updated":"2008-11-17T19:28:40.968+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408551/comment/12648279","id":"12648279","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Block verification failure was actually a fortunate side effect that detected this bug.

We are trying to cover the following sequence of events:\n# a client starts writing to a block and says sync();\n# the data-node does the write and the sync() and then fails;\n# the data-node restarts and the sync-ed block should appear as a valid block on this node, because the semantic of sync demands the sync-ed data to survive failures of clients, data-nodes and the name-node.\n\nIt seams natural to promote blocks from tmp to the real storage during startup, but this caused problems because together with the sync-ed blocks the data-node also promotes all other potentially incomplete blocks from the tmp.\n\nOne source of incomplete blocks in tmp is the internal block replication initiated by the name-node but not completed on the data-node due to a failure. \n\n(I) The proposal is to divide tmp into 2 directories \n\"blocks_being_replicated\" and \"blocks_being_written\". This excludes partially replicated \nblocks from being promoted to the real storage during data-node restarts.\n\nBut this does not cover another source of incomplete blocks, which is the regular block writing by a client. It also can fail, remain incomplete, and will be promoted to the main storage during data-node restart.\nThe question is why do we not care about these blocks? \nWhy they cannot cause the same problems as the ones that are being replicated?\n\nSuppose I do not use sync-s. The incomplete blocks will still be promoted to the real storage, will be reported to the name-node and the name-node will have to process them and finally remove most of them. Isn't it a degradation in performance.\n\n(II) I'd rather consider dividing into two directories one having \"transient\" and another having \"persistent\" blocks. The transient blocks should be removed during startup, and persistent should be promoted into the real storage. Once sync-ed a block should be moved into the persistent directory.\n\n(III) Another variation is to promote sync-ed (persistent) blocks directly to the main storage. The problem here is to deal with blockReceived and blockReports, which I feel can be solved.\n\n(IV) Yet another approach is to keep the storage structure unchanged and write each sync-ed (finalized) portions of the block into main storage by appending that portion to the real block file. This will require an extra disk io for merging files (instead of renaming) but will let us discard everything that is in tmp as we do now.\n\nWhat we are trying to do with the directories is to assign properties to the block replicas and make them survive crashes. Previously there were just 2 properties final and transient. So we had 2 directories: tmp and main. Now we need a third property, which says the block is persistent but not finalized yet. So we tend to introduce yet another directory. I think this is too straightforward, because there is plenty of other approaches to implement boolean properties on entities.\nWhy we are not considering them?\n\nAlso worth noting this issue directly affects appends, because a replica being appended is first copied to the tmp directory and then treated as described above.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-01-14T21:23:29.663+0000","updated":"2009-01-14T21:23:29.663+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408551/comment/12663958","id":"12663958","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I think the issue that Konstantin is raising is based on the assumption that data that is not \"synced\" by a client *should not* appear in a file.

There were several issues (we actually had a data loss) caused by promoting blocks from tmp to main storage. One of them is HADOOP-4702, which was probably when you were on vacation.\nThe problem was that partial blocks were promoted to the main storage even though they were transient.\nI am arguing that your solution does not eliminate this condition. blocksBeingWritten can still contain transient blocks and they will still be promoted to the main storage. A simple example is when you write a block (without using sync()) and the DN fails in the middle leaving an incomplete (transient) block in blocksBeingWritten directory. This block will be moved to the main storage upon DN restart although it should be treated exactly as the blocks in blocksBeingReplicated directory are, because neither the block nor a part of it was ever finalized.\nDoes it make more sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-01-19T20:54:49.558+0000","updated":"2009-01-19T20:54:49.558+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408551/comment/12665356","id":"12665356","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"In the \"append world\" (i.e 0.19), the semantics that we provide is that data written by a writer may be seen by other readers even if the writer has not invoked \"sync\".

I will run some tests on how much this can add to performance overhead. Will report my findings soon.

From my viewpoint, the system should make every effort to persist this data, rather than saying that \"ok, you did not invoke sync, so you lose your data\". (I remember a discussion with Sameer saying that it would be nice to have every new block allocation at the namenode  be persisted, and persisting the block list at the namenode is useless if the datanode anyways deletes blocks that were not closed).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-01-23T00:09:46.239+0000","updated":"2009-01-23T00:09:46.239+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408551/comment/12666379","id":"12666379","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> Ok, so it is not about correctness, but rather a performance question.\n\nIt is about both.

A bug in the generation-stamp protocol could cause data corruption.\n\nThe alternative is to not promote blocks to the main storage when the datanode restarts. In this case, the data that was written by the client to that datanode is lost. This is data written by an application, and it would be nice if HDFS can make every effort to recover this data instead of deleting it. This is true with most other file systems. For example, if an application writes some data to an ext3 file and then dies before closing/fsync it, the OS/FS does not delete the data that was cached in the OS pages. It makes every effort to persist it. If we can have similar semantics for HDFS, it will be a more powerful system, isn't it? An HDFS application that does not issue a \"fsync\", cannot rely on the fact that all the data it has written will be persisted, but as long as HDFS makes a good effort to keep all the data, that will be nice, isn't it? \n\nSo, this issue all boils down to the tradeoff of having a \"file system that never persists data unless the writer explicitly invoked a fsync\"  verses  \"complexity of the namenode thereby introducing buggy code\". \n\nI can vote for one application that we run inhouse that would definitely like the behaviour where HDFS makes every effort to persist data (rather than invoking sync frequently). HBase can use this feature too (in the future) to recover HBase transactions that lie beyond the sync point (good to have, not a hard requirement).\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-01-28T22:13:33.197+0000","updated":"2009-01-28T22:13:33.197+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408551/comment/12668196","id":"12668196","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"@Raghu.

If on a reboot , the DN\nmoves some blocks from tmp to main (after doing the validations Dhruba suggested), why have them in tmp in the first place?\n\nOne could consider not sending this special BR at all ever.
