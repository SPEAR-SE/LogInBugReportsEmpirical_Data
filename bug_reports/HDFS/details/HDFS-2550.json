I thought that it was a symptom of too many clients against the server (say 16 doing a mix of file read and write, as well as listStatus), but in the past couple of days, I have started getting them all the time, even with only 1 client trying to read.  The Perl client error is:\n\n{noformat}\n$VAR1 = bless( {\n                 'code' => 0,\n                 'message' => 'TSocket: timed out reading 4 bytes from bigwws001:9090'\n               }, 'Thrift::TException' );\n{noformat}\n\nThis typically happens in conjunction with errors in other clients, thus initially leading me to believe that it was really a timeout issue.  But after it started occurring with only 1 client running and well within the 10 sec timeout I had set on the TSocket within my Perl client, I checked on the exceptions in the ThriftFS server log:\n\n{noformat}\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -1\n        at java.lang.String.checkBounds(String.java:397)\n        at java.lang.String.<init>(String.java:442)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.thriftfs.HadoopThriftServer$HadoopThriftHandler.read(HadoopThriftServer.java:307)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.thriftfs.api.ThriftHadoopFileSystem$Processor$read.process(Unknown Source)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.thriftfs.api.ThriftHadoopFileSystem$Processor.process(Unknown Source)\n        at com.facebook.thrift.server.TThreadPoolServer$WorkerProcess.run(Unknown Source)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.runTask(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:886)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:908)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)\n{noformat}\n\n\nThis change seems to have \"solved\" the problem, but this is very much a hack since I do not know the code (maybe throwing an IOException is the right thing to do, and then let it turn into a ThriftIOException?).\n\n{noformat}\n--- src/contrib/thriftfs/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/thriftfs/HadoopThriftServer.java-orig       2011-11-11 09:18:44.000000000 -0600\n+++ src/contrib/thriftfs/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/thriftfs/HadoopThriftServer.java    2011-11-11 09:00:47.000000000 -0600\n@@ -303,8 +303,9 @@\n         }\n         byte[] tmp = new byte[length];\n         int numbytes = in.read(offset, tmp, 0, length);\n-        HadoopThriftHandler.LOG.debug(\"read done: \" + tout.id);\n-        return new String(tmp, 0, numbytes, \"UTF-8\");\n+        HadoopThriftHandler.LOG.debug(\"read done: \" + tout.id +\n+                                     \" numbytes: \" + numbytes);\n+        return new String(tmp, 0, numbytes > 0 ? numbytes : 0, \"UTF-8\");\n       } catch (IOException e) {\n         throw new ThriftIOException(e.getMessage());\n       }\n\n{noformat}\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113924","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"TSocket timed out reading 4 bytes error against HadoopThriftServer from Hadoop-0.20.2 in Perl","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcrickmer","name":"jcrickmer","key":"jcrickmer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Crickmer","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcrickmer","name":"jcrickmer","key":"jcrickmer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Crickmer","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Cloudera Hadoop 0.20.2 distribution running on CentOS 5.5 x64, Java SE 1.6.0_23-b05, Perl 5.14.0","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12531176/comment/13148769","id":"13148769","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
