And I checked that the patch for this bug set access time of directories to \"0\" which remains in latest code.\n\nQuote from HADOOP-1869:\ndhruba borthakur added a comment - 22/Aug/08 07:46\nThis patch does the following:\n1. Implements access time for files. Directories do not have access times.\n2. The access times of files is precise upto an hour boundary. This means that all accesses to a file between 2Pm and 2:59PM will have an access time of 2PM.\n3. The transaction to write access time to edits is not synced. It is assumed that it will get synced as part of other transactions.\n4. There is a configuration parameter to switch off access-times. By default, it is on.\n5. There is a new FileSystem API setAccessTime() to set the access time on a file.\n\nRelease Note of HADOOP-1869:\nAdded HDFS file access times. By default, access times will be precise to the most recent hour boundary. A configuration parameter dfs.access.time.precision (milliseconds) is used to control this precision. Setting a value of 0 will disable persisting access times for HDFS files.\n\nI'm closing this bug.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-15T20:12:56.300+0000","updated":"2014-01-15T20:12:56.300+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688124/comment/13902263","id":"13902263","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5175 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5175/])\nHDFS-5749.
