My proposal is the following:\n- on open(), do not determine the visible length of the file. Set the member variable to something like \"-1\" to indicate it's still unknown\n- in the code that opens a block reader, change it to check if it's about to read from the last block. If it is, try to determine the visible length.\n- in the explicit getVisibleLength() call, if it's not determined yet, try to determine the visible length\n\nWith the above changes, we can allow a client who only wants to access the first blocks of a file to do so without having to contact the DNs holding the last block.
