I know you probably copied-n-pasted, however {{assertTrue(stat == 0)}} is an anti-pattern.  {{assertTrue}} should used to test a real boolean value, not a fabricated boolean within the assert.  This condition needs to be {{assertEquals(0, stat)}}.  The reason is if {{assertTrue}} fails, junit can't report the bad value.  Whereas {{assertEquals}} will report \"I expected *this*, but got *that*\".\n\nIf you feel esp. industrious, you might pay it forward and use a regexp to search and replace the other similar conditions to {{assertEquals}}...
