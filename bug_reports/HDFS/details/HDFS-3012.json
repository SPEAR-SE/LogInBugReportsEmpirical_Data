Two also seems very unlikely because the AnnotatedSecurityInfo class and the config file for the ServiceLoader is in the same jar as SecurityUtils itself.  Found also seems unlikely because the NodeManagers would in theory use the same config and are able to talk to the NN, but this is the most likely culprit.
