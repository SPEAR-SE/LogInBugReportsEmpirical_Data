countDown only after a successful actualGetFromOneDataNode call): since we moved the latch to finaly statement. then once a actualGetFromOneDataNode() failed, we still fire \"latch.countDown();\" , then getFirstToComplete() will pass the \"latch.await\" after that, then goes to \"thorw new InterruptedException\", so in hedgedFetchBlockByteRange(), we will continue to try to do getBestNodeDNAddrPair(), and in the test case, the replica is two and due to the previous failed actualGetFromOneDataNode() so one dn had been added into deadnode list:) so it looks like the loop in hedgedFetchBlockByteRange() is:\n{code}\nwhile(true) {\ngetBestNodeDNAddrPair();\ngetFirstToComplete();\ncatch exception...\n}\n{code}\n\nI'll make a patch soon, thank you [~liulei.cn]

This is a pretty tricky one!  I think the logic is easier to follow now using {{CompletionService}} instead of {{CountDownLatch}}.\n\nI have a few comments and questions.\n\n# {{DFSInputStream#hedgedFetchBlockByteRange}}: I have a question on the following code, which runs when there is no need for a hedged read.  (The initial read completes before the hedged read timeout.)\n{code}\n          future = hedgedService.poll(dfsClient.getHedgedReadTimeout(),\n              TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n          if (future != null) {\n            future.get();\n            return;\n          }\n{code}\nThe return value from {{future.get()}} is discarded, so it appears that we never copy to {{buf}} in this code path.  I only see a copy to {{buf}} inside the else path, when a hedged read actually happens.  Did I miss something?\n# {{DFSHedgedReadMetrics}}: Is it actually useful to add the new metric for HedgedReadOpsLoopNum, or was it just helpful for catching this bug?  If it's not going to be useful in general, then maybe we should look for a different way to accommodate the test rather than publishing a new metric.\n# {{TestPread}}: Let's set {{isHedgedRead = false}} in a JUnit {{After}} method instead of at the end of individual methods.  That way, if one test throws an exception and leaves the flag on by mistake, it won't disrupt the other tests in the same suite.  Also, it seems this was done wrong for {{testMaxOutHedgedReadPool}}, which is setting it to {{true}} at the end.

The problem with publishing a metric is that technically it becomes part of our contract.  If tools start querying the metric (even accidentally), then removing it in a later version is backwards-incompatible.\n\nI'm holding off on committing anyway, because I may have found another problem.  I wanted to suggest removing the {{future.get()}} from here:\n\n{code}\n          if (future != null) {\n            future.get();\n            return;\n          }\n{code}\n\n{{CompletionService#poll}} guarantees that the returned task (if not null) has completed.  We don't need the result of the task, so the {{get}} should be unnecessary.  However, when I remove that line, I start getting a test failure in {{TestPread#testPreadDFS}}:\n\n{code}\ntestPreadDFS(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestPread)  Time elapsed: 2.127 sec  <<< FAILURE!\njava.lang.AssertionError: Pread Datanode Restart Test byte 0 differs. expected 47 actual 0 expected:<0> but was:<47>\n\tat org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)\n\tat org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:743)\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:118)\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:555)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestPread.checkAndEraseData(TestPread.java:92)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestPread.datanodeRestartTest(TestPread.java:225)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestPread.dfsPreadTest(TestPread.java:439)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestPread.testPreadDFS(TestPread.java:250)\n{code}\n\nI've isolated the problem to 2 tests running in sequence: {{testMaxOutHedgedReadPool}} followed by {{testPreadDFS}}.  Removing {{future.get()}} shouldn't make a difference, so this might indicate a race condition that had been masked by the {{future.get()}} taking up a few extra cycles.  Something about the way {{testMaxOutHedgedReadPool}} fills the thread pool seems to set up the timing conditions just right to trigger the test failure.\n\nI'm not yet certain what's causing this, but I have a theory.  The return value of {{getFromOneDataNode}} gets submitted as a {{Future}}.  As you pointed out, that code mutates the buffer that was passed in.  If we've already returned to the caller, and then a background task lands late and starts mutating the buffer, then we could see unexpected results.  We do cancel the unstarted tasks, but we don't interrupt them if they're already running.  Even if we did interrupt them, I don't think we could guarantee interruption before it mutates the buffer.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this.
