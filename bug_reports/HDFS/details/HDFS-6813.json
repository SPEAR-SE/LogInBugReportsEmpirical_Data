What do you think?\n{quote}\nI opened a new JIRA HADOOP-10938 for javadoc. Let's discuss with [~stevel@apache.org] and other guys together to see what thread safety mode we want. Then we can decide whether to modify the javadoc or make implementations thread-safe.

We need to synchronize few object variables like {{failures}}, we can define local variable to resolve this problem.\n   If Pread doesn't access object variable, then it's thread-safe and we don't need to synchronize it with other Ops like read, seek.\n* If we leave the synchronization to user applications, then read and pread *cannot* be concurrent.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi
