Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hey Charles, thanks for working on this. I had a few review comments:\n\n* I see you did some cleanup in XAttrCommands. I think we need to move the {{out.println(header)}} in the first if statement up by one line. We should still print the header as long as the file exists, even if it doesn't have any xattrs.\n* There are a couple issues with the exception logic in FSNamesystem. One is if the user asks for an xattr in either an unknown or disallowed namespace. Another is if the user asks for multiple xattrs and one of them is not present. The filtering makes sense for the {{getAll}} case, but for the other case, we need to throw if a specifically requested xattr is not available or present.\n* We could actually do the bulk of this testing in the Java API, since the shell sets the error code on an exception. The Java API is better since it's faster, more concise, and lets us more easily verify expected exceptions and return values. We could have a short sanity test with the shell, but it can't handle things like requesting multiple xattrs right now.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-16T23:53:21.022+0000","updated":"2014-05-16T23:53:21.022+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12714887/comment/14002504","id":"14002504","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clamb","name":"clamb","key":"clamb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Charles Lamb","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"[~andrew.wang] and I discussed this offline.

It'll bubble all the way up.\n* FSNamesystem, for the comments, would \"EXECUTE on the\" and \"WRITE on the\" read better?\n\nFSN#getXAttrs\n* We might be able to get rid of {{filteredXAttrs}} since it looks like it's just {{xAttrs}} now. It's somewhat misnamed now too, since the provided list is no longer filtered by the PermissionFilter, it's checked.\n* We shouldn't shortcut out if {{filteredXAttrs.isEmpty()}}, this didn't really make sense in the first place since an exception should be thrown if you don't have access to the path even if all your xattrs are filtered out. This should be moved down to the {{else}} block after the permission checks.\n* Line over 80 chars.\n* When would {{toGet.size()}} be zero? I ask because I'd rather just inline the Exception message than making it a constant. I think Java does the right thing automatically, so there's no efficiency gain by pulling it out.\n\nTests:\n* s/doSetXattr/doSetXAttr/. This function also moved in the diff for some reason.\n* TestDFSShell, Not sure what's going on here, the diff is hard to read. Was removing testSetXAttrPermissionAsDifferentOwner intentional?\n* If my comment about the incorrect shortcut is correct, it'd be good to have tests on a no-permission and/or non-existent path to make sure that these always throw an exception.\n* I believe that the permission type is called \"search\" not \"scan\".

Example first call may succeed internally but restarted/disconnected, in that case idempotent API will be retried from client. So, next call may fail as it was already removed.

Please handle only specific exceptions. If it throws unexpected exception let it throwout, we need not assert and throw.\n\nAll of this is due to WebHDFS throwing a different exception from the regular path. WebHDFS throws a RemoteException which wraps a HadoopIllegalArgumentException. In other words, the WebHDFS client does not unwrap the exception. You'll see in the diff that I've changed the exception handling to catch both RemoteException and HadoopIllegalArgumentException. In the former case, I check to see that the underlying exception is a HIAE.\n\nXattrNameParam.java:\n\n{code}\n    private static Domain DOMAIN = new Domain(NAME,\n    +      Pattern.compile(\".*\"));\n{code}\n\nbq.

So, how about validating pattern? Please check with Andrew as well what he says. But I have no strong feeling on that. It is a suggestion.\n\nI understand your concern. The problem is that WebHDFS would then be doing client side checking and the exception would be generated and thrown from two different places. We wanted to unify all of the xattr Namespace checking into one place on the server side so that there would only be one place where the exception would be generated. I talked to Andrew and he's ok with leaving it like it is in the patch.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clamb","name":"clamb","key":"clamb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Charles Lamb","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-07-21T21:00:38.205+0000","updated":"2014-07-21T21:00:38.205+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12714887/comment/14069544","id":"14069544","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
