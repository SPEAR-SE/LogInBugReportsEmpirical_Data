Overall looks good.\n* The new constructor may be confusing - an inet addr and the namenode objects? Rather than the if statement in the new constructor, it may be better to have two constructors, one that takes an Inet addr, and one that takes the NNs directly.  To avoid duplicating code, it would be necessary to not make the ClientProtocol instances final. I tried playing around with nested private/public constructors to avoid the code duplication and was surprised I couldn't get away with it.\n* Is there any other use case for the new constructor other than testing? If not, it may be good to note the ctor is used for testing in the comments.\n* We try to stay within the 80 column limit generally, even if it means weird wrapping.\n* There is commented-out code in TestDFSClientRertries import section that should be removed.\n* I like the mock namenode. For its empty methods, it would be better to either add a comment in each that it's not needed, or to group all together with a preceding comment to that effect and provide really empty bodies {} (perhaps on the same line).  Better for readability and gets the point across more clearly.  Another option would be to throw unsupportedOperationExcetion, but that's probably overkill.\n* It's better to use this format for the logger:   {noformat}public static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(CLASS.class.getName());{noformat} rather than specifying the clas name in a string, so that if the class is refactored or changed, the logging statement doesn't need to be updated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jghoman","name":"jghoman","key":"jghoman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318"},"displayName":"Jakob Homan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-07-29T19:56:51.101+0000","updated":"2009-07-29T19:56:51.101+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12419551/comment/12736865","id":"12736865","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jghoman","name":"jghoman","key":"jghoman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318"},"displayName":"Jakob Homan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Talked with Bill and he points out the Namenode field in question is public, which is a mistake and should be fixed with this patch, since we're in that neck of the code woods anyway.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jghoman","name":"jghoman","key":"jghoman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318"},"displayName":"Jakob Homan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-07-29T22:08:34.006+0000","updated":"2009-07-29T22:08:34.006+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12419551/comment/12736939","id":"12736939","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zeller","name":"zeller","key":"zeller","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bill Zeller","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I addressed the six bullet points in Jakob's comment above and also made the namenode field private in DFSClient.
