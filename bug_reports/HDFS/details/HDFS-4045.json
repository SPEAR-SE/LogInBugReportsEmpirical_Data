Instead, UnsupportedOperationException is probably to be preferred. This is in a few places. Should we also add TODOs here?\n----\n\nTests:\n\n- The two test cases are identical except that one of them has both a local edits dir and a QJM configured, whereas the second has only QJM, right? Instead of duplicating all the code, can you make them both call through to a method with a {{boolean alsoIncludeLocalEdits}} or something? That would make it much easier to tell the difference between the two cases, and cleaner code.\n\n- Also, can you add some assertions that a new checkpoint is actually uploaded by the 2NN to the NN? ie that it successfully checkpointed something instead of being a no-op?\n\n----\nNits:\n\n- A bunch of changes in TestFileJournalManager don't seem to be necessary for this patch: why switch out FileJournalManager for JournalManager?\n- Why is the test called TestSnapshotWithQJM? It probably should be TestCheckpointWithQJM -- otherwise it looks related to HDFS Snapshots\n- Some indentation is off in testSecondaryCheckpoint\n- the new startSecondaryNameNode function in TestNNWithQJM doesn't seem to be used. There are also some new unused imports. In general, please try to review the patch files so that they only make the minimum changes to fix the issue at hand.\n- {{getStreamServer}} seems to share most of its code with {{getFileServer}}. Can you refactor them to share code? I'd also pick a different name, like {{copyInputStreamToResponse}} or {{streamServletOutput}} or something since {{get*}} should be reserved for functions that return a value.\n\n----\nGeneral thought:\nI'm not wild about exposing the underlying input stream via {{getInputStream}}, for a few reasons:\n\n1) It means that we don't get the benefit of the RedundantInputStream stuff that Colin did -- if there's an error in the middle of serving a stream, we won't fail over to another option.\n2) It seems like the {{serveEdits}} API that you added to JournalManager overlaps quite a bit with {{getInputStream}}.\n\nInstead, what about adding only {{serveEdits}}, and adding {{getInputStream}} as necessary to the JM-specific subclasses of EditLogInputStream where appropriate? This makes more sense because, for example in the case of QJM, we could have serveEdits issue a 302 redirect to one of the JournalNodes and avoid the 'proxying' through the NN. It also maintains the abstraction of EditLogInputStream only being an iterator for edit log ops, and not a bytewise interface.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-10-29T23:45:38.451+0000","updated":"2012-10-29T23:45:38.451+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12611490/comment/13488246","id":"13488246","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Unfortunately, I can't think of a good way to get the benefits of {{RedundantEditLogInputStream}} without using its intended interface-- {{readOp}}.\n\nIf you do choose to violate the abstraction, it would be best to do so by creating FileInputStream objects for the underlying edit log files, when appropriate.  Then just read directly from the files.  You'll still have a hard time dealing with IOExceptions in the middle of reading the file.  It wouldn't be *too* hard to do that failover yourself, but you run into sticky situations.  What if you get an IOExecption, fail over to the next file, and then discover that it's actually fairly different from the first one?  You might have sent bytes over the wire that completely fail the edit log operation checksums.\n\nI think it's best to punt on the issue of zero-copy {{serveEdits}} for now.  Maybe open up a follow-up JIRA for that.  Just do the simple thing of streaming it for now.  I also wonder whether serveEdits should serve a range of edits, rather than discrete edit log segments?  The API feels very segment-oriented, and I thought we were trying to get away from that when possible.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"{{EditLogFileOutputStream#EditLogServletOutputStream}}: I don't think that a servlet output stream \"is-a\" file output stream.  There's just so many things that the base class does that don't make sense at all in the derived class.    Like what does it mean to preallocate space in a servlet output stream?  What  does it mean to fsync a servlet output stream?  It's meaningless.  I think you'll find that if you create {{EditLogServletOutputStream}} as a top-level class, you will share little, if any, code with {{EditLogFileOutputStream}}.  It's usually better to favor composition over inheritance, and here is a great example of why.\n\nFor the benefit of people reading this, we had a short discussion outside of this JIRA where we basically concluded that we needed to expose the raw bytes of the opcodes.  The reasoning was that in some cases, the FSEditLog processes opcodes differently depending on the version of the edit log.  Since {{FSEditLogOp#writeFields}} can only serialize the opcode to the latest version, serialization followed by deserialization would thus change the semantics of the opcode.\n\nThe problem with this is that in a lot of cases, \"the raw bytes\" doesn't have a very well-defined meaning.  What should {{getRawHeader}} return for {{RedundantEditLogInputStream}}?  Just picking the header of the current stream is not really correct.  I think that if we are going to do this, we should at least make sure that the header is the same for every stream managed by the {{RedundantEditLogInputStream}}.  As far as I can see, this should be true anyway.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

I generally think this approach is better than the first. Here are some more specific comments:\n\n- I agree with Colin above that EditLogServletOutputStream doesn't seems like it should inherit from EditLogFileOutputStream. There's no need to double-buffer in this case, so it really reuses very little of its superclass. Instead, I think you could just operate directly on the ServletOutputStream itself, pushing the raw bytes directly to the output. This means you also wouldn't need the new {{writeRaw(FSEditLogOp)}} API -- that API doesn't make a lot of sense to me either, since it seems kind of like a contradiction in terms.\n- Instead of the trick in {{decodeOp()}} where you mark/reset/re-read to get the raw bytes, did you consider adding a {{readRawOp()}} API? I agree conceptually with Colin that the EditLogInputStream is a stream of operations, but if the API were still \"give me the raw bytes corresponding to the next op\", that doesn't seem to break the abstraction as much as the previously proposed API which had {{getInputStream}} in it.\n\nWith the above, serveEdits could be implemented something like:\n{code}\nos = response.getOutputStream();\nbyte[] op;\nwhile ((op = es.readOpRaw()) != null) {\n  os.write(op, 0, op.length);\n}\n{code}\n\n(assuming that the \"readOpRaw\" includes both the txid and the checksum.\n\nEven if the second suggestion above doesn't work out, I think avoiding the EditLogServletOutputStream would make the code a little cleaner as well.\n\nColin, any thoughts on this?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-11-30T01:48:29.759+0000","updated":"2012-11-30T01:48:29.759+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12611490/comment/13508993","id":"13508993","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

This seems like a viable alternative approach to {{readOpRaw}}, though it's unfortunate that it adds some overhead to the regular loading path.  I would not make this field protected, though-- perhaps make it private and add an accessor.

The parsing code in FSEditLogOp makes it remarkably difficult to do anything other than parse the Ops using the expected codepath.

It does so by calling readOp in a loop, and noticing the decoded opcode sizes.  Then it just pulls the bytes from the stream itself.\n\nI think this is nicer because it doesn't burden the main opcode loading path with the need to re-read every byte twice or create an array with all the opcode bytes each time.  Calculating the remaining bytes before the limit is really cheap, just a subtraction.  {{decodeRawOp}} still does re-read everything twice, but this only affects that one code path, not all of them.  For extra efficiency, decodeRawOp could just fill an array you pass, rather than creating a lot of garbage all the time.
