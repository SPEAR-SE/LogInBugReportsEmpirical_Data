I think it's actually a little more complicated than we originally though. Liaowenrui's proposed fix has a couple problems I didn't think about at first glance:\n\n- The SocketIOWithTimeout code is supposed to \"act like\" the normal Java Socket stuff. The normal Socket code does throw SocketTimeoutException on timeout to connect, and ConnectException explicitly means that the connect call failed. Changing NetUtils.connect could cause issues for other users downstream such as HBase as well.\n- In {{Client.setupConnection}} we are explicitly treating the SocketTimeoutException differently than IOException -- it retries up to 45 times by default for non-HA. Changing connect to throw ConnectException would break this code and make the ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts config meaningless.\n\nIn the HA case, the HDFS {{ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider}} resets that configuration before constructing the proxy. It sets it to the value of dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts, default 0 (see HDFS-2682). Judging by the description of that JIRA, it looks like it used to fallback to the retry policy provider, which would cause a failover (Uma mentions \"rethrow the exception to RetryPolicy\"). Looking back on the history of Connection.java, it seems like HDFS-3504 rejiggered some of this code and might have broken the behavior.\n\n\nRegardless, now that I have looked into it a bit more, I think it may be OK to skip for 2.0.3. It's certainly a bug, but in practice I don't think we see this much, because almost all use cases involve doing one or more read-only (idempotent) ops before doing any non-idempotent ones.

Timeout on connect is one case where we failed before sending, but it's also possible that we'd get some kind of timeout during SASL negotiation, etc. For example, if one of the two NNs has lost contact with the KDC and won't authenticate people, we still want to failoer.\n\nSo, we'd like some more generic way to pass along the call status in the response beyond just making connect() timeouts throw ConnectException.\n\nThis is tough to do, since the only way we can pass back information from the IPC.Client layer to the FailoverProxyProvider is via an exception, and critically, by making a new exception class which has the requisite info. The problem with making a new class, though, is that any callers who were depending on IPC calls throwing particular IOException subclasses like SocketTimeoutException or ConnectException will get broken (since they'd now end up with something like an IpcTransportException).\n\nWe could handle the current specific case of timeout-on-connect by making a subclass of SocketTimeoutException like ConnectTimeoutException, and throw that. This would be compatible but not a complete solution. A more radical change would be to make a new IOException subclass like IpcTransportException, which is thrown for any case where the transport layer had a problem, with various subclasses for the different cases. This would be a bit difficult since it would be user-visible.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-01-17T00:46:38.494+0000","updated":"2013-01-17T00:46:38.494+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627562/comment/13555721","id":"13555721","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Here's a kind of crappy patch which does something like the above -- makes NetUtils.connect throw ConnectTimeoutException (subclass of SocketTimeoutException) on timeout.

I might have missed this part of the discussion - is there a reason to introduce ConnectTimeoutException and not just use SocketTimeoutException?\n\nYes, we need some way to communicate to the FailoverProxyProvider whether it was a failure to connect or a timeout in reading the response. In the current code, SocketTimeoutException is thrown in either case, so the layer which does failover can't know whether or not the call might have been invoked.\n\nbq. wrapWithMessage() is a good change. Is that necessary in this jira? I am okay if you want to include it.\n\nPer above, it's necessary because, now that we construct a subclass of SocketTimeoutException, it would have caused wrapWithException to convert it back to the superclass -- the exception is still instanceof SocketTimeoutException, so the rethrow wouldn't preserve the right class. The new rethrow method preserves the right class.\n\nbq. Minor - optionally some empty line changes could be removed\nYep, will fix that as well as add a unit test if folks agree on the change. Will also address Uma's feedback above. Do people agree this is an OK approach? Does anyone have a better way of solving it?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-01-17T19:24:27.216+0000","updated":"2013-01-17T19:24:27.216+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627562/comment/13558468","id":"13558468","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ewenpower","name":"ewenpower","key":"ewenpower","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"liaowenrui","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"thanks Todd!you are very good!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ewenpower","name":"ewenpower","key":"ewenpower","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"liaowenrui","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2013-01-21T00:53:27.745+0000","updated":"2013-01-21T00:53:27.745+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627562/comment/13569123","id":"13569123","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Attached patch adds a unit test and addresses some of the feedback above.\n\nUma -- I didn't change the \"Local Exception\" wrapping case to use the new code, since that would be a behavioral change which I think is outside the scope of this bug fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-02-01T21:40:45.321+0000","updated":"2013-02-01T21:40:45.321+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627562/comment/13569265","id":"13569265","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
