Basically, the problem is that this operation:\n\n{code}\nopen(\"/mnt/fuse-dfs/t\", O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_WRONLY, 0644);\n{code}\n\ngets translated into this sequence of fuse-dfs calls:\n\n{code}\nTRACE open /t\nTRACE truncate /t\nTRACE unlink /t\nTRACE getattr /t\nTRACE flush /t\nTRACE release /t\n{code}\n\n(I'm assuming that another open would have followed if our unlink hadn't returned an error.)\n\nThere are a few different quality-of-implementation issues here:\n* hdfs doesn't react too well to unlink of a file while it's open, which we're doing here\n* truncate tries to do ts own create + close cycle in the middle, which basically means that we're trying to open a file for write while it's already open-- not good.\n\n{{FUSE_CAP_ATOMIC_O_TRUNC}} could help stop fuse from translating open into SO MANY complicated fuse operations.  However, it's not supported for all kernel versions (I think definitely not on CentOS 5, for example.)  There are a bunch of hacks we could do to \"fix\" this on older kernels, but they won't be easy.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

I have thought about it and there are no really good choices.  Basically, it boils down to HDFS not supporting random writes.  We could implement some kind of caching layer that simulated random writes in fuse-dfs, but it would be complex.  The performance would also be pretty poor.\n\nWe could be a little bit more clever about when we actually open the HDFS file.  For example, we could convert {{fd = open(O_WRONLY) ; ftruncate(fd, 0)}} to a {{create(overwrite = true)}}.  That only solves one particular case, though.\n\nI felt like this particular change was worth doing because it's a small change which simplifies things.  If we were going to write a caching layer we'd want to have a design discussion first.\n\nbq. I think we should just #error...\n\nWe have to support RHEL5, for a little while longer at least.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

At that point it returns an error. So it seems strictly better than what you proposed (returning error immediately.)\n\nI didn't propose anything!  I said \"let's do APPEND for now, with the understanding that while it fixes the high-order-bit of our current semantic brokenness, it probably causes new breakage somewhere further down the line\".  I don't know what the right answer is, I'm just fairly sure this isn't 100% right.  But moving from our current 10% right to 50% right is an improvement, so let's do it.\n\nI suspect I was unclear when I said \"we should error out when the user asks for semantics that we can't support\".  You seem to have read that as \"error out immediately\", I didn't mean that.  I meant that we should implement as much of the semantics as we can, and error out when we can't.  The right moment to return error will depend on the specifics of a given scenario.\n\nMy whole point here is that this specific change, adding APPEND to a flags word when the user didn't ask for APPEND, is probably neither required nor sufficient nor even entirely accurate.  So it will probably get backed out at some point when we have implemented things more fully.  And that is fine.  Let's do the thing that gets a few important things working, right now, and make more progress in the future.\n\nAnyways, +1 to the patch once the comments get updated to point to the JIRAs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-08T22:09:55.063+0000","updated":"2012-11-08T22:09:55.063+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12614438/comment/13493668","id":"13493668","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
