There is no way for the daemon to close the broken streams so the files can't be removed from the lease.  So the daemon opens new logs and chugs along.  Since it's busy writing to at least one file in its lease, the lease won't expire, so the renamed files remain locked \"forever\".\n\nActually, come to think of it, isn't the issue in HDFS-4258 much more simply fixed by releasing the leases?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-24T23:26:05.703+0000","updated":"2013-01-24T23:26:05.703+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12629126/comment/13562187","id":"13562187","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandonli","name":"brandonli","key":"brandonli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brandon Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"If renaming revokes a lease, a client might be able to write to a file immediately by:\n1. rename it\n2. rename it back\n3. write to it\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandonli","name":"brandonli","key":"brandonli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brandon Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-25T00:19:18.319+0000","updated":"2013-01-25T00:19:18.319+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12629126/comment/13562739","id":"13562739","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I'm not a lease expert, but how could that happen?
