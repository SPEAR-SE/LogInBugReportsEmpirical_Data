This can be when the datanode is running du, and it can also be when it is performing a checkDirs(). Both of these operations currently scan all directories in the block pool and that's very expensive in the new layout.\n\nThe new layout creates 256 subdirs, each with 256 subdirs. Essentially 64K leaf directories where block files are placed.\n\nSo, what we have on disk is:\n- 256 inodes for the first level directories\n- 256 directory blocks for the first level directories\n- 256*256 inodes for the second level directories\n- 256*256 directory blocks for the second level directories\n- Then the inodes and blocks to store the the HDFS blocks themselves.\n\nThe main problem is the 256*256 directory blocks. \n\ninodes and dentries will be cached by linux and one can configure how likely the system is to prune those entries (vfs_cache_pressure). However, ext4 relies on the buffer cache to cache the directory blocks and I'm not aware of any way to tell linux to favor buffer cache pages (even if it did I'm not sure I would want it to in general).\n\nAlso, ext4 tries hard to spread directories evenly across the entire volume, this basically means the 64K directory blocks are probably randomly spread across the entire disk. A du type scan will look at directories one at a time, so the ioscheduler can't optimize the corresponding seeks, meaning the seeks will be random and far. \n\nIn a system I was using to diagnose this, I had 60K blocks. A DU when things are hot is less than 1 second. When things are cold, about 20 minutes.\n\nHow do things get cold?\n- A large set of tasks run on the node. This pushes almost all of the buffer cache out, causing the next DU to hit this situation. We are seeing cases where a large job can cause a seek storm across the entire cluster.\n\nWhy didn't the previous layout see this?\n- It might have but it wasn't nearly as pronounced. The previous layout would be a few hundred directory blocks. Even when completely cold, these would only take a few a hundred seeks which would mean single digit seconds.  \n- With only a few hundred directories, the odds of the directory blocks getting modified is quite high, this keeps those blocks hot and much less likely to be evicted.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12329057","id":"12329057","description":"2.8.0

This would also be a somewhat complex change since we'd have to put the sharding into the VERSION file so that the DN could figure out where to look for blocks.  Also, this would obviously be a DN layout version change.\n\nIn the long term, I think doing a full du is going to get more and more expensive over time as our data volumes continue to increase and the amount of cold data increases.  We shouldn't be assuming this is an operation we can do synchronously or quickly.  We should be rate-limiting our calls to checkDirs so that we don't swamp the actual workload on the cluster.  Currently, we also kick off a du on all hard drives if we spot an error on just one hard drive-- this is a behavior we should fix, because it doesn't really make sense.

A consistent hash to minimize renames, plus some logic that knows how to look in two places (old hash, new hash), seems like it might work.

I forgot to mention that I'm pretty confident it's not the inodes, but rather the directory blocks. inodes have their own cache that I can control with vfs_cache_pressure. directory blocks however are just cached via the buffer cache (afaik), and the buffer cache is much more difficult to have any control over.\n\nI'm having trouble understanding these kernel settings. http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Linux_Kernel_Tuning says that  \"When vfs_cache_pressure=0, the kernel will never reclaim dentries and inodes due to memory pressure and this can easily lead to out-of-memory conditions. Increasing vfs_cache_pressure beyond 100 causes the kernel to prefer to reclaim dentries and inodes.\"  So that would seem to indicate that vfs_cache_pressure does have control over dentries (i.e. the \"directory blocks\" which contain the list of child inodes).  What settings have you used for {{vfs_cache_pressure}} so far?\n\nbq. I'm wondering if we shouldn't move to a hashing scheme that is more dynamic and grows/shrinks based on the number of blocks in the volume...\n\nThe problem that we have is that we have a tension between two things:\n* If directories get too big, the readdir() needed to find the genstamp file of each block file gets very expensive.\n* If directories get too small, they tend to drop out of the cache since they are rarely accessed.\n\nI think if we're going to change the on-disk layout format again, we should change the way we name meta files.  Currently, we encode the genstamp in the file name, like {{blk_1073741915_1091.meta}}.  This means that to look up the meta file for block {{1073741915}}, we have to iterate through every file in the subdirectory until we find it.  Instead, we could simply name the meta file as {{blk_107374191.meta}} and put the genstamp number in the meta file header.  This would allow us to move to a scheme which had a very large number of blocks in each directory (perhaps a simple 1-level hashing scheme) and the dentries would always be \"hot\".  ext4 and other modern Linux filesystems deal very effectively with large directories-- it's only ext2 and ext3 without certain options enabled that had problems.\n\nSince a layout version change is such a heavy hammer, though, I wonder if there's some simple tweak we can make that will avoid this issue.  Have you tried using xfs instead of ext4?  Perhaps it handles caching differently.  I think at some point we should pull out systemtap or LTTng and really find out what specifically is falling out of the cache and why.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Don't we already keep track of the genstamp we discovered during startup? If so, it seems like a simple stat is sufficient.\n\nThat's a fair point.  There are a lot of cases where we don't scan the directory because we have cached the genstamp value.  This corresponds to calls to {{FsDatasetUtil#getMetaFile}}.  However, there are a few other cases like {{DataNode#transferReplicaForPipelineRecovery}} and {{VolumeScanner#scanBlock}} which do end up calling {{FsDatasetUtil#findMetaFile}}.  If we moved to really big directories, we might need to somehow avoid all of those cases.\n\nbq.

I guess that information might be tough to get, since you'd have to reformat everything.\n\nIf you want to experiment with changing the HDFS sharding, you should be able to just change {{DatanodeUtil#idToBlockDir}}.

McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The motivation behind the new layout was to eventually free the DataNode of the need to keep all block metadata in memory at all times.  Basically, we are entering a world where hard drive storage capacities double every year, but CPU and network increase at a relatively slower pace.  So keeping around information about every replica permanently paged into memory looks antiquated.  The new layout lets us avoid this by being able to find any block just based on its ID.  It is basically the equivalent of paged metadata, but for the DN.\n\nWe didn't think about the \"du problem\" when discussing the new layout.  It looks like HDFS ends up running a du on all of the replica files quite a lot.  It's something we do after every I/O error, and also something we do on startup.  I think it's pretty silly that we run du after every I/O error-- we could certainly change that-- and the fact that it's not rate-limited is even worse.  We don't even confine the \"du\" to the drive where the I/O error occurred, but do it on every drive... I don't think anyone can give a good reason for that and it should certainly be changed as well.\n\nThe startup issue is more difficult to avoid.  If we have to do a \"du\" on all files during startup, then it could cause very long startup times if that involves a lot of seeks.  It seems like both the old and the new layout would have major problems with this scenario-- if you look out a year or two and multiply the current number of replicas by 8 or 16.\n\nIf we are going to bump layout version again we might want to consider something like keeping the replica metadata in leveldb.  This would avoid the need to do a \"du\" on startup and allow us to control our own caching.  It could also cut the number of ext4 files in half since we wouldn't need {{meta}} any more.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

I performed 4 tests with setups varying the number of namespaces and block density. Hopefully these tests give a feeling for the startup performance improvement with the 32x32 layout in the worst case scenario where the dentries for the directory structure have fallen out of the cache. This could happen, for example, after a hard reboot of the data node (i.e. rolling restart due to OS upgrade). During the tests I also used iostat to verify that there was indeed a large amount of disk I/O (reads) happening during the long startup times with the 256x256 layout. This is presumably the persisted information needed for all of the dentries.\n\nI have also set up a test to verify the scenario where scans over the finalized directory structure (i.e. du, find or other commands) could impact the IO performance of user level containers running on the machine. I do not see a meaningful performance impact to user level jobs on our test clusters with the 32x32 layout. I am continuing to monitor this closely as we roll this out to more and more clusters.\n\nLet me know if there is any other specific performance data that you would like to see.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ctrezzo","name":"ctrezzo","key":"ctrezzo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Trezzo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-19T18:22:19.391+0000","updated":"2015-11-19T18:22:19.391+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845740/comment/15014463","id":"15014463","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks [~ctrezzo] for the patch!

I suppose with 32x32 there is no need to remove unused subdirectories, which is nice.\n\nWhen using sequential block IDs, after about 16777216 (16 million) blocks have been created, we'll be in the case you described where all directories are created in the 256x256 layout.  I guess this is more likely to happen when blocks are created and destroyed rapidly than if they linger for a long time.  It is interesting that having the directories present but empty consumes so much time.\n\nIn the section on \"upgrade testing\": how long did these upgrades take in the 0.5 million, 1.2 million, and 2.7 million block cases?  Perhaps we should parallelize the upgrade process between multiple directories like we talked about in the past, to minimize this time.  Or perhaps this change needs a full (non-rolling) upgrade, and hence should go only in trunk?\n\nI am +1 for this in trunk if a unit test is added.

From that perspective, I would be happy if this patch simply made it into the next branch-2 minor release.\n\nOn the other hand, if I have my community hat on, I am wondering how many hadoop users would want this patch and, if that group is large enough, what is the best way to get the patch to them on a stable release.\n\n1. How many people would want this patch?: I think this will affect all hadoop clusters that have seen over 16 million blocks written to the entire cluster over its lifespan and are running ext4. As a reminder, data node startup time and potentially IO perf of user level containers will start to degrade before this point (as the directory structure grows, the impact becomes greater). I would say that most large hadoop users fall into this category. My guess is that a non-trivial number of production hadoop clusters for medium size users would fall into this category as well. [~andrew.wang] I am sure you would have a better sense for how many production clusters this would affect.\n\n2. How do we get this patch out to users on a stable release?: I definitely understand the desire to avoid a layout change as part of a maintenance release, but I also think it would be nice to have a stable release that users could deploy with this patch. Here is one potential solution:\n* Since 2.8 is cut but not released, rename the 2.8 branch to 2.9 and continue with the release schedule it is currently on.\n* Cut a new 2.8 branch off of 2.7.3 and apply this patch to this \"new\" 2.8.\n* Going forward:\n** People that are adverse to making the layout change can continue doing maintenance releases on the 2.7 line. My guess is that this is a small group and that the 2.7 branch will essentially die.\n** Maintenance releases can continue on the new 2.8 branch as they would have for the 2.7 branch. People that were on 2.7 should be able to easily move to 2.8 because it is essentially a maintenance release plus the new layout.\n* I would say that there is no need to back-port the layout change to the 2.6 branch if we have a stable 2.8 that users can upgrade to.\n\nWith this scenario we get a stable release with the new layout (i.e. the new 2.8 branch) and we avoid making a layout change in a maintenance release.

I think it'd be very surprising to 2.6.2 users that 2.6.3 will do an upgrade. Our upstream compat guidelines leave this up in the air, but there's some expectation of being able to downgrade between maintenance releases, e.g. just swapping JARs back and forth.\n\nI've also only seen one or two upgrade issues caused by the 256x256 layout, and a good chunk of Cloudera users are on it now. So there's a threshold where this kicks in which most Cloudera users aren't hitting.

To echo [~kihwal]:\n\nI did not explicitly test a layout that had 64x64 or 128x128. That being said, with 32x32 each blockpool on each disk has 1024 directories which allows a data node to host a large number of blocks. Here is a table with some simple calculations on the number of local files per directory given different configurations (note: the directory distribution will change based on how block ids are distributed between data nodes):\n\n||Number of blockpools||Number of disks||Number of HDFS blocks per datanode||Number of data sub-directories per datanode||Number of local files per datanode||Number of local files per directory||\n|1|1|1 million|1,024|2 million|1953|\n|1|6|1 million|6,144|2 million|325|\n|1|12|1 million|12,288|2 million|162|\n|1|12|13 million|12,288|26 million|2115|\n|3|12|1 million|36,864|2 million|54|\n|3|12|13 million|36,864|26 million|705|\n\nMy understanding is that ext4 should be fine in the low thousands of files per directory range. This layout should be able to easily scale. I think we will run into other problems before directory density becomes an issue. If we go to 64x64, the number of directories starts to get a little scary in the federation case. Consider 3 block pools and 12 disks would give you 147,456 data sub-directories per datanode.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ctrezzo","name":"ctrezzo","key":"ctrezzo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris

To be clear, this new layout uses all of the same code paths as the first block-id based layout, the only change is the number of directories. It should support the same mechanisms that the previous layout supported.
