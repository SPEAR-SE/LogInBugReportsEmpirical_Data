Not to mention the subtle bugs that might crop up.  That alone would almost be worth its own patch.  Let's deal with this later if we decide it's something worth doing.  Frankly, I would argue against it because I think there's better APIs we could design.  In particular, an API which separates the concept of a stream from the concept of a stream location is much more efficient and results in cleaner code, because the invariant that you can't use something without initializing it is then enforced by the type system.  So basically, can we revisit this idea later, as in after this week?\n\nbq. The new test case is missing the @Test annotation so it won't run.\n\nWill fix.\n\nbq.

In EditLogFileInputStream#init why only close the stream that threw?\n\nYeah, I guess closing an already closed stream should be idempotent, at least if they're correctly implementing the Closable interface.\n\nbq. In TestEditLog readAllEdits is dead code\n\nok\n\nbq. How about describing the high-level approach in the patch?\n\nFrom the high level, this patch is about getting rid of two APIs in JournalManager-- getNumberOfTransactions and getInputStream, and adding one API to JournalManager-- selectInputStreams.  The new API simply gathers up all the available streams in one go and puts them into a Collection.  This is more efficient, and also better for some of the changes we'd like to make in the future, like supporting overlapping edit log streams.\n\nEdit log validation is the process of finding out how far in-progress edit logs go.  We do it during edit log finalization so that we can find out what to rename the in-progress edit log file to.  (\"validation\" might not be a great name for this process, but it's probably too late to change it now.)  We don't validate finalized logs.\n\nThere are some minor changes to validation here, and a major change.\n\nFirst, the minor changes.  One change is to have the validation class contain only the end txid, rather than the start txid, number of txids, and end txid.  The start txid is already known, and the number of txids does not represent what you might think, but merely end - start + 1.  So it's good to get rid of that cruft.  Another minor change is that EditLogValidation#corruptionDetected was renamed to EditLogValidation#hasCorruptHeader.  That is the concept it always represented-- it never referred to anything other than header corruption, and the rest of the code even uses the terminology hasCorruptHeader to represent this info (see EditLogFile#hasCorruptHeader).  So I'm just trying to be consistent.\n\nThe major change is that we now read to the end of a corrupt file in validation, finding the true end transaction rather than merely the first unreadable txid.  This is needed for recovery to work properly on these files.  It's possible that this change could be dropped from this patch.  Conceptually, it's more related to HDFS-3049.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

That is a pretty concise description of what it does.\n\nThe changes to TestNameNodeRecovery are for correctness.  Formerly, we were doing multiple mkdirs operations on the same directory.  This resulted in only one mkdir operation getting added to the stream.  Then when we corrupted the last edit, the mkdir operation was lost-- a bad thing, since we check for it later.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if calling cluster.waitActive() in this test is necessary, since we have 0 DataNodes.  However, we do it everywhere else, and consistency is a good thing.  Also, conceptually what we want is for the NameNode to come up and be active.  It seems more robust to check for that directly rather than assuming that no part of edit log loading happens in the background.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
