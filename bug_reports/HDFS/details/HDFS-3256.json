In the original patch, the fix I had was just to check if only a single rack was configured and not count a block as being on too-few racks if there in fact was only one rack.\n\nHowever, here's an updated patch which should address the test failures.\n\nThere were two reasons for the test failures:\n# There were 2 tests which asserted that blocks were under-replicated when only one rack was configured, which is no longer the case.\n# There was 1 test which had blocks for a single file spread across two racks, and asserted that after all the nodes on one of the racks died, that blocks were then considered misreplicated.\n\nFixing #1 above just consisted of changing the tests to not assert that behavior.\n\nFixing #2 was a little more involved. I added a boolean to DatanodeManager to track whether or not the cluster had _ever_ consisted of multiple racks. This is updated whenever a node is added to the cluster. When a cluster goes from being sinlge-rack to multi-rack, we call BlockManager#processMisReplicatedBlocks to make sure that we look for blocks which were not considered under-replicated when there was only a single rack, that should now be on separate racks.\n\nThen, the check for whether or not a block is on enough racks becomes \"is the desired replication only 1, OR has there only ever been one rack configured in this cluster.\"","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
