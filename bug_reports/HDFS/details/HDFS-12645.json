locking design.  Preventing a dead node via a lifeline is of dubious value when the node is effectively dead due to blocked IO in the dataset lock.  The node can't process replications which may lead to data loss when another node could have serviced the replication request.  Ex.  The lifeline will keep a node \"alive\" even though it's having severe hw issues and ultimately crashed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-10-12T14:56:28.965+0000","updated":"2017-10-12T14:56:28.965+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-12645/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3l6vj:"}}
