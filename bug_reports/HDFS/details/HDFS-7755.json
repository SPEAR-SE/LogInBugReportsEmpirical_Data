Okay, I see. The point to use /bin/sh is that most of these shell scripts are very simple and do not require any bash-specific things. And since there are systems that do not ship bash by default, this would eliminate one extra dependency. But it is not a big deal if you prefer to stick with more heavyweight bash instead.\n\nI don't have any objections to switching to /bin/sh, but I think that you'll find it a very challenging task.  If your goal is just to get stuff working on FreeBSD, you're probably better off spending your effort elsewhere and coming back to this later.  You would also need to have a vote on the main mailing lists to get a policy enacted to only use /bin/sh in the future, or else your work would quickly be undone by people adding new scripts.  Again, I would support this, but it seems like the effort to reward ratio is pretty low.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
