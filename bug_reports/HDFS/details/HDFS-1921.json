It could be added to a separate method.\nSounded right, so I implemented the suggestion, and then concluded it made the code _more_ complex instead of better, because of the way it worked out with the try/catch context and the management of the errorSDs list.  \n\nbq. Also continue in catch block is redundant.\nThe \"continue\"s are there for defensive coding:  If someone adds statements after the catch context, but within the loop, I believe the catch context should go to the next loop iteration immediately.\n\n.bq Minor: per the coding guidelines please add { } after if statements.\nDone, thanks.\n\nOne more time :-)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-18T16:00:43.139+0000","updated":"2011-05-18T16:00:43.139+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506927/comment/13035536","id":"13035536","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
