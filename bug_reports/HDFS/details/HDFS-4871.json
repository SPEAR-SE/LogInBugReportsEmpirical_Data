I am looking into it.\nCan't we do this in a less intrusive manner, for example in test patch (or Windows equivalent), or some other script external to test code?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-06-04T18:23:12.204+0000","updated":"2013-06-04T18:23:12.204+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12650701/comment/13675591","id":"13675591","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":">My personal preference would be to file a single parent task Jira, and as we fix individual tests we can link their Jiras to the parent Jira.\n\nThis is a really good suggestion!
