Myers","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"There are two obvious work-arounds for this issue:\n\n# Explicitly configure the address of the 2NN ({dfs.secondary.http.address}). This would prevent 2NNs from starting up which couldn't bind to that address.\n# Do something else to make sure that there is only ever one 2NN running.\n\nBut, we should still harden HDFS to make it so that this scenario is less likely to occur. Right now it's all too easy (with the default configs) to find oneself in this scenario.\n\nI can think of a few possible solutions:\n\n# Don't have a default value for the {{dfs.secondary.http.address}}. Require the user set it, and don't allow the 2NN to start up without it. The NN will reject connections to roll/fetch fsimage/edits from any machine that's not connecting from this configured address.\n# On start-up, the 2NN makes an RPC to the NN to generate a unique token. This token is subsequently used for all NN and 2NN communication. The NN will reject any communication from a 2NN with a different token. This will effectively lock out any previously-started 2NNs from mutating the NN state.\n# Before transferring the fsimage back to the NN, the 2NN computes a checksum of the newly-merged fsimage, and informs the NN of the expected checksum. On download of the new fsimage, the NN verifies the checksum of the downloaded file against the expected checksum from the 2NN.\n\nOf these, I think I'm inclined to go with option 3. Option 1 is dead simple, but has the downside of changing default config options and requiring an extra step to set up a Hadoop cluster. Option 2 seems like overkill to me. Option 3 is relatively simple, and has the added benefit of providing an extra integrity check of the fsimage state during network transfer.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

Since the goal of this JIRA is just to prevent receiving the wrong fsimage during checkpointing, not verify validity of the fsimage coming off disk, there's no need to store the checkpoint in the VERSION file. Rather, we can just compute the checksum on the fly, but still send it with the CheckpointSignature during checkpointing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

I changed one of them to debug, and made one other less verbose, since some of the info is only relevant in the event of an error, and in that case the extra info is printed as part of the exception.\n\nbq. Do we also need to add some locking so that only one 2NN could be uploading an image at the same time?\n\nAgreed.

That would reduce divergence between 20s and trunk. That is to say, backport HDFS-903 except for the part where the checksum is put in the VERSION file.\n\nI thought about doing this. Thought it seems like it would make for a more straight-forward back-port, the back-port isn't easy regardless because of other divergences between trunk and branch-0.20-security. So, we don't seem to be gaining much by doing it this way, and since we wouldn't be storing the previous checksum as part of the VERSION file, we wouldn't be getting the intended benefit of HDFS-903 (\"NN should verify images and edit logs on startup.\")\n\nI'll upload a patch in a moment which addresses all of these issues, except the last one.
