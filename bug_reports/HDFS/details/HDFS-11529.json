These are some examples of exceptions that have been observed on an Error(255):\n\norg.apache.hadoop.ipc.StandbyException (Operation category WRITE is not supported in state standby)\n\njava.io.EOFException: Cannot seek after EOF\n\njavax.security.sasl.SaslException: GSS initiate failed [Caused by GSSException: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)\n\nIt is of course not possible to have an error code for each and every type of exception, so one suggestion of how this can be addressed is by having a call such as hdfsGetLastException() that would return the last exception that a libHDFS thread encountered. This way, an application may choose to call hdfsGetLastException() if it receives EINTERNAL.\n\nWe can make use of the Thread Local Storage to store this information. Also, this makes sure that the current functionality is preserved.\n\nThis is a follow up from
