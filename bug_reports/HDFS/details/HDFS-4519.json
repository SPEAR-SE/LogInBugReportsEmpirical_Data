I also found HDFS-2350, an old jira you filed about how secure data nodes don't print to console.  I reassigned HDFS-2350 to myself, because the patch I posted here will give us the capability to send jsvc outfile/errfile to stdout/stderr.\n\nIf you see an existing issue that I missed though, please let me know.

I'd like to suggest that we keep the scope of this jira limited to overriding the jsvc binary, the outfile, and the errfile.

The patch I attached here is fairly small and fully backwards-compatible with the existing behavior.\n\nI'd definitely be curious to see what you have in mind though if you want to file another jira.  Are you thinking that we should drop the jsvc dependency from Hadoop and push the process management responsibility to the operator, who can choose to use jsvc or daemontools or whatever other tool is preferred by that operator?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-23T00:02:08.529+0000","updated":"2013-02-23T00:02:08.529+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633496/comment/13584863","id":"13584863","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=josb-ebay","name":"josb-ebay","key":"josb-ebay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jos Backus","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sorry, Chris, didn't mean to derail this ticket.
