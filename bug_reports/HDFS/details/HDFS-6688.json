We want to wait a conservative amount of time before marking a node as dead, since that will start re-replication for all the blocks on that DN (very I/O and network intensive).\n\nWe do measure the \"last heartbeat\" time in places, and will mark a DN as \"stale\" if we haven't heard from it from a little while (e.g. 30s) but it's not yet dead. You could try looking at those metrics if you're interested in lower-latency detection methods.\n\nIf this is satisfactory, could we close this JIRA?
