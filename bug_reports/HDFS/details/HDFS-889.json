It's {{hasNext()}} method checks the next entry isn't null. But what if between the {{hasNext() call and the next() operation, the map changes and an entry goes away? In that situation, the node returned from next() will be null. \n\nThis is potentially serious as a quick look through the code shows that the iterator gets retrieved a lot and everywhere hadoop does so, it assumes the value is not null. It's also one of those problems that doesn't have a simple \"make it go away\" fix.\n\nOptions\n# Ignore it, hope it doesn't happen very often and the test failing was a one off that will never happen in a production datacentre. This is the default. The iterator is only used in the namenode, so while it does depend on the # of datanodes, it isn't running in 4000 machines in a big cluster.\n# Leave the iterator as is, have all the in-Hadoop code check for a null-value and break the loop\n# Patch the {{NodeIterator}} to be consistent with the {{Iterator}} specification and throw a {{NoSuchElementException}} if the next value is null. This does not make the problem go away, but now it is handled by having every use in-Hadoop catching the exception at the right point and exiting the loop. \n\nTesting. This should be possible.\n# Create a block map\n# iterate over a block\n# while the iterator is in progress remove the next block in the list. Expect the next call to next() to fail in whatever way you choose.
