(truncated blocks, infinite loops, bad meta-data, etc)\n\nYea, what happened is that we had three replicas, and this managed to happen on all three, somehow, due to multiple concurrent recoveries. It's tough to parse out from the logs, but I think basically it was the following sequence of events:\n\n1. DN A told to recover blk_B_1\n2. DN A gets block info from all DNs, and a new genstamp 2\n3. DN A gets disconnected from network, gets swapped out, whatever, for a minute\n4. NN times out the block recovery lease after 60s and another recovery is initiated by a client still calling appendFile()\n5. DN B is told to recover blk_B_1\n6. DN B starts to get block info from all nodes - this takes a while trying to talk to DN A because it's still paused\n7. DN A comes back to life\n8. DN B receives block info from A and asks for new genstamp (3)\n9. DN B wins the updateBlock race, and updates all replicas to genstamp 3\n10. DN A calls updateBlock on all replicas, asking to go genstamp 1 -> genstamp 2. This fails because cur genstamp is 3 on all replicas. In the process of failing, it effectively trashes the meta file by renaming it\n11.All further attempts to recover the block fail because all replicas get the \"no meta file\" error\n\nThe above seems really contrived, but I'm pretty sure that's what I saw happen :) This JIRA deals with step 10 - a stale updateBlock call coming from some DN that had paused during recovery results in corrupting the replica (by removing meta)\n\nIt's also suspicious that a node will allow recovery to start (the startBlockRecovery) call if it thinks it's already the primary DN for recovery on that block. To fix that, we could make startBlockRecovery throw an IOE if it finds the block in the ongoingRecovery map and the call is not coming from itself.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-06-23T17:30:36.005+0000","updated":"2010-06-23T17:30:36.005+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467675/comment/12881776","id":"12881776","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"bq. also, we check the genstamp is moving upwards both at the start of updateBlock and at the end of tryUpdateBlock. do you know why?\n\nOops, missed this question - probably because synchronization blocks are dropped and reclaimed in every cycle of checking that no threads are writing the block.
