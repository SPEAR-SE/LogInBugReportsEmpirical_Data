The basic problem is described in HDFS-1024, but that JIRA was only dealing with possible data corruption, since then we got to a place where we could not compact the fsimage anymore because failures were 100% of the time.\n\nHere is what we have found out:\nThe fetch still fails with the same exception as the HDFS-1024 (Jetty closes the connection before the file is sent)\nWe suspect the underlying reason to be extensive garbage collection on the NameNode (1/5 of all time is being spent in garbage collection). And the reason for that might be the bug that is solved with HADOOP-6577 (we have a lot of large RPC requests, which means we allocate and free a lot of memory all the time).\nBecause of GC the speed of the transfer drops to 700Kb/s\n\nHaving said all of that current mechanism of fetching the image is still potentially flawed. When dealing with large images namenode is under stress of sending multigig files over the wire to the client while still serving requests.\n\nThis JIRA is to discuss the possible ways of separating NameNode and the image fetching by the secondary namenode.\nOne thought we had was fetching the image using SCP rather than HTTP download from the NameNode. \nThis way the NameNode will have less pressure on it, on the other hand this will introduce new components that are not exactly under hadoop control (ssh client and server).\nTo deal with possible data corruption with SCP copy we would also want to extend CheckpointSignature to have checksum on the file, so it can be checked on the client side.\n\nPlease let me know what you think.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113291","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Secondary Namenode fails to fetch image and edits files","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dms","name":"dms","key":"dms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dmytro Molkov","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dms","name":"dms","key":"dms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dmytro Molkov","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12460146/comment/12849596","id":"12849596","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"1. +1 on extending CheckpointSignature to return the checksum of the fsimage/edits file.
