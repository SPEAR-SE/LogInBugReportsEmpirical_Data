Mingliang Liu, what do you think?\n{quote}\n\nThat makes sense in order to avoid overhead of too frequent capturing the stack trace. If we find in the future we need the longest lock holding stack trace heavily, we can add it back. Before that, operators can reduce the config {{dfs.lock.suppress.warning.interval.ms}} for finer-granularity information. Thanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=liuml07","name":"liuml07","key":"liuml07","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=liuml07&avatarId=29203","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=liuml07&avatarId=29203","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=liuml07&avatarId=29203","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=liuml07&avatarId=29203"},"displayName":"Mingliang Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-02T22:29:18.259+0000","updated":"2016-09-02T22:29:18.259+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12994105/comment/15459771","id":"15459771","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xkrogen","name":"xkrogen","key":"xkrogen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526"},"displayName":"Erik Krogen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In HDFS-10475 we hope to add more detailed metrics for which calls are causing long held locks.
