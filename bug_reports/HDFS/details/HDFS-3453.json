So pre-1.0 clients can still talk to 1.0.x namenodes. The 1.0.x client, on the other hand, internally calls only the new method; The original create method is never called. Since pre-1.0 namenode does not understand this new method, 1.0 clients cannot create files on pre-1.0 clusters. The patch makes client call the new method only when createParent is set to false. All others will be fulfilled by the original method.\n\nThe protocol-level incompatibility still exists, but that only manifests when the new file system level method, FileSystem#createNonRecursive(), is explicitly called. Normal use cases within hadoop do not use this method. Currently only SequenceFile#createWriter() calls it when caller specifically asks for it. This was added to support HBase. \n\nIn summary, 1.0.x and pre-1.0 are incompatible, but become interoperable with this patch for most use cases.

This allows newer clients that support createFlag to be interop with older server implementation that do not createFlag in create().}}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-29T13:57:54.829+0000","updated":"2012-05-29T13:57:54.829+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12556860/comment/13284834","id":"13284834","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"New patch: comments added as Suresh suggested.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-05-29T14:10:20.611+0000","updated":"2012-05-29T14:10:20.611+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12556860/comment/13284838","id":"13284838","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
