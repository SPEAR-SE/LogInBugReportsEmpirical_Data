Thanks for taking a look.\n\nbq. Should the failure count be reset per block, but not per read?\n\nThis doesn't match my expectation. Consider the case of HBase, where a region server opens a single region (which may very well be a single block) and holds it open for days at a time. During the time while it's open, it may experience sporadic errors every once in a while due to a network blip or what have you. Just because the reader saw an error at 12pm, 3pm, and 6pm doesn't mean it should fail when it sees one at 9pm.
