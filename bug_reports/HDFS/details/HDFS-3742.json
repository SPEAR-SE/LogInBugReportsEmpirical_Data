The code generated to call any exported functions or use any exported globals is less efficient than those that aren't exported. There is an extra level of indirection involved. This applies to any function that might be exported at compile time. gcc will still produce extra indirection for a function that is later un-exported by a linker script. So using the visibility attribute will produce better code than the linker script.\n\nIn other words, linker version scripts are less efficient than just using __attribute__((visibility))\n\nMore importantly, I don't think new contributors will understand how to add new functions to the API if we use a separate, magic script.  Whereas it's easy to copy and paste the old function definition to the new one.  It's more obvious what's going on when the information is in the code rather than a separate file.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
