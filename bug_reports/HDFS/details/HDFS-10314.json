Here is a description and comparison of the -diff and unimplemented -rdiff switches. \n\n{code}\nDefinition: Assuming we have two snapshots, s1 and s2, where s1 is created earlier, and s2 is newer.\n\n- SnapshotDiff(s1, s2): represents the delta between s1 and s2; That is, if we apply \n  snapshotDiff(s1, s2)  on top of s1, we can go to the state of s2.\n- SnapshotDiff(s2, s1) represents the reversed delta between s1 and s2. That is, if\n  we apply SnapshotDiff(s2, s1) on top of s2, we can go back to the state of s1.\n\nNote: When we talk about source and target, we mean distcp source and distcp target.\n\nA. -diff allows distcp to efficiently copy incremental changes made (on top of previously copied\n    snapshot s1) in source cluster to target cluster   Assuming snapshot s2 is created at the source to\n    capture s1 + incremental changes, snapshotDiff(s1,s2) is the incremental changes, the output of this\n    operation is that the target will be at s2 sate. this operation involves three steps:\n\n  A.1 calculate snapshotDiff(s1, s2) at the source\n  A.2 apply the rename and delete portion of the snapshotDiff at the target. this step is called \"sync\"\n  A.3 copy created/modified files from source's s2 to target \n\nB. -rdiff allows distcp to efficiently copy data from snapshot s1 to overwrite changes made in target\n    after snapshot s1 was created in target. Assuming snapshot s2 is created at the target to capture\n    the changes that need to be overwritten, snapshotDiff(s2, s1) is what we want to apply to target. \n    The output of this operation is that the target is at s1 state. Similar to -diff, but with some differences, \n    this operation involves three steps too:\n\n  B.1 calculate snapshotDiff(s2, s1) at the target,\n  B.2 apply the rename and delete portion of the snapshot diff at the target. this step is called \"sync\"\n  B.3 copy created/modified files from source's s1 to target. (the source here can be a different\n        cluster, or the target itself. When it's a different cluster, the cluster has to have snapshot s1 \n        that's has exact same name and content as the s1 at the target)\n\nA tablularized comparison:\n\n                  required snapshots      DiffCalc       Output After Operation\n                  --------------------------\n                  source        target        \n                  ------------------------------------------\n-diff             s1, s2   ->  s1             source         target is at s2\n-rdiff            s1       ->   s1,s2        target          target is at  s1  \n\n(note, for -rdiff, the source could be the same as target)\n\nSo the \"r\" (reversed) in the -rdiff means the following and is very symmetric to -diff:\n\n- swap the snapshot requirement of source and target in -diff \n  (from \"s1, s2   ->   s1 \"  to  \"s1  ->   s1,s2\")\n- swap the result snapshot after operation (from s2 to s1)\n- swap the snapshot diff calculation place  (from source to target)\n\nWe require source and target to have same snapshot s1 (same snapshot name, same content).\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-19T22:09:45.495+0000","updated":"2016-10-03T20:43:52.826+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12960152/comment/15248784","id":"15248784","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jingzhao],\n\nI'm thinking about implementing -rdiff as a hidden switch of distcp, and implementing this tool as a script.that calls distcp.

There is probably some more work to polish the fix, then documentation since it would be a new tool. However, I hope we can get consensus on the approach here before spending more time.\n\nHighlight of the main changes:\n* Incorporated the HDFS-9820 changes I made earlier. And make sure that no new command line switch is added in DistCp for this feature,  from user's point of view.  \n* This patch addressed the issue reported in HDFS-10263 by massaging the reverted snapshot diff.\n* Instead of using script to wrap the distcp code, I implemented a new class called DistSync in java, that derives from DistCp, and it's in parallel with DistCp, from user's point of view.\n* DistSync requires one of -diff and -rdiff command line switch, and it support copying data from a mirror source cluster in addition to copying from the snapshot of the same target cluster;\n* I dropped the fallback code which says \"if the work on -diff failed, go back to normal distcp\".

Please see my answers below.\n\n{quote}\nSo the current patch actually adds a new distsync extension and implements the \"calculating diff on target cluster\" approach? \n{quote}\nYes. This is the result of our discussion in HDFS-9820. \n\nThough I preferred adding -rdiff as a symmetric behavior as how -diff works in distcp, as reported in HDFS-9820, I think your suggestion of creating a new tool is fine, as long as we leverage the code that does -diff in distcp, and minimize code duplication.\n\n{quote}\nI think to have the diff calculated on target is fine, \n{quote}\nYes. Since the goal is to make the target's state go to a specified snapshot,  we'd better calculate snapshot diff at the target.\n\n{quote}\nbut I'm not sure to directly extend the current distcp is a good idea.\n{quote}\nThere are couple of reasons when I came up with the idea of extending distcp:\n* distsync is a customized distcp,  it extends distcp's -diff behavior to support -rdiff.\n* it's better to re-use the code that implements -diff, extending allows re-using the existing implementation of \"-diff\". You can see it's only 124 lines of code (including the header and imports) in DistSync.java in my patch rev001.\n \n{quote}\nCorrect me if I'm wrong. Here's my current understanding of the patch:\n1. our main motivation is still to utilize distcp to restore a snapshot\n2. the idea is to compute the delta on the target cluster, and for modified files we get their original state from the source.\n{quote}\nYes. However, for modified files, I intended to make it flexible to copy from the specified snapshot of either the source or the target.\n\n{quote} \nIn that sense, I think a simpler way is to wrap (but not extend) the current distcp in the snapshot-restore tool:\n1.

Please let me know if I miss anything.\n{quote}\n\nWe discussed two overall solutions earlier.\n\n* Solution A. What proposed in HDFS-9820: adding \"-rdiff s2 s1\" to distcp, to achieve the symmetric behavior as \"-diff s1 s2\" of distcp.\n* Solution B. What proposed in HDFS-10314: introducing a new tool, that allows to sync a target cluster to a specified snapshot.\n\nFor Solution B,  there are two approaches, one (B.1) is my patch rev001 here, the other (B.2) is what you proposed above. \n\nSome thoughts:\n\n# Creating a new tool itself is going to mean extra support, that's why I preferred solution #A, which is the simplest.\n# Given that we want to create a new tool, we'd better maximize code sharing, otherwise, it's going to be both more development effort and extra support effort. \n# To me, the way suggested by solution #B.2 disallows sharing the existing implementation of -diff in distcp. Thus I think it's actually not simpler, and would incur support burden for future because of the duplicated code.\n# I think we agreed per our discussion that if we create a new tool, then you don't have strong opinion whether we copy from a different cluster or from the same target cluster. As I shared earlier, I can tell from the user's case, that copying from a different mirror cluster can be much faster sometimes. So I kept suggesting that it would be better to support the flexibility, to copy from either the source or the target.\n\nWould you please kindly share the specific problems you see with solution #B.1? \n\nHonestly speaking, I still prefer solution #A. But I'm ok with solution B, except I really hope to share the code of -diff implemented in distcp already.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-20T23:49:44.837+0000","updated":"2016-09-20T23:49:44.837+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12960152/comment/15510391","id":"15510391","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jingzhao],\n\nFor clarity, and as a recap, here is a comparison table between -diff and the proposed -rdiff, which shows the symmetricity:\n\n||Comparison||-diff s1 s2 <src> <tgt>||-rdiff s2 s1 <src> <tgt>||\n|Current feature state|Existing in distcp|Proposed Addition |\n|Functionality| Given <tgt>'s current state is s1, make <tgt>'s current state the same as newer snapshot s2 | Given <tgt>'s current state is s2, make <tgt>'s current state the same as older snapshot s1 | \n|Requirements| # <src> and <tgt> need to be different paths\n# both <src> and <tgt> have snapshot s1 with exact same content \n# <src> has snapshot s2\n# s2 is newer than s1\n# <tgt>'s current state is the same as s1\n# <tgt> doesn't have snapshot s2 | # <src> and <tgt> can be the same or different paths\n# both <src> and <tgt> have snapshot s1 with exact same content\n# <tgt> has snapshot s2\n#  s2 is newer than s1 \n# <tgt>'s current state is the same as s2\n# <src> may or may not have snapshot s2 |\n|Steps|# calculate snapshotDiff<s1,s2> at <src> \n# apply rename/delete part of snapshotDiff on <tgt> \n# copy modified part of snapshotDiff from s2 of <src> to <tgt> | # calculate snapshotDiff<s2,s1> at <tgt> \n# apply rename/delete part of snapshotDiff on <tgt> \n# copy modified part of snapshotDiff from s1 of <src> to <tgt> |\n\nThe original thinking was to add -ridff to distcp (solution A), but because of the concern of confusing semantics, it's suggested to introduce a new command here (solution B). \n\nThanks.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-21T16:05:04.665+0000","updated":"2016-09-21T16:11:07.795+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12960152/comment/15512098","id":"15512098","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jingzhao],\n\nThanks again for your earlier feedback. \n\nWould like to share the details below about why I don't think your proposed method is simpler. Hope it makes some sense to you, and please correct me if I'm wrong. I hope you could elaborate here to help me understand better.\n\nDistCp does two basic steps:\n# based on the input, create the copyListing, which is a sequence file for mapreduce, and each entry contains info to  figure out one pair of <source, target> and file attribute info\n# throw the sequence file to the mapreduce job\n\nStep 2 is relatively stable these days, mostly we are manipulating step 1 based on the input. \n\n\"-diff s1 s2\" replaced the original step 1 with a new step 1:\n* 1.1 compute snapshot diff, \n* 1.2 figure out the rename/delete operation's source and target, based on the snapshot diff info\n* 1.3 apply the rename/delete to the target path\n* 1.4 figure out the add/modification operation's source and target, based on the snapshot diff info\n* 1.5 create copyListing based on step 1.4\n\n*The tricky parts* are 1,2 and 1.4, and the order of applying the rename/delete operations in step 1.3.  With HDFS-7535 and HDFS-8828, a framework has been implemented in DistCp that does the new step 1. What I did was to re-use the framework.\n\nNow the questions:\n\n# With what you proposed, I don't see how the tricky parts I listed above are simplified. And you suggested not to touch existing DistCp implementation, I thought you meant to rewrite the code that does the tricky parts, which is not simpler.  \n# Which step in your proposal will generate the copyListing? Step 3 or step 4? \n** If it's in step 3, how we are going to pass the result to distcp in step 4?\n** or if it's in step 4, that means we need to calculate the snapshot diff again in step 4, and do the tricky manipulation again there. It doesn't look simpler, and probably additional access to NN.\n# Would you please share the specific problems you see with my implementation, other than you think your proposal would be simpler? I really hope you could do that.\n\nThanks much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-22T04:33:14.598+0000","updated":"2016-09-22T04:33:14.598+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12960152/comment/15524359","id":"15524359","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jingzhao],\n\nTo better address your comments, I discussed with [~atm], and we think there are the following possible options:\n\nOption 1. To get closer to what you suggested, we can introduce new tool distsync and let it support all of the following semantics:\n* distsync -diff s1 s2 src tgt\n* distsync -rdiff s2 s1 src tgt\n* distsync tgt s1\n\nImplementation-wise, we can move common DistCp stuff to AbstractDistCp, and let both DistCp and DistSync inherit from AbstractDistCp.  Accordingly, DistCpOption need to be refactored in a similar fashion.\n\nWith this route, the \"-diff\" in distcp will probably eventually be obsoleted.\n\nOption 2. Given that we already have -diff switch in DistCp, we can add \"-rdiff\" to DistCp, and support\n* distcp -diff s1 s2 src tgt (currently supported)\n* distcp -rdiff s2 s1 src tgt\n\nWould you please share what you think?\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-26T22:23:30.958+0000","updated":"2016-09-26T22:23:30.958+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12960152/comment/15528169","id":"15528169","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HI [~jingzhao],\n\nI tried to provide details in my earlier replies so they tend to be lengthy. Now I'd like to ask couple of quick questions on your latest proprosal (I asked too in earlier reply but too buried). Appreciate your taking time to reply.\n\n{quote}\nIn that sense, I think a simpler way is to wrap (but not extend) the current distcp in the snapshot-restore tool:\n1. The tool takes a single cluster and a target snapshot as arguments\n2. The tool computes the delta for restoring using snapshot diff report\n3. The tool does rename/delete etc. metadata ops to revert part of the diff\n4. The tool uses the distcp (by invokes distcp as a library) to copy the original states of modified files\n{quote}\n\nQ1: step 2 does the snapshot diff calculation as you described, does it also collect the modified files and pass to step 4?\n\nQ2: or does step 4 also do snapshot calculation? \n \nThanks much.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-28T02:38:47.418+0000","updated":"2016-09-28T02:38:47.418+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12960152/comment/15530595","id":"15530595","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Had a discussion with [~jingzhao], and we had the following agreement:\n\n1.
