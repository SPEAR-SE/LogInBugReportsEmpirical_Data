If a hedged read can't find a datanode, it will delay a successful response considerably. To set the stage, lets say 10ms is the hedged read timeout and we only have a single replica available, that is, nodes=[DN1]. \n\n1. [0ms] {{DFSInputStream#hedgedFetchBlockByteRange}} First (not-hedged) read is sent to DN1. In the future, the read takes 50ms to succeed. ignoredNodes=[DN1]\n2. [10ms] Poll timeout. Send hedged request\n3. [10ms] {{DFSInputStream#chooseDataNode}} is called to find a node for the hedged request. As ignoredNodes includes DN1, there are no nodes available and we re-query the NameNode for block locations and sleep, trying again.\n4. [+3000ms] {{DFSInputStream#getBestNodeDNAddrPair}} is called. As ignoredNodes includes DN1, we throw, re-query the NameNode for block locations and sleep, trying again.\n5. [+3000+6000ms] {{DFSInputStream#getBestNodeDNAddrPair}} is called. As ignoredNodes includes DN1, we throw, re-query the NameNode for block locations and sleep, trying again.\n6. [+6000ms+9000ms] {{DFSInputStream#getBestNodeDNAddrPair}} is called. As ignoredNodes includes DN1, we throw, re-query the NameNode for block locations and sleep, trying again.\n7. [27010ms] Control flow restored to {{DFSInputStream#hedgedFetchBlockByteRange}}, completion service is polled and the read that succeeded at [50ms] is returned successfully, except +27000ms late (worst case, expected value would be half given RNG).\n\nThis is only one scenario (a happy scenario). Supposing that the first read eventually fails, the DFSClient will still retry inside of {{DFSInputStream#hedgedFetchBlockByteRange}} for the same retries before failing.\n\nI've identified one way to fix the behavior, but I'd be interested in thoughts:\n\n{{DFSInputStream#getBestNodeDNAddrPair}}, there's a check to see if a node is in the ignored list before allowing it to be returned. Amending this check to short-circuit if there's only a single available node avoids the regrettably useless retries, that is:\n\n{{nodes.length == 1 || ignoredNodes == null || !ignoredNodes.contains(nodes[i])}}\n\nHowever, with this change, if there's only one DN available, it'll send the hedged request to it as well. Better behavior would be to fail hedged requests quickly *or* push the waiting work into the hedge pool so that successful, fast reads aren't blocked by this issue.\n\nIn our situation, we run a HBase cluster with HDFS RF=2 and hedged reads enabled, stopping a single datanode leads to the cluster coming to a grinding halt.\n\nYou can observe this behavior yourself by editing {{TestPread#testMaxOutHedgedReadPool}}'s MiniDFSCluster to have a single datanode.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"DFSClient hangs if using hedged reads and all but one eligible replica is down ","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xorlev","name":"xorlev","key":"xorlev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xorlev&avatarId=26861","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xorlev&avatarId=26861","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xorlev&avatarId=26861","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xorlev&avatarId=26861"},"displayName":"Michael Rose","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xorlev","name":"xorlev","key":"xorlev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xorlev&avatarId=26861","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xorlev&avatarId=26861","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xorlev&avatarId=26861","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xorlev&avatarId=26861"},"displayName":"Michael Rose","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-10597/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i30k9z:"}}
