These are varints, but let's assume worst case and they use the full 10 bytes. Thus, with the 64MB default max message size, we arrive at 6.7 million entries.\n\nThere are a couple approaches here:\n\n- Split the directory section up into multiple messages, such that each message is under the limit\n- Up the default from 64MB to the maximum supported value of 512MB, release note, and assume no one will realistically hit this\n- Enforce a configurable maximum on the # of entries per directory\n\nI think #3 is the best solution here, under the assumption that no one will need 6 million things in a directory. Still needs to be release noted of course.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-13T18:39:33.530+0000","updated":"2014-03-13T18:39:33.530+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12701305/comment/13933876","id":"13933876","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I also did a quick audit of the rest of fsimage.proto, and I think the other repeated fields are okay.
