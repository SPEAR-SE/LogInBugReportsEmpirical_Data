Now if /foo/bar is deleted, then there will be two leases (/foo/.snapshot/s1/bar/f1 and /foo/.snapshot/s1/bar/f2)  added with the holder \"HDFS_snapshot\" to leaseManager, these leases will be present till the snapshot is deleted. Will not be considered for lease recovery.\n3. Now on checkpoint, these leases also will be stored as underconstruction files with snapshot path.\n4. These INodes will be reloaded as under construction files replacing the last block as underconstruction. \n5. While considering the namenode safemode threshold these underconstruction blocks will be excluded.\n6. NameNode startup will be success.\n\n*Scenario 2:*\n Renaming a file/dir inside a snapshot will also be maintained using leases.\nex: \n1. /foo/bar is a dir containing /foo/bar/f1 and /foo/bar/f2 which is having a snapshot /foo/.snaphost/s1\n  2. Now /foo/bar is renamed to /foo/bar-renamed\n    3. then two leases will be added with snapshot paths.\n    4. Again while checking pointing these will be written\n    5. While counting for the namenode threshold if there are two leases for the same file then only the original file lease will be considered and threshold will be correct\n\n*Scenario 3:*\nDeleting a snapshot of which contains a file with multiple snapshots.\nex: \n1. /foo/bar is a dir containing /foo/bar/f1 and /foo/bar/f2 which is having two snapshots /foo/.snaphost/s1 and /foo/.snaphost/s2\n2. Now if the /foo/bar is deleted then leases will be created with latest snapshot paths. (/foo/.snapshot/s2/bar/f1 and /foo/.snapshot/s2/bar/f2)\n3. After this if the latest snapshot (s2) is deleted, then leases will be replaced with prior snapshot path for those files which are present in both these snapshots\n\n\nPlease review","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-11-04T09:21:22.183+0000","updated":"2013-11-04T09:21:22.183+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12675798/comment/13812777","id":"13812777","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

To keep the compatibility we keep the information in the \"under-construction-files\" section in fsimage, and just use \".snapshot\" as their paths.\n2) Identify these snapshot files while loading fsimage, and temporarily store them in a map in SnapshotManager.\n3) When calculating total block number when starting NN, besides the files recorded in the lease map, also deduct the number of files recorded in 2).\n\nIn general the idea is very similar to Vinay's patch. The difference is that we do not keep and maintain records in the lease map and only handle these files when starting the NN. We can even clear the records in SnapshotManager after computing the total number of blocks.\n\nOne more thing we may need to handle is that if we remove the 0-sized blocks (HDFS-5443), it is possible that we can have an under-construction file in snapshot while there is no corresponding blockUC for the file. In that case we should not record extra information in fsimage for this kind of INodeFileUC. \n\nThe current patch is just for demonstration. It can pass the new unit tests in Vinay's patch. If folks think the general idea is ok, we can continue our work based on this patch.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-06T23:50:57.473+0000","updated":"2013-11-06T23:50:57.473+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12675798/comment/13815536","id":"13815536","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sathish.gurram","name":"sathish.gurram","key":"sathish.gurram","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sathish","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Continue the discussion ( HDFS-5443) here.\nAs we discussed yesterday to verify this patch for (HDFS-5443).With this patch the issue is still reproducing i..e After restart NN is going to safemode.I am not sure where the flow is missing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sathish.gurram","name":"sathish.gurram","key":"sathish.gurram","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sathish","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-11-07T01:36:01.999+0000","updated":"2013-11-07T01:36:01.999+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12675798/comment/13815551","id":"13815551","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

So here is it possible that the client just writes a full block and call the sync(update-length), but has not tried to get an additional block or close the file? In that case, we will have a full-size block which is under construction? If we treat this block as a complete block and write it into fsimage, later when the NN restarts and receives a block report from DN, we may miss the special process added in HDFS-5283 in BlockManager#processFirstBlockReport.
