I think you're right that in some really weird timing scenarios we might have a problem:\n\n{noformat}\nwriter writes offset 1 and syncs, gs=1\n\nNN recovery starts:\n  - interrupts writer, gets metadata (len 1)\n  - recovering DN hangs for a little bit\n\nwriter recovery starts, picks a different primary DN:\n  - interrupts writer (noop)\n  - gets metadata (len 1)\n  - gets new GS=2\n  - syncs blocks to GS=2 len=1\n  - restarts pipeline\n  - writes and syncs some more data to block with GS=2\n\nNN-directed recovery proceeds:\n  - gets new GS=3   (this has to be at least 10 seconds after above due to lastRecoveryTime check)\n  - calls updateBlock on all DNs, which truncates files\n{noformat}\n\nI think the issue here is that the genstamp can be incremented in between startBlockRecovery() and updateBlock(), and thus updateBlock is allowing an update based on stale recovery info. If we simply added a check in tryUpdateBlock() that oldblock.getGenerationStamp() == oldgs, I think we'd be safe. What do you think?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-06-24T22:16:59.155+0000","updated":"2010-06-24T22:16:59.155+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12466120/comment/12882367","id":"12882367","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rash37","name":"rash37","key":"rash37","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sam rash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"yea, i think so.  let me repeat slightly different to make sure I get this at a higher level:\n\n1. we make sure that a lease recovery that starts with a old gs at one stage (that's synchronized) actually mutates the block data of only the same gs\n2. new writer that come in between start of recovery and actual stamping must have a new gs since they can only come into being via lease recovery\n\nthis is effectively saying that if concurrent lease recoveries get started, the first to complete wins (as it should), and later completions just fail.\n\nsounds like optimistic locking/versioned puts in the cache world actually: updateBlock requires the source to match an expected source.\n\nnice idea\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rash37","name":"rash37","key":"rash37","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sam rash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-06-24T22:26:16.851+0000","updated":"2010-06-24T22:26:16.851+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12466120/comment/12882376","id":"12882376","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I'm wondering if there is still some sort of weird issue, though...\nLet's say there are two concurrent recoveries, one trying to update to genstamp 2 and the other trying to update to genstamp 3, and there are 3 DNs.\n\nLet's say that GS=2 recovery wins on dn A and B, and GS=3 recovery wins on DN C, a little bit later.
