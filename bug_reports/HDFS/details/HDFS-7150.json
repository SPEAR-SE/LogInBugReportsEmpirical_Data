Normally, when you have replicas only on decomm-in-progress nodes, the blocks won't be counted as missing. It turns out if decomm-in-progress nodes lost heartbeat and reconnect to NN, this could happen. The scenario is the following.\n\n1. Kick off decomm on several nodes across different racks.\n2. NN lost heartbeat from 3 decomm-in-progress nodes around the same time. BM's neededReplications will be updated as part of BM.removeStoredBlock process. If block A's 3 replicas happen to be on these 3 nodes, block A will be moved to BM's neededReplications.QUEUE_WITH_CORRUPT_BLOCKS queue. So at this point, block A will be counted as missing.\n3. These 3 nodes reconnect with NNs. However, block A remains in BM's neededReplications.QUEUE_WITH_CORRUPT_BLOCKS queue, until the block A is replicated to other live nodes.\n\nThe issue will be mitigated by HDFS-7128 with faster decommission. But it is better to fix the correctness issue. When decomm-in-progress nodes reconnect with NN, blocks should be moved out of BM's neededReplications.QUEUE_WITH_CORRUPT_BLOCKS queue. This will also give replication of these blocks higher priority.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"MissingBlocks > 0 when all replicas are on decomm-in-progress nodes","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12744215/comment/14869305","id":"14869305","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hello Ming,\nThanks for reporting this issue.
