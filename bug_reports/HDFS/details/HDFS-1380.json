Say we have 2 racks: rack-0 and rack-1. \nRack-0 has dn1, dn2, dn3. Rack-0 has dn4, dn5, dn6.\n \n2. Suppose client is in rack-0, and the write pipeline is:\nclient --> localnode --> other rack --> other rack\nIn this example we have the pipeline client-dn1-dn4-dn6.\nThat is rack0-rack0-rack1-rack1. So far so good.\n \n3. Now other client comes, and append to file.\nThis client is also in rack-0. Interestingly,\nthe append pipeline is client-dn6-dn4-dn1.\nThat is the new client (from rack0) sends packet \nto the first node in pipeline (dn6) which belongs to rack1.\n\nThis bug was found by our
