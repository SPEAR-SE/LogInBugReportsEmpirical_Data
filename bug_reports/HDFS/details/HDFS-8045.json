After some investigation, we think there is an issue in the calculation of FsVolumeImpl.getAvailable - following is the explaination.\n\nFor a volume, let's use Raw to represent raw capacity, DfsUsed to represent space consumed by hdfs blocks, Reserved to represent reservation through \"dfs.datanode.du.reserved\", RbwReserved to represent space reservation for rbw blocks, RealNonDfsUsed to represent real value of NonDfsUsed(which will include non-hdfs files and meta data consumed by local filesystem).\nIn current implementation, for a volume, available space will be actually calculated as  \n{code}\nmin{Raw - Reserved - DfsUsed -RbwReserved,  Raw - DfsUsed - RealNonDfsUsed }\n{code}\nLater on, Namenode will calculate NonDfsUsed of the volume as \n{code}\nRaw - Reserved - DfsUsed - min{Raw - Reserved - DfsUsed - RbwReserved, Raw - DfsUsed - RealNonDfsUsed}\n{code}\n\nGiven the calculation, finally we will have -\n{code}\nif (Reserved + RbwReserved > RealNonDfsUsed) NonDfsUsed = RbwReserved;\nelse NonDfsUsed = RealNonDfsUsed - Reserved;\n{code}\nEither way it is far from the correct value.\n\nAfter investigating the implementation, we believe the Reserved and RbwReserved should be subtract from available in getAvailable since they are actually not available to hdfs in any sense.

soon.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12708970","id":"12708970","filename":"HDFS-8045-001.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sinago","name":"sinago","key":"sinago","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhouyingchao","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-04-02T11:46:15.120+0000","size":924,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12708970/HDFS-8045-001.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Incorrect
