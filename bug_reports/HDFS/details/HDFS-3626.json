Shouldn't the normalization just occur on the server side?\n\nWell, we already normalize the Path(String) constructor, which is the much more commonly used one throughout all the code I've seen. So I think we should be consistent between the URI and String constructors.\n\nbq. Shouldn't the normalization just occur on the server side?\n\nI don't think so, because on the client side you at least need to resolve things like relative paths from the home directory. Or, eg, if you have a viewfs, you need to be able to handle normalization of \"/mount1/../mount2/foo\" on the client side in order to know that you need to go to mount2 and not mount1's NN.\n\nMy other concern with doing normalization on the server side has to do with things like lease renewal. We have to be very careful that the leases are tracked with the correct (canonical) strings and then renewed with the same strings. Of course, if we normalize consistently everywhere, this will work, but I wanted to just fix this bug here rather than try to overhaul where we do normalization.\n\nGiven the above, and given that DFSUtil _already_ checks for non-canonical elements like \"../\" in the path, I think this current approach is the most self-consistent, and if we want to move the normalization to server-side, we should do it separately from the bugfix. If there's a bug with \"../\" in symlinks, then I think that bug already exists and wouldn't be introduced by this patch, right?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-07-13T20:53:05.758+0000","updated":"2012-07-13T20:53:05.758+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598232/comment/13416780","id":"13416780","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Daryn/Suresh: are you guys OK with this current patch given the justification above?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-07-18T00:53:03.624+0000","updated":"2012-07-18T00:53:03.624+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598232/comment/13417065","id":"13417065","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I'm reluctant to approve, but I won't block it.\n\nRegarding the normalization of symlinks, \"/mount2/foo\" is not supposed to normalize to \"/mount1/../mount2/foo\".

The change here is that Path(URI) did not normalize prior to this patch, whereas Path(String) does normalize as you've demonstrated.\n\nRight, that's the bug here. The other Path constructors, not just Path(String) but Path(Path, Path) and friends too, normalize the path on creation.  Ie I don't think the intent was for eg this usage in the code\n{code}  \nnew Path(new Path(uri), new Path(\"/\"));\n{code}\nto normalize the path but new Path(uri) not to.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-18T22:02:38.209+0000","updated":"2012-07-18T22:02:38.209+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598232/comment/13417798","id":"13417798","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"New patch rebased to trunk (had some conflicts after the JUnit4-ification of the test cases)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-07-18T22:59:41.718+0000","updated":"2012-07-18T22:59:41.718+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598232/comment/13417800","id":"13417800","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"We've veered off the road, but I think Path should have been little more than a simple wrapper over a URI that allowed us to parse a URI w/o percent encoding in the path component.
