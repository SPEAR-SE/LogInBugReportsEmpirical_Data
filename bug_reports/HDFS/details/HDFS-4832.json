Then if whole bunch of datanodes crash before leaving the safe mode (e.g. during initialization of repl queues), namenode will still think it's good to go. But once it gets out of safe mode, it will quickly notice a lot of under-replicated and missing blocks.\n\nDo we ever want this behavior? Is this inconsistency justified for shorter duration of startup safe mode? If we fix this (still no actual work will be generated), how much overhead will it introduce?\n\nStartup safe mode is special because the repl queues have never initialized. But in any subsequent safe mode, auto or manual, repl queues are there.
