Attached patch 06 addressed your suggestions.\n{quote}\n3. Would you please explain why the following comments? maybe add the explanation as an addition to the comment.\n{quote}\nThis is added because I met the same NPE described when running secondarynamenode (2NN). Running a command like {{hdfs secondarynamenode -checkpoint}} with kerberos enabled will fail with the same NPE thrown. The cause is that 2NN web server is needed when starting as a daemon, to show status/metrics etc., which needs to get credentials. When running from shell, the environment doesn't have the credentials and prompts for password. When the password is not correct, {{getPassword}} sets the password to null, causing the NPE. Note that clients are't supposed to know the password, but we should definitely allow them to checkpoint. Since the metrics etc. are not needed when running 2NN from shell, I think it makes sense to not start the web server at all.\nI have updated the comments like below, to give more information.\n{code}\n  // The web server is only needed when starting SNN as a daemon,\n  // and not needed if called from shell command. Starting the web server\n  // from shell may fail when getting credentials, if the environment is not\n  // set up for it, which is most of the case.\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-16T01:44:40.799+0000","updated":"2015-10-16T01:44:40.799+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545531/comment/14962724","id":"14962724","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\\\\\n\\\\\n| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:red}-1{color} | pre-patch |  21m 19s | Pre-patch trunk has 1 extant Findbugs (version 3.0.0) warnings. |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | @author |   0m  0s | The patch does not contain any @author tags. |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | tests included |   0m  0s | The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
