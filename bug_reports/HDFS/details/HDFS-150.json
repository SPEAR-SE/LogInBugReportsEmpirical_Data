Heartbeat interval is based on how much a namenode can handle. Repliaction should be based on how much a datanode can handle.\n\nSo given the default heartbeat interval of 20 seconds, we computed datanodes can handle 2 replications in that interval based on which Namenodes give 2 blocks per heartbeat to replicate.\n\nWhat we propose is to keep the 20second/2blocks constant and hence a datanode coming in with a heartbeat of 1 minute interval should be given 6 blocks to replicate per heartbeat. In this case instead on taking 200 minutes it should take 200/3 ~1 hour to replicate the entire
