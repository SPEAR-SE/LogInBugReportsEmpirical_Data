Would you please take a look at the new revision? Thanks.  \n\nHi [~arpitagarwal], thanks for reviewing it earlier, if you have time, I will appreciate that you look at it again.\n\nBTW Andrew, I saw that both FSDirection and FSNameSystem's lock code have quite some indirection (thus a bit more runtime) when making a call, say,\n{code}\n  void readLock() {\n    this.dirLock.readLock().lock();\n  }\n{code}\nIt go through several \".\" and each of them is an indirection. This can be improved. For example,  we can create a class member, e.g., {{mReadLock = this.dirLock.readLock();}}, then modify the readLock() methods to\n{code}\n void readLock() {\n    mReadLock.lock();\n }\n{code}\nI can create a jira to change both classes if you agree.
