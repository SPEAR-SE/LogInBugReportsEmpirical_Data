When they got recommissioned by refreshing nodes using dfsadmin, there were over 5M over-replicated blocks, so holding the write lock the NN (RPC handler) went through each of them and generated two log messages per block.  That took about 5 minutes and over 2GB of log were written.  Because of the locking, the namenode was unresponsive for the whole time.\n\nI tested the commons-logging + log4j FileAppender family combination for its performance and it was clear that the above case was hitting the logging bottleneck. When comparing logging a single character vs. 400 bytes, time to finish logging 1,000,000 messages didn't seem much different. It was not IO bound, but CPU bound as the CPU stayed 100% the whole time. Changing FileAppender properties affected the timing a bit but not a lot.  It seems this is the inherent limit of this logging mechanism.\n\nFor a single character logging, each message took 19-23us. Or it could do about 42K logs/sec with CPU at 100%, almost no IO wait time.  We can see that the namenode in the case given above were spending almost all of its time logging. The IO overhead was not significant.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-10-18T19:48:11.163+0000","updated":"2012-10-18T19:48:11.163+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12612480/comment/13479315","id":"13479315","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"On recommissioning, the dead nodes will not cause this overhead at that moment (i.e. not in the same write lock block). They will do their own share of logging storm when they rejoin and send in the full block reports, which would block the namenode for 6-7 seconds in the above example. They will at least let others run in between such block reports. Or the nodes can be brought up in a controlled manner to reduce the impact. E.g. two data node start-ups per minute.\n\nBut the live nodes at the time of recommissioning can cause problems, unless processing of potentially over-replicated blocks become asynchronous to recommissioning and also throttled. Doing invalidation inline but pausing and releasing the lock won't be ideal since it will prolong the duration of refreshNode command execution. Delaying this work using the mis-replicated blocks handling can make it asynchronous, but it cannot be throttled; at the next block report, all will be processed.\n\nI think the simplest remedy is to disable the state change logging for block invalidation during recommissioning. \n\nOn a busy namenode, the overhead of logging every block state change may not be negligible. We might want to add a capability to selectively disable certain class of state change logging. (There are already places that disables logging for every block)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-10-18T20:09:51.902+0000","updated":"2012-10-18T20:09:51.902+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12612480/comment/13479401","id":"13479401","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"The patch demotes the logging level of over-replicated block invalidation to DEBUG.
