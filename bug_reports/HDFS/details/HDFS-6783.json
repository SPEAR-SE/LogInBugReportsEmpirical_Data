So the concern is a race between \n{code}\n          isScanning = true;\n          needsRescan = false;\n        } finally {\n          lock.unlock();\n        }\n{code}\nAnd code that calls {{setNeedsRescan}} followed by {{waitForRescanIfNeeded}}.  Since there are so many code paths that drop the lock in between those two calls, this could certainly happen, I think.\n\nThis patch would cause us to wait for even rescans that were not triggered by {{needsRescan}}, though.\n\nWe probably need some kind of scan epoch system to do this right...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

If we call {{setNeedsRescan}} while a rescan is going on, we don't want that scan to count as the rescan.\n\nSo the question then becomes: CAN we call {{setNeedsRescan}} while a rescan is going on?  Right now the answer is no, since rescan holds the FSN lock, and everything that calls {{setNeedsRescan}} also holds that lock.  But this is accidental... not something we should rely on.  The v4 patch you posted is correct, but it makes the assumption that we will always hold the FSN lock for the entire duration of the scan.  While this is true currently, it wasn't always true, and won't be true in the future (we *need* to reduce the length of time we hold these locks to avoid latency spikes.)\n\nMaybe a good compromise here would be to set the loop variables while holding both the FSN lock and the CRM lock.  This fixes the corner case you identified, and also would continue to work properly if we released the FSN lock during the rescan.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
