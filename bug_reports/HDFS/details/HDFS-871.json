The process was still alive but no balancing was taking place.\n\nAt the time of the hang, jstack showed there were three threads in RUNNABLE status. Subsequent jstacks taken minutes and hours later showed the same three threads running in the same place, so I don't think this was a case where requests were being restarted, it looks like hangs. My best guess is, there's no timeout in the request to the namenode for these requests, and there needs to be.\n\nI'll attach the full jstack output, but here's a sample thread, they are all stuck in
