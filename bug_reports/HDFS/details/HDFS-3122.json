We should have the following:\n\n- NN side: NN has a newer genstamp but DN reported a replica with an older genstamp.  NN should tell DN to delete replica with the older genstamp and the stored block in NN remains unchanged.\n- DN side: DN receives a replica-delete with the older genstamp from NN but the stored genstamp is newer.  So it ignores the replica-delete.\n\nThere may be some bugs in the implementation.  What happen after the block is marked as corrupted?  Will DN delete the replica?

NN will add the block as corrupt with NN genstamp rather than reported genstamp ( I will take a look on that patch again). This should solve this problem.
