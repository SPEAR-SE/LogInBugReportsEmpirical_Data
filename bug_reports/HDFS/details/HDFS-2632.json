However, there is a bug: in_use.lock is deleted!  After that, if another attempt is made to start the namenode, there is no in_use.lock file, so the new instance goes ahead and starts messing with the namenode state files.  It eventually fails to bind to the TCP port, but it has already done damage by that time.  Specifically, the 'edits' file being written to by the running instance is moved to 'previous.checkpoint' so all further transactions are lost when the HDFS service is next restarted.
