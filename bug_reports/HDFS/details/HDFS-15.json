The neededReplication queue supports four priorities:\nPriority 0: Blocks that have only one replicas;\nPriority 1: Blocks whose replicas are on only one rack;\nPriority 2: Blocks whose number of replicas is no greater than 1/3 of it replication factor;\nPriority 3: All other under-replicated blocks.\n\nIn general we should have priority 4 which includes those blocks that do not belong to priorities 0-3 and do not satisfy the HDFS rack requirement. Currently HDFS provides only two-rack guarantee so priority 1 covers all rack requirement break cases.\n\nIn methods addStoredBlock, removeStoredBlock,   startDecomission,  and markBlockAsCorrupt in FSNamesystem, put both under-replication and 1 rack blocks into the neededReplication queue.

At many places it is assumed that a block in neededReplications is strictly under-replicated and that will make the logic complicated. Code will be cleaner if we use strict definitions of neededReplications and neededReplicationsForRacks queues.\nAlso it will include significant changes to UnderReplicatedBlocks.java.

The original patch was done after the block management refactoring so it isn't a straight forward application to 20, so I've written a new patch, but the fix is in the same spirit as the code in trunk.\n\nThe bug is hard to reproduce as you have to have a failure/decommission on the only cross rack replica of a block in the window of time this block is over-replicated.\n\nThe patch adds following new tests that cover rack policy violations not covered by the existing tests. Some of them fail when looped repeatedly w/o the fix (after commenting out the asserts that check neededReplications which will always fail). I'll forward port these test to trunk in another jira. \n\n* Test that blocks that have a sufficient number of total replicas, but are not replicated cross rack, get replicated cross rack when a rack becomes available.\n* Test that new blocks for an underreplicated file will get replicated cross rack.\n* Mark a block as corrupt, test that when it is re-replicated that it is still replicated across racks.\n* Reduce the replication factor of a file, making sure that the only block that is across racks is not removed when deleting replicas.\n* Test that when a block is replicated because a replica is lost due to host failure the the rack policy is preserved.\n* Test that when the execss replicas of a block are reduced due to a node re-joining the cluster the rack policy is not violated.\n* Test that rack policy is still respected when blocks are replicated due to node decommissioning.\n* Test that rack policy is still respected when blocks are replicated due to node decommissioning, even when the blocks are over-replicated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-12-29T23:30:50.902+0000","updated":"2010-12-29T23:30:50.902+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406936/comment/12976172","id":"12976172","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch passes all unit tests on branch 20. test-patch results:\n\n{noformat}\n     [exec] \n     [exec] -1 overall.  \n     [exec] \n     [exec]     +1 @author.
