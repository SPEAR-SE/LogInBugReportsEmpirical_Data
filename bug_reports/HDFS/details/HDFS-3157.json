Reason, \nNow though the reported block is added into corruptReplicasMap it is not getting invalidated on the DN who is reporting this corrupt block, because for the corrupt block to get invalidated first we need to meet the live replicas for the block equal to the replication factor set.\nProblem - If chooseTarget() picks the same DN who is reporting this corrupt block then it will fail with ReplicaAlreadyExistsException.\nNow question is why NN is picking the same DN who is reporting this corrupt block not the 3rd DN ?\nAnswer - In excludedNodes map only one DN will be present who has the live replica of the block( or who has the block in his Finalized folder).\nThe following partial logs depicits the above scenario.\n{code}\nexcludedNodes contains the following datanode/s.\n{127.0.0.1:54681=127.0.0.1:54681}\n2012-05-12 23:57:33,773 INFO  hdfs.StateChange (BlockManager.java:computeReplicationWorkForBlocks(1226)) -

I have one comment:\n\n{code}\n (corrupted == stored?\n{code}\nThis should be .equals? as we creating new reference of BlockInfo explicitly in some of the ctors right?\n\nAnd other question is:\nif (countNodes(b.stored).liveReplicas() >= bc.getReplication()) {\nThis point may not be related to this patch, but considering one case I wanted to point it.\nDue to several pipeline failure in cluster, only 2 live replicas present in the cluster and all other nodes has the partial block(corrupt) present in RBW.\nNow NN can not invalidat that blocks as it did not meet the enough replication and may try to replicate them to other nodes first. But unfortunately other nodes already have the block with older genstamp. volumes map may have that blocks already and I remember it will reject the replication. So, we have only 2 live replicas even though we have more DNs. But this situation should be very rare and almost no possibility in bigger clusters. Worth considering the case for small clusters. Brahma reported this in one small cluster of 5 nodes. Anyway I will ask him to file separate one, we can discuss there.\n\n\nAlso Thanks a lot Ashish for your efforts on this issue :-)\n\nThanks\nUma","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-01T19:07:16.140+0000","updated":"2012-07-01T19:07:16.140+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548499/comment/13404907","id":"13404907","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Uma,\n\nThanks for taking a look.\n\nThe reason of using == instead of equals(..) is that one of the constructors (see below) sets stored and corrupted to the same object.
