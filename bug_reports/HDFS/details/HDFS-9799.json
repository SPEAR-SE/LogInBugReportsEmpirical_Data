The source of the IOException is from getEZForPath. So when getEZForPath gets an exception – meaning that the EZ of the given path cannot be determined at the time of calling, we should just return the Trash dir of the user's home. Even if the path does belong to an EZ, this will just mean the rm will fail later.\n\nCan you elaborate when getEZForPath gets an IOException? Based on EncryptionZoneManager#getEZINodeForPath, getEZForPath() just returns null instead of throwing IOException when a given path cannot be determined to be inside a EZ. This makes DFS#getTrashRoots() to include just the Trash dir of the user's home as returned result for non-EZ paths. Should we just fix the annotations?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xyao","name":"xyao","key":"xyao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyu Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-02-16T07:24:04.830+0000","updated":"2016-02-16T07:24:04.830+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12938866/comment/15149097","id":"15149097","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhz","name":"zhz","key":"zhz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493"},"displayName":"Zhe Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~xyao] for the discussion.\n\n{{FSNamesystem#getEZForPath}} gets IOExceptions at multiple places:\n# {{checkOperation}}\n# {{FSDirEncryptionZoneOp#getEZForPath}} => {{resolvePath}}, {{getINodesInPath}} etc.\n\nSo the IOException from the {{getEZForPath}} call itself is pretty hard to get rid of.

An API level indication would be a nice. I explored 2 approaches:\n# Add null elements in the returned collection\n# Create a new data structure, something like {{GetTrashRootsResult}}, with a boolean flag indicating partial results\n\nWith either approach, it's pretty complex to reflect the structure of returned trash roots. This is because both {{FileSystem}} and {{DistributedFileSystem}} levels could return partial results (and in principle, any subclass of {{FileSystem}} could return partial results too). Given the complexity I suggest we just rely on WARN logging. Please see if you agree.\n\nUpdating the patch with minor cosmetic changes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhz","name":"zhz","key":"zhz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zhz&avatarId=20493"},"displayName":"Zhe Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-02-17T19:55:53.051+0000","updated":"2016-02-17T19:55:53.051+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12938866/comment/15151112","id":"15151112","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The ideal way of doing partial results is something like Optional, though that's Java 8 and still won't work perfectly since if we fail to list, we won't know the number of homedirs/EZs.
