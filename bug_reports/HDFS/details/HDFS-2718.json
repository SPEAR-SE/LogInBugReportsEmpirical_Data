In the existing code it is -1 (UNKNOWN_DISK_SPACE).\n\nGood point. Just realized that explicit calculation of diskspace is not necessary here at all, because it is calculated in addNode() if childDiskspace < 0. Removing diskspace calculation completely.\n\nJP> COMMITTED code was removed from convertToCompleteBlock and moved to the caller.\n\nCOMMITTED state is a confirmation from client that it finished writing the block.\nDuring edits loading block will never be in committed state, since there are no clients. So we force it to COMPLETE state. And checking if the block is COMMITTED should be performed only if block completion is not forced. Therefore had to move verification to the caller.\n\nATM> do you have any numbers on the performance gain of edits loading attained from this change?\n\nI created 500,000 files using CreateEditsLog utility. And then started NameNode before and after applying the patch. The results show just over 20% improvement.\nI expect that with addBlock transactions in place the gain will be higher.\n{code}\nBefore\n12/01/27 16:05:21 INFO common.Storage: Edits file /hadoop-data/hdfs/name/current/edits of size 286856143 edits # 1005001 loaded in 18 seconds.\n\nAfter\n12/01/27 16:21:17 INFO common.Storage: Edits file /hadoop-data/hdfs/name/current/edits of size 203356143 edits # 1005001 loaded in 14 seconds.\n{code}\n\nAs a side effect it turned out that CreateEditsLog generates non-standard transactions. In real life first transaction that creates a file does not contain blocks. While CreateEditsLog adds blocks to this transaction. I had to introduced additional constructor for INodeFileUnderConstruction in order to cover this use case.\nAttaching files shortly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-01-31T02:15:54.905+0000","updated":"2012-01-31T02:15:54.905+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12536197/comment/13196683","id":"13196683","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Here's my feedback on the patch:\n\n- Rather than adjusting the code to handle the invalid edit log case of first OP_ADD having multiple blocks, we should fix the CreateEditLogs tool to create a realistic edit log. That would allow us to remove code from the loader, as well as avoid having to add the new INodeFileUnderConstruction constructor.\n- The {{updateFile}} call takes a number of parameters which aren't used -- in particular permissions, replication, and preferredBlockSize. Having these parameters present implies that they'll also be used to update the file, which is not the case.\n- I think the construction of filenames in TestEditLog may be buggy -- I think you mean to do {{\"/filename\" + (startIndex + i)}} since otherwise it will do two string-appends, rather than a string append of an addition.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-02-02T23:39:11.117+0000","updated":"2012-02-02T23:39:11.117+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12536197/comment/13199371","id":"13199371","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
