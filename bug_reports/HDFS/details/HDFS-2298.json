This is a private interface and only the non-deprecated version is called any longer, so the deprecated method may now be removed from the protocol.\n - ClientProtocol#rename() has two signatures, one deprecated (HDFS-654).  Both are still used, since they have different semantics.  Since the protocol methods are private, it is safe to rename one.  The user API can still be overloaded.  The new version is now called rename2.  The best practice for interoperability when changing semantics of RPC methods is to add a new method.\n - In two cases, different protocols contained methods with the same signature, with a single implementation in the namenode.  Perhaps Avro could be altered to detect when this is the case and not throw an exception, but this is also duplicate code that can be refactored to better reflect the reuse.  So this patch adds two new private interfaces BadBlockReportable, shared by ClientProtocol & DatanodeProtocol, and VersionRequestable, shared by DatanodeProtocol & NamenodeProtocol.\n - Finally, NamenodeProtocol#errorReport() and DatanodeProtocol#errorReport() have different parameters and, as RPC methods, should be named differently if they're to both be implemented by a single service.  They are thus renamed namenodeErrorReport() and datanodeErrorReport() respectively.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-06T19:56:20.080+0000","updated":"2011-09-06T19:56:20.080+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12520616/comment/13098318","id":"13098318","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

The AvroProtocolEngine on the namenode no longer responds using the right protocol when the DataNode contacts it with datanodeVersionRequest.  It tries to respond with ClientProtocol rather than DatanodeProtocol.  I'll try to look into this more.
