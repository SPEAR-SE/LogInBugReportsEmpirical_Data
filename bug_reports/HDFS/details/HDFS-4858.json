This configuration means that the IPC Client (DataNode, in this case) should timeout in 14000 seconds if the Standby NameNode does not respond to a sendHeartbeat.\n\nWhat we observe is this: If the Standby NameNode happens to reboot for any reason, the DataNodes that are heartbeating to this Standby get stuck forever while trying to sendHeartbeat. See Stack trace included below. When the Standby NameNode comes back up, we find that the DataNode never re-registers with the Standby NameNode. Thereafter failover completely fails.\n\nThe desired behavior is that the DataNode's sendHeartbeat should timeout in 14 seconds, and keep retrying till the Standby NameNode comes back up. When it does, the DataNode should reconnect, re-register, and offer service.\n\nSpecifically, in the class DatanodeProtocolClientSideTranslatorPB.java, the method createNamenode should use RPC.getProtocolProxy and not RPC.getProxy to create the DatanodeProtocolPB object.\n\nStack trace of thread stuck in the DataNode after the Standby NN has rebooted:\n\nThread 25 (DataNode: [file:///opt/hadoop/data]  heartbeating to vmhost6-vm1/10.10.10.151:8020):\n  State: WAITING\n  Blocked count: 23843\n  Waited count: 45676\n  Waiting on org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client$Call@305ab6c5\n  Stack:\n    java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)\n    java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:485)\n    org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client.call(Client.java:1220)\n    org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProtobufRpcEngine$Invoker.invoke(ProtobufRpcEngine.java:202)\n    sun.proxy.$Proxy10.sendHeartbeat(Unknown Source)\n    sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor2.invoke(Unknown Source)\n    sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\n    java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)\n    org.apache.hadoop.io.retry.RetryInvocationHandler.invokeMethod(RetryInvocationHandler.java:164)\n    org.apache.hadoop.io.retry.RetryInvocationHandler.invoke(RetryInvocationHandler.java:83)\n    sun.proxy.$Proxy10.sendHeartbeat(Unknown Source)\n    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolPB.DatanodeProtocolClientSideTranslatorPB.sendHeartbeat(DatanodeProtocolClientSideTranslatorPB.java:167)\n    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.sendHeartBeat(BPServiceActor.java:445)\n    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.offerService(BPServiceActor.java:525)\n    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.run(BPServiceActor.java:676)\n    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)\n\nDataNode RPC to Standby NameNode never times out.

Datanode should be connected to both Active and Standby NNs\n2. Standby NN should die without sending the TCP RST to the DataNode. If the RST is sent out, then the DataNode thread waiting on this Socket will get a SocketException, and all is fine. It will keep trying to re-connect to the SNN, and will succeed when the SNN comes back to life. This is fine. The problem really happens only when the network interface dies abruptly. In this case, the TCP RST does not go out, so the DN side of the TCP connection never knows that the SNN rebooted. This is not such an unusual occurrence - an unexpected power loss for the SNN would cause exactly this situation\n\nNote the following:\n1. Kill -9 of the SNN will cause a TCP RST to be sent out\n2.

It's been working fine for us since then. Is it a different problem you are talking about?\n\nThere are other parts of the code that use the ipc client. It is not just limited to the datanode. The tasktracker, as mentioned is one example for MR1. The fact that the client does not timeout for a write is still there. You now need to find every single place where you use the client and make sure that you fix it. I tried to point that out.\nInstead of pulling the time out for writes out of the client code (Client.java) it should be handled transparently for the caller in the Client code. \n\n>> see around line 600\n>Line 600 of what?\n\nLine 600 of the Client.java code, If rpcTimeout is not set (0 or -1) then the pingInterval will be used to make sure that the read times out. A similar construct should also be used for the write side to make sure that you do not have  rpcTimeout set. The solution maintains a different behaviour for read and write timeouts while this would be a chance to fix that.\n\n>> It is also used by the TaskTracker\n> Are you referring to cdh4, as trunk and Hadoop 2 don't have TaskTracker.\n\nThe TaskTracker was used as an example. Purely used to point to the fact that there are, or could be, more users of the client code that exhibit the same issue.\n\n>Sorry, I didn't understand the general problem from your descriptions, guys. If you could tell how to reproduce it or better propose a fix. The DataNode problem is real though, because fail-overs fail when the DN thread gets stuck. It would be good to fix it in the next release.\n\nThe issue is real for each user of the client code. Write on a socket does not time out (normal behaviour). When a hardware failure occurs on a network layer this becomes apparent (unplug a cable, server HW failure, switch failure etc). Steps to reproduce are given in this bug and in HDFS-4646. They all work. TCP timeout and retry are the underlying cause of this 'hang' and faster fails can be achieved by changing the tcp_retries2 parameter at the kernel level.\nInstead of looking outside the Client.java code why do we not time out the write itself? Currently the code just waits forever for the write to return, a simple change would be to change that wait. I can attach a diff for the change if that makes it easier to see what I mean.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wilfreds","name":"wilfreds","key":"wilfreds","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Wilfred Spiegelenburg","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"created":"2014-02-09T23:03:37.837+0000","updated":"2014-02-09T23:03:37.837+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12649701/comment/13897431","id":"13897431","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I understand now what you mean.
