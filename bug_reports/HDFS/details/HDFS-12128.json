During balancing, the replicas in source datanodes can't be deleted immediately,\nso the total usage of the cluster will increase and won't decrease until datanodes' stale state be cancelled.\nWhen the datanodes send next block report to namenode(default interval is 6h), active namenode will cancel the stale state of datanodes. I found if replicas on source datanodes can't be deleted immediately in OP_REPLACE operation via del_hint to namenode,\nnamenode will schedule replicas on datanodes with least remaining space to delete instead of replicas on source datanodes. Unfortunately, datanodes with least remaining space may be the target datanodes when balancing, which will lead to imbalanced datanode usage again.\nIf balancer finishes before next block report, all postponed over-replicated replicas will be deleted based on remaining space of datanodes, this may lead to furitless balancer efforts.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Namenode failover may make balancer's efforts be in vain","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yiyang","name":"yiyang","key":"yiyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10451","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10451","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10451","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10451"},"displayName":"liuyiyang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yiyang","name":"yiyang","key":"yiyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10451","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10451","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10451","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10451"},"displayName":"liuyiyang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13086530/comment/16085029","id":"16085029","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brahmareddy","name":"brahmareddy","key":"brahmareddy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624"},"displayName":"Brahma Reddy Battula","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"HDFS-11146 might help on this..?
