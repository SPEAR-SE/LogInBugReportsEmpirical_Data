So, both threads are writing to the same file fsimage.ckpt_12, but the actual file contents correspond to the uploading thread's data.\n- NN1 finished its saveNamespace operation while NN2 was still uploading. So, it renamed the ckpt file. However, the contents of the file are still empty since NN2 hasn't sent any bytes\n- NN2 finishes the upload, and the rename() call fails, which causes the directory to be marked failed, etc.\n\nThe result is that there is a file fsimage_12 which appears to be a finalized image but in fact is incompletely transferred. When the transfer completes, the problem \"heals itself\" so there wouldn't be persistent corruption unless the machine crashes at the same time. And even then, we'd still have the earlier checkpoint to restore from.\n\nThis same race could occur in a non-HA setup if a user puts the NN in safe mode and issues saveNamespace operations concurrent with a 2NN checkpointing, I believe.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12327584","id":"12327584","description":"2.7.0

concurrency. Alternatively, we can move {{ImageServlet}}'s code that handle s duplicated download requests to {{FSImage}} so that it covers regular checkpoint. Any thoughts on this?\n\nIn addition, {{currentlyDownloadingCheckpoints}} is declared as static. That is problematic in unit test where two namenodes share the same list. It doesn't need to be static as {{ImageServlet}} gets the global FSImage object from {{NameNodeHttpServer}}.\n\nAnother thing about the test case, it is possible that the first standby nn checked by the test code finishes the checkpoint and upload before the second standby nn kicks off its checkpoint process; it doesn't appears to be the intention of the test case.  We can increase {{SlowCodec}} sleep interval for that.\n\nChris, sorry didn't checkout the jira owner until after I write up the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-09T21:12:43.624+0000","updated":"2015-01-09T21:12:43.624+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559906/comment/14271906","id":"14271906","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~mingma], I'm not actively working on this, so thank you for posting a patch.

I did multiple test runs locally, and they always passed.\n\nA few comments on the patch:\n* {{FSImage#saveNamespace}}: It's possible to leave this method after adding the transaction ID to the checkpointing set, but without removing it.  This would leave the transaction ID in the set permanently, and I believe it would then be impossible to checkpoint at that transaction ID again.  Even though {{removeFromCheckpointing}} is called in a {{finally}} block, it is preceded by a call to {{FSEditLog#startLogSegmentAndWriteHeaderTxn}}, which can throw {{IOException}}.  I think we'll need to wrap the whole logic in a second layer of try-finally to guarantee the transaction ID gets removed from the set.\n* {{FSImage#saveFSImageInAllDirs}}: Now that this is wrapped in try-finally, there is an existing line of code that needs to be indented.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-19T20:56:19.329+0000","updated":"2015-01-19T20:56:19.329+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559906/comment/14284657","id":"14284657","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks, Chris.
