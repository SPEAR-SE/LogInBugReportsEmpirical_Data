It would be really useful if we can have multiple simulated data nodes binded to different hosts and dfs client binded to a particular host.  And futher down the road, some of the simulated data nodes on different hosts, but the same rack.  We can use this to test network topology distance related issues.\n\nOne of the related problem that I ran into was that the order of data nodes in LocatedBlock returned by name nodes is sorted by NetworkTopology#pseudoSortByDistance().  In current Mini dfs cluster, there is no way I can bind the client to a host or bind a simulated data node to a particular host/rack.  It would be nice if mini dfs cluster can make this possible, so that the network topology distance of client to each data node is fixed.  Therefore, the order of data nodes returned within a LocatedBlock on MiniDFS cluster is fixed.  Currently the order of data nodes in LocatedBlock is randomly sorted which means NetworkTopology understand the DFSClient and simulated datanodes are not different hosts and different racks. \n\nAlso in currently Mini DFS client provides the opton of -racks when starting data nodes.  But we can not bind multiple simulated data nodes to one rack... so it is not really that useful.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tanping","name":"tanping","key":"tanping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tanping Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-05-02T22:48:34.147+0000","updated":"2011-05-02T22:48:34.147+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12505977/comment/13035624","id":"13035624","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I added an additional aprameter to private void setupDatanodeAddress() in MiniDFSCluster.java.

Have you asked Suresh to merge HADOOP-7001 to yahoo-merge?\n\n# DataNodeCluster\n** In the class javadocs and/or the USAGE string, should document the change in semantics - that the datanode addresses specified in config will be used unless not set.\n\nAlso, with this setup, if you then run the Client on the same server as the DataNodeCluster, can the Client communicate successfully?  Or does it try to use 127.0.0.1 and fail to connect?  Have you searched for other unit test classes that use a Client and a DataNodeCluster?

I added HADOOP-7001 to the list for merge into yahoo-trunk, and it has now been merged.\n\n   3. With the previous patch, there were some cases where DataNodeCluster was getting errors with conflicting ports. So, in the new patch, I added a command-line parameter (-checkDataNodeAddrConfig) that will implement the new functionality. That is, with the new parameter, it will use the dfs.datanode.address.* values from the config, if set. Otherwise, if the -checkDataNodeAddrConfig parameter is not set, it will keep the existing behavior.\n\nI have tested the behaviors with and without the parameter, and the results are as expected.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-06-04T00:50:59.077+0000","updated":"2011-06-04T00:50:59.077+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12505977/comment/13044166","id":"13044166","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
