Myers","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sorry, I should have mentioned what I did for testing. No tests are included since writing a test seems like it would require adding a test hook in the EditLogFileOutputStream#flushAndSync method, which seems undesirable since that method is highly performance-sensitive. I verified that the bug exists by adding a \"System.exit(0)\" after pre-allocation, but before calling FileChannel#force. This indeed resulted in a file full of FF, which if an NN were to try to read would be interpreted as an invalid header version number. By moving the pre-allocation after the call to FileChannel#force, we guarantee that the valid data will hit the edit log before writing FFs for the purpose of pre-allocation.\n\nIn the course of preparing and testing this patch, I think I've discovered another potential issue, though. Note that in the call to FileChannel#force, we pass \"false\" which indicates that FileChannel#force does not need to wait for metadata of the file to be synced to disk, only the data. I'm not sure of the precise semantics of not syncing metadata. In particular, is the file length included? If not, I think this has the potential to cause some edits to not actually be read back from disk after a crash.\n\nThe explanation, per the comment, is that syncing metadata is unnecessary because of pre-allocation. I don't think that's reasonable, though, since EditLogFileOutputStream#preallocate doesn't call sync itself, which means that the file length might never get updated upon returning from EditLogFileOutputStream#flushAndSync.\n\nDo people agree this is a potential problem? If so, I can either fix it here, or file a new JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

The explanation, per the comment, is that syncing metadata is unnecessary because of pre-allocation.
