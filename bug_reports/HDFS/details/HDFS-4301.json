Alternatively we could set a \"minimum rate\" - eg in this case you'd set to 5MB/sec, and if we are downloading a 50MB image, it would set timeout to 10sec (+ some fixed extra time)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-12-28T19:09:53.197+0000","updated":"2012-12-28T19:09:53.197+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12623437/comment/13628393","id":"13628393","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I poked at this some, manually setting an artificially low timeout and transfer bandwidth. The behavior I see is the SNN successfully fetching big edits from the NN (indicating that this is in fact a socket timeout) but timing out in the {{putimage}} back to the NN. This is because of the HTTP GET inside the {{putimage}} GET handler; we hit the timeout because the {{putimage}} request sees no data until the nested {{getimage}} finishes.\n\nThe best fix here is to do away with this nested GET business and use an HTTP POST or PUT instead.
