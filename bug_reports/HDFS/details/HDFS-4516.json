Once DN reports block receving then we can set the length to 0. \nBy this time if client synced with some data, anyway that size will be persisted. When block receiving request comes from DN to NN, NN will update length to 0 if and only if length is -1. Otherwise it can leave as is, because it might have synced with some data and updated that length.\n\nAnd client can check, if last block length is -1, then direct it can return 0, because DNs not yet created and reported (or) not synced by client.
