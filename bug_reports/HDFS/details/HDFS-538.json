Patch is done, but when running it through unit tests, it fails {{TestHDFSFileSystemContract}}, which includes a test called {{testListStatusReturnsNullForNonExistentFile()}}, which was added back in HADOOP-930.  This test is evaluating an element of the contract that seems incorrect, particularly given the FileSystem API documention: \"{{@return the statuses of the files/directories in the given patch}},\" which does not mention returning null.  It would be much better in this situation to just return a zero-length array.  Otherwise, every call to listStatus has to include an extra null check, rather than just iterating over the array (which still succeeds with a zero-length array) or actually checking for zero files via the length of the array equaling zero.\n\n   This is borne out by listStatus' use in HDFS codebase, where there is only one check for null; the others assume an array will be returned and could potentially NPE at some point.\n\n   The rub is that the S3 FileSystem implementations do return nulls in this situation, so if we fix the contract, these will have an incompatible change introduced.  I'm not sure how wide-felt that would be, but it seems to me to be important to fix the semantics sooner than later.  The other option would be to change the API specification and continue with non-intuitive behavior, as well as changing HDFS to support it.
