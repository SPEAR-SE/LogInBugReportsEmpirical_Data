Also, because createBlockOutputStream() is not called\n(due to an early return), blockStream is still null.\n \n4) Now PDNE 1 has finished, we come to streamer.start(), which calls PDNE 2.\nBecause hasError = false, PDNE 2 returns false immediately without doing anything\n\n> if (!hasError) { return false; }\n \n5) still in the DataStreamer.run(), after returning false from PDNE 2, we still have\nblockStream = null, hence the following code is executed:\n\nif (blockStream == null) {\n   nodes = nextBlockOutputStream(src);\n   this.setName(\"DataStreamer for file \" + src + \" block \" + block);\n   response = new ResponseProcessor(nodes);\n   response.start();\n}\n \nnextBlockOutputStream which asks namenode to allocate new Block is called.\n(This is not good, because we are appending, not writing).\nNamenode gives it new Block ID and a set of datanodes, including crashed dn1.\nthis leads to createOutputStream() fails because it tries to contact the dn1 first.\n(which has crashed). The client retries 5 times without any success,\nbecause every time, it asks namenode for new block!
