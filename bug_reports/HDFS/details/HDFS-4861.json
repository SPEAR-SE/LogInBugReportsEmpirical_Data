replication factor were failing.\nSince the maxNodesPerRack is determined without considering the number of racks that are decommissioning, the BlockPlacementPolicyDefault couldn't find any good target to copy the block.\n\nI have one approach which can fix this bug:\nWe can get rid of maxNodesPerRack altogether.\nNetworkTopology (and NetworkTopologyWithNodeGroup) can maintain list of all racks (and NodeGroup) in the current topology.\nIn BlockPlacementPolicyDefault#chooseRandom we can get a list of the racks given the scope.\nIf we get multiple racks from the above function, we can go  each rack and select a target in a round robin fashion.\nIn this way we can try to place the replica evenly on all the racks for higher replication factor blocks.\n\nThis case breaks for BlockPlacementPolicyRackFaultTolerant policy.\nThis policy is heavily dependent on maxNodesPerRack (and overriding its implementation) unlike other placement policies.\nAsking the author [~walter.k.su] to share the motivation behind this policy.\nMy approach will try to place the high replication factor blocks on most racks but it will put first 2 out of 3 copies on one rack.\n\nI have a patch that is working for branch-2.7 since BlockPlacementPolicyRackFaultTolerant is not committed to branch-2.7.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh
