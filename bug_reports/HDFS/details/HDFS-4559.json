FileSystem doesn't support symlinks at the moment, so it shouldn't be exposed.\n\n[~sureshms] I've looked into this a fair bit since I'm working on HADOOP-8040 (porting symlinks to FileSystem). Full-on symlink support is definitely messier in FileSystem since we don't have the nice separation of FileContext/AbstractFileSystem, but it's still possible as long as the FileSystem subclasses are willing to do some work. I hope to have a patch up this week or next.\n\nAs a meta point, I don't think any FileSystem subclasses besides DistributedFileSystem support resolving symlinks (S3, FTP, ?), and getting resolution even just within HDFS would make 95% of our users happy.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-12T20:30:20.256+0000","updated":"2013-03-12T20:30:20.256+0000"}],"maxResults":7,"total":7,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-4559/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1ijs7:"}}
