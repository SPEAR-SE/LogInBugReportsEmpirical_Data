I looked at this some more, and have to say I disagree.\n\nWhile I think it's important to respect the configured hostname for the purposes of security on multihomed hosts, this is by far the minority of clusters. The patch attached here does not break that -- if you configure a true hostname it will be respected. This patch just fixes the issue for the vast majority of users who (a) don't have security enabled, and (b) don't have multiple hostnames on a machine. As trunk stands today, those users will be unable to run a secondary namenode without adding configuration, and this configuration isn't documented anywhere in the setup guides, etc.\n\nAnother way of saying this is:\n- before HDFS-1080, with default config, the most common configuration would work correctly, but multihomed hosts might fail at checkpoint-time.\n- after HDFS-1080, with default config, *all* 2NNs will fail at checkpoint time.\n\nSo I see this as a backwards step introduced by that patch. I apologize for not noticing it when it went in.\n\nI think our general policy has been (and should be) that we should endeavor to minimize the amount of configuration necessary for new users while at the same time allowing advanced users to do what they need. The patch attached here achieves those goals.\n\nIf I update the patch to include a check that if security is on, the 2NN will not start with 0.0.0.0, would you be OK with this change?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-12-22T20:29:59.038+0000","updated":"2010-12-22T20:29:59.038+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12477786/comment/12996790","id":"12996790","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
