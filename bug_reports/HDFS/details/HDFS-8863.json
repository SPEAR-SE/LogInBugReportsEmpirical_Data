For example, we have datanode dn0, and three storages(s1, s2, s3) of required storage type. Both s1 and s3 has 2/3 block size remaining space, and s2 has 1+2/3 block size remaining space. We just scheduled one block on dn0, it's certainly on s2, now a new block is adding and block placement checks dn0, for current patch, it will see the maximum of remaining space is 1 + 2/3 block size (s2), and also the sum satisfy, so treat it as a good target, but actually it's not.\n\nI am thinking we can do as following:  do storage type level sum, but for each storage, we only count the remaining space of multiple block size part, so for above example, remaining space of s1 and s3 is counted 0, s2 is 1, then the sum is 1, dn0 is not a good target.
