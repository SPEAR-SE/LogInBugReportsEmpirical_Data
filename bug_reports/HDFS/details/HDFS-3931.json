That's due to a separate test issue also uncovered by HDFS-3828.\nThe failure scenario for this one is a bit more tricky. I think I've captured the scenario below:\n\n- The test corrupts 2/3 replicas.\n- client reports a bad block.\n- NN asks a DN to re-replicate, and randomly picks the other corrupt replica.\n- DN notices the incoming replica is corrupt and reports it as a bad block, but does not inform the NN that re-replication failed.\n- NN keeps the block on pendingReplications.\n- BP scanner wakes up on both DNs with corrupt blocks, both report corruption. NN reports both as duplicates, one from the client and one from the DN report above.\nsince block is on pendingReplications, NN does not schedule another replication.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12545244","id":"12545244","filename":"hdfs3931.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy

value (like 5 secs). This is under the assumption that this is a rare phenomenon, and in practice we are OK waiting 10 minutes to make a new replica when this happens.\n\n2) Add a field to the DN heartbeat which reports back a failed replication for a given block. The NN would use this to decrement the pendingReplication count, which would cause a new replication attempt to be made if it was still under-replicated.\n\n\nOption 1 is clearly less risky, since it's a test-only change, but option 2 is probably \"righter\" and has the advantage of reducing the under-replication window in some rare cases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-09-12T18:45:52.265+0000","updated":"2012-09-12T18:45:52.265+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12607320/comment/13456236","id":"13456236","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Implement todd's #1 suggestion, reduce dfs.replication.pending.timeout.sec to 5.

It's not clear to me the timeout is because 20 iterations is insufficient or the failure is due to us timing out because there's a race where we'll *never* reach all the iterations (because the block will never be sufficiently replicated).

I'm surprised that there's a scenario where 20 is insufficient but it still eventually does get replicated correctly.\nThe scenario is\n- NN requests replication, puts block on pending replication queue.\n- requested replication source is corrupt, replication fails.\n- eventually NN times out pending replication queue and tries again. Block scanner has run and marked replica as corrupt so eventually we are guaranteed the replication source is not corrupt.\n\nWithout cranking DFS_NAMENODE_REPLICATION_PENDING_TIMEOUT_SEC_KEY down, we fail 1/2 tries. After speeding up pending replication timeouts, we fail 1/2*1/2*1/2... until the waitReplication loop bails. If the blockScanner has a chance to run and mark replicas corrupt, and after blockScanner finishes the replication queue has time to run, then we succeed reliably.\n\nWithout increasing the timeout from 20 seconds to 40 seconds, the test fails 1/3 times.\n\nbq. Why is restarting the datanodes ITERATIONS times necessary?\n\nAs the test is currently structured, we're polling to notice that the corrupt replica count has increased. With the fixed blockscanner from HDFS-3828, the test fails to hit the timing window to notice corrupt replicas because the blockscanner sometimes (1/20 in my tests IIRC) wins a race and the NN deletes the corrupt replica before the test can poll it.  If this happens, we have to go back and re-try the whole \"corrupt two replicas, restart their DNs, poll\" loop.\n\nSo it's not \"restarting the datanodes\" that we are retrying here.  The thing we're retrying is \"corrupt the replicas, restart the DNs, watch the corrupt count to verify it changed\".\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-09-20T23:09:12.678+0000","updated":"2012-09-20T23:09:12.678+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12607320/comment/13460040","id":"13460040","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"With hdfs3931-3, my testbox ran 1000 iterations with one test failure.
