Krogen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hey [~csun], thanks for working on this valuable change. I have a few comments:\r\n* Minor nit, I feel \"get-service-state.timeout.millis\" would be better for the config key. But if you prefer the current version I am fine with it. I am also wondering if \"ms\" may be better than \"millis\" - is there any consistency in other configs?\r\n* The comment for {{incrementProxyIndex}} has some grammatical issues, it should read \"Keep trying until all other NameNodes have been exhausted. When that happens, let the retry policy decide how to sleep and retry.\"\r\n* This still leaves us vulnerable to the situation when we are already locked on an active, and then it becomes standby. I don't think there's any good way for us to solve that here.\r\n* Your current strategy of cycling through the NameNodes once means that, if all NameNodes are currently in STANDBY, you will leave {{currentProxyIndex}} as the same node that initially triggered the failover. So despite this new logic, we may still fail over to a STANDBY (the same one we started with) and start reading from it. Given that the bullet above means we can't guarantee we're reading from an active anyway, I think this is probably okay, but want to mention it, and we should probably document this in the Javadoc. We just need to be aware that even with this patch, avoiding reading from a standby is best effort, not guaranteed.\r\n* The comment on {{isState}} should probably be converted to a Javadoc\r\n* I don't think the {{LOG}} in {{isState}} should be an error. For example, if one NameNode is currently unavailable (e.g. restarting), that is not really an error. It should probably be a warn.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xkrogen","name":"xkrogen","key":"xkrogen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526"},"displayName":"Erik Krogen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-06-18T16:30:04.946+0000","updated":"2018-06-18T16:30:55.206+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13166447/comment/16516494","id":"16516494","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Was looking at your patch, [~csun]. The problem looks straightforward, but the solution may be tricky here. Some thoughts.\r\n# We cannot just call {{getServiceStatus()}} from {{ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider<T>}}\r\n#* Because it requires superuser privileges on NN, which the client doesn't generally have in case {{T = ClientProtocol}}\r\n#* For some protocols like {{T = DatanodeProtocol}} we actually don't care if the proxy connects to Active, because in the end DNs should report to all NNs regardless of the state.\r\n# If the proxy needs the HAState it should be doing something like {{FailoverController}}. Particularly go through a factory to create a proxy, rather than directly instantiating {{HAServiceProtocolClientSideTranslatorPB()}}.\r\n# Current implementation of {{ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider}} doesn't have a notion of dealing with NNs. It probably should, or the factory for it should. So that we were able to add NameNode specific logic.\r\n\r\nAnyways, this will need some thinking, I don't see a solution yet. In the mean time, can we return back to HDFS-12976 and see what we can do there?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-06-19T00:30:27.298+0000","updated":"2018-06-19T00:30:27.298+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13166447/comment/16516754","id":"16516754","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=csun","name":"csun","key":"csun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340"},"displayName":"Chao Sun","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~xkrogen] and [~shv] for the very valuable comments! Regarding Konstantin's comments:\r\n\r\n1. Very good point. Sorry I didn't know that {{getServiceStatus}} requires super privilege. Another option might be to add another interface/protocol to get the active/standby state from NN, [as proposed in the original JIRA|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2917?focusedCommentId=13204178&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-13204178].\r\n2. Yes good point. Perhaps we can reuse {{NameNodeHAProxyFactory}} to create the factory needed in our case. \r\n3. Can you elaborate more on this?. Currently {{ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider}} does assume all remote addresses are NN, right?\r\n\r\nWill go back to HDFS-12976 in the mean time.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=csun","name":"csun","key":"csun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340"},"displayName":"Chao Sun","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-06-19T07:40:03.524+0000","updated":"2018-06-19T07:40:03.524+0000"}],"maxResults":5,"total":5,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-13687/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3uxfz:"}}
