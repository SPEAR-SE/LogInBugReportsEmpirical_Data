This configuration is no longer supported in release 1.2.0 onwards and is renamed as \"dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode\". \n\nHow feature works and configuring this feature:\nAs described in HDFS-3703 release notes, datanode stale period can be configured using parameter \"dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval\" in seconds (default value is 30 seconds). NameNode can be configured to use this staleness information for reads using configuration \"dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode\". When this parameter is set to true, namenode picks a stale datanode as the last target to read from when returning block locations for reads.

I took another look at this and think it can be cleaned up a bit more... having two separate booleans (and respective getters) for isAvoidingStaleDataNodesForWrite vs shouldAvoidStaleDatanodesForWrite is pretty messy.\n\nWhat if we did the following?\n- kill off the boolean for {{isAvoidingStaleDatanodesForWrite}}\n- change heartbeatCheck to always check stale nodes. It seems like there is practically zero cost to this. In the usual case where the heartbeat check does not find a dead node, we already iterate over the whole list of nodes. Checking isStale() is just a comparison, so essentially free.\n- then DatanodeManager only needs to expose the current state: {{shouldAvoidStaleDataNodesForWrite}}, which would be implemented something like\":\n\n{code}\nreturn avoidStaleDatanodesForWrite && numStaleNodes < datanodeMap.size() * ratioUseStaleDatanodesForWrite\n{code}\n(or still keep a cached boolean inside DatanodeManager, but set inside setNumStaleNodes)\n\nThat also allows you to move the ratio into DatanodeManager, which makes more sense in my opinion. I think all these changes together could allow you to remove the reference backward from HeartbeatManager into DatanodeManager - the circular reference between the classes is the thing that smells bad to me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-01-15T22:27:31.447+0000","updated":"2013-01-15T22:27:31.447+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12625703/comment/13554618","id":"13554618","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Andrew's on vacation, so I took a whack at implementing the above suggestion against his patch.

Suresh, what's our policy on changing config strings and behavior for alpha and beta releases? The current name would be misleading, and it'd be kind of unfortunate to have to deprecate it already.\n\nI think this is a good change. Out of curiosity, is there a use case for using stale datanode information for write path alone (which is what currently not supported).\n\nChanging configuration name and semantics will be an incompatible change. I am okay making the assumption that this was used only for HBase MTTR work for now and make these changes both in branch-2 and branch-2. For branch-1, it is good to loop in the release manager [~mattf]. Given 2.0.2 is marked alpha, I am okay letting this incompatible change into 2.0.3.\n\nAdditionally, related change needs to go into HBase as well, related to HBASE-5843. Not sure the backward compatibility impact on HBase.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-23T18:50:02.121+0000","updated":"2013-01-23T18:50:02.121+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12625703/comment/13560945","id":"13560945","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"One additional comment - if the config name is changed, it should go into both branch-1 and branch-2.
