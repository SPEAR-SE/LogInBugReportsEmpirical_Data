At the same time, space was not well balanced, so many nodes were full and  replication was slow due to HDFS-6965.  Many pending replications were timing out and placed back to the under-replacated block queue. These blocks were quickly rescheduled for replication by the replication monitor.  The block that eventually ended up missing was not scheduled for replication at all during this time. The only remaining source node did not get any such replication command and PendingReplicationMonitor never saw replication of this block expiring.  The source node had been replicating other blocks without any problem until the node was rest hours later.\n\nThere are few possibilities.\n- The removal of the two nodes (heartbeat expiration) did not cause the block to be added to the under-replicated queue.\n- The block was added to the queue, but somehow removed without generating a replication work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-08-29T14:34:54.952+0000","updated":"2014-08-29T14:34:54.952+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12737507/comment/14178625","id":"14178625","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Retargetting for 2.7.0 for now.
