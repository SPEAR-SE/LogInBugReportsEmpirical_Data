Following your steps, I got permission denied in both cases and could not delete the files. In my test, I used the super user account to create a shared folder (every user can upload files to this directory) in the root directory of the HDFS and then used two different non root accounts (user1 and user2) to upload files to this folder (one user does not have permission to edit the files of the other). Finally, I could reproduce the inconsistency. When the HDFS thash was disabled, I got permission denied when trying to delete the files with one of the non root accounts and when the trash was enabled I was able to move all the files to the trash folder. Although I cannot delete the files directly from the trash folder, they will be deleted when the deletion interval set in the Hadoop configuration is reached. I could not reproduce this issue in Hadoop 2.7.1, I got permission denied in both cases. I think this bug was fixed in newer versions of Hadoop.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=luisfernandoantonioli","name":"luisfernandoantonioli","key":"luisfernandoantonioli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luis Fernando Antonioli","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-10-01T17:34:49.692+0000","updated":"2015-10-01T17:34:49.692+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12826680/comment/15407456","id":"15407456","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cheersyang","name":"cheersyang","key":"cheersyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cheersyang&avatarId=23772","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cheersyang&avatarId=23772","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cheersyang&avatarId=23772","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cheersyang&avatarId=23772"},"displayName":"Weiwei Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hello [~eyang] and [~luisfernandoantonioli]\n\nI was able to reproduce this issue with following steps\n\nI created user1 and user2, they both belongs to users group\n{code}\nuid=1007(user1) gid=1007(user1) groups=1007(user1),100(users)\nuid=1009(user2) gid=1010(user2) groups=1010(user2),100(users)\n{code}\n\nAs super user,\n{code}\nsu hdfs\nhadoop fs -mkdir /BSS\nhadoop fs -chmod 777 /BSS\n{code}\n\nAs user1\n{code}\nsu user1\nhadoop fs -mkdir /BSS/user1/\nhadoop fs -put /tmp/test /BSS/user1/\nhadoop chmod 600 /BSS/user1/test\n\nhdfs dfs -ls -R /BSS\ndrwxr-xr-x   - user1 users          0 2016-08-11 18:06 /BSS/user1\n-rw-------   3 user1 users       4308 2016-08-11 18:06 /BSS/user1/test\n{code}\n\nAs user2, try to delete /BSS/user1 directory with -skipTrash, it gives permission denied error (expected)\n{code}\nsu user2\nhadoop dfs -rmr -skipTrash /BSS/user1/\nrmr: Permission denied: user=user2, access=ALL, inode=\"/BSS/user1\":user1:users:drwxr-xr-x\n{code}\n\ntry to delete the directory again without disabling trash, \n{code}\nsu user2\nhadoop dfs -rmr /BSS/user1/\n16/08/04 01:47:53 INFO fs.TrashPolicyDefault: Namenode trash configuration: Deletion interval = 360 minutes, Emptier interval = 0 minutes.\nMoved: 'hdfs://bdavm1542.svl.ibm.com:8020/BSS/user1' to trash at: hdfs://bdavm1542.svl.ibm.com:8020/user/user2/.Trash/Current\n{code}\ndirectory removed (unexpected). \n\nThis opens security hole that user is able to delete other user files, this should be fixed.

Also thinking on how to fix it. There are generally two options \n\n1) Trash now calls {{FileSystem.rename}} to move file/dir to trash dir, so it only checks rename permission. A fix is to add a new method to check if delete is permitted, expose that from FileSystem API so we can check if user has permission to delete before rename in trash code.\n\n2) Improve {{Emptier}} code logic to let emptier run per user, so even user removes somebody else stuff to trash, the emptier will still not be able to remove it because it's not permitted by this user. This is better than delete ... \n\nI personal prefer option 1 because 2 looks like a partial fix, we should avoid user moving things to trash if it is not allowed to at first place. \n\nAny suggestions ?

The 3 failed test case doesn't seem to be related, I can get them run successfully on my local environment. I'll try a closer look tomorrow and confirm if they are unrelated. \n\nThe patch added an option {{TO_TRASH}} in {{Options.Rename}}, to indicate if it is going to rename things to trash directory. In Instead of calling\n\n{{fs.rename(path, trashPath);}}\n\nin {{TrashPolicyDefault}}, calls \n\n{{fs.rename(path, trashPath, Rename.TO_TRASH);}}\n\nIf user removes things without skipping trash, instead of checking rename permission, it is going to check if delete is permitted. If it failed, move to trash will fail with a permission denied error to avoid user from removing files/dirs that it has no permission to.

The patch fixed the rename API by adding the permission check of delete when the destination is to the trash directory, this has to be fixed otherwise the it exposes the security hole that malicious user would use rename to move other people's file/dir to trash and subsequently got deleted.\n\nI lost track of this jira until I saw it being backported.  I'll reiterate, bluntly this time, that +this patch is completely worthless from a security perspective+.  It's an honor-system based sanity check for the good users.  A malicious user is never going to pass the flag to request the permission subcheck.  Why even hack fs -rm to remove the flag when you can just use fs -mv?\n\nbq.  Suppose userA has no privilege to delete fileB, directly FS.delete(fileB) will fail. However FS.rename(fileB, fileBinTrash) would success because it only checks the write access to parent of fileB and write access to ancestor of fileBinTrash.\n\nYes, rename/delete modify a directory which only requires write privs.  That's POSIX semantics.

It's an honor-system based sanity check for the good users. A malicious user is never going to pass the flag to request the permission subcheck. Why even hack fs -rm to remove the flag when you can just use fs -mv?\n\nThis fix is only fixed the internal code in fs, not exposed this flag to any clients. Because when trash is enabled, when user runs\n\n{{hdfs dfs -rm /path/to/file}}\n\nat backend, it is implemented by {{rename}} which only checks the privilege to {{rename}}. This behavior changes semantic under-cover which caused inconsistent behavior with or without {{-skipTrash}} flag, isn't it? The purpose of the fix is to prevent user to remove files which they don't have privilege to. More explanation is [here | https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8312?focusedCommentId=15407456&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15407456].\n\nbq.

If I have write privs to a directory, I can move anything in it to /tmp and it'll get blown away.\n\nThis is different, user uses {{mv}} to /tmp instead of what trash uses {{rm}}, so they know what they are doing and it still honors {{mv}} semantic. On the contrary, moving stuff to trash is using {{rm}} so if it doesn't check {{rm}} privilege seems inconsistent to me.\n\nPlease share your ideas if you agree this is a problem that we need to fix. In that case, if you have a better idea how to fix this, I would love to hear.\n\nThank you.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cheersyang","name":"cheersyang","key":"cheersyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cheersyang&avatarId=23772","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cheersyang&avatarId=23772","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cheersyang&avatarId=23772","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cheersyang&avatarId=23772"},"displayName":"Weiwei Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2017-05-17T01:12:11.579+0000","updated":"2017-05-17T01:12:11.579+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12826680/comment/16041889","id":"16041889","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"2.8.1 became a security release.
