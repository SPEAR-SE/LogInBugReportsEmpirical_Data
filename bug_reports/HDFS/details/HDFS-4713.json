For example, standby namenode talks to active namenode via NamenodeProtocol, where the server principal key is defined as DFS_NAMENODE_USER_NAME_KEY, \"dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal\".  The standby bootstrapping and checkpointing fail because the namenode proxy object has a conf with DFS_NAMENODE_USER_NAME_KEY set to itself.
