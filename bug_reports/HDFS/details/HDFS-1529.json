The difference between the handling in the two different methods is this:\n\nIn waitForAckedSeqno, the user thread is just blocked on an hflush() or flush before close - In this case throwing an exception will not leave the stream in an inconsistent state, and matches what one might expect: interrupting a thread blocked on IO will throw cause the thread to throw an exception. In waitAndQueueCurrentPacket() if we return early from that wait without an exception, we still leave the stream in a \"correct\" state. Keeping the interruption state flagged means the user will see the exception on the next operation.\n\nSince you gave +1 I'll commit as is, and if we want to clean this up we can do it
