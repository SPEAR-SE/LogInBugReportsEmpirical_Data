Checkpointer needed a bit more work to get the relevant information to the right to the needed function, but should work exactly the same.  I'm going to open a JIRA to combine this code duplication until the 2ndarryNN is removed.  \n\nKonstantin pointed out that this will be an incompatible change in that, were one specifying localhost as the 2nd/CP Nodes' address and relying on that value to be resolved on the node.  For now on, one will need to specify the exact address to use, which is much more correct in my opinion, particularly on production systems that may rely on IP aliasing.  I'll mark this as incompatible.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jghoman","name":"jghoman","key":"jghoman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318"},"displayName":"Jakob Homan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-06-08T22:39:17.466+0000","updated":"2010-06-08T22:39:17.466+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461191/comment/12876901","id":"12876901","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1. \nYes, this is incompatible in the sense that currently NN and SNN can communicate if SNN uses local host - the default value for its http address, while after the patch they wont be able to.
