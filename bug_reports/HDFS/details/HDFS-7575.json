Since HDFS-2832 the DataNodes have a unique storageId per storage directory which is just a random UUID.\n\nThey send reports per storage directory in their heartbeats. This heartbeat is processed on the NameNode in the {{DatanodeDescriptor#updateHeartbeatState}} method. Pre HDFS-2832 this would just store the information per Datanode. After the patch though each DataNode can have multiple different storages so it's stored in a map keyed by the storage Id.\n\nThis works fine for all clusters that have been installed post HDFS-2832 as they get a UUID for their storage Id. So a DN with 8 drives has a map with 8 different keys. On each Heartbeat the Map is searched and updated ({{DatanodeStorageInfo storage = storageMap.get(s.getStorageID());}}):\n\n{code:title=DatanodeStorageInfo}\n  void updateState(StorageReport r) {\n    capacity = r.getCapacity();\n    dfsUsed = r.getDfsUsed();\n    remaining = r.getRemaining();\n    blockPoolUsed = r.getBlockPoolUsed();\n  }\n{code}\n\nOn clusters that were upgraded from a pre HDFS-2832 version though the storage Id has not been rewritten (at least not on the four clusters I checked) so each directory will have the exact same storageId. That means there'll be only a single entry in the {{storageMap}} and it'll be overwritten by a random {{StorageReport}} from the DataNode. This can be seen in the {{updateState}} method above. This just assigns the capacity from the received report, instead it should probably sum it up per received heartbeat.\n\nThe Balancer seems to be one of the only things that actually uses this information so it now considers the utilization of a random drive per DataNode for balancing purposes.\n\nThings get even worse when a drive has been added or replaced as this will now get a new storage Id so there'll be two entries in the storageMap. As new drives are usually empty it skewes the balancers decision in a way that this node will never be considered over-utilized.\n\nAnother problem is that old StorageReports are never removed from the storageMap. So if I replace a drive and it gets a new storage Id the old one will still be in place and used for all calculations by the Balancer until a restart of the NameNode.\n\nI can try providing a patch that does the following:\n\n* Instead of using a Map I could just store the array we receive or instead of storing an array sum up the values for reports with the same Id\n* On each heartbeat clear the map (so we know we have up to date information)\n\nDoes that sound sensible?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12690971","id":"12690971","filename":"HDFS-7575.01.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit

It seems like the main thing we're testing here is just that when we start up, we're going to modify the VERSION files as expected.  We shouldn't even need any block files to test that, right?  Just a few mkdirs in a unit test.\n\nIf we check in the existing code, this 1.7 MB commit becomes part of the repo's history forever which slows down downloads and git pulls.  I also think that untarring things during a test is kind of sluggish as well.\n\nIt seems like we never needed these tar files to begin with.  We could just have the test open up the txt files and generate a temporary directory based on them.  If you want the blocks to have contents, we could just generate them with a fixed random seed using java.util.Random, and always get the same contents.\n\n{code}\n     if (this.layoutVersion > HdfsConstants.DATANODE_LAYOUT_VERSION) {\n+\n+      // Clusters previously upgraded from layout versions earlier than\n+      // ADD_DATANODE_AND_STORAGE_UUIDS failed to correctly generate a\n+      // new storage ID. We fix that now.\n+\n+      boolean haveValidStorageId =\n+          DataNodeLayoutVersion.supports(\n+              LayoutVersion.Feature.ADD_DATANODE_AND_STORAGE_UUIDS, layoutVersion) &&\n+              DatanodeStorage.isValidStorageId(sd.getStorageUuid());\n+\n       doUpgrade(datanode, sd, nsInfo);  // upgrade\n-      createStorageID(sd);\n+      if (createStorageID(sd, !haveValidStorageId)) {\n+        LOG.info(\"Generated new storageID \" + sd.getStorageUuid() +\n+                     \" for directory \" + sd.getRoot());\n+      }\n{code}\n\nIt would be good to add some logging for the various cases here.  If we are generating a new storage ID because the previous one was invalid, we should log that the previous one was invalid somewhere.\n\n{code}\n     if (this.layoutVersion > HdfsConstants.DATANODE_LAYOUT_VERSION) {\n{code}\n\nIs this \"if\" statement really valid?  It seems like right now, there are clusters out there that are on the latest layout version, but which don't have \"valid\" storage IDs.  We should either bump the DN layout version, or unconditionally check that the storage ID is valid, right?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Do you see any downside to doing so?\n\nThanks for taking a look at the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-09T19:50:53.998+0000","updated":"2015-01-09T19:50:53.998+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12764191/comment/14271963","id":"14271963","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Basically we are going from a layout where the storageID might not have been unique, to one where it is.  This is a change in the VERSION file.  It's nice to have the same guarantees that we usually do (that if the ugprade fails, you can roll back via the {{previous}} directory, and so forth.)  We could probably be more \"clever\" here and optimize this so we didn't have to hardlink the block files, but the upgrade path is already a little too \"clever\" and I think this is fine.\n\nRather than calling the new layout version UPGRADE_GENERATES_STORAGE_IDS, how about calling it something like UNIQUE_STORAGE_IDS or GUARANTEED_UNIQUE_STORAGE_IDS?  That describes what the new layout is, rather than what the process of upgrading is, consistent with our other layout version descriptions.\n\n{code}\n110    ... = new ClusterVerifier() {\n111\t      @Override\n112\t      public void verifyClusterPostUpgrade(MiniDFSCluster cluster) throws IOException {\n113\t        // Verify that a GUID-based storage ID was generated.\n114\t        final String bpid = cluster.getNamesystem().getBlockPoolId();\n115\t        StorageReport[] reports =\n116\t            cluster.getDataNodes().get(0).getFSDataset().getStorageReports(bpid);\n117\t        assertThat(reports.length, is(1));\n118\t        final String storageID = reports[0].getStorage().getStorageID();\n119\t        assertTrue(DatanodeStorage.isValidStorageId(storageID));\n120\t      }\n{code}\nIt seems like this exact code appears in 3 different tests.

StorageIDs aren't going to repeatedly morph - unless there's a UUID collision that you argue can't happen.  The important part is you always want unique storage ids.  It's an internal default of hdfs that is not up to the user to assign.

Changing the storage id is not incompatible.  Unique ids are the default for newly formatted nodes.

McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"So there are two approaches here:\n1. silently (i.e., without user intervention), dedupe duplicate storage IDs when starting up the DataNode\n2. create a new DataNode layout version and dedupe duplicate storage IDs during the upgrade.\n\nArguments in favor of approach #1:\n* Collisions might happen that we need to dedupe repeatly.  This argument seems specious since the probability is effectively less than the change of cosmic rays causing errors (as Nicholas pointed out).  I think the probabilities outlined here make this argument a non-starter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Random_UUID_probability_of_duplicates.  Also, approach #1 only dedupes on a single datanode, but there can be many datanodes in the cluster.\n\n* As Suresh pointed out, the old software can easily handle cases where the Storage IDs are unique.  So using a new layout version is not required to flip back and forth between old and new software.  While this is true, we have bumped the layout version in the past even when the old software could handle the new layout.  For example, HDFS-6482 added a new DN layout version even though the old software could use the new blockid-based layout.  So this argument is basically just saying \"approach #1 is viable.\"  But it doesn't tell us whether approach #1 is a good idea.\n\n* Nobody has made this argument yet, but you could argue that the upgrade process will be faster with approach #1 than approach #2.  However, we've done datanode layout version upgrades on production clusters in the past and time hasn't been an issue.  The JNI hardlink code (and soon, the Java7 hardlink code) eliminated the long delays that resulted from spawning shell commands.  So I don't think this argument is persuasive.\n\nArguments in favor of approach #2:\n* Changing the storage ID during startup basically changes storage ID from being a permanent identifier to a temporary one.  This seems like a small change, but I would argue that it's really a big one, architecturally.  For example, suppose we wanted to persist this information at some point.  We couldn't really do that if it's changing all the time.\n\n* With approach #1, we have to carry the burden of the dedupe code forever.  We can't ever stop deduping, even in Hadoop 3.0, because for all we know, the user has just upgraded, and was previously running 2.6 (a version with the bug) that we will have to correct.  The extra run time isn't an issue, but the complexity is.  What if our write to VERSION fails on one of the volume directories?  What do we do then?  And then if volume failures are tolerated, this directory could later come back and be an issue.  The purpose of layout versions is so that we don't have to think about these kind of \"mix and match\" issues.\n\n* Approach #1 leaves us open to some weird scenarios.  For example, what if I have /storage1 -> /foo and /storage2 -> /foo.  In other words, you have what appears to be two volume root directories, but it's really the same directory.  Approach #2 will complain, but approach #1 will happily rename the storageID of the /foo directory and continue with the corrupt configuration.

Recently we had a cluster with two datanodes connected to the same shared storage accidentally.  I guess you could argue that lock files should prevent problems here.  However, I do not like the idea of datanodes modifying VERSION on startup at all.  If one of the DNs had terminated before the other one tried to lock the directory, it would have succeeded.  And with the \"retry failed volume\" stuff, we probably have a wide window for this to happen.\n\nbq. We only change a storage ID when it is invalid but not changing the storage ID arbitrarily.

The code is for validating storage IDs (but not for de-duplication) and is very simple. It is good to keep.\n\nI agree that it is good to validate the storage IDs are unique.  But this is the same as when we validate that the cluster ID is correct, or the layout version is correct.  We don't change incorrect values to \"fix\" them.  If they're wrong then we need to find out why, not sweep the problem under the rug.\n\nAre there any practical arguments in favor of not doing a layout version change?  The main argument in favor of not changing the layout here I see is basically that this isn't a \"big enough\" change to merit a new LV.
