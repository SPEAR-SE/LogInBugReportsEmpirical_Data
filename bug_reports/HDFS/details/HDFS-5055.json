The issue was exactly what was described in HDFS-4304 - you couldn't set the 2NN HTTP address setting to the wildcard address since if the NN were to use that it obviously couldn't connect to the 2NN unless the two processes were co-located on the same machine.\n\nI think the best solution to this (and other) issues would be to switch to using an HTTP PUT or POST for the 2NN to send the fsimage back to the NN, instead of having the 2NN do a GET which in turn causes the NN to do another GET back to the 2NN. That's what's proposed in this JIRA: HDFS-3405.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
