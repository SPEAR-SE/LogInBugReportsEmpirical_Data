The file length is correct in both those cases so it's ok to use that. In the case of a still-being-written file, then isLastBlockComplete() returns false and the code works just same as it does today. The particular case that this patch is fixing is that a snapshotted file is frozen, so the file length is the limit of what should be checksummed, not the block lengths (which include the non-snapshotted portion). I've added more assertions in the test to demonstrate this.\n\nIn other words, the behavior for non-snapshotted files that are still open (and possibly being appended to) is not changed by this patch, only that of snapshotted files, for which isLastBlockComplete() is a valid check.\n\nHDFS-5343 took a similar approach.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clamb","name":"clamb","key":"clamb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Charles Lamb","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2015-01-27T17:20:47.864+0000","updated":"2015-01-27T17:20:47.864+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770179/comment/14294146","id":"14294146","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

My main concern is that the patch is just a partial fix, since it cannot cover the case that the file is snapshotted but still being written. \n\nbq. In other words, the behavior for non-snapshotted files that are still open (and possibly being appended to) is not changed by this patch, only that of snapshotted files, for which isLastBlockComplete() is a valid check.\n\nThe behavior for snapshotted files that are still open also have not been changed.\n\nActually for a snapshotted file, {{blockLocations.getFileLength}} should equal to the file length explicitly recorded in the snapshot diff. If there is not such length recorded, {{blockLocations.getFileLength}} should be the current file length including the last uc block's length (please read the current code to confirm). In that case, the check condition should be \"if the src is a snapshot path\", and we should use {{blockLocations.getFileLength}} as the limit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-05T21:15:33.292+0000","updated":"2015-02-05T21:15:33.292+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770179/comment/14316415","id":"14316415","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clamb","name":"clamb","key":"clamb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Charles Lamb","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"[~jingzhao],\n\nThanks for the comments.
