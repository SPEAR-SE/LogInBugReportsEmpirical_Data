I have some doubts here:\n\n*  {{FSConstants}} has been marked as deprecated since 0.23 which is 4 years ago. The compatibility guide allows removing deprecated code in the next major release. It allows cleaning up code and moving things forward. Notably, we removed hftp and JSP in trunk which makes things much simpler.\n* Even we don't remove {{FSConstants}}, the class itself extends {{HdfsConstants}} which is annotated as private. As {{HdfsConstants}} continues to evolve, HBase might hit other issues down the road.\n\nI have no problems of bringing it back in branch-2 (after all it is just a very small piece of code). My feeling is that to avoid further complication, it might be beneficial to investigate how HBase uses the class and to derive a cleaner solution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-20T01:05:33.440+0000","updated":"2015-05-20T01:05:33.440+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12820635/comment/14551615","id":"14551615","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtCarrera9","name":"gtCarrera9","key":"gtcarrera9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Li Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm fine with reverting those changes back into branch-2.
