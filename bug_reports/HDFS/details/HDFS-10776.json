features. As we have seen in HDFS-9395 and the 2.7.3 release discussions in the mailing list, even bug fixes are tricky since some users may get greatly impacted by the resulting incompatibility. The goal of this jira is to clarify what the hdfs audit logging should do and discuss potential approaches that will allows us to move forward.\n\n1) What is the correct way of doing the hdfs audit logging? This was discussed in HDFS-9395, but needs to be revisited as there were discussions on the fix being made with wrong assumptions. What needs to be fixed, if HDFS-9395 is incorrect or incomplete?\n2) What if a single standard cannot satisfy everyone?

The audit log should be a record of successful or unauthorized access to data - not a debug record of every attempted operation.
