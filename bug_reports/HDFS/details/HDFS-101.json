Similar problem exists on DataNode as well and it is fixed in HADOOP-3339. From HADOOP-3339 : \n\n\"The main issue is that BlockReceiver thread (and DataStreamer in the case of DFSClient) interrupt() the 'responder' thread. But interrupting is a pretty coarse control. We don't know what state the responder is in and interrupting has different effects depending on responder state. To fix this properly we need to redesign how we handle these interactions.\"\n\nWhen the first datanode closes its socket from DFSClient, DFSClient should properly read all the data left in the socket.. Also, DataNode's closing of the socket should not result in a TCP reset, otherwise I think DFSClient will not be able to read from the

I suspect the key problem here is the following (as described in the description) and it's orthogonal to how a DN reports its downstream errors.\n  - When the first datanode closes its socket from DFSClient, DFSClient should properly read all the data left in the socket.. Also, DataNode's closing of the socket should not result in a TCP reset, otherwise I think DFSClient will not be able to read from the socket.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kzhang","name":"kzhang","key":"kzhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kan Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-12-07T18:58:29.978+0000","updated":"2009-12-07T18:58:29.978+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12396337/comment/12787120","id":"12787120","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"> When the first datanode closes its socket from DFSClient, DFSClient should properly read all the data left in the socket..\nKan, thanks for pointing this out, which is a very valid point.

Here's the test setup:\n\n- Cluster is with 3 DNs, running on EC2.\n- On DN at 10.251.43.82, I have dfs.data.dir pointing at two volumes. One has 150M remaining. On the other nodes, there is plenty of disk space. I've set dfs.du.reserved to 0 on the small-disk volume.\n- From a separate node, I try to upload a 100M file. As soon as it starts uploading, I issue a \"dd\" command on 10.251.43.82 to fill up the small volume (causing the disk to fill up while the local DN is writing to that volume)\n- If this patch works correctly, it should figure out that .82 is the problem node, and recover the pipeline to the other two nodes in the cluster. It should never eject a different node from the pipeline.\n\nAlthough the write did succeed, it incorrectly decided .148 was the bad datanode even though .82 experienced the failure.
