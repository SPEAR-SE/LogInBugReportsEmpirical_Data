This makes audit logging for the ACL APIs consistent with what we already do for {{setPermission}}.  We'll log the path, the operation name, and the permissions after execution of the operation.  The existing audit logging relies on {{FsPermission#toString}}, and we've already updated that method in a prior patch to append '+' if there is an ACL present.  I also noticed that {{FSNamesystem#setAcl}} was missing its edit log sync, so I added that.\n\nI also considered the possibility of putting the full ACL into the audit log entries.  However, that could cause some very long audit log lines.  I estimate an extra ~600 characters for an inode that uses the maximum of 32 ACL entries.  There is also the matter of changing a lot of existing operations to fetch the ACL just for the sake of logging.  Let's not do this right now, and we can always revisit it later if it's requested.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-21T22:15:01.520+0000","updated":"2014-01-21T22:15:01.520+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12689652/comment/13879400","id":"13879400","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 for the patch.
