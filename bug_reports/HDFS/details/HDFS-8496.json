By looking at the stack, we found the calling of stopWriter() with FSDatasetImpl lock blocked everything.\n\nFollowing is the heartbeat stack, as an example, to show how threads are blocked by FSDatasetImpl lock:\n{code}\n   java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.FsVolumeImpl.getDfsUsed(FsVolumeImpl.java:152)\n        - waiting to lock <0x00000007701badc0> (a org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.FsDatasetImpl)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.FsVolumeImpl.getAvailable(FsVolumeImpl.java:191)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.FsDatasetImpl.getStorageReports(FsDatasetImpl.java:144)\n        - locked <0x0000000770465dc0> (a java.lang.Object)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.sendHeartBeat(BPServiceActor.java:575)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.offerService(BPServiceActor.java:680)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor.run(BPServiceActor.java:850)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)\n{code}\n\nThe thread which held the FSDatasetImpl lock is just sleeping to wait another thread to exit in stopWriter(). The stack is:\n{code}\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (on object monitor)\n        at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)\n        at java.lang.Thread.join(Thread.java:1194)\n        - locked <0x00000007636953b8> (a org.apache.hadoop.util.Daemon)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.ReplicaInPipeline.stopWriter(ReplicaInPipeline.java:183)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.FsDatasetImpl.recoverCheck(FsDatasetImpl.java:982)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.FsDatasetImpl.recoverClose(FsDatasetImpl.java:1026)\n        - locked <0x00000007701badc0> (a org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.FsDatasetImpl)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataXceiver.writeBlock(DataXceiver.java:624)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.datatransfer.Receiver.opWriteBlock(Receiver.java:137)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.datatransfer.Receiver.processOp(Receiver.java:74)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataXceiver.run(DataXceiver.java:235)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)\n{code}\n\nIn this case, we deployed quite a lot other workloads on the DN, the local file system and disk is quite busy. We guess this is why the stopWriter took quite a long time.\nAny way, it is not quite reasonable to call stopWriter with the FSDatasetImpl lock held.   In HDFS-7999, the createTemporary() is changed to call stopWriter without FSDatasetImpl lock. We guess we should do so in the other three methods: recoverClose()/recoverAppend/recoverRbw().\n\nI'll try to finish a patch for this today.
