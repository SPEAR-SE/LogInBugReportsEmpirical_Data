I did a review and below are my comments.\n\n1. There are the following scenarios:\na. mv fileX fileY (fileY is a child of the same snapshot root)\nb. mv fileX fileY (fileY is not a child of the same snapshot root)\nc. mv fileX fileY, take snapshot, mv fileY fileX\nd. delete fileX\nwhere b/d can be handled same way, and a/c can be handled same way. HDFS-10797 already has a unit test, I'm not sure whether it covers all scenario, if not, we can extend the test to cover these scenarios. So to trace the behavior of the changed code to see if that the code works as expected for different scenarios.\n\n2. The following code covers scenario c, it seems the calculation {{computeContentSummary}} done in this {{if}} branch is already done before this code is reached, and we should not call it again here.
