My main concern is that we're relying on QueryStringDecoder#path to give us a raw path so URI can decode it properly.  The javadoc for that method says it returns a decoded path, and if that were ever fixed to match the javadoc then we'd end up double-decoding which will break for some paths.  It also seems weird to me that we're using a QueryStringDecoder to obtain parts of the URL that aren't query strings.  I think it would be safer to avoid QueryStringDecoder altogether for the path computation and just pass the original request URI string to the URI constructor for path decoding.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-20T23:54:15.457+0000","updated":"2015-02-20T23:54:15.457+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776489/comment/14329869","id":"14329869","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This is well-defined. If the WebHDFS client happens to diverge from it, it should be considered as a bug instead of a feature that needs to be backward-compatible.\nThis is not the first time this problem was discovered and discussed. The original webhdfs design is flawed, but we cannot ignore the compatibility.  IMO, maintaining compatibility takes precedence over being standard compliant, because things stop working and business are impacted.\n\nI think we should definitely fix webhdfs to be RFC3986 compliant, but it must be done in a way that avoids any breakages due to incompatibility. However, this jira is intended for making things continue to work in the short term, as such I suggest we open a new jira and continue discussion there.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-23T15:22:20.172+0000","updated":"2015-02-23T15:22:20.172+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776489/comment/14333392","id":"14333392","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Filed HDFS-7822.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-23T15:26:57.872+0000","updated":"2015-02-23T15:26:57.872+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776489/comment/14336700","id":"14336700","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"[~wheat9], are you okay with restoring the compatibility here and address the standard-compliance in HDFS-7822?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-25T16:25:33.458+0000","updated":"2015-02-25T16:25:33.458+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776489/comment/14336890","id":"14336890","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. maintaining compatibility takes precedence over being standard compliant, because things stop working and business are impacted.\n\nIMO this is a bug of implementing the spec instead of a feature.

Just take a few examples:\n\n* Microsoft .NET SDK For Hadoop (http://hadoopsdk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=WebHDFS%20Client)\n* Python (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/WebHDFS/0.2.0)\n* Proxy-based solutions, like Knox and HttpFS\n* Reverse proxy standing in front of WebHDFS\n\nThis bug prevents all of the above libraries working properly.
