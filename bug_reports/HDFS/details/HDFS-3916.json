And, apologies if I cite any issues you've addressed in the attached patch, I'm just reading SVN commit 1382836.\n\n* nearly all uses of strcat should be replaced by strncat or similar bounded copy routines.\n* {{sizeof(char)}} is defined to be 1, so code like {{u = malloc((uriLen + 1) * (sizeof(char)));}} should be {{u = malloc(uriLen++ 1);}}\n{code}\n+int checkIfRedirect(const char *const headerstr, const char *content, const char *operation) {\n...\n+    if(headerstr == '\\0' || strncmp(headerstr,\"HTTP/\", 5)) {\n{code}\nComparing a pointer {{headerstr}} against the character constant {{'\\0'}} is probably wrong.  I can't tell if the coder intended to handle {{headerstr == NULL}} or {{headerstr[0] == '\\0'}}.\n{code}\n+    while (DnLocation && strncmp(DnLocation, \"Location:\", strlen(\"Location:\"))) {\n+        DnLocation = strtok_r(NULL, delims, &savepter);\n+    }\n+    if (!DnLocation) {\n+        return NULL;\n+    }\n+    DnLocation = strstr(DnLocation, \"http\");\n{code}\nUsing strstr here will not correctly handle a URL like \"ftp://http.foo.com\".  It should skip whitespace and check the beginning of the word for \"http\", or something like that.\n{code}\n+        des = pthread_cond_destroy(&buffer->transfer_finish);\n+        if (des == EBUSY) {\n+            fprintf(stderr, \"The condition transfer_finish is still referenced!\\n\");\n+        } else if (des == EINVAL) {\n+            fprintf(stderr, \"The condition transfer_finish is invalid!\\n\");\n+        }\n{code}\nPlease use strerror and consistently handle all errors, rather than silently discarding unexpected error values.\n\n{code}\n+            newAddr[strlen(bld->nn) - strlen(lastColon)] = '\\0';\n{code}\nThat assignment is terrifying, it would be very easy for a nonobvious bug to cause this calculation to end up outside of the buffer and overwrite other memory.  In general libwebhdfs has way too much \"clever\" (dangerous) string processing code.\n\n{code}\n+        absPath = (char *)malloc(strlen(path) + 1);\n{code}\nNo need to cast the return value of malloc in C code.\n\n{code}\n+int hdfsExists(hdfsFS fs, const char *path)\n+{\n+    hdfsFileInfo *fileInfo = hdfsGetPathInfo(fs, path);\n+    if (fileInfo) {\n+        hdfsFreeFileInfo(fileInfo, 1);\n+        return 0;\n+    } else {\n+        return -1;\n+    }\n{code}\nBoolean functions in C should return 0 for false and 1 for true.
