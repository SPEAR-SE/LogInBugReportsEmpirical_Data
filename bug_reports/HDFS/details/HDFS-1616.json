Should also work inside Grunt/etc.{{.}}\n\nTo programmatically call {{fs}} sub-functions, it would be wise use the Hadoop's {{FileSystem}} API directly in your language instead. There are Python bindings for HDFS available, to start with, apart from the Java one provided.\n\nRegarding glob differences in Shell/Hadoop, there isn't really a standard available to conform to (please correct me if I'm wrong).
