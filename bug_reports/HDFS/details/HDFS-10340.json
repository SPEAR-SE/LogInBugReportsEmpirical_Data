Whoever the sender is, you should be able to catch it with the systemtap instrumentation.\n\nWe have had similar issues due to stale pid files, but that can't be it if no service was (re)started at that time. \n\nbq. if user of DataNode is same with NodeManager, maybe it is related with YARN-4459\nAre you saying that your cluster is configured this way? If so, I agree YARN-4459 is a good candidate. If not, we are back to square one.  In any case, the systemtap instrumentation should help identifying the source of the signal.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-08-23T13:56:21.221+0000","updated":"2016-08-23T13:56:21.221+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12963408/comment/15434106","id":"15434106","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=magnum","name":"magnum","key":"magnum","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"KWON BYUNGCHANG","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"body":"Yes. my cluster was configured same user of DataNode and Nodemanager due to my infrastructure have some limitation.\nanyway I have figured it out using YARN-4459.\n\n[~kihwal] Thank you for your advice.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=magnum","name":"magnum","key":"magnum","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"KWON BYUNGCHANG","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"created":"2016-08-24T02:52:01.373+0000","updated":"2016-08-24T02:52:01.373+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-10340/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2ww0f:"}}
