What's the advantage of this fix vs just making cleanUp (which should be renamed) only roll the log at the appropriate interval?

Do you agree that the invariant (that we should never get a scanner for a block pool with no scanner) should hold? If yes please file a follow on jira to address this case and the other uses (where the invariant might hold as well). If not, then note that printBlockReport and getNextBPScanner do *not* check for null so they will NPE and we should fix them. Also, looks like the test checks the return value to see if the scanners are initialized yet. Either way we can handle it in a separate jira.\n\nAlso per my previous comment please file the jira for the proposed refactoring.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-09-06T05:00:18.517+0000","updated":"2012-09-06T05:00:18.517+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604270/comment/13449452","id":"13449452","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2754 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2754/])\n    HDFS-3828.
