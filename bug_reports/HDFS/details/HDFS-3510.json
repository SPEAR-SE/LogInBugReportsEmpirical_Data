It would be good add a brief description of the solution you are proposing. That way there is no need for looking at the code to understand the proposal.\n\nLet me give a high level overview.  As you know, we don't want corrupt edit logs.  They are bad.  One way that an edit log can become corrupt is by ending with an edit log operation that is cut off in the middle.  This is what happens when you are writing to the edit log, and you get \"cut off\" in the middle by a disk full condition.\n\nWhen it's done properly, preallocation solves this problem by making sure that we have enough space before starting the write.  In this case, we maintain the invariant that all of the current batch of edits are written out, or none of them are, even when the disk starts getting close to full.\n\nPreallocation was introduced by Dhruba Borthakur in HADOOP-2330 in 2008.  At that time, the motivation was better edit log performance, rather than preventing partial edit log operations at the end of the file.  So it is perhaps understandable that the original scheme doesn't guarantee that preallocation will always happen before the write.  However, it has become clear over time that when preallocation isn't done, corrupt edit logs are all too common when the disk runs out of space.\n\nIf you're curious why we fill with 0xff rather than 0x00, check out HDFS-1846.\n\nHope that helps.\n\ncheers,\nColin","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Preallocation was introduced by Dhruba Borthakur in HADOOP-2330 in 2008.\nI know this quite well and hence was pointing out that the description of this jira needs to be updated. BTW please address my earlier comment about updating the description of the jira. Instead of saying preallocation is flawed, you may want to state that it can be improved to avoid partial writes during disk becoming full. Please also update the current jira title \"Fix FSEditLog pre-allocation\" to \"Improve FSEditLog pre-allocation\".\n\nSome comments on the patch:\n# Please retain the pre-allocation method in EditLogFileOutputStream. This functionality does not belong in EditsDoubleBuffer.\n# {{fc.position(fc.position() - 1); // skip back the end-of-file marker}} - is no longer required?\n# Please add the debug logs back - it is useful for debugging.\n\nUnder heavy load/long disk i/o times, you could still see a large number of edits batched and synced together. Some of the editlog operations such as Close operation can be quite large.

Because the end-of-file marker is 0xff, in those days we needed to explicitly add the 0xff before the padding.  This should no longer be necessary after HDFS-1846.

TestEditLogFileOutputStream: You do not need try finally. @Before method deleted the file.\n\nThe @Before method only runs once, before all the junit tests in TestEditLogFileOutputStream are executed.  The reason why it's there is that EditLogFileOutputStream always appends to the end of a file; it never truncates.  So if there is garbage in the test directory before the test begins, it's very important to remove it.  But the tests also have to clean up after themselves, since the @Before method only runs once, not between individual junit tests.  It makes more sense to do this in a try... finally block so that the failure of one test does not cause all of them to fail.\n\nI agree with the rest of the comments.
