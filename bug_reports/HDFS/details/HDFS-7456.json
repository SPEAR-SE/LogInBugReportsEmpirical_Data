Here is a review of the current patch:\n# {{AclFeature}}: Now that {{entries}} is an {{int[]}}, we need to update {{equals}} and {{hashCode}} to use {{Arrays#equals}} and {{Arrays#hashCode}}.\n# {{Interner}}: There are 2 calls to {{WeakReference#get}}.  The first is done for a null check, and the second is to return the referent.  If there is a garbage collection in between the 2 calls, then this could cause the method to return {{null}}, and the caller likely would hit a {{NullPointerException}} some time later.\n# I'm looking back at the code for the Guava interner implementation that I was using in the original HDFS-5620 patch that we abandoned.  That code is shown here: https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/source/browse/guava/src/com/google/common/collect/Interners.java .  I had been critical of the spinlock, but I now realize that this implementation has another nice benefit.  It uses a dummy value in the map instead of the key wrapped in a {{WeakReference}}.  This saves on memory, because it avoids the need for the extra layer of pointers going through {{WeakReference}}.  As a side effect, it needs a spinlock, but in our usage, I expect little contention on the spin lock.  We would only spin in the presence of multiple concurrent ACL modification operations.  Reads wouldn't cause a spin.\n# The new tests create a few new ACLs and assert that we only create a new instance if needed.  This is great.  I'd also like to add tests that remove all references to an ACL and then assert that the instance count goes down.  Of course, that could be a flaky test if we're relying on the GC, so that leads me to...\n\nIn general, my current thinking on this is that we should avoid implementing an interner at all and instead implement it as a reference-counted set, i.e. {{Map<AclEntry, Long>}}.  The value type would need to be {{Long}} for agreement with the definition of inode ID.  Unlike an interner, we'd need to hook code into both creation and removal instead of relying on weak references and GC to cover removal for us.  Fortunately, that's a very easy thing for ACLs, because we already have the hook points we need.  {{INodeWithAdditionalFields#addAclFeature}} can do the add, and {{INodeWithAdditionalFields#removeAclFeature}} can do the remove.  We know both operations are done under the namesystem write lock, so I don't see any tricky concurrency challenges.  This might end up being a larger total patch compared to the interner, but I think it's simpler code overall compared to reasoning through weak references and GC.  As another benefit, we'll be able to write reliable tests of the removal case, because we'll be able to get a deterministic count out of the {{Map}}.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this.  Thanks again for all of your recent ACL patches!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-05T19:34:09.717+0000","updated":"2014-12-05T19:34:09.717+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12758609/comment/14235976","id":"14235976","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"On a side note, the same techniques are applicable to {{XAttrFeature}}, though I don't know if anyone has enough experience with real-world xattr usage yet to tell if they tend to experience a high degree of duplication in the values like ACLs do.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-05T19:38:33.685+0000","updated":"2014-12-05T19:38:33.685+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12758609/comment/14237542","id":"14237542","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~cnauroth] for the suggestions and comments.\nAttaching the patch with {{ReferenceCountMap}} implementation.

Here are a few comments.\n\n# In {{ReferenceCountMap#put}}, I see a way to avoid the {{instanceof}} pre-condition check and the 2 downcasts.  Change the class type parameter to {{E extends ReferenceCounter}} and then change the type definition of the map to {{Map<E, E>}}.  That way, the constraint is enforced at compile time.\n# Please annotate the new class as {{Private}}.\n# Thank you for covering the case of deleting inodes too!\n# Can we please add some additional tests in {{FSAclBaseTest}} and {{TestAclWithSnapshot}}?  On some of these, it might be easier to insert new assertions within existing tests instead of writing whole new tests.  This is perhaps a bit paranoid, but here is the list of additional test cases I came up with, mostly focused on maintaining correct reference counts:\n## Deleting a file with ACL decrements the reference count.\n## Modifying a directory's ACL decrements the reference count of the old ACL and increments the reference count of the new ACL.\n## Modifying a file's ACL decrements the reference count of the old ACL and increments the reference count of the new ACL.\n## Deleting a snapshot where the root directory references an ACL decrements the reference count.\n## Deleting a snapshot where a contained sub-directory references an ACL decrements the reference count.\n## Deleting a snapshot where a contained file references an ACL decrements the reference count.\n## After creating a snapshot, modifying the ACL of the root directory decrements the reference count of the old ACL and increments the reference count of the new ACL.\n## After creating a snapshot, modifying the ACL of a contained sub-directory decrements the reference count of the old ACL and increments the reference count of the new ACL.\n## After creating a snapshot, modifying the ACL of a contained file decrements the reference count of the old ACL and increments the reference count of the new ACL.\n## After creating a snapshot that contains both directories and files with ACLs, and then deleting the original directory, check that the reference counts still show the snapshotted inodes are referencing their ACLs.\n## Restart the NameNode.

This is looking good, and the tests are very thorough.  I have just a few more nitpicks.\n\nIn {{INodeAttributes}}, was it necessary to change the {{SnapshotCopy}} constructor?  The new version has a slight disadvantage in that calling {{INode#getPermissionStatus}} constructs a new intermediate {{PermissionStatus}}, which then has to get translated back to {{long}} representation immediately.  It will generate some additional garbage.\n\nIn {{FSAclBaseTest}}, perhaps it's more appropriate to rename {{startSize}} to {{currentSize}}, since it gets incremented in the test when new instances get created.\n\nIn the NameNode restart tests, we have the limitation that reference counts are not maintained between restarts, because the data is {{static}}.  I think it's important to be able to test this though.  Even though the reference counts won't be decremented during shutdown, we should know the expected delta of increments done on each feature during the subsequent startup.  Can we add assertions for that?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-20T00:46:32.981+0000","updated":"2014-12-20T00:46:32.981+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12758609/comment/14254949","id":"14254949","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Addressed above comments.\nThanks Again Chris for the suggestion of verifying the counts.
