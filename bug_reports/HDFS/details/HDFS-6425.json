Given all the DNs are marked as blockContentsStale after NN fail overs, rescanPostponedMisreplicatedBlocks isn't going to find many blocks to remove until majority of DNs send their blockreports.\n2. Normally it is ok to not remove stay over replicated right away. So rescanPostponedMisreplicatedBlocks can wait until most if not all of the DN storages aren't marked as blockContentsStale anymore.\n\nIdeas on how to fix it:\n\nRescan postponed blocks only after all/most of DN storages aren't marked as blockContentsStale anymore. In that way, postponed blocks won't impact BR until most of DNs have sent BRs. After that, postponed blocks will be drained steadily. We can do it in a background thread instead of during BR call.\n\nAlternatively, [~lohit] and I also discussed using HashMap to store postponed blocks, keyed by DN storage, that means each BR doesn't need to scan the whole set and thus improve the performance.\n\nSuggestions?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-01T22:57:16.564+0000","updated":"2014-08-01T22:57:16.564+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12714939/comment/14085152","id":"14085152","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here is the initial patch.\n\n1.

This jira can address more common NN failover scenario with lots of \"content stale\" storages.\n\nWe try to get storages out of \"content stale\"  as soon as possible. Here are several scenarios.\n\na. For non-HA NN restart, have DN send HB before BR right after registration.\nb. For HA setup, NN becomes active right after it restarts. This can happen if we have to restart both NNs at the same time, due to some rare outage or some incompatible upgrade. In this case, the active NN will first go to standby, then get transitioned to active at which point all DNs will be marked as stale again. For big clusters, most of the DN reregistration will come in after the NN becomes active, so the fix to have DNs send HB and BR right after registration will also help.\nc. For HA setup, NN becomes active after the NN JVM has been up for some time. The failover could happen due to zk session timeout, or the other NN just crashes. In this case, there is no DN reregistration given the new active NN doesn't have recent restart. We can change the NN to ask DN to resend blockreport upon failover, but that will cause cluster performance issue.\n\nSo we still have some scenario where we might have lots of \"content stale\" storages. This jira tries to make NN handle the scenario better.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-07T22:34:34.414+0000","updated":"2014-08-07T22:34:34.414+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12714939/comment/14093366","id":"14093366","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated patch for latest trunk.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mingma","name":"mingma","key":"mingma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ming Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-11T21:48:37.980+0000","updated":"2014-08-11T21:48:37.980+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12714939/comment/14093558","id":"14093558","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

In rescanPostponedMisreplicatedBlocks, instead of always picking the first blocksPerRescan blocks, the new version randomly selects blocksPerRescan consecutive blocks. This is to handle the case if for some reason some datanodes remain in content stale state for a long time and only impact the first blocksPerRescan blocks.\n\nThis new version has been running on our production clusters for couple months.\n\nRegarding the root cause of over replication. We did some analysis a while back. It could be due to the IBR scenario you mentioned. There are also other sources.\n\n1. Load balancer could create spike of over replication in our clusters.\n2. As part of machine repair process, we used to bring \"unformatted\" machines back the cluster.\n3. It appears right after NN startup and leave safe mode but before all DNs send blockreport, NN will consider some blocks under replicated and start replication process.
