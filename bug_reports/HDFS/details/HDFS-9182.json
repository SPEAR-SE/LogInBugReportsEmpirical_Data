EI_EXPOSE_REP,EI_EXPOSE_REP2 type comments as as already added them in hadoop-hdfs-project.After moving to hfs-client project we should add file names explicitly.\n \n2) DFSOutputStream#currentPacket inconsistent synchronization because enqueueCurrentPacketFull is package scoped and a non synchronized method, here it is accessing currentPacket. This is the concern for findbags. Currently enqueueCurrentPacketFull called only in writeChunk which is already synchronized, so logically there is no issue. But to exclude such comments options to mention the field name which can avoid the comment, but the issue is it may suppress future warnings as well. So to make windbags happy I just made enqueueCurrentPacketFull synchronized, I think its ok.\n\n3) Merged the HDFS-7285 related CHANGES.txt to main CHANGES.txt.\nI also took chance to place two of the issue entries in CHANGES.txt, which was placed wrongly like HDFS lira entry in Common and vise versa.\n Following 2 are such type: \n  HADOOP-11921. Enhance tests for erasure coders. (Kai Zheng)\n  HDFS-8557. Allow to configure RS and XOR raw coders (Kai Zheng)\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-06T05:09:36.318+0000","updated":"2015-10-06T05:09:36.318+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12901747/comment/14944537","id":"14944537","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\\\\\n\\\\\n| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:red}-1{color} | patch |   0m  0s | The patch command could not apply the patch during dryrun. |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Subsystem || Report/Notes ||\n| Patch URL | http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12765129/HDFSS-9182.00.patch |\n| Optional Tests | javadoc javac unit findbugs checkstyle |\n| git revision | trunk / 5f6edb3 |\n| Console output | https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/12807/console |\n\n\nThis message was automatically generated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-10-06T05:39:48.654+0000","updated":"2015-10-06T05:39:48.654+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12901747/comment/14945478","id":"14945478","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for all the fix, [~umamaheswararao]!
