So let's say I am writing to pipeline A,B,C. I first write a good packet (512) bytes, then I write a packet with bad checksum. This gets written to disk on A and B without verifying checksum. C verifies the checksum, gets the error, and forwards it back up the chain. The client then drops C from the pipeline and initiates recovery. The recovery process gets the replica info on A and B, both of which have length 1024 at this point. So it recovers the block to a length that includes the bad checksum chunk, when we reopen the file, we have issues.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-06-23T20:24:49.962+0000","updated":"2010-06-23T20:24:49.962+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467743/comment/12881944","id":"12881944","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"It turns out this is very similar to HDFS-679.
