Thank you for thorough analysis!\n\nWhat I'm doing in 01 patch is to trigger the *second* time blockReport so the corrupted block can get deleted on dn1. So ReplicationMonitor can schedule copying the block to dn1.\n\nbq. To trigger block report or not before restarting DataNodes...\n\nThat's not what I do. In the 01 patch, checkBlockRecovery(p) will make sure truncation is completed. triggerBlockReports() is for *second* time blockReport.\n{code}\n    cluster.waitActive();\n    checkBlockRecovery(p);\n    ...\n    assertEquals(newBlock.getBlock().getGenerationStamp(),\n        oldBlock.getBlock().getGenerationStamp() + 1);\n\n+    cluster.triggerBlockReports();\n     // Wait replicas come to 3\n     DFSTestUtil.waitReplication(fs, p, REPLICATION);\n{code}\n\nbq. it is very possible that the truncate can be done before the restarting.\nThat's very unlikely, because fs.truncate(p, newLength); is non-blocking.\n{code}\n    boolean isReady = fs.truncate(p, newLength); // non-blocking\n    assertFalse(isReady);\n\n    cluster.restartDataNode(dn0, true, true); // shutdown, restart and sends registration\n    cluster.restartDataNode(dn1, true, true); // shutdown, restart and sends registration\n    cluster.waitActive(); // wait until dn0,dn1 got response from NN about the registration\n// dn0 or dn1 got DNA_RECOVERY command\n{code}\n\nbq. So maybe a quick fix is to change the total number of DN from 3 to 4.\nIt works too. I prefer my approach. Even though with my approach the time spending on DFSTestUtil.waitReplication(..) is 4-6 seconds longer. (waiting deletion and copy)\nIt worth it. Because the purpose of the test case is to schedule block recovery to dn0/dn1, which got restarted. Increasing the number of DNs will lower the chance.\n\nUploaded 02 patch. add {{Thread.sleep(2000)}} to make sure it's the second BR.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=walter.k.su","name":"walter.k.su","key":"walter.k.su","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Walter
