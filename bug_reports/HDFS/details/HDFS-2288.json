If the local DN has an older genstamp than what the client requests, it will throw an IOE in FSDataset.getReplicaVisibleLength\n- If all of the DNs crashed at the same time, and the client didn't update the generation stamp, then the replicas may have different lengths.

It is replica (not block) specific, meaning it can be different for different replicas at a given time. In the document it is called BA (bytes acknowledged), compared to BR (bytes received).\n\nIf we have 3 replicas: r1, r2, r3 then all of them could have received the same number of bytes:\nr1.BR = r2.BR = r3.BR, \nbut visible lengths are different, because r3 hasn't acknowledged the latest packet to r2 and r1. Until then\nr3.BA = r3.BR\nr2.BA = r2.BR - p\nr1.BA = r1.BR - p\nwhere p is the packet length.\n\nNow when a client reads a byte it first verifies with one of the replicas, suppose it was r3, if the byte is visible. The last-received-byte is visible in r3, and this means the client can read it from any replica. When the client reads the last-received-byte from r1, it sends to r1 the visible length obtained from r3. DN containing r1 realizes that the client has already confirmed with another replica, that the byte was visible there, and lets the client read that byte, even though it is not yet locally visible.\n\nSo our consistency guarantee is that after a client had read a byte from one replica that client (or any other knowledgeable of the fact) can read that same byte from any other replica.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-03-09T09:24:04.473+0000","updated":"2012-03-09T09:24:04.473+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12520148/comment/13228685","id":"13228685","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Rosolve as invalid.

The above definition by Konst and the design doc which defines it as property of the replica:\n\n{quote}\nvisible length is the \"number of bytes that have been acknowledged by the downstream DataNodes\". It is replica (not block) specific, meaning it can be different for different replicas at a given time. In the document it is called BA (bytes acknowledged), compared to BR (bytes received).\n{quote}\n\n2. Nicholas' definition in HDFS-814 and DFSClient#getVisibleLength which defines it as a property of a file:\n\n{quote}\nThe visible length is the length that *all* datanodes in the pipeline contain at least such amount of data. Therefore, these data are visible to the readers.\n{quote}\n\nAccording to this definition the visible length of a file is the floor of all visible lengths of all the replicas of the last block. It's a static property set on open, eg is not updated when a writer calls hflush. Also DFSInputStream#readBlockLength returns the 1st visible length of a replica it finds, so it seems possible (though unlikely) in a failure scenario it could return a length that was longer than what all replicas had.\n\nPerhaps we should rename DFSClient#getVisibleLength?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli2","name":"eli2","key":"eli2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-03-23T00:35:53.073+0000","updated":"2012-03-23T00:35:53.073+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12520148/comment/13248540","id":"13248540","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli2","name":"eli2","key":"eli2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Filed HDFS-3219 for this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli2","name":"eli2","key":"eli2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-04-06T17:54:28.910+0000","updated":"2012-04-06T17:54:28.910+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12520148/comment/13248567","id":"13248567","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Eli, I forgot to comment on this earlier.
