One possible option to fix this issue is:\nActually lease renewer required for the opened files. So, while opening the file it can add the renewer if there is no client present in Renewer's list of clients.\nSo, file close can remove the dfsCLinet instance completely if there is no filesBeingWritten with that client. Means that, if there is no open files with a particular DFSClient, then that clinet will not be there with renewer. If the same DFSClient wants to open new file, it will take care of adding client to renewer.\nHow does this sounds to you?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-12T14:07:07.685+0000","updated":"2012-07-12T14:07:07.685+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598556/comment/13412820","id":"13412820","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks Uma.

IMO, this will a leak from application side, since there is a bug in closing the streams from app.\n\nAgreed, but it can have pretty severe consequences that aren't easily detected unless explicitly hunting for leaks.  It makes me uneasy that an out of scope fs stream can cause a massive leak of heavy objects, threads, and tie up sockets that may exhaust fds and/or memory for long running processes.  Emitting an angry log error for lost & unclosed streams may be more beneficial. \n\nI don't think a finalizer on the fs will work.  If I do {{in = path.getFileSystem(conf).open(...)}}, the fs might get garbage collected but we certainly don't want its finalizer to shoot the dfs client that is still holding open a stream.  Maybe a finalizer on the dfs client, but in any case, the circular hard references need to be broken somehow.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-07-12T16:34:31.675+0000","updated":"2012-07-12T16:34:31.675+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598556/comment/13414156","id":"13414156","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"The goal of this patch is to remove unnecessary references from both DFSClient and LeaseRenewer whenever possible.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-07-13T23:44:24.962+0000","updated":"2012-07-13T23:44:24.962+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598556/comment/13414204","id":"13414204","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Hey Kihwal.
