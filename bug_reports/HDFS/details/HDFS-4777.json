The third I'm not so sure can/should be fixed, since we're not really concerned about NN operation throughput when entering safemode, and it does seem to be a good idea to call logSyncAll when entering SM.\n\nCertainly feel free to make sub-tasks if you want, though it doesn't seem crazy to me to do this in one JIRA.
