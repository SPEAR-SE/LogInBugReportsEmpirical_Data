When upgrading to trunk from 0.20.203(LV -31), namenode code expects FSImage compression to be available (because -31 is later LV than -25). This functionality is in 0.22 and trunk and not in 0.20.203. Hence the upgrade fails.\n\nSolution:\n# Change the checks for LV in 0.22 for ranges -20 to -27 to -33.\n# Change the checks for LV in trunk for ranges -28 to -33 to -34.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-13T17:28:22.972+0000","updated":"2011-05-13T17:28:22.972+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507148/comment/13033153","id":"13033153","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"good digging.

But I agree with you on adding a feature matrix, that some looks some thing like:\nLV <-> EnumSet of features supported.\n\nWith that we could move to using feature supported for doing the functionality that we depend on LV today.

Are you suggesting this bug needs to be fixed in this jira. I think it is unrelated to what this jira is addressing - that is layout versions changed in HDFS-1822 causes upgrade issues. Will create a separate jira as I have said earlier.\n\nI think the new jira should be a blocker for 0.23 and not 0.22 (where by lucky coincidence the test works).\n\n> I think the null checks you had to add are also due to this singleton usage – they're masking an issue but don't inherently make sense.\nNot sure what you are getting at here. This is an initialization issue that I was addressing. To make progress on this issue, I can revert that part.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-31T19:06:45.928+0000","updated":"2011-05-31T19:06:45.928+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507148/comment/13041775","id":"13041775","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Reverted the DataNode.java changes in the new version of the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-31T19:26:40.296+0000","updated":"2011-05-31T19:26:40.296+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507148/comment/13041789","id":"13041789","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"+1 pending Hudson.
