High bits should range from 0 to highMax INCLUSIVELY in some cases; try (1L << 32) - 1\n\n(1L << 32) - 1 = 0xffffffff\nThis is MAX_INT.  So you'll take the first branch of the 'if' statement and get a number between [0 and 0xffffffff).\nSo, it works fine here.\n\nbq. Two 31-bit int's cannot handle a 63-bit long; try Long.MAX_VALUE\n\nNow this criticism is fair.  It could be fixed by just using nextInt() rather than nextInt(Int.MAX_INT) to get the lower half of the return value.\n\nI think I can fix this code to work in the 64-bit case.  The big insight of this code was that a uniformly randomly distributed 63-bit number can be viewed as a linear decomposition of several smaller uniformly distributed random numbers.\n\nI'm tempted to try fixing this.  However, it may be more practical to limit ourselves to 31-bit values...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

It is simply not a good practice to perform unchecked typecasts.  The lack of a nextLong() method tends to produce this kind of code.  For that reason alone, it would be a good addition to Hadoop-- don't you agree?\n\nCheck out HDFS-2541, where we also needed a nextRandomLong, didn't have it, and ended up doing an (incorrect) typecast.  The problem is more widespread than you think.  Does that make sense at all?  The alternative is to change a lot of our long configuration values to int, or introduce artificial maximum values for them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
