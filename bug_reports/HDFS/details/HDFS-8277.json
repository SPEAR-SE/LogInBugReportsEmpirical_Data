That choice could have been intentional but it looks like the wrong choice in an HA setup. If it had been logged we would only have to contact the active NN. I agree your patch did not introduce this problem however I'd like to at least understand the reason for the original choice before changing any more behavior.\n\nSurendra, feel free to kick off a thread on the dev mailing list.

DFSAdmin#setSafeMode should send the RPC to the ANN only.\nbq. SBN should fail setSafeMode via RPC call.

Currently safemode API have one parameter {{isChecked}}\n{code}\n\t@Override // ClientProtocol\n\tpublic boolean setSafeMode(SafeModeAction action, boolean isChecked)\n{code}\n\nIf {{isChecked}} is true, RPC call will fail for SBN and it will throw StandbyException. I think we should not change anything in Namenode side {{setSafeMode()}} API. In {{DFSAdmin}} command now we are calling {{haNn.setSafeMode(action, false)}} with false, We can call it with true option for both the namenode like this.\n{code}\n        {\n          //NN in standby we will get StandbyException\n          inSafeMode = haNn.setSafeMode(action, true);\n        } catch (StandbyException e) {\n          System.out.println(\"Skipping safemode for standby NameNode \" + proxy.getAddress());\n          continue;\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n          System.out.println(\"Failed to connect \" + proxy.getAddress());\n          continue;\n        }\n{code}\n\nFor SBN we will catch the StandbyException and print the message.

Agreed, and this is is because the manual safe mode transition is not logged in the edit log. That choice could have been intentional but it looks like the wrong choice in an HA setup. If it had been logged we would only have to contact the active NN. I agree your patch did not introduce this problem however I'd like to at least understand the reason for the original choice before changing any more behavior.\n\nHi [~arpitagarwal], Please check [this|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-3507?focusedCommentId=13437134&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13437134] comment from [~atm] in HDFS-3507, where the {{isChecked}} parameter was introduced, and set to true only for {{dfs#isInSafemode()}}, since this is API is cares more about the User calls and required to get the Active NN state.\nAccording to the comment, {{setSafeMode()}} meant to change the safemode state on the entire HDFS service, not just one NN. So changes in HDFS-6507 introduced these changes to call such APIs on both NNs.\n\nAnd manually entering safemode, is not permanent action. NN stays in safemode until one more manual request is made to come out, or it gets restarted. So there is no need of edit logging for this. Right?\n\nAnd as far as this Jira is concerned, IMO, I think its okay to go ahead with available NN for the execution, again since entering safemode is not a permanent operation.\nBut, if the setSafemode() is restricted to only Active NN, then saveNamespace(), which is very important regardless of NN state, fails in SNN because of not in safemode.\n\nAny thoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-06-12T04:58:04.326+0000","updated":"2015-06-12T04:58:04.326+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12825556/comment/14582941","id":"14582941","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq. if you mean including the above in addition to persisting the safe mode state in fsimage/editlog then yes that sounds like a good idea.
