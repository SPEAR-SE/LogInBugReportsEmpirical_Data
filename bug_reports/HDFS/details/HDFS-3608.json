The reason for this is that fuse_dfs caches Filesystem instances using the UID of the user running the command as the key into the cache.  This is a very uncommon scenario, since it's pretty uncommon for a single user to want to use credentials for several different principals on the same box.\n\nHowever, we can use inotify to detect changes in the Kerberos ticket cache file and force the next operation to create a new FileSystem instance in that case.  This will also require a reference counting mechanism in fuse_dfs so that we can free the FileSystem classes when they refer to previous Kerberos ticket caches.\n\nAnother mechanism is to run a stat periodically on the ticket cache file.  This is a good fallback mechanism if inotify does not work on the file (for example, because it's on an NFS mount.)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12322472","id":"12322472","description":"2.0.2-alpha release","name":"2.0.2-alpha","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2012-10-09"}],"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12536867","id":"12536867","filename":"HDFS-3608.004.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Can you comment on what manual testing of the patch you've done?\n\nA few comments:\n\n# I find the \"used\" member of the hdfsConn struct to be a little confusing with regards to its unit. It's not really \"representing how recently this connection has been used,\" as the comment says, but is really \"the number of times this connection has been checked by a timer callback while there were no users of the connection.\" I think it'd be better if it were just a value representing the last time the connection was used, and if it were renamed \"lastUsedTime\". If you want to keep the current semantics you have, you should rename this member to something like \"expiryChecksRemaining\".\n# Looks like there's a tab character in hdfsConnExpiry, on the RB_FOREACH_SAFE line.\n# In an error message in hdfsConnCheckKpath, you mention that a call to \"utimes\" failed, when in fact it was a call to \"stat\"\n# In hdfsConnCheckKpath, you always return \"1\" in the event of error, even if you have a more meaningful errno number stored in \"ret\". Is that intentional? You might want to add an @return annotation to hdfsConnCheckKpath regardless, to explain what it's supposed to return.\n# Could use function comments for hdfsConnFind, hdfsConnFree, printTime, hdfsConnCompare, etc.\n# I again see some places where we return negative numbers for errors, and other places positive numbers.\n# In hdfsConnRelease, I recommend you add the username associated with the connection to the log message you're printing.\n# There's a few places in fuseNewConnect where you just print \"OOM\". Might want to put some indication of which allocation caused the OOM.\n# I don't understand why you call fuseTimerAdd every time in fuseNewConnect. I don't think it's a bug, since fuseTimerAdd exits early if the timer is already active, but it seems like fuseTimerAdd should just be called once on startup? This point seems supported by the fact that you never call fuseTimerRemove.\n# Given that there's only ever one timer, it doesn't seem like there's a need to put it in an RB tree, or for that matter having a generic timer interface at all. Let's scrap fuse_timer.c, and just make a thread that wakes up periodically and runs hdfsConnExpiry in fuse_connect.c.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

A few comments:\n\n# Why the \"C\" in \"FUSEC_DEFAULT_TIMER_PERIOD\" ?\n# I think the default timer period should be way lower. It seems totally fine to me to run this every 5 or 10 seconds, instead of every 2.5 minutes.\n# It's still weird to me that \"expirationCount\" isn't just a measure of time since last use, but rather how many expiration checks have occurred. Why not make it time-based? It also seems odd to me that the frequency of checking for expiration would affect how long the FS objects stay in the cache. Seems like those two things should be independent. At the very least, the comment \"respresenting how recently this connection has been used\" is still not accurate.\n# Rather than configuring the timer period using the env var \"FUSE_CONNECT_TIMER_PERIOD\", how about making it part of the normal Hadoop configuration? Or passing it as an argument to fuse_dfs? There doesn't seem to be any reason to depart from the normal configuration systems for this setting.\n# Could use a function comment for printTime, hdfsConnExpiry.\n# Typo: \"This must be called before any of the other functions in this module.edu\"\n\nOne question regarding your testing: did you test with Kerberos enabled? If so, did you try kdestroy/kinit as a different use and confirm that it works as expected?
