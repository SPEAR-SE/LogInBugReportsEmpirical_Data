HDFS-5321 was applied to branch-2 but reverted in HDFS-6632, so there's a bit of a difference in how branch-2 versus trunk handles default values (branch-2 pulls them from configs if specified, trunk

Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. ...am getting a bit concerned about the backwards compatibility of this change...\n\nYes, I agree.  Navigating through the twisty history, I can see that there was concern expressed about this part of the change in the later comments of HDFS-5321.  There was a specific choice to restore the behavior of making {{getDefaultPort}} respect the configuration as part of HDFS-6632, so I think we need to preserve that.\n\nFWIW, I don't think this is strictly correct for the contract of {{getDefaultPort}}.  Other implementations hard-code the return value to its typical default instead of reading configuration.  {{DistributedFileSystem}} is hard-coded to return 8020.  {{FTPFileSystem}} hard-codes 21.  Sometimes we have to let compatibility win though.  I suppose that's why we're taking the opportunity change it on trunk.\n\nFor these test failures on branch-2, shall we change {{WebHdfs}} and {{SWebHdfs}} to call {{setConf}} on the wrapped instance?  This would require private static helper methods that do the instantiation + {{setConf}}, just to satisfy Java's rules about the call to {{super}} being the first line in the constructor.  e.g.:\n\n{code}\n    super(theUri, createWebHdfsFileSystem(conf), conf, SCHEME, false);\n{code}\n\n{code}\n  private static WebHdfsFileSystem createWebHdfsFileSystem(Configuration conf) {\n    WebHdfsFileSystem fs = new WebHdfsFileSystem();\n    fs.setConf(conf);\n    return fs;\n  }\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-25T23:18:48.920+0000","updated":"2015-08-25T23:18:48.920+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12858019/comment/14728060","id":"14728060","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jghoman].
