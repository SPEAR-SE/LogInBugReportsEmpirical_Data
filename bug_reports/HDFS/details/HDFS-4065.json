Therefore, when the test tries to corrupt the block file, it's non-deterministic whether the data node still holds an open file handle.

Before I coded this, I had looked for a lighter weight method: a sync or a flush like you suggested.  Unfortunately, the current data node code provides no such method.  DataNode.shutdown is the only method that synchronously waits for all DataXceiver threads to finish.  I figured it wasn't worthwhile to refactor DataNode.shutdown (and possibly weaken encapsulation) just to support one test case that needs to do some highly unusual operations on the raw block files.\n\nIf speeding up this whole test suite (which currently runs in ~50 seconds) is a goal, then I'd actually suggest refactoring so that all 14 tests in the suite reuse the same MiniDFSCluster instead of starting and stopping 14 times.  That would increase speed, but at the cost of reduced test isolation.  (This part would be tracked as a separate Jira.)\n\nThanks,\n--Chris\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-17T21:06:08.572+0000","updated":"2012-10-17T21:06:08.572+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12612114/comment/13478507","id":"13478507","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think we need to look at changing tests not to unnecessarily restart the MiniDFSCluster.
