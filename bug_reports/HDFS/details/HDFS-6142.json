The comment suggests that the RPC server will unwrap it to StandbyException before sending back to the client, but this may not be the case for every code path. For example, in datanode's DataXceiver.copyBlock, it will call checkAccess which eventually might call retrievePassword, but when copyBlock catches an InvalidToken exception, it would simply send to the client that exception without unwrapping it. \n\nI am not exactly sure about the possible consequence, but it seems client treats StandbyException (which is perhaps much more serious) very different from InvalidToken exception.
