If the disk containing the file system where log is stored is failing, the logging action may hang. We want disk check to start before this happens.\n\nA possible future improvement will be to make the disk check ({{mkdir()}}) to timeout. This will require another thread to monitor the disk check activity and interrupt the disk check thread if a check is taking too long.  Since I/O timeout is usually very long (e.g. 15-20 minutes), the common I/O hang condition can make a lot of user requests timeout/fail before a faulty disk is marked bad.  With the timeout/interrupt feature, the fault detection latency can be made shorter.  This is beyond the scope of this jira, of course.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-05-09T03:24:24.504+0000","updated":"2014-05-09T03:24:24.504+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12679508/comment/13993772","id":"13993772","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Will work on Kihwaal comments and post a new patch","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-05-09T18:14:41.391+0000","updated":"2014-05-09T18:14:41.391+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12679508/comment/13993780","id":"13993780","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks Kihwal for your comments.\nI incorporated your first and second comment.\nFor the third comment, I agree that start and termination of checkDiskError Thread should be logged.

After applying this patch, it seems that DNs will run checkDiskError when any other node experiences an issue. So, if one node is down (eg due to a rolling restart or a crash) all of the other nodes are very soon running checkDiskError for no particularly good reason. Coupled with HDFS-7489, this failure can also cascade.\n\nCan you describe in more detail the scenario you were facing that inspired this JIRA? Would it not make more sense to actually look for the underlying symptom (by adding a timer around the I/O, perhaps?) and running checkDiskError in the specific scenarios we're looking for, rather than all network errors?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2015-03-17T05:24:32.683+0000","updated":"2015-03-17T05:24:32.683+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12679508/comment/15150220","id":"15150220","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq.
