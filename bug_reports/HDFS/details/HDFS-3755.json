The policy is to retry once every LEASE_SOFTLIMIT_PERIOD up to 5 times (i.e 5 minutes). Assumedly this is so that, if a writer fails, another writer can call {{append()}} and take over from it, even if it first makes this call before the old writer's soft limit has expired. This behavior goes way back to HADOOP-1263 circa 2007. We removed this when we moved around a lot of the retry functionality in DFSClient into the IPC layer during development of HA.\n\nI think the right thing to do here is:\na) commit this patch, since, as described above, it doesn't make sense to have to recover the lease when you're going to delete the file anyway for overwrite.\nb) think about whether the above transparent-retry behavior for create() is actually what we want to expose to developers. I personally would rather the caller be responsible for retrying if it expects to be taking over a lease from a prior writer - otherwise a call which should be fast could retry up to 5 minutes. Since I can imagine there might be disagreement on this point, I'd propose take it to a separate JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-08-03T01:12:48.958+0000","updated":"2012-08-03T01:12:48.958+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12601268/comment/13427823","id":"13427823","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think it iscorrect that fs.create() with overwrite=true could overwrite a being written file.
