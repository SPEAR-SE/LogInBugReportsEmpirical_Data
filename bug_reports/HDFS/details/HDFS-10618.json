However, before computing the locations the write lock is released (and reacquired to add to pendingReconstruction). testPendingAndInvalidate can expose this race condition because it also indirectly calls BlockManager.computeReconstructionWorkForBlocks. The following scenario outlines how this test can fail:\n\n1. ReplicationMonitor calls computeReconstructionWorkForBlocks, removes blocks from neededReconstruction, releases the write lock, and takes time computing the locations for replication\n2. testPendingAndInvalidate calls computeReconstructionWorkForBlocks, sees nothing in neededReconstruction, spends 0 time computing locations, adds nothing to pendingReconstruction, and returns. \n3. testPendingAndInvalidate calls updateState() and indirectly sets pendingReconstructionBlocksCount to the current value of pendingReconstruction (which is 0, since the Replication Monitor is still computing the block locations and hasn't yet added the blocks to pendingReconstruction).\n3. testPendingAndInvalidate checks the value of pendingReconstructionBlocksCount via getPendingReconstructionBlocksCount() and sees that it is 0, causing the associated assert to fail.\n\nIt is unclear to me whether or not this failure can happen outside of this test, since it is explicitly calling computeReconstructionWorkForBlocks, which is normally only called by the Replication Monitor.
