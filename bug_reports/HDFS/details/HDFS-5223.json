This means that even for changes which might be backward compatible, like the addition of a new edit log op code, we must go through the full `namenode -upgrade' process which requires coordination with DNs, etc. HDFS should support a lighter weight alternative.\n\n\nCopied description from HDFS-8075 which is a duplicate and now closed. (by sanjay on APril 7 2015)\nBackground\n* HDFS image layout was changed to use Protobufs to allow easier forward and backward compatibility.\n* Hdfs has a layout version which is changed on each change (even if it an  optional protobuf field was added).\n* Hadoop supports two ways of going back during an upgrade:\n**  downgrade: go back to old binary version but use existing image/edits so that newly created files are not lost\n** rollback: go back to \"checkpoint\" created before upgrade was started - hence newly created files are lost.\n\nLayout needs to be revisited if we want to support downgrade is some circumstances which we dont today. Here are use cases:\n* Some changes can support downgrade even though they was a change in layout since there is not real data loss but only loss of new functionality. E.g. when we added ACLs one could have downgraded - there is no data loss but you will lose the newly created ACLs. That is acceptable for a user since one does not expect to retain the newly added ACLs in an old version.\n* Some changes may lead to data-loss if the functionality was used. For example, the recent truncate will cause data loss if the functionality was actually used. Now one can tell admins NOT use such new such new features till the upgrade is finalized in which case one could potentially support downgrade.\n* A fairly fundamental change to layout where a downgrade is not possible but a rollback is. Say we change the layout completely from protobuf to something else. Another example is when HDFS moves to support partial namespace in memory - they is likely to be a fairly fundamental change in layout.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[],"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12623042","id":"12623042","filename":"HDFS-5223.004.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

From now on the addition of new edit log opcodes would increment the NN metadata version, and we would require that changes made to the format of existing fsimage/edit log entries be done in a backward compatible fashion. We would freeze the existing \"layout version\" number and from now on only increment this in the case of more fundamental NN metadata version changes.\n# Introduce a set of NN metadata format feature flags which can be enabled or disabled by the admin at runtime. These feature flags could be enabled/disabled entirely independently, so we would move away from a strictly-increasing NN metadata version number. The fsimage and edit log header would be changed to enumerate which of these features were enabled. We will allow the NN to start up only if its software supports the full set of features identified in the fsimage/edit log headers.\n\nI'd love to solicit others thoughts/feedback on these proposals, or suggest an alternative if you have one.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

So, within a single image or edits directories, you might now have different edit log segments or images with different version numbers -- the ones written post-upgrade would have a higher version number.\n- note that this allows for in-place software upgrade, but not in-place software downgrade. Once you've written an edit log with the new version, you couldn't downgrade the NN back to the previous version, because it would refuse to read the higher-versioned edit log segment.\n\nbq. and we would require that changes made to the format of existing fsimage/edit log entries be done in a backward compatible fashion\n\nThis isn't quite the case -- because the new edit log segments would have a new version number, we have the same ability to evolve opcodes as today. I verified with Aaron that he mis-stated this above.\n\n*Proposal 2*:\n- This is basically the way that file systems such as ext3 handle version compatibility. Every ext3 filesystem's superblock contains a set of flags which determine which features have been enabled for it. Similarly, we'd add something to the edit log and fsimage headers with a set of feature names. Here's the docs from Documentation/filesystems/ext2.txt in the kernel tree:\n\n{code}\nThese feature flags have specific meanings for the kernel as follows:\n\nA COMPAT flag indicates that a feature is present in the filesystem,\nbut the on-disk format is 100% compatible with older on-disk formats, so\na kernel which didn't know anything about this feature could read/write\nthe filesystem without any chance of corrupting the filesystem (or even\nmaking it inconsistent).  This is essentially just a flag which says\n\"this filesystem has a (hidden) feature\" that the kernel or e2fsck may\nwant to be aware of (more on e2fsck and feature flags later).  The ext3\nHAS_JOURNAL feature is a COMPAT flag because the ext3 journal is simply\na regular file with data blocks in it so the kernel does not need to\ntake any special notice of it if it doesn't understand ext3 journaling.\n\nAn RO_COMPAT flag indicates that the on-disk format is 100% compatible\nwith older on-disk formats for reading (i.e. the feature does not change\nthe visible on-disk format).  However, an old kernel writing to such a\nfilesystem would/could corrupt the filesystem, so this is prevented. The\nmost common such feature, SPARSE_SUPER, is an RO_COMPAT feature because\nsparse groups allow file data blocks where superblock/group descriptor\nbackups used to live, and ext2_free_blocks() refuses to free these blocks,\nwhich would leading to inconsistent bitmaps.  An old kernel would also\nget an error if it tried to free a series of blocks which crossed a group\nboundary, but this is a legitimate layout in a SPARSE_SUPER filesystem.\n\nAn INCOMPAT flag indicates the on-disk format has changed in some\nway that makes it unreadable by older kernels, or would otherwise\ncause a problem if an old kernel tried to mount it.  FILETYPE is an\nINCOMPAT flag because older kernels would think a filename was longer\nthan 256 characters, which would lead to corrupt directory listings.\nThe COMPRESSION flag is an obvious INCOMPAT flag - if the kernel\ndoesn't understand compression, you would just get garbage back from\nread() instead of it automatically decompressing your data.  The ext3\nRECOVER flag is needed to prevent a kernel which does not understand the\next3 journal from mounting the filesystem without replaying the journal.\n{code}\n\nThis would allow us to do rolling upgrades, run mixed-version clusters, and still retain the ability to roll back to a prior version until the new feature was used. So, to take the example of a feature like snapshots which required a metadata change, the admin workflow would be:\n\n# Shutdown standby node\n# Upgrade standby software version\n# Start standby node, failover to it\n# Shutdown and upgrade the old active, start it back up.\n# Note: at this point, the format for the edit logs and images is identical to the pre-upgrade format, so the user could still roll back.

The code can get very complex dealing with multiple combinations and the testing/QA can get also be very difficult to manage. Things can get overwhelmingly complex quite quickly. Having an \"-enableAllNewFeatures\" helps a bit but I'm not sure it lowers the complexity all that much. \n\nOf the two options, I'd lean in the direction of #1 at this point. \n\niiuc, option 2 basically means that V2 software has to remember how to both read and write in V1 format whereas option 1 only requires that V2 be able to read V1 format (like we do today). I kind of like the fact that new software doesn't ever have to write things according to the older format. \n\n* When we update the SBN to V2 it would be allowed to come up and it would still be able to process V1 images/edits\n* The first time it tries to write a new image, it would do so in V2 format \n* When uploading a new V2 image to ANN, the upload would not proceed because of the version mismatch (this way the ANN's local storage stays purely V1)\n* At this point we can still rollback by simply re-bootstrapping the SBN\n* Now we failover to the SBN, the SBN changes the shared edits area to indicate V2 (just an update to VERSION file I think)\n* Upgrade old ANN with V2 software\n* old ANN comes up as Standby, reads the new V2 image and starts processing new V2 edits (somewhere in here also has to change local storage to V2)\n\nWhat's not great about this approach is that as soon as V2 software becomes active, we're writing in V2 format and at that point can't go back without losing edits. However, that's basically very similar to today's -upgrade. The only difference being that we haven't done anything to protect the blocks on the datanodes (with -upgrade we hardlink everything and therefore guarantee data blocks can't go away). So, maybe we need a mode where HDFS stops deleting blocks both from the NN's perspective (won't issue invalidates any longer), as well as from the DN side where it will ignore block deletion requests. Kind of a semi-safe-mode where the filesystem acts pretty much normally except that it refuses to delete any blocks. If we get ourselves into a true disaster-recovery situation, we can go back to V1 software + last V1 fsimage + all V1 edits that applied to that image + all blocks from the datanodes.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-09-26T20:20:11.421+0000","updated":"2013-09-26T20:20:11.421+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12669303/comment/13779511","id":"13779511","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"bq.

Things can get overwhelmingly complex quite quickly. \n\nI agree that it's a bit more complex, but I'm not sure it's quite as bad in our context as it might be in others. Most of our edit log changes to date have been fairly simple. Looking through the Feature enum, they tend to fall into the following categories:\n- Entirely new opcodes (eg CONCAT) - these are easy to do on the writer side by just throwing an exception in logEdit() if the feature isn't supported. Sometimes these also involve a new set of data written to the FSImage (eg in the case of delegation token persistence) but again it should be pretty orthogonal to other features.\n- New \"container\" format features (eg fsimage compression, or checksums on edit entries). These are new features which are off by default and orthogonal to any other features.\n- Single additional fields in existing opcodes. We'd need to be somewhat careful not to make use of any of these fields if the feature isn't enabled, but I think there's usually pretty clear semantics.\n\nCertainly it's more complex than option 1, but I think the ability to downgrade without data loss is pretty key. A lot of Hadoop operators are already hesitant to upgrade between minor versions already, and losing the ability to roll back would make it a non-starter for a lot of shops. If that's the case, then I think it would be really tough to add new opcodes or other format changes even between minor releases (eg 2.3 to 2.4) and convince an operator to do the upgrade.\n\nAm I being overly conservative in what operators will put up with, instead of overly conservative in the complexity we introduce?\n\n\n(btw, I agree completely about the \"no-delete\" mode -- I think a \"TTL delete mode\" is also a nice feature we could build in at the same time, where block deletions are always delayed for a day, to mitigate potential for data loss even with bugs present)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-09-27T00:52:11.843+0000","updated":"2013-09-27T00:52:11.843+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12669303/comment/13871548","id":"13871548","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

The basic idea is to place a LayoutFlags object inside the FSNamesystem, and supply the flags object whenever we need to roll the edit logs, etc.  We also store these flags in the FSImage header and FSEditLog header.  The flags are supplied during edit log opcode serialization and deserialization.\n\nAfter installing new software, and ensuring that it's stable, the user performs an allowLayoutFlag RPC to finalize the upgrade.  Once the new layout flag has been added to the FSImage and edit log, downgrade is not possible.  We may want to add a downgrade feature flag tool later, possibly as part of NameNode recovery mode.

In cases where the only NN metadata change between versions is just the introduction of new edit log op codes, I think it'd be much better if we could just swap the software during a rolling restart without having to use the {{-rollingUpgrade}} functionality at all, and then optionally enable the feature via an administrative command afterward - essentially the \"feature flags\" proposal earlier discussed. That approach will both make non-destructive downgrades possible from versions which introduce new op codes, and make upgrades substantially easier as well.\n\nWhat's your reasoning for wanting to stick with a linear layout version number approach when introducing new op codes? In general I think it'd be beneficial for HDFS to move toward a bit-set denoting which features/op codes are enabled/disabled, much like [~tlipcon] described earlier.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

The fact that presently all features are always enabled means that we should consider ourselves obligated to make sure that all features work well with all other features.\n\nYes, definitely agreed.\n\nI don't think I communicated this point clearly.  What I meant was that I see additional complexity arising from the new combinations of \"feature X on while feature Y off\".  These represent new system states not covered by existing tests, and this is where we get a combinatorial explosion in the test matrix.  It's particularly challenging if one feature is coupled to another, either in code or as an implementation pre-requisite.\n\nAs an example, an early design proposal for ACLs would have involved implementing xattrs first, followed by implementing ACLs in terms of private xattrs.  (This is a common implementation in other file systems.)  We didn't do it this way, but if we had, then we'd have a situation where the {{EXTENDED_ACL}} feature is dependent upon {{XATTRS}}.  What is the effect of disabling {{XATTRS}} while {{EXTENDED_ACL}} is enabled?  I suppose the correct response is to block disabling {{XATTRS}} if {{EXTENDED_ACL}} is still on.  This becomes extra code to write and test.  It also becomes extra knowledge for operators to be aware that both must be enabled before the feature can be used.\n\nThe monotonically increasing (well, technically decreasing!) layout version has the benefit of restricting possible system states, because it guarantees that prior features in the lineage are enabled.  The drawback is that it harms flexibility.  In this particular case, I prefer keeping that invariant and the safety it brings over the increased flexibility.\n\nbq. One might want to use the OOB ack feature just when doing a rolling restart (no upgrade) to effect a configuration change, without the additional complexity of metadata changes, etc.\n\nFWIW, the existing rolling upgrade functionality doesn't really dictate what it is that you're upgrading, and the design targeted a DN-only upgrade as one of its use cases.  It would be completely legitimate to skip the NN portion of the rolling upgrade procedure and do just the DN portion to push a configuration change with no code changes, like increasing the xceiver count.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-05T22:22:35.441+0000","updated":"2015-05-05T22:22:35.441+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12669303/comment/14550876","id":"14550876","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I have deleted the design document and patch and moved it over to HDFS-8432, so that this issue can remain focused on discussion of the proposal for feature flags.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-19T17:54:09.473+0000","updated":"2015-05-19T17:54:26.151+0000"}],"maxResults":15,"total":15,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-5223/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1o7v3:"}}
