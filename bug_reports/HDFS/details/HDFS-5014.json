This meant that one {{BPServiceActor}} could prevent running commands from the other if the heartbeat response from its NN indicated that it had become the new active.\n\nWith this patch, we could have a command in progress, and the other {{BPServiceActor}} takes over as active, but the change isn't visible.  (Basically, one thread won't see the other thread's update of {{BPOfferService#bpServiceToActive}}, and I don't think the addition of {{volatile}} helps.)  If that command is a block invalidate, then we could lose a block erroneously.\n\nI definitely can see how the synchronization could cause the problem you described though.

I'm not +1 for the current patch, but I would be +1 if it was changed to hold the write lock for all of {{updateActorStatesFromHeartbeat}}.  I'd like to seek out a second opinion though, because concurrency is hard.  :-)  [~tlipcon], maybe you could take a look since you originally coded HDFS-2627?\n\nVinay, thank you for reporting the bug and working through the feedback on the patch.\n\nbq. I dint understand how we could get 'some unfortunate interleavings'. Can you please explain.. I thought since we are reading under lock, we would get correct state always.\n\nThe challenge is that we are updating multiple pieces of data ({{bpServiceToActive}}, {{bposThinksActive}}, {{lastActiveClaimTxId}}, and {{isMoreRecentClaim}}), and the failover handling logic isn't correct unless those pieces of data are consistent with one another.  Without mutual exclusion, we can end up with {{bposThinksActive}} true even though {{bpServiceToActive}} has changed, or we could end up with {{isMoreRecentClaim}} true, even though a more recent transaction ID has been seen.\n\nIn the following examples, assume T1 and T2 are separate threads for separate {{BPServiceActor}} instances/separate name nodes.\n\nExample 1: race on {{bposThinksActive}}\n\n# T1 acquires read lock.\n# T1 calculates {{bposThinksActive}} true.\n# T1 releases read lock.\n# The OS suspends T1 here.  (Note that T1 is holding neither read lock nor write lock at this point.)\n# T2 wakes up, processes a heartbeat, and executes all of {{updateActorStatesFromHeartbeat}}.  It determines that T2 is the new active, so it updates {{bpServiceToActive}}.\n# The OS suspends T2 here.\n# T1 resumes.  It still thinks {{bposThinksActive}} is true, even though the other thread has changed {{bpServiceToActive}}.\n# T1 now can fall into the block for {{else if (!nnClaimsActive && bposThinksActive)}} and set {{bpServiceToActive}} null.\n# The OS suspends T1 and resumes T2.\n# T2 now erroneously skips commands from the active NN, because {{bpServiceToActive}} is null.\n\nExample 2: race on {{isMoreRecentClaim}}\n\n# T1 acquires read lock.\n# T1 calculates {{isMoreRecentClaim}} based on {{lastActiveClaimTxId}} 1 and {{txid}} 2 from the heartbeat.\n# T1 releases read lock.\n# The OS suspends T1 here.  (Note that T1 is holding neither read lock nor write lock at this point.)\n# T2 wakes up, processes a heartbeat, and executes all of {{updateActorStatesFromHeartbeat}}.  It updates {{lastActiveClaimTxId}} to 3.\n# The OS suspends T2 here.\n# T1 resumes.  It still thinks {{isMoreRecentClaim}} is true, even though the other thread has changed {{lastActiveClaimTxId}}.\n# T1 now can set {{bpServiceToActive}} to itself instead of going into the split-brain warning path.\n# The OS suspends T1 and resumes T2.\n# T2 now erroneously skips commands from the active NN, because {{bpServiceToActive}} was changed.\n\nbq. Actually if we try holding writeLock() throughout method, then that will be same as adding method level synchronization. where we would get the same issue as this jira.\n\nMy understanding is that you had an actor get stuck in the re-registration loop when it got a {{DNA_REGISTER}} request from a flapping namenode.  Since {{processCommandFromActor}} was synchronized, this also blocked the actor thread for the healthy namenode from making progress.  Therefore, we can solve the problem by allowing concurrent executions of {{processCommandFromActor}}, so that the healthy actor can make progress even if the unhealthy actor gets stuck.  However, we don't need to allow concurrent execution of the heartbeat/HA failover processing (and I think it would be incorrect to do so based on the examples above).\n\nUnlike {{processCommandFromActor}}, the {{updateActorStatesFromHeartbeat}} method only changes local in-memory state.  There is no polling loop or RPC involved, so there is no risk that one actor gets stuck inside this method and blocks the other.  I expect minimal lock contention on the write lock.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-24T19:37:41.603+0000","updated":"2013-08-24T19:37:41.603+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12658893/comment/13749463","id":"13749463","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

I think there is no problem in allowing resignation commands alone concurrently right?\nI am bit worrying on the above locking and putting double checks to handle specific cases of race conditions. Instead making code complex, how about allowing registaration commands allowing without lock and all other command should go under lock. ex: if command is register, then don't take lock and simply process it. else go with current flow by taking lock on BPService itself. (bit odd to process some commands out of switch, but this looks simpler to me as of now :-) )Do you guys seeing any concurrent issue in processing registrations commands concurrently?  [Correct me if did not follow you guys]\n\n{quote}\n I'm starting to think that we need to work out a way for the re-register polling loops to yield the lock in case of repeated failure, to give the other BPServicActor a chance. If a BPServiceActor yields like this, then it must also have a way to trigger the other BPServiceActor to repeat its heartbeat before executing any additional commands. It's vital to re-check current state of the other one before proceeding to handle its commands.\n{quote}\nI am not sure what is your idea here.

I am not sure what is your idea here.\n\nMy last idea was to keep holding the lock during the register attempt, but then release the lock after there is a timeout.  IOW, don't hold the lock during the {{Thread#sleep}} time of {{BPServiceActor#register}}.\n\nbq. how about allowing registaration commands allowing without lock and all other command should go under lock.\n\nGreat idea!  That's a much simpler version of what I was trying to achieve.\n\nbq. I think it should work fine with BPOfferService#registrationSucceeded(..) synchronized.\n\nYes, I agree that {{BPOfferService#registrationSucceeded}} now needs to be synchronized.  [~vinayrpet], thanks for covering this in the most recent patch.\n\nThe new patch looks good.  Just one small thing: the log messages used to say whether it was processing a {{DNA_REGISTER}} request from the active or the standby.  With the patch, we lose that information, because the log message is the same regardless of which NN sent the command.  Can we restore active vs. standby in the log message?  That's potentially useful information for troubleshooting.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-18T18:35:16.164+0000","updated":"2013-11-18T18:35:16.164+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12658893/comment/13825679","id":"13825679","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Attaching updated patch for restoring the log.\n\nI thought it would be sufficient to log the claiming state of the actor instead of locking again and checking the state.\nPlease review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-11-18T19:41:53.637+0000","updated":"2013-11-18T19:41:53.637+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12658893/comment/13825830","id":"13825830","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 for the patch, pending successful Jenkins test-patch run.\n\nNote that it's possible for the HA state to be null (e.g. if heartbeats are disabled for tests).
