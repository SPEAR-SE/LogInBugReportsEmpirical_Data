In HDFS-1773, discussion about this was had, and it was decided that the web UI should not show these nodes. However when HDFS-5334 went through and the NN web UI was reimplemented client-side, the behavior reverted back to pre-HDFS-1773, and dead+decommissioned nodes once again showed in the dead list. This can be operationally confusing for the same reasons as discussed in HDFS-1773.\n\nI would like to open this discussion to determine if the regression was intentional or if we should carry forward
