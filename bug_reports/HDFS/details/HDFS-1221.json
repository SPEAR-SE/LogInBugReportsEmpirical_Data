During next reboot, NameNode \nwill get an exception when parsing the edits file, because of stale data, \nleading to unsuccessful reboot.\nNote: This is just one example. Since we see that edits log (and fsimage)\ndoes not have checksum, they are vulnerable to corruption too.\n \n- Details:\nThe steps to create new edits log (which we infer from HDFS code) are:\n1) truncate the file to zero size\n2) write FSConstants.LAYOUT_VERSION to buffer\n3) insert the end-of-file marker OP_INVALID to the end of the buffer\n4) preallocate 1MB of data, and fill the data with 0\n5) flush the buffer to disk\n \nNote that only in step 1, 4, 5, the data on disk is actually changed.\nNow, suppose a crash happens after step 4, but before step 5.\nIn the next reboot, NameNode will fetch this edits log file (which contains\nall 0). The first thing parsed is the LAYOUT_VERSION, which is 0. This is OK,\nbecause NameNode has code to handle that case.\n(but we expect LAYOUT_VERSION to be -18, don't we). \nNow it parses the operation code, which happens to be 0. Unfortunately, since 0\nis the value for OP_ADD, the NameNode expects some parameters corresponding \nto that operation. Now NameNode calls readString to read the path, which throws\nan exception leading to a failed reboot.\n\nThis bug was found by our Failure Testing Service framework:\nhttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2010/EECS-2010-98.html\nFor questions, please email us: Thanh Do (thanhdo@cs.wisc.edu) and \nHaryadi Gunawi (haryadi@eecs.berkeley.edu)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"113396","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"NameNode unable to start due to stale edits log after a crash","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467152/comment/12879857","id":"12879857","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Shouldn't having multiple namedirs defined (i.e., following best practices) make this failure case high improbable?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-06-17T17:37:19.689+0000","updated":"2010-06-17T17:37:19.689+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467152/comment/12880647","id":"12880647","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thanhdo","name":"thanhdo","key":"thanhdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thanhdo&avatarId=22565"},"displayName":"Thanh Do","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Multiple namedirs defined may make this failure very rare. \nBut in any case, namenode will fail stop if it faces some IO error\nwhen reading edits log at boot time.
