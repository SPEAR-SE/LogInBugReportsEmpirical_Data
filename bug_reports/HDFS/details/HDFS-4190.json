You have already written the code for unmapping the mmapped buffers (we have to write JNI call for that right. Currently I just used cleaner class from Sun package to clean) ? If we don't clean them, I have seen bad behavior and after some time OOM errors as native memory won't be cleaned until fullGC or you used in C code directly. I have tried mmapped buffers in write path also. I have tried with 36 threads, I got around ~20% improvement. I did not try increasing them, not sure if it goes bad if i increase them.(here other improvement involved that, I have allocated complete block once, added the packet content to that buffers. So, allocating consecutive memory location would improve somewhat I guess like using fallocate). CLeaning that memmapped buffer is again heavy operation. So, I cleaned them in asynchronous thread. That gives me that improvement. If I clean them sequentially then result is in negative :( . \n\nI have one question here: \nfadvise options are global in DFS right? so, when I have random small reads, then readahead may create unnecessary load data?
