Myers","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The issue is that in {{BlockManager#processReport}} we use the following logic to determine whether or not a block report is the initial block report from a DN:\n\n{code}\nif (node.numBlocks() == 0) {\n  // The first block report can be processed a lot more efficiently than\n  // ordinary block reports.  This shortens restart times.\n  processFirstBlockReport(node, newReport);\n} else {\n  processReport(node, newReport);\n}\n{code}\n\nHowever in the DN code which actually performs the block report ({{BPServiceActor#blockReport}}) we always send the incremental report before doing the full report:\n\n{code}\n// Flush any block information that precedes the block report. Otherwise\n// we have a chance that we will miss the delHint information\n// or we will report an RBW replica after the BlockReport already reports\n// a FINALIZED one.\nreportReceivedDeletedBlocks();\n\n// Create block report\nlong brCreateStartTime = now();\nBlockListAsLongs bReport = dn.getFSDataset().getBlockReport(\n    bpos.getBlockPoolId());\n\n// Send block report\nlong brSendStartTime = now();\nStorageBlockReport[] report = { new StorageBlockReport(\n    new DatanodeStorage(bpRegistration.getStorageID()),\n    bReport.getBlockListAsLongs()) };\ncmd = bpNamenode.blockReport(bpRegistration, bpos.getBlockPoolId(), report);\n{code}\n\nMost of the time when the NN is starting up the DN won't have any pending received or deleted blocks since the NN will have been down and couldn't have been allocating new blocks for clients or issuing deletes. However, in the HA case, the active NN may have been up and running just fine allocating blocks while the standby NN was down. In this case when the standby NN starts up it will receive an incremental block report first and if any of these blocks are not queued for later processing (i.e. the standby has received the edit logs containing the block allocation) it will result in the first full BR being identified as a non-initial BR, thus logging the addition of every block.\n\nI can think of a few solutions to this issue:\n\n# We could try to ensure that a DN never sends an incremental block report after registering with an NN before a full block report is sent.\n# We could change the logic at the NN for determining whether or not a full BR is the initial full BR. Instead of checking whether or not any blocks have yet been reported for the node, we could add a boolean per-DN that expressly signifies whether or not a full BR has been processed by this NN for this DN yet.\n# We could make it so that full block reports, regardless of whether or not they are the initial block report from a DN, do not log every block. On one hand this may be overkill since the only time I've seen this cause a problem is during SBN restart, but on the other hand it doesn't seem like a good idea to me to ever log every block reported by a DN, whether it's the initial full BR or a later full BR.\n\nI think I'm leaning toward option #3.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
