When you say \"HDFS assumes the target is inside its own namespace\", this is not strictly true. Link targets are stored as specified, and cross-filesystem symlinks are supported. This also applies to dangling symlinks. The real error in your example is possibly what's getting fixed in HDFS-4765, not with the properties of symlinks in HDFS themselves.\n\nRegarding permissions, AFAIK symlinks do not have meaningful permissions in POSIX. Creation and deletion of symlinks depends on having write permissions for the parent directory (true of any file), and access of a symlink target depends on the permissions on the target. I don't think the use-case specified in HDFS-948 (undeletable link in a writable directory) is actually supported by POSIX symlinks.\n\nSo, could we get specific with precise APIs and errors that we're trying to fix here?
