I think this is a good fix.\n\n[~shahrs87]'s comments addresses a similar but different problem, but also sounds like a good improvement. Rushabh, would you mind filing a jira and attach your patch? Thanks.\n\nBack to this jira. It seems the proactive warming up was added by HDFS-7209, but now that we have EDEKloader thread, it makes sense to do it there. And most importantly, async.\n\nSome small comments and 1 question. (Also thanks for the refactoring, looks pretty good!)\n\nComments:\n- I feel the javadocs on those {{@VisibleForTesting}} methods are a bit redundant.\n- This is existing code, {{EDEKCacheLoader.java}} line 112's param name should be \"keyNames\", not \"edeks\"\n- precommit will likely catch this: FSN's {{edekCacheLoader}} should be private.\n- I think the new test case's name should be warmup *Dont* block create zone.\n- Sleeping for nine 9s' are pretty much stalled, but I think {{Long.MAX_VALUE}} reads better.\n\nQuestion:\nWanted to get this all sorted out: It seems after this fix there are only 2 places that could end up with blocking call to KMS:\n- startFile which eventually {{generateEncryptedKey}}. With Rushabh's patch this will become retriable exception IIUC.\n- createZone which eventually {{ensureKeyIsInitialized}}. Will this also be covered? It seems to me {{KeyProvider#getMetadata}} is always a synchronized call, and there's no client-side cache now.

New patch attached, with comments:\n\nbq. 1. We can skip reading EDEKCacheLoader related conf properties in FSNamesystem. We can just pass the conf object to EDEKCacheLoader class and let it read in EDEKCacheLoader.\n\nOne issue with this is that I'd like to do fail-fast with the precondition checks. If we defer the config reading to EDEKCacheLoader's constructor, it won't fail until the NN starts active services. I left this as is.\n\nbq. 2. Why to call edekCacheLoader.warmUpEdekCache(0) after FSNamesystem#createEncryptionZone ?\n\nWe'd still like to warm up in the background when a new EZ key is seen. This way it does not have to block during the first file write; we get consistent performance.\n\nbq. 3. The patch applies almost cleanly in branch-2.8 but compilation is failing with the following error.\n\nThanks, changed the test a bit and checked compilation on branch-2.\n\nbq. The above chunk of code is redundant as KeyProviderCryptoExtension#warmUpEncryptedKeys is never called since that is only being called at namenode startup and since we are not restarting namenode in the test case, it will never be called.\n\nI did this as a guard against future changes to prod code. Some future programmer might change createFile to calling warmUpEncryptedKeys, and it'd be caught by this test case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-06-07T01:00:42.819+0000","updated":"2017-06-07T01:00:42.819+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13074914/comment/16039944","id":"16039944","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Missed the earlier javadoc issue, quick re-rev.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-06-07T01:01:11.009+0000","updated":"2017-06-07T01:01:11.009+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13074914/comment/16040065","id":"16040065","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~andrew.wang] for the new rev and [~shahrs87] for review comments!\n\nHere's my +1 to patch 003, pending jenkins and any other comments from Rushabh.

It will take some time. We can initialize the key queue when creating the encryption zone by admin.\n{quote}\n\nEach create only gets 1 edek, and there's the async thread in {{ValueQueue}} to fill in the cache (e.g. 500 edeks).

To give you an idea, during testing we blew the 60s RPC timeout while waiting for the cache to fill to the low watermark (30 keys). We'd really like the cache to be warmed up before a workload hits the EZ.\n\nWith the current design, I see the motivation.  However, if Rushabh posts the patch we've been running internally which basically throws retriable if no EDEK is available, yet has kicked off an async fetch, can we entirely get rid of the warmup code?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-08-03T19:37:14.423+0000","updated":"2017-08-03T19:37:14.423+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13074914/comment/16113644","id":"16113644","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm fine with this plan, it was an oversight not to use RetryStartFileException in this case.
