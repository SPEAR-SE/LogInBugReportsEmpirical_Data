For example, HDFS tests that start a NN but no DNs.\n-- LargeTest -- for system-wide functional tests - for example things like TestHDFSCLI that take several minutes but cover a large swath of the

http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2009/07/software-testing-categorization.html\n\n- mark the existing tests in src/test/unit as @Category(SmallTest.class), and move them into src/test/java.\n\nWe can
