The issue seems to be that after the fuse RELEASE operation, we never call GETATTR again when attribute caching is enabled.\n\nOne easy fix for this would be to disable attribute caching entirely.  This would certainly fix the bug, but it might result in lower performance.  As you can see from the \"correct noattr\" trace, many more GETATTR operations are done in this, all of which will hit the NameNode.\n\nCan we live with the fuse attribute cache?  This raises the question of how we're \"supposed\" to invalidate the fuse_dfs attribute cache.  I wasn't able to find any documentation about this.  I can see that fuse is checking the attributes of the root directory after the release.\n\n{code}\n   unique: 18, success, outsize: 16\nunique: 19, opcode: RELEASE (18), nodeid: 2, insize: 64, pid: 0\nrelease[140595351837776] flags: 0x8001\n   unique: 19, success, outsize: 16\nunique: 20, opcode: GETATTR (3), nodeid: 1, insize: 56, pid: 6597\ngetattr /\n   unique: 20, success, outsize: 120\n{code}\n\nIs it possible that FUSE expects something to change there if a new file has been added?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
