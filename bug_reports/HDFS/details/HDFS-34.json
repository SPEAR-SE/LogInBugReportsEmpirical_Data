The JVM does lots and lots of DNS caching of its own. To get it to cache positive and negative DNS entries for less time than forever, you've got to start the processes with a DNS TTL property,  networkaddress.cache.ttl\nBy default, Java5 caches forever: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html\nJava6 is a bit smarter, and only caches forever when a security manager is installed\nhttp://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html\n\nYou'd need to decide what is a good DNS cache TTL for the datanodes and push it out to the scripts. I'm not 100% sure you can set this property inside the JVM and have it taken up; the command line is the conventional way to do it.\n\n2. The address of the namenode is currently set up in DataNode.startDataNode(). There are a few classes that assume that DataNode.getNameNodeAddr() is never null; they'd need to change their assumptions.\n\n3. DNS is slow and is one of the main delays in test runs right now.\n\nWhat may work is leaving the current init code as it is, but whenever a connection to the namenode fails, the datanode should re-read the namenode address from the configuration and redo the nslookup; the scripts would need patching to set a low TTL on the live systems. Rereading the address from the configuration would be useful if the configuration was coming from something like an LDAP server; you could change the hostname there and have it picked up without DNS caching interfering. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_l","name":"steve_l","key":"steve_l","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-08-21T15:14:50.301+0000","updated":"2008-08-21T15:14:50.301+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12402796/comment/12624407","id":"12624407","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Steve's comment reminded me of an important detail that is bound to come up from our experiment!
