I was using that change to test easily. Here's another patch without that change and some more documentation.\n\nbq. Finalizing blocks without checking the actual replica state will very likely cause \"corruption\" later. \nThat is correct. However its unavoidable. e.g. If the client was writing with replication=1, and it dies, the lease would not be recovered for (by default) another 1 hour. If during this one hour, the datanode also failed, then we have genuinely lost the data (that we acked to the client before it crashed) and the file should be marked corrupt. I fail to see any point in keeping the lease open forever hoping that at some point we will be able to bring the block back. I'm completely open on how long we want to wait as long as its not forever. With this patch we wait until we have tried to set each possible replica to be the primary for 5 times. Would you prefer some other timeout? \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-11T20:30:05.417+0000","updated":"2015-05-11T20:30:05.417+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12828061/comment/14538617","id":"14538617","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"bq.

If blindly completed, the block size will probably be whatever was in the Receiving IBR, regardless of how much data was actually written. This will prevent clients from retrieving the data. Maybe we could explore setting to the default block size when doing this. Size won't match anyway, but we won't truncate and lose data this way.

The final size is reported in the \"received\" IBR, which is sent after the block replica is finalized. The official size is set when the client commits the block with the gen stamp and the size.\n\nLet's look at the block creation cycle.\n{panel}\na. The NN serves addBlock() request for the client. The new block is added to the block collection (INode).\nb. The client calls createBlockOutputStream() and write the first packet of the block.\nc. The datanodes receive the first packet and send receiving IBR to the NN.\nd. The client keeps writing.\ne. The client send the last packet. The datanodes finalize the block and send received IBR to the NN.\nf. Once the client receives ACK for the last packet, commits the block on the namenode (either by addBlock() or complete()).\n{panel}\n\nA cleint can fail at any time, but we are interested in the cases where the namenode has block locations but the client does not close the file. If the client fails right after {{a}}, no datanodes actually has the block. The size should be 0. If the client fails after {{b}} but before {{e}}, the size will be that of the first packet. \n\nI agree that such file should not be left dangling for a long time. Since we do not want unconditionally discarding the last block, let's first think about detecting and reporting such files. If block recovery fails n times, it can be reported in the metrics as well as the UI. Admins can bring back the node, truncate the file, or delete it.  If one kind of certain action is always preferred, that can be automated externally.

By recovery, I meant recovery of a replica (not lease recovery). Please let me know if you think this sequence cannot happen:\n1. Client writes data\n2. Client dies\n3. Datanodes A, B and C (on which data) was written die\n4. Lease recovery tries to recover data from Datanodes A and B but fail (because datanodes are dead)\n5. Cluster is taken down\n6. Datanodes A or B are resurrected\n7. The cluster is brought back up after {{RECOVERY_TIMEOUT}}\n8. {{FSNamesystem.getShouldForciblyCompleteMissingUCBlock}} returns true because RECOVERY_TIMEOUT has expired\n9. Block is forcibly marked complete and the file is labeled as having missing blocks\n\nIF Datanode A or B were back, the data would be recovered.
