Thus, in the case where we have two replicas, one of which is potentially corrupt at the end, we'd end up only keeping the valid one.\n\nWe can still lose flushed data in the case of multiple datanode failure, if both of the DNs end up with corrupt last chunks (unlikely but possible)\n\n3) Ignore checksums completely for the last chunk\n\nWe can entirely throw away the checksums on the last chunk, and augment ReplicaRecoveryInfo to actually include a BytesWritable of the last data chunk (only 512 bytes by default).\n\nDuring the recovery operation, we can simply find the common prefix of data across all of the replicas, and synchronize to that length (recomputing checksum on each node).\n\nSince we're only talking about one checksum chunk, and these are known to be small, I don't think it's problematic to shove the bytes in an RPC.\n\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-05-11T20:58:42.606+0000","updated":"2010-05-11T20:58:42.606+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462701/comment/12867366","id":"12867366","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Example scenario that would cause this issue:\n\n1.
