The method is called on every file system access, and we may gain performance if we cache the ticket cache path for a pid in cases where there is an application that is using the fuse mount often and remains running. In case where the user runs file system commands from a shell for example or from a shell script, every command will have its own pid I believe (though I have not tested) so this use case on the other hand can add on memory usage, and in edge cases can also cause slowness. And also in this case we would need to take care of the cleanup that introduce complexity. I haven't done any benchmarks on this, but I think I can run some over the weekend, or early next week, let's see how performance changes in different scenarios.\r\n\r\nI am planning to run the following tests, let me know if you see it sufficient to test around the perf difference:\r\n- test 10k access of a file via cat command on a random file with and without the patch\r\n- test 10k access for the same file using a small java program that runs with the same pid during the test with and without the patch\r\n\r\nThough I do not see anything besides the increased complexity with the pid<->krb_ticket_cache mapping being cached, so that might be as well a good approach here. I can think of the following scenarios:\r\n- there is a scheduler, that schedules different processes to run in different environments (different KRB5CCNAME) but with the same user id, then pid can be a good differentiation and we can spare the lookup for the path\r\n- there is a scheduler that schedules different tasks in threads, in this case threads are inheriting the environment, and a change in the ticket cache path will not be detected if we cache it by pid, but this scenario will not fulfill the need of different principals used for different tasks only if we introduce a different inheritance of the security context of the caller which I think we don't want to do.\r\n\r\nDo you see any other scenarios? As if you don't, we can try to measure and see the perf difference in fuse-dfs with KRB5CCNAME value cached for a pid, and evicted the same way as connections are getting expired from the cache. What do you think about this approach? I do not really have further ideas at the moment, though while I am working on the testing, I will try to figure out other feasible ways.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pifta","name":"pifta","key":"pifta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Istvan Fajth","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Budapest"},"created":"2018-06-08T16:04:40.105+0000","updated":"2018-06-08T16:04:40.105+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13146858/comment/16522115","id":"16522115","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pifta","name":"pifta","key":"pifta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Istvan Fajth","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Budapest"},"body":"Hello [~fabbri],\r\n\r\nsorry for the delay here, I was not able to get to the end of the measurement so far, I had some other things, and some problems with the environment setup over the weekend.
