This makes sense.\n\nNow, if my admin were to change my local accounts' default/primary group to 'bar' (but did not change so on my homedir on HDFS, and I were to continue writing files to my home directory or any subdirectory that has 'foo' as group, all files still get created with group 'foo' - as if the NN has not realized the primary group of the mapped shell account has already changed.\n\nOn linux this is the opposite. My login session's current primary group is what determines the default group on my created files and directories, not the parent dir owner.\n\nIf the create and mkdirs call passed UGI's group info (UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser().getGroupNames()[0] should give primary group?) along into their calls instead of a null in the PermissionsStatus object, perhaps this can be avoided.\n\nOr should we leave this as-is, and instead state that if admins wish their default groups of users to change, they'd have to chgrp all the directories themselves?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"114082","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HDFS ignores group of a user when creating a file or a directory, and instead inherits","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12545987/comment/13227205","id":"13227205","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"For whatever strange historic reason, Hadoop uses BSD semantics instead of Linux semantics for group ownership at creation.
