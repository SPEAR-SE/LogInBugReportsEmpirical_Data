I tried it with a bigger directory containing 1 mln files - it blocks for 30 minutes.\nThe rename itself is fast, its the changeLease() called after renaming that takes all the time.\nAs I can see from the code changeLease() gets tailMap() of the directory that it renames and scans the whole tail.\nIf the number of open files is large as in my case this takes forever because the tailMap includes all files in the subtree.\n\nSimple way to reproduce it is to run\n{code}\nNNThroughputBenchmark -op open -files N\n{code}\nwith a large N.
