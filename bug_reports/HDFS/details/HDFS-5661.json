The HTTP auth tokens do not contain the DT, presenting the HTTP auth tokens to the DN does not grant you the access, thus it makes no sense to pass them around.\n\nRegardless of what UI you're using, the NN fetches the DT on the behalf of the client, and the client presents this DT to authenticate with DN. This should the only way you can access the data.\n\nIf you happen to get the data in your approach, this is a security hole and please file a jira to track it.\n\nAgain, I'll encourage you to check out the new web UI. It accesses the data through WebHDFS which is much more robust.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-13T23:17:57.580+0000","updated":"2013-12-13T23:17:57.580+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12684347/comment/13848076","id":"13848076","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=benoyantony","name":"benoyantony","key":"benoyantony","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benoy Antony","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"------the client presents this DT to authenticate with DN.\nThis s not correct.
