As an extra defense, I changed the validation logic so that it requires the base entries for both access and default.  Previously, this was just enforced for access.  To do this, I rewrote this portion of the logic to use the search approach, similar to what people found more readable for {{AclTransformation#copyDefaultsIfNeeded}}.  In theory, the checks on the default ACL should never fail, because we should always copy the missing required entries from the access ACL.  However, if there is a bug, then it's better to bail earlier instead of producing an invalid default ACL that gets used later.\n# Added one more test in {{TestAclTransformation}}.

That way you can make finding the pivot more efficient, and you don't need to create sub lists in copyDefaultsIfNeeded.\n\nMy understanding is that {{ArrayList#subList}} returns an alternative view over the same underlying array, just with a different offset and length to pin it within the requested range.  This would mean that there is no cost incurred for copying the underlying data, just some extra math to deal with offset calculations, so perhaps the efficiency gain would be minor.
