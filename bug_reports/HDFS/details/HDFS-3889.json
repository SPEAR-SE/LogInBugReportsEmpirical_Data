So nothing needs to be kept in sync.  It's true that time can sometimes go backwards on the NN (due to server misconfiguration, NTP, or other things) but it's not exactly common.\n\nStill, I could go either way on this point.  It's nice to know that you're doing the safe thing, and refusing to skip pre-copy checksum definitely is the safe thing.\n\nAlso, we currently aren't doing as much checking as we should do.  We don't consider the mtime and owner, group, etc at the moment.  This makes skipping the checksum a lot more unsafe than it needs to be.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

I believe that the modification time is set based on the NN, not the clients. So nothing needs to be kept in sync.\n\nYou have two NNs. The metadata on the the target NN needs to be in sync with the source NN for the metadata-based check to do the right thing.\n\nIn the end, my opinion is just that metadata-based checks are a very poor substitute for checksums, and can much more easily generate false positives (i.e. say that files are equal when they're not). But if it's a feature that people find useful, why not. The false negative case is not such a big problem, since it would just waste bandwidth by forcing the copy.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vanzin","name":"vanzin","key":"vanzin","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marcelo Vanzin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-09-06T21:39:33.979+0000","updated":"2012-09-06T21:39:33.979+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-3889/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0jxa7:"}}
