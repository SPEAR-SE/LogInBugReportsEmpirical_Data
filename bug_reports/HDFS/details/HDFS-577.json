But I think it might be useful if the name node attempted to connect to the data node over a long period of time [probably another configurable :( ].  \n\nI'm trying to think of a use case where it would be beneficial/useful if data node/name node had one way communication and coming up empty.\n\nAs to the network partitioning problem (where data nodes lose connectivity to each other, but name node still has connectivity), it may be worth while to have an algorithm such that if x% percent cannot communicate, then we enter safe mode.  From a practical perspective, chances are good the job tracker is going to go down in flames in those sorts of situations anyway since the tasktrackers should end up on the dead pile.  Even in a pure HDFS setup, at some point the replication list is going to get very large if we start declaring nodes dead based upon %... so probably better off to just safemode ourselves and alert the admin that the network is horked.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-08-31T18:14:10.159+0000","updated":"2009-08-31T18:14:10.159+0000"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-577/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0jorb:"}}
