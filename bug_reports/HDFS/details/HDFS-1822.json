This will convert opcodes to the right ones for h-0.20s. Then you can upgrade it to h-0.21,22,23, which will have higher LV -30,-31,-32 respectively  (according to the table above).\nh-0.21,22,23 will also prohibit to upgrade from -19, asking to upgrade to -29 first.\nBut there is no confusing opcode conversions in releases h-0.21,22,23 and in the future.
