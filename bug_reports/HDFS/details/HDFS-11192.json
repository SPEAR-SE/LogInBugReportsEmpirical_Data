The benefit of the parallel init is huge, while exhausting threads is symptomatic of a system management issue.\n\nIf another process by the same user as the nn exhausted the per-user thread limit, strongly consider running the nn as a distinct user.  If processes by different users managed to exhaust the os thread limit, then you should consider a dedicated nn host since that many other things running on the nn will surely degrade performance - horribly.\n\nI agree in principal the NN should be able to detect + retry or abort but I suspect the issue is a bug in the jdk which is where it may need to be fixed.  Or maybe a default exception handler might work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-01-20T15:10:53.087+0000","updated":"2017-01-20T15:10:53.087+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13024372/comment/15831904","id":"15831904","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"We can create the quota init ForkJoinPool with a UncaughtExceptionHandler.

Thread's uncaught exception handling is wired at the Thread class so that it is called on exit. So setting the handler for worker threads won't do any good.\n\nBut the exception does bubble up and is handled by the ThredGroup's hander. In this case, it's the namenode's main thread. So we could set the UncaughtExceptionHandler in caller thread so that it terminates on OOM.  It might be better to set it before a quota init and set it back to the default after to avoid other subsystems (e.g. jetty) causing exit. \n\n{{ForkJoinPool}} is also used by jdk itself in jdk8 (e.g. {{ConcurrentHashMap}}), so even with this fix, you can run into strange problems if the process cannot create more threads.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-01-20T18:28:15.394+0000","updated":"2017-01-20T18:28:15.394+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13024372/comment/15982768","id":"15982768","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xupener","name":"xupener","key":"xupener","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"xupeng","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi all:\n\nIs there any update on this issue ? \n\nI have also run into the same condition HDFS-8865 resolved.
