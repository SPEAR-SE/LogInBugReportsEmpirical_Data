Again, the basic question driving this change is why FSNamesystem#checkOperation(OperationCategory.WRITE) is not throwing during a transition to active?\n\nDuring the transition (Standby -> Active), the current code first sets the state of the NN to Active, then starts the active service, during which the NN still needs to tail the remaining editlog. If a delegation token is contained in that last part of editlog, 1) FSNamesystem#checkOperation(OperationCategory.WRITE) will not throw anything since the NN's state has already been changed to Active, 2) the new ANN cannot find the token in its cache since it has not finished applying the editlog. We should allow clients to retry since after NN finishes reading the editlog the delegation token can be recognized.\n\nIn the meanwhile, if we let the NN first start active service, then change its state to standby, your original hack in HADOOP-9880 can work, since a standbyexception will be thrown. But this change will 1) extend the failover time, and 2) trigger unnecessary client failover. And I'm not sure if this will break other code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-10T16:56:47.799+0000","updated":"2013-10-10T16:56:47.799+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672717/comment/13791681","id":"13791681","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Fix the unit test and make the visibility of getPassword() still default.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-10T17:00:21.514+0000","updated":"2013-10-10T17:00:21.514+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672717/comment/13791879","id":"13791879","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

I think the current code wants to achieve this through the FSNamesystem R/W lock: the startActiveService method holds the write lock and blocks other methods. Then since we remove the FSNamesystem lock in retrievePassword, the original implementation does not work for delegation token part. We should file a separate jira to track this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jingzhao","name":"jingzhao","key":"jingzhao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jing Zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-14T17:18:32.578+0000","updated":"2013-10-14T17:18:32.578+0000"}],"maxResults":36,"total":36,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HDFS-5322/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1oqxb:"}}
