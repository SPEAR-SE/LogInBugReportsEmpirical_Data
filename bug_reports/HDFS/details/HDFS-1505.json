However, my understanding of NNStorage.getNumStorageDirs(NameNodeDirType), and NameNodeDirType.isOfType() is that membership queries (iterators or counts) about storage dirs of type EDITS return answers relating to all storage dirs of type EDITS || IMAGE_AND_EDITS, while queries about storage dirs of type IMAGE return answers relating to all storage dirs of type IMAGE || IMAGE_AND_EDITS.  That is, isOfType() is permissive rather than exclusive.\n\nI could be wrong of course :-) as it's possible I didn't correctly follow overloaded implementations. Please let me know if so.

The original logic you posted for the check seems to be correct.\n\nbq. Also, since HDFS-1826 copied the concurrent saveNamespace() logic into FSImage.doUpgrade(), would you please add the same code fragment to the end of doUpgrade(), and a corresponding corruption unit test case to TestDFSUpgrade? Thanks.\n\nIt occurs to me now that the failure handling should perhaps be different between these two cases. i.e. it is acceptable to tolerate some number of storage directory failures during save namespace, but we should perhaps throw an error in the event *any* storage directories fail during upgrade.

Given this, I think the correct check will be to see if there are any IMAGE directories at the end of saveNamespace, and not care about EDITS (we're also decoupling failure state of the edit log from failure state of the image saving).

You're pretty close.\n\nbq. And you're referring to the resulting fact that one could take an image ending with txn 100, jump into the middle of a log file that went from txn 50 to 170\nIn theory, yes. In the current implementation, images are only saved at boundaries of edit log segments. So if you have an image with txn 100, then you'll have some edit log file which starts at 101, so the \"jump into the middle\" part isn't necessary.\n\nbq. Although it doesn't hurt to also clear the edits logs, once you have multiple copies of the fsimage. Does your log-rolling logic automatically delete log chunk files older than available fsimage files? \nIt's not implemented yet, but the idea is that a separate background thread would be responsible for handling management of old files based on various policies (eg remove old ones, or perhaps archive to some other location)\n\nSo, sounds like we're in agreement.
