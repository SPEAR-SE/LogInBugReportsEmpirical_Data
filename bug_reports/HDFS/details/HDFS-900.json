After step 3 in Todd's description the NN has 3 good replicas and one corrupt. The corrupt replica is in recentInvalidatesSet, but not in the DatanodeDescriptor. That is the replica is scheduled for deletion from the DN. See blockReceived(). \nBut before it is deleted from the DN, that same DN sends a block report, which contains the replica. DatanodeDescriptor.processReport() treats it as a new replica because it is not in the DatanodeDescriptor and a good one since its blockId, generationStamp, and the length are in order.\nThe fix is to ignore replicas that are scheduled for deletion from this DN.\nI tested this patch with the test case attached by Todd, thanks. The test passes with the fix and fails without.\nThe test case is not exactly a unit test as it introduces changes to FSNamesystem class for testing.
