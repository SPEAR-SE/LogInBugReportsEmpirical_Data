I'm going to cancel this patch for now, because I'm working on an improved version.  I still see a few lingering test failures caused by the fact that {{DataBlockScanner#shutdown}} performs its shutdown work asynchronous of the caller within its background blockScannerThread.  I have a patch in progress to make this synchronous, so that the caller of {{DataBlockScanner#shutdown}} knows deterministically that shutdown has completed.  I'll let you know when the new patch is available for review.\n\nIvan posted this question:\n\n{quote}\nQuick question, would it make sense to shutdown BlockPoolSliceScanners on DataBlockScanner#shutdown?

All operations on {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}} that could use the internal {{verificationLog}} instance are initiated from the background thread of {{DataBlockScanner}}.  Therefore, when the {{DataBlockScanner}} background thread is exiting, it is safe to close each verification log, because nothing else will attempt to use it.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-12-11T18:04:10.523+0000","updated":"2012-12-11T18:04:10.523+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618919/comment/13529518","id":"13529518","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here is the new version of the patch:\n\n# During {{DataNode}} shutdown, change {{DataBlockScanner#run}} to shut down every allocated {{BlockPoolSliceScanner}}, which in turn closes the verification logs.  This part is the same as the earlier patch.\n# {{DataBlockScanner#shutdown}} also joins to the background blockScannerThread.  There is a slightly tricky bit in here about avoiding a deadlock.  I explained it in comments.  This is necessary to make shutdown synchronous, so that the caller knows deterministically that shutdown has completed.  In the case of {{MiniDFSCluster}}, it means that it is safe to delete the working directories, because nothing will be holding locks.\n# Change {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#scan}} to use {{Thread#isInterrupted}} instead of {{Thread#interrupted}}.  {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#scan}} runs within the blockScannerThread, which depends on seeing the interrupted status of the thread to know when to exit.  (See the while loop condition in {{DataBlockScanner#run}}.)  When {{BlockPoolSliceScanner#scan}} was calling {{Thread#interrupted}}, it would clear the current thread's interrupted status, so that the while loop in {{DataBlockScanner#run}} would never see it, and therefore would never exit.  This was occasionally causing tests to enter an infinite loop on Windows.\n\nWith this patch in place, I am consistently seeing good test results on Mac and Windows, with no tests blocked on a prior {{MiniDFSCluster}} holding a lock on a verification log.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-12-12T00:50:58.205+0000","updated":"2012-12-12T00:50:58.205+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618919/comment/13529598","id":"13529598","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
