The reason is explained in the jira comments. ...\n\nI think you mean the following comment:\n{quote}\n..., but the design is still flawed. Move decision is made then thread pools are created, which likely only cover a subset of targets in the schedule. Also, the schedule will less likely make use of all 50 threads anyway. In any case, the moves will all pile up to the first 25 targets (in our case, 25 thread pools seemed to be the limit).

This will prevent users from hitting the same issues we had.  The changes from HDFS-8188 does allow running balancer at a higher throughput, but it needs turning multiple knobs to get there.  And when it is running slower than the previous release, users will have no clue why it is so. The default config values may result in degraded performance for users running a cluster with more than 20 nodes.\n\nThe main problem of HDFS-8188 is the way thread pool is created per target.  If it reaches the limit (max mover threads), the remaining pending moves are simply dropped (Or even worse, it hangs without HDFS-11377), leading to degraded performance as demonstrated above with graphs.  The suggested workaround of \"set the mover thread limit to 10,000 or 30,000\" simply means removing the limit. i.e. it cannot work with the limit.\n\nThe suggested improvement calculates the size of each mover thread pool, instead of using the configured fixed value.

In one (~2500 node) of our clusters, setting it to 10,000 wasn't enough. The balancer does create 10,000 threads while only subset of them are utilized. Nicholas previously suggested 30,000 and  while that would have \"worked\", it effectively means HDFS-8188 requires the mover threads limit to be removed.\n\nWhat I did here is to honor the configured mover thread limit (default=1,000) and size a thread pool accordingly (#movers / #targets) instead of using a fixed number (default max=50).  I've verified it works as good as, and sometimes better than 2.7 balancer with the identical config.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-06-05T15:04:20.248+0000","updated":"2017-06-05T15:04:20.248+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13068567/comment/16045628","id":"16045628","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~kihwal], thanks for the data. Shows your point well.\n\nI have a 2600-node cluster, where we've been running Balancer pretty actively. This was initially based on 2.6, but now pretty close to branch-2.7, and with  HDFS-8818 applied. Here is the graph, thanks [~xkrogen] for generating it:\n\n!https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12872444/replaceBlockNumOps-8w.jpg!\n\nThe maximum number of transfers is 50 - close to yours. We do not allow the Balancer to run \"full speed\" to allow room for normal workload on the cluster. So I am not completely sure that HDFS-8818 is the only thing to blame for the slowness you described. I did not run branch-2.8 Balancer, but I plan to test on branch-2.7 in the very near future.\n\nAlso looked at your patch. Sounds like a reasonable change to me.

But may be we want to understand more closely at the root cause of the behavior before we commit?\nHDFS-8818 made a thread pool to be created per target. The size of each thread pool is fixed to  {{dfs.datanode.balance.max.concurrent.moves}}(default=50). When the number of targets * max concurrent moves exceeds the configured mover thread limit (default=1000), it stops creating thread pools.  The end result is that not all calculated moves are executed.\n\nSo when the default config is used, if an iteration involves more than 20 targets (1000/50), some blocks won't be moved.  We have clusters where balancing involves hundreds of targets and the effect of this limitation is very visible. My patch dynamically sizes each thread pool based on the number of targets in the iteration and the configured maximum mover threads to mitigate this problem. It does not limit the capability of HDFS-8818. It simply makes it possible to continue to use the default value or adjust it without much side effect.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-06-15T01:44:50.605+0000","updated":"2017-06-15T01:44:50.605+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13068567/comment/16095212","id":"16095212","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~kihwal], do you think this is a blocker for 2.7.4 - it's marked as such?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-07-20T19:08:47.566+0000","updated":"2017-07-20T19:08:47.566+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13068567/comment/16095263","id":"16095263","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"bq. do you think this is a blocker for 2.7.4 - it's marked as such?\nIt caused performance regression for us.
