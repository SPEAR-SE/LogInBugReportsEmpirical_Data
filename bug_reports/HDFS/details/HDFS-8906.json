The spoof datanode is created by adding the namenode RSA SSH public key to the known hosts directory, starting Hadoop services, setting the IP address to be the same as a legitimate node on the Hadoop cluster and sending the namenode a heartbeat message with an empty namespace ID.  This will cause the namenode to think that the spoof datanode is a node that had previously crashed and lost its data.  The namenode will then connect to the spoof datanode using its SSH credentials and start replicating data on the spoof datanode, incorporating the spoof datanode into the cluster.  Once incorporated, the spoof node can start issuing MapReduce jobs to retrieve cluster data.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Non Authenticated Data node Allowed to Join HDFS","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=JJHoward","name":"JJHoward","key":"jjhoward","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John J.
