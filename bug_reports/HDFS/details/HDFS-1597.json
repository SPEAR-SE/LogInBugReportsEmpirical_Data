The only way to prevent inconsistencies is to make sure all threads waiting to {{logSync()}} have everything synced already.\nIn other words all transactions that started before {{saveNamespace()}} grabbed the write lock should complete, and no new transactions should be allowed to start while {{saveNamespace()}} is in progress.\nSo {{saveNamespace()}} must call {{logSyncAll()}} before doing anything with the image or edits.\n\nTherefore, moving the assert down is absolutely correct, imo.
