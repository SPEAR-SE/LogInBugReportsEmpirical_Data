I'm saying that this is demonstrably not a security vulnerability, since we consciously chose to add this capability to other interfaces. HADOOP-11701 will make things configurably more secure for all interfaces, but that's a separate discussion.\n\nbq. My question is that is there a need to create yet another workaround, given that we know that it is prone for security vulnerability? \n\nLike I said above, this should not be considered a security vulnerability. If it is, then we should have never added this capability to WebHDFS/RPC, and we should be reverting it from WebHDFS/RPC right now.\n\nbq. I'd like to understand your use cases better? Can you please elaborate why you'll need another workaround in HFTP, given that you guys have put the workaround in WebHDFS already?\n\nSimple: because some users use HFTP and not WebHDFS, specifically for distcp from older clusters.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

As I've said previously, your only objection seems to be that this introduces a security vulnerability, but as I've pointed out several times already, we as a project have chosen not to treat this issue as a security vulnerability in other areas, and thus I think we should go ahead and check in this change.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
