After rebooting the node it  was okay again and a few files and a few clients recovered, but not all.\nI restarted these clients and they completed this time (before noticing the marginal node we restarted the clients twice without success).\n\nI would conclude that the existence of the marginal node must have caused loss of blocks, at least in the tracking mechanism, in addition to eternal retries.\n\nIn summary, dfs should be able to handle datanodes with good heartbeat but otherwise failing to do their job. This should include datanodes that have a high rate of socket connection timeouts.\n\n\n",
