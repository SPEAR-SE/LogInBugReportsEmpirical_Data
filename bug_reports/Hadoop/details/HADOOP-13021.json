I agree with you. However, there could be corner case such as JVM crashes or unit tests terminated in outage. Even we set different value for each machine, for example, machine A has its own bucket. Because of previous outage, there is some leftover directories or files. The next unit test run incline to report error. \n\nI propose we use some timestamp for those hard values. Combining your suggest, we can guarantee that in every time unit test runs on every machine, they are using different hard values.
