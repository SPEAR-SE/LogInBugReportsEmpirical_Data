The namenode uses a single global lock to protect access to data structures. One key area is heartbeat processing. The lower the cost of processing a heartbeat, more the number of nodes HDFS can support.  A simple change to this current locking model can increase the scalability. Here are the details:\n\nCase 1: Currently we have three locks, the global lock (on FSNamesystem), the heartbeat lock and the datanodeMap lock. The following function is called when a heartbeat is received by the Namenode\n\npublic synchronized FSNamesystem. gotHeartbeat() { ........ (A)\n    synchronized (heartbeat) {                                        ........ (B)\n      synchronized (datanodeMap) {                               ......... (C)\n   ...\n     }\n}\n\nIn the above piece of code, statement (A) acquires the global-FSNamesystem-lock. This synchronization can be safely removed (remove updateStats too). This means that a heartbeat from the datanode can be processed without holding the FSnamesystem-global-lock.\n\nCase 2: A following thread called the heartbeatCheck thread periodically traverses all known Datanodes to determine if any of them has timed out. It is of the following form:\n\nvoid FSNamesystem.heartbeatCheck() {\n            synchronized (this) {                                        ........... (D)\n                        synchronized (heartbeats) {                .............(E) \n}\n\nThis thread acquires the global-FSNamesystem lock in Statement (D). This statement (D) can be removed. Instead the loop can check to see if any nodes are dead. If a dead node is found, only then it acquires the FSNamesystem-global-lock.\n\nIt is possible that fixing the above two cases will cause HDFS to scale to higher number of nodes.\n\n ","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12347142","id":"12347142","filename":"heartbeatlock3.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2006-12-14T05:51:25.000+0000","size":6515,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12347142/heartbeatlock3.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"106751","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Increase dfs scalability by optimizing locking on namenode.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358364/comment/12457593","id":"12457593","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"1.
