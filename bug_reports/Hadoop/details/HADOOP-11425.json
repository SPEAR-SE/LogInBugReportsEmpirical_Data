I started with latest stable build  2.6.0. Installed  HDFS on Linux.\n\nMy application is running on Windows  which submits mapreduce jobs remotely. By default we don’t have windows distribution for Hadoop, So I need to build Hadoop on  win32 platform. This turns out the non-trivial tasks as there are so many issue with windows build on both 2.6.0 and 2.2.0. By default Win32 support is not there. \nI am sharing my efforts, so that It can be used by others struggling with same issue.\n\n\nBy default the targets to build on Windows platforms are missing in Hadoop 2.6.0 and 2.2.0 and other release.\n\nSo modify \n\nmodify native.sln and native.vcproj (Add targets for win32)\nmodify libwinutils.vcproj,  winutils.sln and winutils.vcproj (Add targets for win32)\n\nSample for *.sln modification\n353FDE506F33}.Release|Win32.ActiveCfg = Release|Win32\n\t\t{D94B3BD7-39CC-47A0-AE9A-353FDE506F33}.Release|Win32.Build.0 = Release|Win32\n\t\t{12131AA7-902E-4A6D-9CE3-043261D22A12}.Release|Win32.ActiveCfg = Release|Win32\n\t\t{12131AA7-902E-4A6D-9CE3-043261D22A12}.Release|Win32.Build.0 = Release|Win32\n\n\nSample for *.vcproj modification - modify properties with Win32  platform conditional conf. \n\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|Win32'\" Label=\"Configuration\">\n\nCritical Issue - In native.vcproj the following file is not compiled.\nThis gives linker error.\n\n    <ClCompile Include=\"src\\org\\apache\\hadoop\\io\\compress\\lz4\\lz4hc.c\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also need to document to setup the build environment for windows.
