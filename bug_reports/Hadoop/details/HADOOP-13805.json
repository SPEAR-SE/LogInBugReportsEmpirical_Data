intention was to avoid UGI from trying to renew the TGT when the UGI is created from an existing Subject as in that case the keytab is not 'own' by UGI but by the creator of the Subject.\n\nIn HADOOP-13558 we introduced a new private UGI constructor {{UserGroupInformation(Subject subject, final boolean externalKeyTab)}} and we use with TRUE only when doing a {{UGI.loginUserFromSubject()}}.\n\nThe problem is, when we call {{UGI.getCurrentUser()}}, and UGI was created via a Subject (via the {{UGI.loginUserFromSubject()}} method), we call {{new UserGroupInformation(subject)}} which will delegate to {{UserGroupInformation(Subject subject, final boolean externalKeyTab)}}  and that will use externalKeyTab == *FALSE*. \n\nThen the UGI returned by {{UGI.getCurrentUser()}} will attempt to login using a non-existing keytab if the TGT expired.\n\n\nThis problem is experienced in {{KMSClientProvider}} when used by the HDFS filesystem client

In any case, I agree with your initial proposal of having this done in HADOOP-13807 - feels cleaner and more separated :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-01-04T00:07:04.991+0000","updated":"2017-01-04T00:07:04.991+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13019773/comment/15796761","id":"15796761","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue}  0m 12s{color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green}  0m  0s{color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} test4tests {color} | {color:green}  0m  0s{color} | {color:green} The patch appears to include 1 new or modified test files. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 13m 35s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green}  9m 38s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} checkstyle {color} | {color:green}  0m 29s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green}  1m  1s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green}  0m 18s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} findbugs {color} | {color:green}  1m 22s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green}  0m 48s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green}  0m 36s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green}  9m 10s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javac {color} | {color:green}  9m 10s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:orange}-0{color} | {color:orange} checkstyle {color} | {color:orange}  0m 30s{color} | {color:orange} hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common: The patch generated 9 new + 101 unchanged -

So this will delay the failure until the TGT cannot be renewed anymore; \n{quote}\nLooking at the [initial commit|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/1a6ed79ebf6649d4f0828b8c2adff26d0f79832f#diff-8da26f813ae9e87bbf0fb9abb349acc2R445], I think that's what this renewal thread is supposed to do - {{kinit -R}} until the TGT reach its max lifetime. After that, it will fail and seems current code isn't considering it - no {{-kt <keytab>}} is provided to the command.\nVerifying this from shell, {{kinit -R -kt <keytab>}} will get a new TGT to keep credentials updated, but feels like we should split that improvement to a new jira.\nLet's move this part to HADOOP-13807 if you're comfortable.\n\nBack to this jira, I think the issue can be fixed in another way. Current patch breaks {{TestKMS#testTGTRenewal}}, and the usage there seems reasonable.\nSo maybe we can fix it this way - the state of whether a login is external shouldn't be a instance variable of the UGI, but a static variable reflecting what loginFromXXX was performed to log the user in. Therefore, it can track the initial login and perform relogins accordingly. This is different than current patch, because UGI itself instantiates new UGI objects in various calls (e.g. {{getCurrentUser}}), and performs {{loginUserFromSubject}} internally (e.g. {{getLoginUser(null)}}). Having a static variable to reflect the static {{loginUserFromXXX}} methods feels cleaner.\n\nPatch has the proposed fix, and didn't have to change any unit test.

It loginuser from subject, and expects the renewal thread to be created to renew the credential. Because of the fix, no matter whether we disable or enable the config, the condition for creating renewal thread is always false, thus the test failed. The reason is that this test is created after HADOOP-13558, and it depends on the behaviour of HADOOP-13558. Disabling the config will disable the HADOOP-13558 change, enabling it will fix the wrong behavior, that's why this test can't work by simply disabling or enabling the config.\n\nDiscussed with [~xiaochen] who originally created the testcase, we agreed upon a solution that introduce a special field to allow the renewal thread be created for testing purpose. Uploaded rev 008 with this solution. Would you please take a look again?\n\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-01-25T05:50:11.356+0000","updated":"2017-01-25T05:50:11.356+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13019773/comment/15837286","id":"15837286","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue}  0m 15s{color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green}  0m  0s{color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} test4tests {color} | {color:green}  0m  0s{color} | {color:green} The patch appears to include 2 new or modified test files. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 13m 46s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 12m 58s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} checkstyle {color} | {color:green}  0m 31s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green}  1m 14s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green}  0m 17s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} findbugs {color} | {color:green}  1m 30s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green}  0m 46s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green}  0m 39s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 12m 21s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javac {color} | {color:green} 12m 21s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:orange}-0{color} | {color:orange} checkstyle {color} | {color:orange}  0m 28s{color} | {color:orange} hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common: The patch generated 1 new + 220 unchanged -

I think there's a deeper bug this is attempting to mask because I've seen the EZ UGI handling - it is completely screwed up and on my to-do blockers for EZ deployment.\n\nInternally we hacked out the external ugi changes because it broke us.\n\nbq. If you create a UGI from another UGI, ie via getCurrentUser(), the created UGI should not relogin from keytab, the relogin should be done by the creator UGI if it has a keytab.\nbq. My point is, any UGI created from a Subject (directly or via another UGI) should never attempt to relogin, it is the creator of the responsibility to do so.\n\nWrong.  Any UGI should be able to relogin a subject regardless of who created it.  Why should any number of threads be dead in the water waiting for the \"owner\" to relogin in?  It's a shared resource.\n\nbq. The bug i'm hitting now is that UGI.getCurrentUser() creates a new UGI and this tries to do relogin from keytab even if there is no keytab associated to the current UGI. This happens when HDFS client is accessing encryption zones, specifically the HDFS client interacting with the KMS client to get encryption keys.\n\nWhoa.  Let's step back for a minute.  The ugi knows if it's from a keytab based on whether there's a KeyTab instance present.  Why does the ugi think it has a keytab but doesn't have a keytab?  That makes no sense and is an indicator that the ugi is being grossly misused.\n\n[~alejandro.villa] Please provide more details or a stack trace.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-03-03T23:51:00.035+0000","updated":"2017-03-03T23:51:00.035+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13019773/comment/15900196","id":"15900196","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Hi [~daryn],\n\nThe exception we were hitting was:\n\n{code}\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: loginUserFromKeyTab must be done first\nat org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.reloginFromKeytab(UserGroupInformation.java:1055)\nat org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab(UserGroupInformation.java:1020)\nat org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.KMSClientProvider.createConnection(KMSClientProvider.java:478)\nat org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.KMSClientProvider.decryptEncryptedKey(KMSClientProvider.java:771)\nat org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider$3.call(LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider.java:185)\nat org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider$3.call(LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider.java:181)\nat org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider.doOp(LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider.java:94)\nat org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider.decryptEncryptedKey(LoadBalancingKMSClientProvider.java:181)\nat org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.KeyProviderCryptoExtension.decryptEncryptedKey(KeyProviderCryptoExtension.java:388)\nat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSClient.decryptEncryptedDataEncryptionKey(DFSClient.java:1420)\n{code}\n\nThe {{UGI}} as created using a {{Subject}}.
