Since the current expectation is that the tarball exists only on the compute nodes, this may result in some regression - even though it is an unlikely scenario. Even if we keep this, the error message on validation failure is a bit confusing. It says invalid uri, but as far as the user is concerned it just seems like a file path to him.\n- For every datatype in types.py, there are 4 functions. The display_uri function is one of the 4 that's missing. Is this required ?\n- Do we need to do expanduser in types.py: __normalizePath ?\n- The code for verify_uri and norm_uri is trying to normalize a path even if the uri begins with file://. If we specify the URI in this format, I don't think the path can be relative, right ? So, I think we should only be checking for empty string, and not 'file' for the value of component[0].\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-03-25T11:09:35.304+0000","updated":"2008-03-25T11:09:35.304+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12389085/comment/12582209","id":"12582209","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"    *  Added test cases.\n    * Removed validating the hadoop tar ball URI on the client.
