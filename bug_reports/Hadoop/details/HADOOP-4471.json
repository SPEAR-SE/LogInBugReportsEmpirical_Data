That is the problem of temporary disk space usage. \n\nFor e.g. consider a low priority job that has started running. The maps run for this job will use disk space for storing the intermediate outputs. At this point, if a higher priority job is submitted and it starts running, the space used for the low priority job would be held up until it completes. \n\nThis situation is not new, and exists even with the default scheduler. However, because the capacity scheduler runs multiple jobs concurrently (from multiple queues, or from different users), the problem is slightly more serious in this case.\n\nThat said, it is still not clear what a right way of fixing this problem is. At the same time, not sorting running jobs still makes it extremely difficult for users to run high priority jobs in preference to lower priority ones if the need arises. Hence, while the problems with sorting running jobs are acknowledged, we may still want to do this and address the issues in related jiras like HADOOP-4557.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-11-10T14:58:51.572+0000","updated":"2008-11-10T14:58:51.572+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406902/comment/12647262","id":"12647262","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Based on the discussions above, we are deciding to go ahead with this fix.
