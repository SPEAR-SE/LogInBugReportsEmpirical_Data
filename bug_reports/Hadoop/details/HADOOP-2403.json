Something like {{key=length:value}}. Now read _length_ characters at a time for forming the value.\n3) Serialize job history information.\n\nFollowing are the problems with {{(2)}} when error-like strings are stored in {{JobHistory}} :\n1) The whole line needs to be read before parsing and hence there is no good way to detect the length at the key-value level. \n 2) A simple solution would be to use _record-level_ length. But again there is a problem :\n\n- Currently, the code checks for a ' \" ' in the end before considering the record as complete. This can be erroneous as error string can contain ' \" ' which might lead to premature termination. Also the splitting of _key-val_ pairs is done based on _space_. Hence with _error_ like strings in the history, the split will result into wrong key-val pairs. Hence _encoding-decoding_ seems to a better fix for all these problems. \n\n\nWhile encoding, one should make sure that the data is written in one line. Hence the record parsing algorithm becomes\n1) Read line. Since all the entries fit in one line, there is no need to look for record end.\n2) Split the line based on _space_. \n3) Split the pair on '=' to get key and value. Recover the value if required.\n----\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-07-30T14:08:04.547+0000","updated":"2008-07-30T14:08:04.547+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12384366/comment/12618355","id":"12618355","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching a sample encode/decode implementation\n\n_Data in code_  :\n{code}\n StringBuffer line = new StringBuffer();\n  line.append(\"I m happy\");\n  line.append('\\n');\n  line.append(\"me 2\");\n  line.append('\\n');\n  line.append(\"`1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\\\\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./~!@#$%^&*()_+QWERTYUIOP{}|ASDFGHJKL:\\\"'ZXCVBNM<>?\\r\\t\\b\\n\\f\");\n{code}\n_Data on screen_ :\nData : \n{code}\nI m happy\nme 2\n`1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./~!@#$%^&*()_+QWERTYUIOP{}|ASDFGHJKL:\"'ZXCVBNM<>?\n\n\n{code}\n------------------------------------\nCode : \n{code}\n73-32-109-32-104-97-112-112-121-10-109-101-32-50-10-96-49-50-51-52-53-54-55-56-57-48-45-61-113-119-101-114-116-121-117-105-111-112-91-93-92-97-115-100-102-103-104-106-107-108-59-39-122-120-99-118-98-110-109-44-46-47-126-33-64-35-36-37-94-38-42-40-41-95-43-81-87-69-82-84-89-85-73-79-80-123-125-124-65-83-68-70-71-72-74-75-76-58-34-39-90-88-67-86-66-78-77-60-62-63-13-9-8-10-12-\n{code}\n------------------------------------\nDecoded :\n{code}\nI m happy\nme 2\n`1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./~!@#$%^&*()_+QWERTYUIOP{}|ASDFGHJKL:\"'ZXCVBNM<>?\n\n\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-07-30T14:20:46.854+0000","updated":"2008-07-30T14:20:46.854+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12384366/comment/12621727","id":"12621727","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Here is patch with one line change which replaces occurances of *\\n* with *\\ \\n* (there is no space in between both back slashes.

Similarly other strings in the history can have these characters like counter-names etc. \nThis problems can fail HADOOP-3245.\n\nI would go for having a record _delimiter_ like a {{.}}(dot) to detect if the record is complete or not.
