This is dangerous since it is the *{{TaskTracker#TaskInProgress#cleanup}}* call which removes the taskid from {{TaskTracker#tasks}}.\nc) {{TaskTracker#TaskInProgress#reportProgress}} unconditionally marks the task's run-state as {{RUNNING}} which clearly is wrong, since it overwrites the task's {{KILLED}} status set in {{TaskTracker#TaskInProgress#kill}}.\n\nOverall a combination of the above leads to the task never being removed from {{TaskTracker#runningTasks}} which leads to the bug in question.\n\nThe way to get around is to:\na) Call {{tasks.remove(taskid)}} from {{TaskTracker#TaskInProgress#kill}} to ensure the interspersed call to {{TaskTracker#TaskInProgress#reportProgress}} fails to wrongly update the task status as {{RUNNING}}\nor\nb) Check to ensure the task's state is actually {{RUNNING}} before updating it's status when the child reports in.\n\nI'd go with (b).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-10-10T20:14:42.937+0000","updated":"2007-10-10T20:14:42.937+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12379973/comment/12533869","id":"12533869","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"First cut - relatively straight-forward; I'll continue testing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-10-10T20:27:40.433+0000","updated":"2007-10-10T20:27:40.433+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12379973/comment/12533943","id":"12533943","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I figured that a less intrusive approach to just ignore the child's status-update and not asking it to kill itself right-away would work as well.
