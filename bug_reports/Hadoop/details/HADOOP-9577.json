This was avoided by not reusing blob names, and using OpenStack Swift's {{X-NEWEST}} header, which so far has met its promise of \"returning the newest value\".\n\nEven so, the other issue with blobstores is that most don't meet Hadoop's expectations of atomicity of directory create, rename and delete; rename is used during the commits of MR jobs. We have expectations of a filesystem \"presents a consistent single-instance view of a hierarchical filesystem across the cluster\" that are very much broken by blobstores \"a set of blobs with variable consistency guarantees, onto which we have to mimic directories through bulk blob operations\".\n\nThis is why we're trying to spell out our expectations more clearly in HADOOP-9361, under which I'm thinking we need to add an explicit {{Blobstore}} interface to the blobstores to indicate -at least to MapReduce- that what implements the FileSystem isn't really, and that we need to commit differently. If you can help define and fix the behaviour -and verify it works- we'd love your participation. \n\nFor now, something we should think about spelling out in more detail is \"commit to HDFS then copy to S3\", and \"if you do output to a blobstore, make sure speculation is turned off\".\n\n Making sure that distCP works reliably with blobstores should be a first step in blobstore-aware work.\n\n\nNow\n# was this Apache Hadoop 1.0.3 or the Amazon variant? \n# was speculative execution enabled?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2013-05-18T20:57:27.342+0000","updated":"2013-05-18T20:57:27.342+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12648285/comment/13661590","id":"13661590","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=j_caplan","name":"j_caplan","key":"j_caplan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joshua Caplan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"To answer your questions:\n1.

Speculative execution was certainly enabled.  I suppose if I could live without speculative execution for the jobs that write directly to S3, I could use the DirectFileOutputCommitter or some derivative to avoid this issue.\n\nYour comments about blobstores in general and Hadoop's assumptions about FileSystems are enlightening.  I definitely prefer the commit to HDFS and copy later strategy.\n\nMy reason for calling out this particular FileSystem side-effect assumption is that it seems like a gratuitous use for accomplishing the goal of deciding whether or not there's temporary output to commit.
