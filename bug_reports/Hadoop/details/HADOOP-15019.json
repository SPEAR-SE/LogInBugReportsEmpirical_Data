I believe this is because the de-duping at https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/cbc632d9abf08c56a7fc02be51b2718af30bad28/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop-functions.sh#L1200 is ignoring the \"before/after\" parameter.\r\n\r\nMy way of reproduction, first build the following trivial Java program:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n$cat Test.java\r\npublic class Test {\r\n  public static void main(String[]args) {\r\n    System.out.println(System.getenv().get(\"CLASSPATH\"));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n$javac Test.java\r\n$jar cf test.jar Test.class\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWith that, if you happen to have an entry in HADOOP_CLASSPATH that matches what Hadoop would produce, you'll find the ordering not honored. It's easiest to reproduce this with a match for HADOOP_CONF_DIR, as in the second case below:\r\n{code}\r\n# As you'd expect, /usr/share is first!\r\n$HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/etc HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST=\"true\" HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/usr/share:/tmp:/bin bin/hadoop jar test.jar Test | tr ':' '\\n' | grep -n . | grep '/usr/share'\r\nWARNING: log4j.properties is not found. HADOOP_CONF_DIR may be incomplete.\r\n1:/usr/share\r\n\r\n# Surprise! /usr/share is now in the 3rd line, even thought it was first in HADOOP_CLASSPATH.\r\n$HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/usr/share HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST=\"true\" HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/usr/share:/tmp:/bin bin/hadoop jar test.jar Test | tr ':' '\\n' | grep -n . | grep '/usr/share'\r\nWARNING: log4j.properties is not found. HADOOP_CONF_DIR may be incomplete.\r\n3:/usr/share\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTo re-iterate, what's surprising is that you can make an entry that's first in HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH show up not first in the resulting classpath.\r\n\r\nI ran into this configuring {{bin/hive}} with a confdir that was being used for both HDFS and Hive, and flailing as to why my {{log4j2.properties}} wasn't being read. The one in my conf dir was lower in my classpath than one bundled in some Hive jar.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Hadoop shell script classpath de-duping ignores HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST ","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=philip","name":"philip","key":"philip","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Philip Zeyliger","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=philip","name":"philip","key":"philip","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Philip Zeyliger","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13116536/comment/16242263","id":"16242263","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"bq.
