While it's true that the {{Listener}} and {{Reader}} threads are not guaranteed to be fully initialized after return from {{RPC#Server#start}}, the important thing is that the server socket is listening and accepting connections, via the code in the {{Listener}} constructor:\n\n{code}\n    public Listener() throws IOException {\n      address = new InetSocketAddress(bindAddress, port);\n      // Create a new server socket and set to non blocking mode\n      acceptChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();\n      acceptChannel.configureBlocking(false);\n\n      // Bind the server socket to the local host and port\n      bind(acceptChannel.socket(), address, backlogLength, conf, portRangeConfig);\n{code}\n\nThe server socket bind is guaranteed to be done before {{RPC#Server#start}} returns, so a caller can start a server and be guaranteed that an immediate connection attempt will succeed.  It might experience some extra latency on the response if it needs to wait for the {{Listener}} and {{Reader}} threads to finish initialization, but it won't fail.\n\nI don't think this is really a bug.  We probably just need to change the logic of the failing test, and this is already covered in HADOOP-8980.\n\nI'm planning on resolving this as Not a Problem.  I'll leave this open a few more days in case anyone else wants to comment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-27T20:55:46.157+0000","updated":"2013-06-27T20:55:46.157+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12655069/comment/13696383","id":"13696383","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"As per prior comments, this doesn't appear to be a real problem in practice, so I'm resolving it as not a problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-30T17:36:27.900+0000","updated":"2013-06-30T17:36:27.900+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-9674/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1lug7:"}}
