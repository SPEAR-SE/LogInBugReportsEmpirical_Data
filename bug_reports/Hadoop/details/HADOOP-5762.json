Actually, my first attempt to fix this bug did exactly that. Then I noticed that method copy() was already programmed to copy empty directories and, except for the root source, directories were being added to src_writer on method setup. I think it's a good design option to let copy be the only method that actually writes something to the destination. This makes the code simpler and more elegant (thus, more maintainable).\n\nI'm don't like the idea of creating only the root src directory (in case it's empty) on setup(). It just doesn't look good. And creating all empty src subdirectories on setup might force us to do a lot of extra checking on setup to cope with failures (checks that already exist on copy()). I don't think many people will be using distcp to copy empty directories and it doesn't look like the performance gain will compensate the loss in code simplicity.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rschmidt","name":"rschmidt","key":"rschmidt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rodrigo Schmidt","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-05-11T21:41:02.001+0000","updated":"2009-05-11T21:41:02.001+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424365/comment/12708687","id":"12708687","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rschmidt","name":"rschmidt","key":"rschmidt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rodrigo Schmidt","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Uploading a new patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rschmidt","name":"rschmidt","key":"rschmidt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rodrigo Schmidt","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-05-12T23:34:05.369+0000","updated":"2009-05-12T23:34:05.369+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424365/comment/12713595","id":"12713595","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 The latest patch looks good.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-27T14:49:46.446+0000","updated":"2009-05-27T14:49:46.446+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424365/comment/12715789","id":"12715789","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
