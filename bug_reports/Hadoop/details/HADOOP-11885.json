If you have a sec, would appreciate a quick look from a more experienced shell scripter.\n\n{noformat}\n-> % mvn -f hadoop-dist/pom.xml package -Pdist\n...or...\n-> % dash target/dist-layout-stitching.sh\n{noformat}\n\nSounds like we really need that dev-support refactor, or maven assembly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-29T01:27:55.818+0000","updated":"2015-04-29T01:27:55.818+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12825720/comment/14518523","id":"14518523","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brahmareddy","name":"brahmareddy","key":"brahmareddy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624"},"displayName":"Brahma Reddy Battula","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Nice catch..Shall I post patch ..?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brahmareddy","name":"brahmareddy","key":"brahmareddy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brahmareddy&avatarId=24624"},"displayName":"Brahma Reddy Battula","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-04-29T01:29:58.934+0000","updated":"2015-04-29T01:29:58.934+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12825720/comment/14518854","id":"14518854","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\\\\\n\\\\\n| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | pre-patch |  14m 28s | Pre-patch trunk compilation is healthy. |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | @author |   0m  0s | The patch does not contain any @author tags. |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | tests included |   0m  0s | The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
