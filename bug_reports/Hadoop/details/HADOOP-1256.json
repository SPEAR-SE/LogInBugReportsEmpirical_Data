optimization really\nworks and worth the complexity involved.\n\nThese bugs are related to the optimization issue HADOOP-971, which introduced\na new data-structure in the name-node in order to accelerate access to data-nodes by name.\nIt involves more complexity in synchronizing the new map with the other structures.\nWe still don't know what the benefits are.\n\nWe have TestDFSIO and NNBench to measure the performance.\nIn this particular case the cluster should have a lot of data-nodes, so it probably needs\na custom benchmark, which should run imo both on a small cluster to show the existing\nperformance does not degrade and on a large one to show the advantages.\n\nI'd propose to make it a requirement for committing optimization
