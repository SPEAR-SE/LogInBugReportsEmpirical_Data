In its current form it passed in an array sized to min(maxblocks,blocks.size()) into the Collections.toArray method. As the javadoc for Collections.toArray indicates, the toArray method may discard the passed in array (and allocate a new array) if the number of elements returned by the iterator exceeds the size of the passed in array. As a result, the flawed implementation of this method would return all the invalid blocks for a data node in one go, and thus trigger the NameNode to send a DNA_INVALIDATE command to the DataNode with an excessively large number of blocks. This INVALIDATE command, in turn, could potentially take a very long time to process at the DataNode, and since DatanodeCommand(s) are processed in between heartbeats at the DataNode, this would trigger the NameNode to consider the DataNode to be offline / unresponsive (due to a lack of heartbeats). \n\nIn our use-case at CommonCrawl.org, we regularly do large scale hdfs file deletions after certain stages of our map-reduce pipeline. These deletes would make certain DataNode(s) unresponsive, and thus impact the cluster's capability to properly balance file-system reads / writes across the whole available cluster. This problem only surfaced once we migrated from our 16.2 deployment to the current 18.1 release.

You only have to set root = null,\n\nYou are right. I see that TreeSet uses TreeMap as the underlying container, and, each iterator.remove causes a re-balance of the red-black tree. And, yes, looks like TreeSet.clear() set root = null, which is obviously speedier. I would still argue that under normal load scenarios (from my initial observations), the number of blocks in the Collection are <= 10, and since delete on the CLRS implementation of the Red-Black Tree takes O(log n), there might not be that much gained from the .clear() optimization. In the edge case where the system is under heavy load, I observed block count in excess of 1000. In this case, a partial removal of the blocks (based on the max blocks limitation) would still require the iterator.remove pattern. So perhaps in the long term, it might be better to replace the underlying data structure, as Hairong suggests. I guess it would be interesting to find out if the code (post patch) is a performance bottle neck or not before undertaking the more aggressive modifications.
