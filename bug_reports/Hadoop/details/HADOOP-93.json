Smaller splits should only be used if this would result in fewer than mapred.map.tasks splits.  What value do you have for mapred.map.tasks in your mapred-default.xml?  Let's make sure that is working before we add a new min.split.size feature.  I don't oppose the feature, but it should be generating 356*30G/32M splits, not 356*30G/2K splits as you claim.  That's still a lot of splits.  If it is too many then we should add the feature you're adding.\n\nNote that, as a workaround, it is also easy to implement this w/o patching by defining an InputFormat that subclasses InputFormatBase and specifies a different minSplitSize.  But making that a long is a good idea.\n\nSo, in summary, can you please confirm that the actual number of splits that you object to is 356*30G/32M splits, not 356*30G/2K?
