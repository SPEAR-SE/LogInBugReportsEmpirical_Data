are some insights:\n\nEssentially there seems like a issue with {{TaskCompletionEvent}}s received by the {{ReduceTask}}. More than one *stuck* reducer (looking for map outputs) never actually scheduled a copy from the maps from which it is missing outputs, which leads me to believe that there is an issue with missing {{TaskCompletionEvents}}s.\n\nThe other minor bug is the one I pointed out in my previous comment, so I've attached another patch which incorporates:\na) previous fix\nb) a debug statement to help track the received {{TaskCompletionEvent}}s at the {{Reduce}} task.\n\nChristian: I'd appreciate if you could try this out...
