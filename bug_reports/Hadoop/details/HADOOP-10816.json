So this whole argument is probably moot.  Or, we could actually define some different error codes: \n# Argument processing error\n# Command validation error\n# Command execution error\n\nI've uploaded patch 2 for your consideration, should we choose to go this way, which says that it returns 1, and tests that it returns 1, and has the following language:\n{noformat}\n+   * @return 0 on success and 1 on failure.  This value is passed back to\n+   * the unix shell, so we must follow shell return code conventions:\n+   * the return code is an unsigned character, and 0 means success, and\n+   * small positive integers mean failure.\n{noformat}\n\nI'd also be happy to implement multiple return codes as above.
