Most checksum errors folks see are from local disks during sorting, not HDFS.  So, yes, we'll still need it.\n\nAnd per-block checksums are different.  They're not end-to-end.  Currently we checksum the data as it is written to the output stream's buffer, and validate it as it is read from the input stream's buffer.  A lot can happen between that time and it winding up in a DFS block.  To replace this we'd ideally want to still compute the checksum as it is written, transmit it along with the block to datanodes, then transmit it back to the client when the data is read, and verify as it is read.  We'd also need sub-block checksums, not per-block, so that one can seek without checksumming an entire block.  Yes, TCP does checksums, but memory errors can be introduced on either end outside of the TCP stack, and, if blocks are temporarily stored on local disk, it can also be a source of block corruption.  So getting rid of CRC files for even HDFS will take more than just per-block checksums on datanodes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-11-22T19:44:28.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-22T19:44:28.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12356215/comment/12452613","id":"12452613","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eric14","name":"eric14","key":"eric14","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"eric baldeschwieler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Well the discussion does seem to be on the topic of the subject.

One which is typically used for lightweight copies and does not write CRCs and one which does and has an inverse command that validates the CRCs on import.
