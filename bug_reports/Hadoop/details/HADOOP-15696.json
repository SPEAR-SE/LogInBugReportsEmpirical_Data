Our internal testing shows the openfd number was in the range of a few hundred in Hadoop 2.x, and it increases by almost 100x in Hadoop 3.\r\n# Hadoop 3.x KMS as much as twice the heap size than in Hadoop 2.x. The same heap size can go OOM in Hadoop 3.x. Jxray analysis suggests most of them are temporary byte arrays associated with open SSL connections.\r\n# Due to the heap usage, Hadoop 3.x KMS has more frequent GC activities, and we observed up to 20% performance reduction due to GC.\r\n\r\nA possible solution is to reduce the idle timeout setting in HttpServer2. It is currently hard-coded 10 seconds. By setting it to 1 second, open fds dropped from 20 thousand down to 3 thousand in my experiment.\r\n\r\nFile this jira to invite open discussion for a solution.\r\n\r\nCredit: [~misha@cloudera.com]

{{HttpServer2.configureChannelConnector(ServerConnector c)}} method. Currently it has the {{c.setIdleTimeout(10000);}} line. This timeout should be made configurable in the first place, and looks like we need to adjust it to a (much) smaller value when {{HttpServer2}} is used by KMS.\r\n\r\nHere is a question that I have in this regard. If by closing HTTP connections on the server side, and thus recycling more quickly, we make KMS work better - does it mean that the KMS client doesn't reuse any such connections, and/or doesn't close a connection when it doesn't need it anymore? If so, it doesn't sound very optimal. I wonder how to prove or disprove this theory.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=misha%40cloudera.com","name":"misha@cloudera.com","key":"misha@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Misha Dmitriev","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-08-28T00:13:32.679+0000","updated":"2018-08-28T00:13:32.679+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13181222/comment/16594364","id":"16594364","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=misha%40cloudera.com","name":"misha@cloudera.com","key":"misha@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Misha Dmitriev","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Answering my own question: yes, it looks like indeed the KMS client opens a new HTTP connection for every request, and doesn't seem to close it explicitly. See methods such in {{KMSClientProvider}} , e.g. {{decryptEncryptedKey()}}, {{getCurrentKey()}}, {{deleteKey()}} etc. They all invoke {{createConnection()}}, then {{call()}} with this connection to send a request and get a response, and then I don't see any code that would close that connection.\r\n\r\nIt's hard for me to say whether it's by design or by neglect, but anyway, such a frequent creation of TCP connection and no explicit close/reuse look unusual. At a minimum, I think it's worth documenting this behavior briefly somewhere, maybe in the top-level javadoc of the {{KMSClientProvider}} class. I suggest to do it in the above patch so that this is not left behind.\r\n\r\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=misha%40cloudera.com","name":"misha@cloudera.com","key":"misha@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Misha Dmitriev","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-08-28T00:51:42.678+0000","updated":"2018-08-28T00:51:42.678+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13181222/comment/16595788","id":"16595788","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Misha.\r\n\r\nI attached a patch to do exactly what you suggest firstly: make the idle timeout configurable and make the KMS's default shorter.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things remain to do that I plan to work on:\r\n # find the optimal idle timeout value\r\n # figure out if the KMS client's behavior can be improved.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-08-29T00:38:41.566+0000","updated":"2018-08-29T00:38:41.566+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13181222/comment/16595865","id":"16595865","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=misha%40cloudera.com","name":"misha@cloudera.com","key":"misha@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Misha Dmitriev","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think the KMS client can be improved as follows. The goal is to avoid creating a TCP connection for each call as done now, but also avoid the situation when a call is blocked waiting for a connection to become available.\r\n\r\nLet's use a {{BlockingQueue}} to store connections for reuse. When some client thread needs to make a call, it first checks the queue for an available old connection. If such a connection is available and not closed yet, it's reused and then stored back in the queue. If no open connection is available, a new one is created, used and then also stored back in the queue. In this situation we will normally need no more connection than the maximum number of concurrent client threads.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=misha%40cloudera.com","name":"misha@cloudera.com","key":"misha@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Misha Dmitriev","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-08-29T02:38:57.856+0000","updated":"2018-08-29T02:38:57.856+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13181222/comment/16595912","id":"16595912","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Hi [~jojochuang]\r\n\r\nAs this jira is marked for 3.2 as a blocker, cud u pls help to take this forward or move out if its not feasible to finish in coming weeks. 3.2 code freeze date is nearby in a weeks.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think originally with tomcat, this way of connection setup didn't cause any issue probably because the connection was polled by tomcat. This has proven to be problematic in Jetty, and glad having the idle timeout dropped helped this situation.\r\n\r\nHow about we do this jira first to make it configurable, and continue the connection reuse improvement as a follow-on? A tricky part for the connection reuse is (at least on current trunk) the connection object is created in relation to the caller ugi, so one would need to make sure the reuse doesn't expose any security concerns. From use case perspective, I agree the connection should be reused - and if not, the connection to be proactively closed by the client.\r\n\r\nMinor code review comment on patch 1:\r\n- Instead of calling it {{HTTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT}} we may call it {{HTTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS}} for clarity about the millisecond unit\r\n- It seems httpfs-default could also use such an update.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-08-30T05:29:27.553+0000","updated":"2018-08-30T05:29:27.553+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13181222/comment/16598091","id":"16598091","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=misha%40cloudera.com","name":"misha@cloudera.com","key":"misha@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Misha Dmitriev","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~xiaochen] I agree that any work on connection reusing is more complex and should be done under another jira.\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate on \"the connection object is created in relation to the caller ugi\" statement?
