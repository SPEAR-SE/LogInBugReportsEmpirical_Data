How one accomplishes this is an implementation detail. If the only way to do it is to unjar the archive more than once then I guess that would have to be the solution. This saves the potential for a lot of grief. No shared files are ever modified because they aren't actually shared. This causes more unpacking of jars but I don't really see that as a problem. How the jar's are copied to a node and the  subsequent reuse of the jar is important. \n\nThat is the sandbox. Then there is the shared sandbox which is also two different instance to memory map a file and pay a single cost. This is best handled by either softlinks or hardlinks under unix/linux. \n\nWhy do I think these are important models? Most of the programs that I write and that I use run out of the current directory and expect all of the their configuration files/resources can be read from there. For programs that have more sophisticated models of deployment the models above are still ok. For the simpler programs the proposed external repository doesn't work.\n\nOTOH I can always run a script that will hard link the files from the directory where the jar to my current working directory. I just don't believe that this should be forced on the users. Having the users do system'ish things is potentially dangerous.\n\nEven more restrictive then the above sandbox would be one in which the application is run chroot'd. That way there is no way it could muck with anything system like on the nodes. This is an important consideration when one lets arbitrary programs to be run.

Maybe I don't have access to the source of all programs that I might want to run, or I have the source and don't desire to make any changes. Having the data for an application be rooted in the current directory allows many more programs to be run with no changes.\n2. I think of hadoop as an infrastructure to run other progams. not as something to write programs too. This means that I do not want to write into my progams hadoop'isms. \n\nRunning streaming apps on hadoop should be as transparent as possible.\n\nFiles being a shared resource is an efficiency consideration not one required for proper operation. Is there an operational requirement for the files being shared such as I need to mmap the same file? Is this likely the way that most programs will be. \n\nIt's not that I'm absolutely against the .. structure, just that it seems to me not to be the most useful structure. I would contend that if you desire the .. placement you need also, some how, provide for placement in the current working directory.\n\nThe above comments only apply to streaming. \n\nA more general comment, perhaps philosophical, perhaps religious.\n\nThe purpose of hadoop is to allow work to be divided and then executed with a belief of correctness that is the same as would have if I ran it as a single job on a single machine. Sharing data in a way that allows inadvertant/unintended manipulation of 'SHARED' data violates this. It seems to me that this should be used when efficiency is needed and the user can take an appropriate explicit action to enable it. \n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkasperski","name":"rkasperski","key":"rkasperski","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Richard Kasperski","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-11-20T16:30:34.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-20T16:30:34.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12354634/comment/12451450","id":"12451450","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ok, I propose that we handle this as a streaming option. So:\n\n1. For all map/reduce jobs the task has current working directory set to the task specific directory.\n2. For streaming if the property \"mapred.create.symlink\" is true, the contents of the job directory (other than the task directories) are symlinked into the task directory. Note that this property is already used for the file cache for a similar purpose and in streaming defaults to true.\n\nIf there was a convenient way to make the job cache files read only in Java, that would make me more comfortable about violating the sandbox isolation.
