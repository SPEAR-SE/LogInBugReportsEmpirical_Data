I'm with Haohui here: make it something projects explicitly turn on/off if they choose. HDFS's needs \"part of a management console\" are different from a YARN app where that's not a perceived use case.\n\nOn that topic, we'd probably recommend that YARN apps use it too, wouldn't we? Or at least have the RM proxy add it when filtering requests, which would give it to the apps automatically.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-01-08T15:38:39.558+0000","updated":"2016-01-08T15:38:39.558+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845159/comment/15089380","id":"15089380","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} patch {color} | {color:red} 0m 4s {color} | {color:red} HADOOP-12234 does not apply to trunk.

I think that it makes sense to keep these web app security filters together. I don't really care for the \"lib\" in this package name but maybe this is an existing pattern in hadoop elsewhere?\n2. configuration prefixes - in order to accommodate some ability for some components to override a global setting, I proposed the use of separate prefixes. A global one that would be used if a component specific one was not found. See the JIRA for comments around that.\n3. filter initializer - it seems that this implementation has its own filter initializer where HADOOP-13008 introduces the filter and would rely on integration specific initializers which would be able to interrogate the prefixed configuration for each integration point.\n\nI think that we should determine which implementation should be resolved as duplicate based on the sense of which one is closer to what we need and adjusting to accommodate the other. I don't have any problem discarding HADOOP-13008 but let's discuss here.\n\nI would like to get this feature in as soon as we possibly can in order to address the needs and concerns of our customers/users.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2016-04-21T12:30:46.780+0000","updated":"2016-04-21T12:30:46.780+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845159/comment/15251875","id":"15251875","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue} 0m 0s {color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} patch {color} | {color:red} 0m 4s {color} | {color:red} HADOOP-12234 does not apply to trunk.
