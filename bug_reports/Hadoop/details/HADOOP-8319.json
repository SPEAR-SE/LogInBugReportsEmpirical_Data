{Write|Verify}Checksum for FileContext and viewFS.  \n * Make a LocalFs constructor public so that it can be extended by the test.\n * remove one of the renameInternal implementation from FilterFs since it is not being overridden by ChecksumFs.\n * Modify ChecksumFs to create checksum files only in cases when the flag was set to true.\n * Add a method to resolve a path as much as possible (in cases where the full path does not exist). This is to support cases where a user does a set {Write|Verify} Checksum on a file that does not exist yet. This is a valid usecase since the user should be able to write a checksum before a file is created or verify it in cases where a file is being copied.\n\nAppreciate reviews and open to suggestions and comments. I will also be running all the  tests in hadoop common and posting the results here.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnvijoe","name":"johnvijoe","key":"johnvijoe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John George","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-04-27T21:54:32.004+0000","updated":"2012-04-27T21:54:32.004+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12552875/comment/13264078","id":"13264078","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

First, a general question: why change the visible of LocalFs ctor to public?\nIt is needed by one of the tests (that is not in the same package), which unfortunately was missing in the latest patch I uploaded. Will upload the right patch soon\n\nbq. This patch doesn't work when a path symlinks off to a different afs. fc.setWriteChecksum(boolean, Path) will instantiate the resolved afs, set the flag, the afs instance goes \"poof\", and the subsequent create will get another instance of the afs with the default value. One solution might be to cache all the afs used by the context so the value persists.\nGood catch Daryn. You are right that the patch will not work on paths when it leads to a different afs than the {{defaultFS}} already cached in FC. I guess a discussion to resolve this is happening in HADOOP-6356.\n\nbq. However, I'm not comfortable with the misleading semantics of fc.setWriteChecksum(boolean, Path). The path argument implies the flag applies only to the given path, but in this patch it applies to the entire afs of the given path. I'd be more comfortable with mimicing fs and just have fc.setWriteChecksum(boolean) set an instance var in the fc. fc.create calls the resolved afs.setWriteChecksum, and then afs.create.\nThe reason {{setWriteChecksum}} requires a patch argument is because FileContext, just like ViewFS, works on paths and resolves the path to an FS. If we remove the path, {{setWriteChecksum}} will have the side effect that it apply to all the FS that the filecontext resolves in a path.\n\nbq. What I think ultimately needs to be done is for fs/afs create to accept a flag for whether checksums are written. This provides more granularity, avoids threading issues where one thread changes the value for all threads, prevents viewfs from applying the setting to all its mounts, and would solve the unexpected behavior in FileSystem where the cache causes the value to change in every instance/reference to the fs.\nPassing the flag as part of create sounds like a good idea to me. If you feel strongly for this, we could file a JIRA to address this at a later point in time.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnvijoe","name":"johnvijoe","key":"johnvijoe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John George","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-03T17:03:27.518+0000","updated":"2012-05-03T17:03:27.518+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12552875/comment/13267672","id":"13267672","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnvijoe","name":"johnvijoe","key":"johnvijoe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John George","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching a patch with all the test cases etc ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnvijoe","name":"johnvijoe","key":"johnvijoe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John George","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-03T18:34:55.708+0000","updated":"2012-05-03T18:34:55.708+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12552875/comment/13267702","id":"13267702","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

The reason setWriteChecksum requires a patch argument is because FileContext, just like ViewFS, works on paths and resolves the path to an FS.

With the patch as-is, the user can't reliably control the writing or verification of checksums w/o explicitly resolving paths and creating a new context for the resolved path – which kind of defeats the purpose of the context.\n{quote}\nThe user can set/reset the values specific to the path. But like you said, the other option is to allow user to only set/reset per file context (as opposed to per AFS that each path belongs to). That might simplify the implementation and make it less complex for the user as well. \n\n{quote}\nDo you have another solution in mind to control the flags?\n{quote}\nThe other solution is to cache the state per AFS which is the latest patch I have uploaded. But, I am leaning towards your proposal of per FC, especially since the setWD and getWD are implemented per FC.\n\nLet me know your thoughts either way.
