buffer:\n\n{code}\nseek(0);\nreadFully(1);\n{code}\n\nThis primes the buffer. After this, the current state of the buffered stream is {{pos=0, count=4096, filepos=4096}}\n\n{code}\nseek(2000);\n{code}\n\nThe seek sees that the required data is in already in the buffer, and just sets {{pos=2000}}\n\n{code}\nreadFully(10000);\n{code}\n\nThis first copies the remaining bytes from the buffer and sets {{pos=4096}}. Then, because 5904 bytes are remaining, and this is larger than the buffer size, it copies them directly into the user-supplied output buffer. This leaves the state of the stream at {{pos=4096, count=4096, filepos=12000}}\n\n{code}\nseek(11000);\n{code}\n\nThe \"optimization\" in BufferedFSInputStream sees that there are 4096 buffered bytes, and that this seek is supposedly within the window, assuming that those 4096 bytes directly precede filepos. So, it erroneously just sets {{pos=3096}}.\n\nThe next read will then get the wrong results for the first 1000 bytes -- yielding bytes 3096-4096 of the file instead of bytes 11000-12000.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-02-14T08:51:25.536+0000","updated":"2013-02-14T08:51:25.536+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12632335/comment/13578245","id":"13578245","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I believe this may be the root cause of the behavior that [~eclark] was seeing in HADOOP-8336.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-02-14T08:52:18.288+0000","updated":"2013-02-14T08:52:18.288+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12632335/comment/13578275","id":"13578275","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Interesting.

At the beginning of every unique record a synchronization point is created with DataFileWriter.sync(). (I cannot or do not want to save the sync points and i do not want to use SortedKeyValueFile as output format for M/R job)  \n\nThere are at-least 25k synchronization points in a 340 MB file.\n\nEx:\nMarker1_RecordA1_RecordA2_RecordA3_Marker2_RecordB1_RecordB2\n\n\nAs records are sorted, for efficient retrieval, binary search is performed using the attached code.\n\nMost of the times the search is successful, at times the code throws the following exception\n------\norg.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: java.io.IOException: Invalid sync! at org.apache.avro.file.DataFileStream.hasNext(DataFileStream.java:210 \n------\n\n\n\nQuestions\n1) Is it ok to have 25k sycn points for 300 MB file ? Does it cost in performance while reading ?\n2) I note down the position that was used to invoke fileReader.sync(mid);. If i catch AvroRuntimeException, close and open the file and sync(mid) i do not see exception. Why should Avro throw exception before and not later ?\n3) Is there a limit on number of times sync() is invoked ?\n4) When sync(position) is invoked, are any 0 >= position <= file.size()  valid ? If yes why do i see AvroRuntimeException (#2) ?\n\n======\n\nSome of the questions are irrelevant here.\n\nAs the patch has been committed, what version of hadoop-core will have this fix ?
