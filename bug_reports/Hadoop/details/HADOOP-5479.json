The current code interprets it as numOfTargets to be replicated. This change is made in DatanodeDescriptor#BlockTargetPair.poll(). This prevents empty replication requests as well as empty recover requests.\n# The number of targets to be chosen is not capped by the number of transfers. Again NameNode should not treat the number of transfers as the number of targets.\n# The third change is not directly related to this issue. But I saw this happen when I debugged this issue. The current code moves a block to the pending replication queue only when it reaches its replication factor. This sometimes causes over-replication because it does not track all pending replications. This patch adds a block to the pending replication queue whenever there is one replication scheduled for this block.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-03-12T21:21:43.882+0000","updated":"2009-03-12T21:21:43.882+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416767/comment/12682410","id":"12682410","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 on all changes.\n\nLittle thing:\n{{else}} clause in {{DatanodeDescriptor.BlockQueue.poll()}} can be removed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-03-16T18:52:04.808+0000","updated":"2009-03-16T18:52:04.808+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416767/comment/12682489","id":"12682489","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks Konstantin for the review.
