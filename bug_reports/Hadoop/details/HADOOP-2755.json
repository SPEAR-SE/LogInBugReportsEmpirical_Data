This has been fixed, but I suspect, all the blocks of this node needed to get replicated. But this is less than 20,000 blocks. This should be handled easily by dfs.\n\nAlso the namenode came out of safemode automatically, i.e. there were no missing blocks, which you would expect from a massive failure of joining datanodes.\n\n60% cpu out of 400% cpu (there are 4 cpu's) is not much in my opinion. What is strange compared to other namenodes is  that the system usage of the CPU is relatively high.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ckunz","name":"ckunz","key":"ckunz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christian Kunz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-01-31T23:11:39.707+0000","updated":"2008-01-31T23:11:39.707+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12387556/comment/12564544","id":"12564544","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ckunz","name":"ckunz","key":"ckunz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christian Kunz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This is a 1300 active node cluster with blockreports every hour  each (they seem to take a couple of seconds each) and heartbeat interval every minute.
