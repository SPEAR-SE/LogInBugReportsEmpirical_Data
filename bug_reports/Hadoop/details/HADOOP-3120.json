You are right, if we went from 10 microseconds/call to something more like ~0.5-1 microsecond that should probably do it -- The 10 microseconds is measured from a call to LOG.info with a couple of strings and 2 ints to format (standalone program with idle disk and about a million calls). The 0.5 is the same call with info logging disabled and just guestimating the overhead of the call to AsyncAppender. Probably can have #s on asyncappender performance maybe early next week.\n-- pete\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wyckoff","name":"wyckoff","key":"wyckoff","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pete Wyckoff","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-03-28T19:16:11.108+0000","updated":"2008-03-28T19:16:11.108+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392579/comment/14065623","id":"14065623","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I'm going to close this as stale.
