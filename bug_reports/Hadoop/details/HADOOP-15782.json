If that fails partway through, then both MR and spark assume that the entire task can be retried. Which has the following flaws\r\n\r\n* a rerun task may generate files with different names. If this holds, those files from the first attempt which are copied into place will still be there. Outcome: output of two attempts may be in the destination.\r\n* if the created filenames are the same, if the first attempt hasn't actually failed, but instead paused for some time, but then resumes (GC pauses, VM hangs etc), then the first attempt will continue its rename, and potentially then overwriting 1+ file of the previous attempts output. Outcome: the data may be a mix of two attempts.\r\n\r\nIf each attempt creates precisely one file, and the name of the file is the same on both, then these problems don't arise. There's no partial commit of files; the second attempt will overwrite the first completely, and, if a paused attempt resumes, then it will completely overwrite the output of the latter. Provided that doesn't happen partway through ongoing work (deletion of task attempt dirs will cause the rename to fail, obviously), then the requirement for speculative/retriable tasks \"output from either attempt is valid\" will be met  âdownstream code will have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nThat said, happy to be wrong, if I've misunderstood something âthat commit code is complex enough that I had to step through with a debugger taking notes to understand what was going on.\r\n\r\nRight now I don't trust v2. it's worse on object stores as time-to-rename is potentially much longer, so probability of task failure during rename is higher.\r\n\r\nSee also [a zero rename committer|https://github.com/steveloughran/zero-rename-committer/releases/download/tag_draft_003/a_zero_rename_committer.pdf]; review & corrections welcome there.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2018-09-25T11:43:24.286+0000","updated":"2018-09-25T11:43:24.286+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13187158/comment/16627206","id":"16627206","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"BTW, HADOOP-15107 updated that committer docs a lot; if you haven't looked at the 3.1.2+ version of the docs, start there","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2018-09-25T11:45:48.080+0000","updated":"2018-09-25T11:45:48.080+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13187158/comment/16627210","id":"16627210","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"PS: spark recovery is, AFAIK, always by rerunning entire job; it's only task recovery it attempts âand there it assumes that task attempts can always be retried.

Only one attempt is allowed to commit via canCommit and with deterministic output + atomic rename works anyway.\r\n\r\nyes, but if that attempt is considered to have failed, an alternative attempt may commit. At least, that's my reading of the code in Hadoop and spark. Now, provided that only one file is generated by a task attempt, and the output of any attempt can be accepted, then a long-delayed task commit *shouldnt* be harmful, at least if it happens while the job is in progress. If it happens after the job has completed, well, that's \"unusual\"\r\n\r\nI've never seen that happening, it is a failure mode to be considered if you want to be able to show that your algorithm is robust. The MR job committer explicitly checks before job commit that it's had a recent heartbeat with the YARN RM to avoid this and cluster partition problems at the job level; nothing worries about it for individual tasks.\r\n\r\nbq. even on HDFS v1 was noticeably non-atomic for large jobs and you need to check for _SUCCESS or have another service recording completion, v2 was a big improvement for Twitter.\r\n\r\nYes: neither committer is fully atomic at some phases in its operation\r\n\r\nThe S3A ones don't have atomic job commit either; just O(files) POST requests which can be done in parallel.
