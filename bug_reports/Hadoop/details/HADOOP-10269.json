It makes sense. I don't want to sound like a pest but in this case this \"ignored\" is a different exception from se, and since the code completely ignores it, later no one will ever know that there were another exception \"ignored\" thrown by the dispose. Although 'dispose' shouldn't fail in most cases, the purpose of an error handler is exactly to prepare for those extremely rare cases where some failure modes are not anticipated.
