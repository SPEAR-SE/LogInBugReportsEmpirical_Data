URIs are the underlying mechanism Hadoop uses to name files.  Hadoop only supports a subset of possible URIs (hierarchical URIs, normalized to remove double-slashes and so that non-root paths don't end in a slash).  Path enforces this subset.  Path also handles some compatibility issues, mostly to make it easier to include Windows drive letters in \"file:\" URIs when running on Windows.\n\nSo a path is not limited by \"URI semantics\", it is implemented with URI syntax.  URIs permit escapes, so that one can include arbitrary unicode characters in a URI.  One *can* create URIs that include colons.  However our Windows-compatibility code may make it awkward to get colons through the Path wrapper into a URI and perhaps we can improve that.\n\n> It would be nice if Path handled all characters correctly...\n\nWhat does \"correctly\" mean?  I think we need more specific issues before we can have a real discussion.  Escaping here is tricky, since we have code that takes files from different filesystems that require different escapes and uses these to form paths.  I've commented on this previously:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2066?focusedCommentId=12558701#action_12558701\n\nTwo approaches are possible:\n - limit Paths to an interoperability subset, a common-denominator.  That's where we are today.\n - permit simpler and more automated escaping of certain characters.  That's a laudable goal.\n\nI don't think we should simply say that Path must accept any string verbatim as a file name.  I think it is reasonable to permit syntax errors for clearly malformed paths.  It is also reasonable to permit colons in directory and file names.  If colons are unescaped in a relative path, then they can be confused for the URI scheme, and I think that interpretation trumps.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-04-15T17:15:00.505+0000","updated":"2008-04-15T17:15:00.505+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12393950/comment/13178831","id":"13178831","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Barring any lower-level checks, the FsShell copy failure with a colon (and probably other chars) should already be fixed on trunk.
