It doesn't construct a valid classpath due to changes in the directory layout as Owen mentioned.\n2. For reduce tasks, it doesn't fill in the missing map outputs (throws a DiskErrorException).\n3. For reduce tasks, even if map outputs are there the reduce task never exits as Yuri observed.\n\nI've produced a test for IsolationRunner which tests 2. and 3., and a fix for 1. and 2. (So the test just hangs at the moment, which exposes 3.) See the attached patch.\n\nI'm not sure how to fix 3. The task spawns MapOutputCopiers which go into a wait state forever. Should IsolationRunner even be copying map outputs from map nodes, or should it just be using the files it has locally? Any ideas how to fix this?\n\nAs a future improvement it would be better if IsolationRunner could share code with TaskRunner so its behaviour is as faithful as possible.

I suspect that there's still some funny business not happening for users of the DistributedCache.  I haven't dug in deeply there.\n\nI'd like to propose that we open a separate JIRA for IsolationRunner for reduce tasks.  Reducers have to contact mappers to get the intermediate data, and, frankly, that's quite messy.  I believe it requires interacting with the job tracker, and that seems like a lot of dependencies for a tool that in theory runs in isolation.  So I'd like to get this fixed for mappers first and then tackle reducers separately.\n\n-- Philip","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=philip","name":"philip","key":"philip","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Philip Zeyliger","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-25T22:50:00.572+0000","updated":"2009-05-25T22:50:00.572+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403264/comment/12712926","id":"12712926","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"+1\n\nI agree that we should commit this and have a separate Jira for reducers.
