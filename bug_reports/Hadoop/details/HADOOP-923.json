The global FSNamesystem lock is kept for this entire 2 ms.\n\nIn the current implementation, heartbeats are sent by the datanode once every 3 seconds. A 1500 node cluster will cause the namenode to spend about 3 seconds (2ms * 1500) processing just heartbeat requests.

I feel that it is not neccessary to balance # of transfers when the heartbeat thread picks up the replication work. First the background thread that computes pendingTransfers has already balanced the load. Second block replication work needs to be done asap to avoid data loss. Since the datanode has been assinged the block replication work, no other datanode is able to pick up the work. If the work does not get to send to the datanode in the current heartbeat, it has to wait for at least another heartbeat interval.\n\n2. The background thread that computes pendindingTransfer scans only 100 datanodes per interation and then sleep for 3 seconds. I feel that the approach does not scale well. For example, when a cluster size becomes 2000, a datanode's work gets computed every 2000/100*3=1min if we ignore the computation overhead, which is far less frequently than what we do now (every 3 seonds). Another minor flaw is that the thread uses the index to record the next node to be checked. But if the heartbeat queue gets updated between two consecutive interations, the index may not point to the right node.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-02-09T20:02:34.330+0000","updated":"2007-02-09T20:02:34.330+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12361132/comment/12472425","id":"12472425","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Incorporated review comments. the change from the previous version is in method FSNamesystem.computeDatanodeWork().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2007-02-12T21:35:55.733+0000","updated":"2007-02-12T21:35:55.733+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12361132/comment/12472452","id":"12472452","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Code has been reviewed by Hairong.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2007-02-12T22:59:37.755+0000","updated":"2007-02-12T22:59:37.755+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12361132/comment/12472489","id":"12472489","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this.
