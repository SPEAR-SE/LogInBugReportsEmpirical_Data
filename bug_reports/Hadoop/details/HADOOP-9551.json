Thanks, Ivan!\n\nI have a couple of additional notes related to this patch, but none of this needs to prevent committing the current patch:\n\n# I think it would be good to backport {{TestDiskChecker}} to branch-1 and branch-1-win.  I've filed HADOOP-9843 for this.\n# We want to use {{assumeTrue}} for skipping tests that don't apply to the current platform.  I didn't recommend making the change in this patch, because trunk currently uses {{if (WINDOWS)}} for this too.  Cross-branch maintenance will be easier if we keep these the same.  We already have HADOOP-9427 to track cleaning those up.  I updated its Target Version to include branch-1-win.  We can clean up both branches in the scope of that issue.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-06T17:35:30.839+0000","updated":"2013-08-06T17:35:30.839+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646553/comment/13736167","id":"13736167","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Thanks Chuan and Chris for the review!
