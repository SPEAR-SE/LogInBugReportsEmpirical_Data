The consequence of that is very devastating: the client can no longer write to the file, and all the partial results up to that point are gone! This is especially costly for some map reduce jobs where a reducer may take hours or even days to sort the intermediate results before the actual reducing work can start.\n\nThe problem will be solved if the flush method of  DFS client can renew lease on demand. That is, it should try to re-new lease  when it catches a lease expiration exception. That way,  even when under heavy load and the lease renewing thread runs behind, the reducer  task (or what ever tasks use that client) can preceed.  That will be a huge saving in some cases (where sorting intermediate results take a long time to finish). We can set a limit on the number of retries, and may even make it configurable (or changeable at runtime). \n\nThe namenode can use a different expiration time that is much higher than the current 1 minute lease expiration time for cleaning  up the abandoned unclosed files.\n\n ","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12343646","id":"12343646","filename":"softhardlease.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2006-10-25T19:18:38.000+0000","size":6181,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12343646/softhardlease.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"106956","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"DFS client should try to re-new lease if it gets a lease expiration exception when it adds a block to a file","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=runping","name":"runping","key":"runping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Runping Qi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=runping","name":"runping","key":"runping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Runping Qi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12351918/comment/12438212","id":"12438212","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"If the lease-renewing thread has fallen behind, what confidence do we have that the client will be able to renew the lease any easier?  Moreover, this approach sounds like it would place more load on the namenode, which it probably doesn't need if it is being slow to respond to lease requests.\n\nPerhaps we could instead change the client to wait for the lease-renewing thread to sucessfully renew things.  But first we should try to better understand the circumstances under which the lease-renewing thread fails to renew things.  It currently waits for half the lease period, then starts trying to renew leases once per second until it succeeds.  That sounds like a fine method to me.  Is the namenode sometimes unresponsive for longer than half lease period?  If so, then waiting until the renewer succeeds would be an appropriate solution, no?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-09-27T20:28:18.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-27T20:28:18.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12351918/comment/12438231","id":"12438231","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yarnon","name":"yarnon","key":"yarnon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yoram Arnon","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"accelerating lease requests may not be the right approach, given that the typical use case is that the name node is so busy that it wasn't able to reply within half the lease period.\naccelerating requests makes sense prior to STONITH, and then the other node should have a high priority thread to reply or risk death, that's clearly not the case here.\n\nSeems like backing off requests is a better policy than accelerating requests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yarnon","name":"yarnon","key":"yarnon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yoram Arnon","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-09-27T21:43:47.000+0000","updated":"2006-09-27T21:43:47.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12351918/comment/12438246","id":"12438246","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"One minute is awfully short to lose your lease that kills a day worth of work.
