When you have lots and lots of tasks, after some time the tasks array will predominantly be filled with running or completed tasks, especially at lower indexes. So it takes longer and longer to scan the array for virgin tasks (tasks that haven't run yet)  or failed tasks if we always start from the beginning. There are a number of ways to get around this: \n\n1. On a cache miss, if you don't mind returning a virgin task ahead of a failed task, even though the failed task occurs earlier in the array than the virgin task, then you can do the following. Keep an index (a pointer) into the tasks array, which points to the first task in the array that is a virgin task. Every TIP to the left of this index will have been run at least once. Every time we need to scan the array, we look for runnable tasks from this index onwards. This index will move across the length of the array just once during the running of all tasks, so it averages out to O(1) for finding the first virgin task. This is fairly easy to code, and should provide significant savings in the cases where there are lots and lots of tasks. If a virgin task is not found, you can use the same code to look for a failed task or a speculative task. \n\n2. If you want to keep the same algorithm for finding the next task, i.e., if you want to return either a virgin or failed task first on a cache miss, then you can keep an index into the array which represents the first failed or virgin task. This approach won't be as fast as the first one, since this index can move back and forth across the array, but it should still be better over what we do today. In both options, the index will have to be potentially updated whenever a task's status changes. \n\nA more detailed approach requires maintaining separate lists for tasks with different states: one for virgin tasks, one for failed, one for completed, and one for running. As a task's status changes, it moves from one list to another. These lists can be sorted (the list of virgin tasks should be sorted in decreasing order of input size; the other lists can be sorted the same way, or perhaps in order of when the tasks ran, which simplifies things). Picking the next task is as simple as walking down the list (in many cases, just picking the first element of a list). Care must be taken that moving an element from one list to another is as effective as possible. The array of TIPS is no longer needed. I can think of at least a couple of ways of doing this: \n\n3. Modify a TIP object to have a reference to a 'previous' TIP object and a 'next' TIP object, so that we have linked lists of TIPS. Then a list is just a reference to the first (and last) TIP object, and a TIP belongs to just one list. If objects are added into the Running, Completed, and Failed lists at the tail only, handling a TIP's status change is O(1), but the lists are no longer sorted by size. Rather they are sorted by when the task ran. Finding the next task is pretty much constant, as we either pick the first TIP in the Virgin list, or the first TIP in the failed list (such that the TIP didn't fail on the host), or we walk through the Running list to find the first speculative task. If you need the lists sorted by size, then insertion is O(n). This is a fair bit of change, as far as coding is concerned. \n\n4. Lists can also be implemented as arrays of TIPS. This takes more space but moving a TIP from one list to another is faster than in the linked-list case. Insertion into a list sorted by size can be O(log n). \n\nYou can also have hybrid approaches where you just keep lists for virgin tasks, for example. \n\nI think it makes most sense to go with Option 1 for now, as it's the easiest to implement and makes the most common case run much faster. Options 3 and 4 need a fair bit of refactoring and may be an overkill for now, since you can get the most bang for the buck by just making sure that you don't scan the array from the beginning for virgin tasks.

At least that's not the way we've been thinking about them (i.e., my recommendations are not based on short-term or long-term considerations). My view is that the first two approaches are simple enough and probably solve most of the problem so it's worth trying them out and then measuring performance. The other approaches require much more coding and the performance gains may not be worth the added complexity, even in the longer term.

We used to have this behavior and it was very bad. If map 0 fails deterministically, you absolutely do not want all 200,000 maps to fail 4 times each before the job fails.\n\nThat's a valid point. However, today's code doesn't handle this situation completely well either. If you're treating a virgin task and a failed task with the same priority, then it's quite possible that you run a number of virgin tasks before you get to a failed task. You should really be prioritizing failed tasks over virgin tasks if you want to avoid the situation you've mentioned, though such a policy may cause unfairness in other situations. \n\nI think what we really need is what I mentioned for Options 3 and 4 - separate data structures to hold virgin tasks, failed tasks, and running tasks. \n- The data structure for virgin tasks does not need dynamic insertion capabilities (i.e., once created, you will never add any task to it). It also needs to be sorted by size. This structure needs to support deletion (once a task runs, it will be removed from this structure), and it also needs to handle large sizes (up to the number of tasks). \n- The data structure for failed tasks need to support quick insertions and deletions, but will be smaller in size (as the number of failed tasks is typically low). \n- The data structure for running tasks need to support quick insertions and deletions, and it's size is bounded (by the number of task trackers), though not necessarily small. Note that when a task is running and its status changes, we'll need to find it quickly in the running list  so we can move it to another. The data structure should optimize a lookup as much as possible. \n\nGiven all this, Devaraj, Amar, and I feel that the following data structure choices are the most appropriate: \n- We leave the cache as is.\n- For virgin tasks, we keep the tasks array, and have a running index to it (as suggested in Option 1). We could alternately have a doubly linked list structure with some sort of indexing (a list implemented as an array). \n- For failed tasks, we can keep a linked list or a sorted structure such as a Java sorted set. If we're OK not needing to keep failed tasks sorted by size (we could sort them by when they ran), then we can just keep a linked list and insert at the end. \n- For running tasks, given that the structure size is potentially larger than that for failed tasks, we can still keep a sorted map, or have some sort of a composite structure (which Devaraj/Amar have discussed, and can describe). Again, if we're OK not needing to keep running tasks sorted by size (we could sort them by when they ran), then we can just keep a linked list and insert at the end. \n\nBy having multiple lists and keeping the array for virgin tasks, we're using more memory, but if that becomes a problem, we can use some other structure to represent virgin tasks. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-02-07T06:55:37.087+0000","updated":"2008-02-07T06:55:37.087+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12381400/comment/12566541","id":"12566541","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I guess the reason for not prioritizing failed task over virgin tasks is that the probability of the first not-running task being failed is pretty high as compared to it being virgin and hence the simplicity. \n----\nI will explain some of the things in detail here.\n1) There is one more data structure that can be used for finding the virgin task in {{O(1)}} time but requires to hold {{2*num-tips}} integers.  Basically to have an array implementation of the doubly linked list. A pointer of the first element in the list also has to be maintained. Deletions/Top/Pop are {{O(1)}} and assuming no dynamic insertions. This is similar to the c/c++ implementations of doubly linked list giving the benefit of indexing the list as arrays providing {{O(1)}} deletions. If required I will post the implementation of this data structure.\n2) Since there will be a lot of insertions and deletions for running TIPs, the data structure should be optimized for insertions/deletions. Finding a TIP for speculation requires a scan over the running TIPs (sorted on size) as the progress changes dynamically. One good structure here will be an array of {{b}} SortedSets. Here {{b = max-possible-running-TIPs / k'}} and {{k'}} will be compile time constant by default set to 100. So now we hash the partition for the TIP to one such sortedset and then insert/delete locally in that set.  Something like\n{code}\n// compile time constant, number of elements per bin\nk' = 100 \n// number of bins\nb = num-tips / k'  \nSortedSet = Bin[tip.getPartition() % k']\n// operate on this tip \n// addition/deletions happen on a smaller set of TIPs\n{code}\nNote that for finding the TIP for speculation we will iterate over all the bins in order. \nIf we decide not to care about the sortedness then use a simple ArrayList instead of a SortedSet. \nOther option would be to use a single list/structure for all the running tasks.\n----\nComments?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-02-07T10:24:52.455+0000","updated":"2008-02-07T10:24:52.455+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12381400/comment/12566626","id":"12566626","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I will summarize the designs here \n_Algorithm_\n{code}\n1 Get a {{Runnable && ~Running && NotFailedOn(tracker)}}\n   1.1 Scan the cache\n   1.2 Scan all the TIPs\n2 Get a speculative TIP\n3 Get a TIP that has failed on all the machines\n{code}\n_Notations_\n{noformat}\nn            : number of TIPs\nmaster array : an array of TIPs sorted in some order.\nc            : number of TIPs that can potentially be executed locally.\nk            : maximum number of tasks that can be run simultaneously (<<n)\nf            : number of failed tasks (<<r)\nPop          : get the first TIP\nb            : number of bins of TIPs = n/s (where, s  : max number of TIPs per bin (<k))\n{noformat}\n\nThe following analysis considers the worst case scenarios.\n||#||Algorithm For||Description||General Design Requirements||Time Complexity||Space Complexity||Implementation Complexity||\n|1|Virgin Task|Maintain a running pointer rather than starting from 0.\\\\ The pointer will always more forward|Fast Pop and Delete operation|Pop : O(c) (worst case but will happen at most once)\\\\No deletions required| O(1)|Low|\n|2|Virgin Task|Maintain a doubly linked list using array|Fast Pop and Delete operation|Pop : O(1)\\\\Delete : O(1)| O( n )[actually 2*n]|High|\n|3|Virgin Task|Extend TIPs to have _previous_ and _next_ references.

I'd make the rows a doubly linked circular list and the columns a singularly linked circular list.

After discussions between Owen, Arun and myself, we feel the following assumptions are valid:\n\n- Failed tasks (tasks and TIPs are used interchangeably in this discussion) should be considered before virgin tasks where possible. \n- Failed tasks need not be sorted on input size. In fact, there isn't any one obvious way in which they should be sorted. \n- Similarly,  there isn't any one obvious way in which running tasks should be sorted. Maybe the tasks that have run the longest are better candidates for speculation, but that's not obvious. \n\nAfter looking at the various data structures that have been suggested, the following are recommended: \n\n1. A single data structure for virgin and failed tasks is recommended (call this the runnable list). There are two options:\n\n1a. We use a structure similar to that for the cache. Have a hashmap of hostnames to linked lists, where each list contains the runnable tasks for the host. \n- Each list is sorted in decreasing order of input size at the beginning, as all tasks are virgin. \n- A task can occur in a list for more than one host. \n- When a task is selected to run (this is the first task in the list, unless that task is marked as running on another host, in which case it is removed from the list and the next task is considered), it is removed from the runnable list. This is an O(1) operation. \n- A task can be inserted into a runnable list when it fails, in which case it is inserted into the beginning of the list (O(1)). \n- A runnable list can end up such that failed tasks occur before virgin tasks, and the failed tasks are sorted by when they failed (the ones that failed later occur earlier in the list), and not by input size. Thus the highest priority is for a failed task that failed most recently.\n- This list can be singly linked, as we insert and delete at the head. \n- We can have a single hashmap that keeps tracks of lists for hosts or racks. The key for the hashmap is a unique name of the host or rack. By using names similar to absolute paths of files in directories, this structure can support multiple hierarchies of racks. \n\n1b. Another implementation option is a 2-D sparse matrix as Owen suggested earlier. Only difference between this structure and the one proposed in 1a is that tasks are additionally connected to other tasks in their column. This makes it easy to delete all tasks related to the same data input. When a task is selected to run, we can remove all other related tasks (tasks in the same column) very easily. \n\n2. For running tasks (call this the running list), we have the following options: \n\n2a. Keep a global list of running tasks and walk through it to pick a speculative task, much as we do today (the only difference being that currently, we walk through an array of all tasks, whereas with this approach, we walk through a list of only running tasks). \n- When a tasks starts to run, it is removed from the runnable list to a running list, and can be inserted at the head or tail. This is O(1). \n- When a task completes (or fails), we need to locate it in this list and remove it. \n- Perhaps the best way to implement this is for each TIP object to have a prev and next pointer. That makes location of a task in this list O(1), and removal is O(1) too as the list is doubly linked. \n- To figure out a speculative task, we walk through this list as before and pick the first task that works (we have to add options for rack awareness to the current algorithm). This is not O(1), but is no worse off than what we have today. \n\n2b. Use a 2-D sparse matrix, as described earlier, to represent possible speculative tasks. \n- When a task is selected to run from the runnable list, copies of it are inserted into the running list for each host where the task can be speculated (one for each host where the input is replicated, at the very least). Insertion into the matrix is O(1) if you have doubly linked lists for rows, and if you have an array, indexed by task ID, that points to the head of the column. \n- When a task completes (or fails), it is removed from this list, as are all tasks linked to it in its column. This takes constant time. \n- Finding a speculative task is O(1), as you pick the first task in the running list for the host, or for its rack. If nothing matches, pick a task from any arbitrary host. \n\nAs far as implementation recommendations go, it makes sense to implement 1a and 2a now. Both use existing code and do not have a lot of changes to make. Picking a speculative task will be slow and not locality aware, but it will be no worse than what we have today, and implementation will be quick. At some time, depending on need, we can implement 1b and 2b, both of which refer to the same data structure. This requires more coding and testing, but will make the process of finding a speculative task faster. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-02-13T01:04:18.905+0000","updated":"2008-02-13T01:04:18.905+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12381400/comment/12568437","id":"12568437","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"BTW, if we take the sparse matrix approach, we really don't need the other datastructure for RUNNING tasks. \nIn the sparse matrix proposal, note that all TIPs are running in a location if the first TIP is running since we always move TIP columns to the back whenever we choose a TIP for running. And, we don't consider tasks to execute speculatively unless we run out of virgin tasks. So when we run into the situation where we want to consider tasks for speculatve execution, we go in the order - local, rack local, off rack. We hit all all the locations in O(1) and the time to find a speculative task in a particular row is given by the placement of the first slow task in the row. We also move this corresponding TIP column to the back in exactly the same way we do for virgin tasks. This way we do speculative execution also in the order of split sizes.

And that the linked list for a row in a spare matrix is doubly linked (you need it to efficiently delete tasks in the running list) while in 1a, the runnable list is a singly linked list. Given that, I would vote for the cache map, for the following reasons: \n- My big concern with implementing a sparse matrix now is that you're implementing a brand new data structure. Given how core this functionality is, and time constraints, it's riskier to introduce such newness in the code. \n- You already have most of the code in place for cache map, it's been there for a while and tested in production. That gives me a lot more comfort than putting in brand new code. \n- In terms of performance, the only difference between a linked list for running tasks (2a) and a sparse matrix is for speculative tasks, where the latter performs better. However, it's not clear to me how much this will reflect in the overall performance. it seems like the effect of lower performance of a linked list may be extremely minimal in the overall scheme of things, so why throw in new code? It's better, iMO, to see whether this performance is indeed significant before making big changes. \n- As I mentioned earlier, the cache map and sparse matrix are almost identical. I don't see a sparse matrix being any more simple or elegant than a cache map, i.e., i see both as fairly simple and elegant structures. \n\nI agree that a sparse matrix is the better option for speculative tasks, and that it may be also useful in the future for more complex scheduling decisions,  as Arun points out. However, because it requires new code and in such a central/core functionality, I'd recommend a more cautious approach of using the tried&tested code you already have to solve most, if not all, of the problems you're facing today, and looking at a sparse matrix implementation if the need is great. New code always brings it problems with testing and implementation and potential side effects.

[for fail-early]\n3) Removal of a tip from the *NR* caches is on demand i.e remove running/non-runnable TIPs while searching for a new TIP.\n4) Maintains a new set of caches called *R* caches for running TIPs. This caches are similar to the *NR* caches but provides faster removal. Additions to the caches are in the form of appends. Removal is one shot i.e a non-running TIP is removed at once from all the *R* caches. [for speculation]\n\nReduces :\n1) Maintains a LinkedList of non-running reducers i.e *NR* cache. [for non-running tasks]\n2) Failed reducers are added to the front of *NR* cache. [for fail-early]\n3) Maintains a set of running reducers with faster removal capability. [for speculation]\n----\nAlso,\n1) Search preference is as follows {{FAILED}}, {{NON-RUNNING}}, {{RUNNING}}\n2) Search order is as follows \n{noformat}\n    1. Search local cache i.e strong locality\n    2. Search bottom-up (i.e from the node's parent to the node's top level ancestor) for a TIP i.e weak locality.\n    3. Search breadth wise across top-level ancestors for a TIP i.e for a non local TIP.\n{noformat}\n3) Introducing a _default-node_. TIP's that are not local to any of the node are local to default node. This node takes care of random-writer like cases i.e adapting the random-writer like cases to the cache structure. _default-node_ belongs to _default-rack_ and hence all the nodes share the non-local TIPs through _default-rack_.\n4) The JobTracker need not be synchronized for providing reports to the JobClient and hence these API's doesn't lock the JT. Some staleness is okay.\n5) Commits are now in batches. But batching takes fixed number of tasks at a time. Default is 5000. So at a time 5000 tasks will be batch committed. The reason for doing this 'fixed sized batching' is that committing too many TIPs in one go locks the JobTracker for a very long duration causing *lost rpc/tracker* issues.\n6) TIPs use trackers hostname instead of tracker name for maintaining the list of machines where the TIP failed.\n7) One major bottleneck which we observed was in {{JobInProgress.isJobComplete()}} where all the TIPs were scanned. This is costly since {{isJobComplete()}} is called once every completed/failed task (via {{TaskCommit}} thread) and proves costly in case of large number of maps. Now this check is done by using the counts of finished TIPs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-03-17T08:09:18.713+0000","updated":"2008-03-17T08:09:18.713+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12381400/comment/12579813","id":"12579813","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Some comments on the attached patch\n1) It uses hostname to detect if the tip failed on a machine as compared to tracker-name.

So instead of falling to the array on a cache miss you hit the list that you can update as well (remove items, and add them to a equivalent list for running, etc.).\n2) Maintain a mapping from the level to the set of nodes in that level (except level 0). You should look at the TIPs at the topmost level cache (in case max cache level is 2, then that will mean all racks), when you look for something to run on a cache miss. \n3) Change the JobInProgress code to reflect proper terminologies like caches/lists etc\n4) TIPs that don't have locations get added to a special list instead of the default-node cache (point 1)\n5) Change the signature of findNewCachedTask to take the level instead of a boolean. Also, i think it'd be better if you call the method findTaskFromList since it caters to both maps and reduces and reduces really don't have a cache.\n6) getCurrentTime should be moved out to a place where it is called exactly once per findTask\n7) I don't think it is that important to move tasks to the back of the list in case of speculative tasks.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-03-19T18:48:58.675+0000","updated":"2008-03-19T18:48:58.675+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12381400/comment/12580659","id":"12580659","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Submitting a patch after incorporating Devaraj's comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-03-20T04:37:04.431+0000","updated":"2008-03-20T04:37:04.431+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12381400/comment/12580668","id":"12580668","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"You can not assume that i++, i--, i+=1, etc are atomic operations.\n\nYou must use the AtomicInteger class to get the semantics that you are looking for.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-03-20T05:37:38.825+0000","updated":"2008-03-20T05:37:38.825+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12381400/comment/12580670","id":"12580670","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I really wish the removing of synchronization had been done in a different patch.
