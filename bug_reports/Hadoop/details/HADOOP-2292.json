changes state and then they return letting the rest of the table be updated in the background.\n\n(Of course createTable only deals with one region so it is completely synchronous).\n\nThe reasons for semi synchronous operation are:\n- such an operation on a large table could take a long time to complete\n- it is likely that the rpc would timeout before the operation completed.\n\nUsing Thread.sleep could be unreliable as these operations take an indeterminate amount of time.\nWhat you might do is open a HTable on the META region (HConstants.META_TABLE_NAME) and scan HConstants.COL_REGIONINFO_ARRAY which will give you back HRegionInfo objects (as bytes).\n\nFind the table in question by comparing your table name to regionInfo.getTableDesc().getName()\n\nIf adding or deleting columns, check regionInfo.getTableDesc().hasFamily()\n\nIf changing table on/off line check regionInfo.isOffline()\n\nIf any of the regions don't meet the criteria, close the scanner, sleep and rescan.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jimk","name":"jimk","key":"jimk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jim
