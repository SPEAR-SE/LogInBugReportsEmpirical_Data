This is different from the standard log file and can be parsed and displayed by a JSP page (something like JobHistory.jsp) . It includes only completed and failed jobs. So from the user interface perspective running jobs are displayed as they are currently but failed and completed jobs are displayed from this log.\n\nWe can add extra information in this log than what we have currently as a postmortem analysis like time spent by different phases or by different hosts (?). \n\nThis will require unique job ids across jobtracker restarts otherwise it will be difficult to track jobs in history with same id. \nThis log file can contain a configurable numbers of days of history, which can be browsed by time. Optionally this history can itself reside in HDFS.

That's perhaps overkill, but it's worth thinking about.\n\nIn any case, we need to make sure it's easy for these files to evolve.  Adding and removing fields should be trivial, and processing old files that have obsolete or missing fields should also be natural.
