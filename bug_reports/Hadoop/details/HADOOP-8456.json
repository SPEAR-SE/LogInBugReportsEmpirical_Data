My answers are below.\n\nbq. AccessControlList depends on a space delimiter, you will need to somehow address that too.\nYou bring up a good poing Vinod. I discussed this part with the team before posting a patch. At this point, we will keep the current HDFS user and group name semantics, so no spaces. If we decide to make this change, that would be a separate Jira. The goal of this patch is to provide accurate information to Hadoop in the first place since providing false information can lead some other problems. Does this make sense?\n\nbq. 1.Does the wrapping of double quotes around the command args imply that the windows shell is re-parsing the group name? If so, that would seem to be a security issue if the user is somehow able to inject input with metachars.\nDaryn, I am relatively confident that Windows deals with this stuff properly. I would assume the same for the thin JNI layer. Passing in paramaters under quotes means that they are passed as separate args to app underneath (C argc/argv). Do you maybe know of some problems here?\n\nbq. 2.Maybe turn the delimiter into a general option so it's not hardcoded throughout the patch?\nMake sense, I'll prepare the updated patch.\n\nbq. How does Cygwin, MS SUA, etc handle this problem? We should do the same thing on Windows in order maintain compatibility with those systems.\nThanks Allen. I just checked using Cygwin's {{id -Gn}}, and it seems that Cygwin keeps some internal metadata about groups.

I don't think we have this problem here as windows shell is not involved. The quoted strings go thru the following stack: Java#ProcessBuilder->Win32#CreateProcess->Winutils.exe#argc/argv. On the other hand, we have to place username under quotes, as it won't be passed as a single argument to underlying winutils exe. For example:\n{{winutils groups user name}}\ndoes not work (4 args), while\n{{winutils groups \"user name\"}}\nworks.
