But the server-side initiates the token-based challenge just in case the client wants token. As part of doing that the server does  secretManager.checkAvailableForRead()  fails because the NN is in standby. \n\nIt is really bizzare that there is check for the server's state (active or standby) as part of SASL. This was introduced in HDFS-3083 to deal with a failover bug. In HDFS-3083, Aaron noted that he does not like the solution: \"I'm not in love with this solution, as it leaks abstractions all over the place,\". The abstraction layer violation finally caught up with us. \n\nTurns out even prior to Dary's HADOOP-9421 a similar problem could have occurred if the ZKFC had used Kerberos for first connection and Tokens for any subsequent connections.\n\nAn immediate fix is required to fix what HADOOP-9421 broke but I believe we need to also fix the fix that HDFS-3083 introduced - the abstraction layer violations need to be cleaned up.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-16T01:06:37.750+0000","updated":"2013-08-16T01:06:37.750+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663941/comment/13741810","id":"13741810","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"This is slightly more appealing hack than HDFS-3083.\n\nI've moved the call to the NN-specific {{checkAvailableForRead}} from the RPC layer into the NN's secret manager so it's only called when token auth is being performed.\n\nHowever, the current method signatures only allow {{InvalidToken}} to be thrown.
