Branch-2 patch forthcoming after conflicts resolved.\n\nMajor highlights:\n# Frivolous synchronization in common code paths is eliminated.\n# Login/logout/relogin synchronizes on the subject's private credentials to ensure atomic update relative to each other and SASL authentication.\n# Supports concurrent UGI instantiation - ctor does not access priv creds that require locking and mutate during relogin.\n# A login context wrapper \"remembers\" the login configuration so the class statics for principal and keytab can be eliminated.\n# Is keytab/ticket is based on the login config, not the current state of the priv creds.\n#* prevents race during relogin where new instances might think the ugi is not a keytab when logout has occurred and relogin underway.\n#* ugis created for keytab users after a relogin failure now remember they are keytab based.\n# Creating ugi from a subject will learn the principal and possibly keytab\n#* no more \"external\" ugi hack\n#* subject based-ugis will relogin, ie. after ipc errors\n\nBasic design is:\n* HadoopLoginContext wraps a \"real\" LoginContext and remembers the javax-derived HadoopConfiguration which is normally not accessible.\n* HadoopConfiguration is based on LoginParams which track parameters for login and relogin.\n* LoginParams for pre-existing subjects are learned prior to login and reused for subsequent relogins.\n* LoginParams for new subjects are updated post-login.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn

It's not exactly a \"big and risky feature/improvement\".  It does offer improvements via eliminating synchronization (all calls to getCurrentUser, getLoginUser, and relogins are class synchronized), but incidentally fixes some esoteric skeleton-in-the-closet potential privilege escalation.  Which is more risky?  Faster and correct?  Slower and vulnerable?\n\nThe basic premise is that all calls to getCurrentUser, getLoginUser, and relogin do not need to be class synchronized.  A few marketing points since my prior bullets were design oriented.\n# A UGI identity is truly immutable after inception as was originally intended. Ie. What was the principal?  From keytab or ticket cache?\n# Removes instance-level synchronization since it's generally worthless (multiple UGIs share the same Subject)\n# Removes class-level synchronization by moving class static principal/keytab into the Subject\n# Add synchronization only where necessary to fix races with relogins corrupting the Subject\n# Incidentally fixes root cause of issue that inspired the completely broken \"external ugi\" hack\n# Multiple logged in UGIs actually work correctly due to elimination of class statics.\n# Incidentally prevents relogin of 1 UGI causing another UGI to morph (see linked jira)\n\nIt's really not that bad.  About 50% of the patch is adding lots of great tests since UGI tests are sparse.  I've been waiting 4 years to integrate this patch.  I gave up and added workarounds in the IPC layer and NN.  But then along came EZ file EDEK fetching causing high UGI contention...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-08-03T22:12:26.708+0000","updated":"2017-08-03T22:12:26.708+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12658567/comment/16116110","id":"16116110","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"[~daryn], I can understand your passion in fixing this long term existing issue so I am OK to get this in 2.8.2 if the patch get well tested in production environment before we cut RC (target before end of Aug.).

Viswanadham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~daryn]\r\nThanks for a great patch, this really simplifies UGI code. I have a few comments.\r\n1. System.setProperty(KRB5CCNAME) is not being set, previously this is being set in the case of IBM_JAVA\r\n\r\n2. getLoginUser is no longer Synchronized. If multiple threads call this in parallel, multiple loginUser ugi’s will be created and they could potentially spin up a new thread in spawnAutoRenewalThreadForUserCreds. I would suggest to synchronize it for the case when loginUser is null.\r\n\r\n3. In loginUserFromSubject method, when subject passed is null the same situation will occur, it could spin multiple threads for renewal. Probably, we don’t need to support null subject in this API, because null subject use case is already handled by getLoginUser.\r\n\r\n4. As you have noted in the comments that getKeyTabEntry is not very reliable for external subjects. I was wondering whether we really need it. Can we get away by saying that it’s user’s responsibility to renew external subjects?\r\n\r\n5. Following 3 methods perform login and update the static loginUser. It might make sense to add documentation that these update the global loginUser.\r\ngetLoginUser, loginUserFromSubject and loginUserFromKeytab\r\n \r\n*Minor Nits*\r\n·         getSubjectLoginLock, does not actually getLock, can we change this method name getSubectPrivateCredentials.\r\n·         In hasKerberosCredential, it might make sense to return false for null user, otherwise we will get an NPE.\r\n·         Can we add assert hasSubjectLoginLock() in getTgt()?\r\n·         In unprotectedLoginUserFromSubject we should change the local variable name instead of overloading loginUser, only for better readability.\r\n \r\nThank You [~xyao] [~jnp] for cumulative review on the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bharatviswa","name":"bharatviswa","key":"bharatviswa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bharat Viswanadham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-12-01T04:50:13.156+0000","updated":"2017-12-01T04:50:13.156+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12658567/comment/16279340","id":"16279340","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bharatviswa","name":"bharatviswa","key":"bharatviswa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bharat Viswanadham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~daryn]\r\nPing again.\r\nIf you are busy with other task, I can provide a patch for the review comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bharatviswa","name":"bharatviswa","key":"bharatviswa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bharat Viswanadham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-12-05T23:07:38.263+0000","updated":"2017-12-05T23:07:38.263+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12658567/comment/16282532","id":"16282532","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Working on this today.

OS_LOGIN_MODULE,\r\n * In case of loginuserfromSubject, as we pass params as null to doSubjectLogin, the configuration will be OS_SPECIFIC_LOGIN. So, in this case login fallbacks to Simple Auth login? Is this the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nArrayList<AppConfigurationEntry> entries = new ArrayList<>();\r\n// login of external subject passes no params.  technically only\r\n// existing credentials should be used but other components expect\r\n// the login to succeed with local user fallback if no principal.\r\nif (params == null || appName.equals(SIMPLE_CONFIG_NAME)) {\r\n  entries.add(OS_SPECIFIC_LOGIN);\r\n} {code}\r\n\r\n * renewTGT and refreshKrb5Config is not set in IBM_JAVA case, is there any reason for this?\r\n * @Test annotation is missing for tests in TestUGILoginFromKeytab.java\r\n * Following 3 methods perform login and update the static loginUser.
