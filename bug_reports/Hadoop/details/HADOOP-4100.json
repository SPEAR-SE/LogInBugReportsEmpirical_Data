In general, this seems the right approach. So, +1. \n\nOne question I have (and possibly this was indirectly brought up by Matei as well), should the running of the cleanupTask count as slots used by the Job - as this could impact fairness and capacity limits ? From what I've seen, it appears that each Job has atmost 1 cleanup task - correct ? In that case, it might not be *that* critical to count these for quotas etc. Comments ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-09-06T05:25:14.090+0000","updated":"2008-09-06T05:25:14.090+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403814/comment/12628877","id":"12628877","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Hemanth, that's right.
