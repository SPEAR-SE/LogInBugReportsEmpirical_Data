If you have cygwin installed it should run fine. \n\nAnd cygwin is explicitly required in the documentation:\n\n=====================================\nRequirements\n\n   1. Java 1.4.x, preferably from Sun Set JAVA_HOME to the root of your Java installation.\n   2. ssh must be installed and sshd must be running to use Hadoop's scripts to manage remote Hadoop daemons. On Ubuntu, this may done with\n      sudo apt-get install ssh\n   3. rsync must be installed to use Hadoop's scripts to manage remote Hadoop installations. On Ubuntu, this may done with\n      sudo apt-get install rsync.\n   4. On Win32, cygwin, for shell support. To use Subversion on Win32, select the subversion package when you install, in the \"Devel\" category. Distributed operation has not been well tested on Win32, so this should primarily be considered a development platform at this point, not a production platform.\n=====================================\n\nThis should be updated to say that Java 1.5 is required.\n\nThe new saveVersion.sh script should probably detect and handle internally if svn is not installed/found. Although it is hard to imagine a case where I wanted to build Hadoop and not have svn installed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-10-08T04:23:30.000+0000","updated":"2006-10-08T04:23:30.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12352671/comment/12441023","id":"12441023","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, under cygwin it builds fine.
