Thus, in the worst case where each call to read fills the 256 MB buffer in negligible time, the ThrottledInputStream cannot reduce the bandwidth to under (256 MB) / (5 ms) = 5 GB/s.\n\nEven in a more realistic case where read returns about 1 MB per call, it still cannot throttle the bandwidth to under 20 MB/s.\n\nThe issue is exacerbated by the fact that you need to set a low limit because the total bandwidth per host depends on the number of mapper slots as well.\n\nA simple solution would change the if in throttle to a while, so that it keeps sleeping for 50 ms until the rate is finally low enough:\n\n{code:java}\n  private void throttle() throws IOException {\n    while (getBytesPerSec() > maxBytesPerSec) {\n      try {\n        Thread.sleep(SLEEP_DURATION_MS);\n        totalSleepTime += SLEEP_DURATION_MS;\n      } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Thread aborted\", e);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n{code}\n\nThis issue affects the ThrottledInputStream in hadoop as well.\n\nAnother way to see this is that for big enough buffer sizes, ThrottledInputStream will be throttling only the number of read calls to 20 per second, disregarding the number of bytes read.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12685213","id":"12685213","filename":"mapreduce-6180-001.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yuzhihong%40gmail.com","name":"yuzhihong@gmail.com","key":"yuzhihong@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Yu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-05T00:46:14.926+0000","size":782,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12685213/mapreduce-6180-001.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ThrottledInputStream doesn't perform effective throttling","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yuzhihong%40gmail.com","name":"yuzhihong@gmail.com","key":"yuzhihong@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Yu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yuzhihong%40gmail.com","name":"yuzhihong@gmail.com","key":"yuzhihong@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Yu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12759544/comment/14234889","id":"14234889","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
