this case the Pipes application isn't looping through the Java RecordReader...\n\nPossible solutions:\n1. Add a 'setProgress' api to org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Reporter - this is quite dangerous since applications can potentially use this to throw the Scheduler off.\n2. Use a dummy InputFormat/RecordReader along with a specialized Reporter which can communicate the progress to the RecordReader and hence the rest of the framework.\n\nGiven the dangers of the first approach, Owen/me agree we should go with the second for now.
