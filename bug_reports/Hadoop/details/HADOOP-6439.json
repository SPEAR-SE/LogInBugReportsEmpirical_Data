So, suppose a non-null value is stored for this key from a previously loaded resource, then we would printing the value belonging to the older resource, but the name of the new resource. This is inconsistent. In general, I am very skeptical of changing any behavior in how configurations are loaded because it is so core to the entire framework. IOW, I would be happy if the old code structure in loadResource is retained when pulled to the new method loadProperty. Of course, unless there's a good reason for the change which I'd be happy to see.\n- Also, previously whenever we are reloading the properties object, we were reseting the 'accessed' flag for the deprecated key, which is removed in this patch.\n\nI haven't looked at the test cases very closely - though the changes seem mostly OK so far. Cutting down the changes in Configuration.java will actually allow us to not have to write more test scenarios. So, I would like to relook at the cases after the changes above are made.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-23T14:48:45.726+0000","updated":"2009-12-23T14:48:45.726+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12442015/comment/12796134","id":"12796134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chaitk","name":"chaitk","key":"chaitk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"V.V.Chaitanya Krishna","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Uploading patch with the above mentioned comments implemented.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chaitk","name":"chaitk","key":"chaitk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"V.V.Chaitanya Krishna","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-01-04T10:40:23.652+0000","updated":"2010-01-04T10:40:23.652+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12442015/comment/12797034","id":"12797034","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"This is looking good.
