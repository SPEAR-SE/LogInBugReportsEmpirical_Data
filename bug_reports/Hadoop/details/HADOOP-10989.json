Here is patch v2 with the ifdef inverted to focus on the Linux special case and more comments.\n\nbq. Just out of curiosity, was there a specific operating system or environment you found that had this problem?\n\nWe saw this happening in 2 different environments, one RHEL 6.2 and the other RHEL 6.3.  Upgrading to RHEL 6.4 solved it, so we've recommended upgrading to RHEL 6.4 or later as a workaround.  The specific sequence of events involved nslcd issuing an LDAP query that timed out.  I suspect whatever version of nslcd shipped with RHEL 6.2/6.3 by default had a bug in its error handling, such that an LDAP timeout could result in returning 0 from {{getgrouplist}}, but leaving the other out parameters in an indeterminate state.  Then, we'd use those bad parameter values in a {{realloc}} and segfault.  Unfortunately, I no longer have the information on the specific nslcd version numbers.  I agree that it's not exactly accurate to blame an OS version.
