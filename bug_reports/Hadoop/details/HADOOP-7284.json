Yes and no.\nIf you recall, when I did FileContext and AbstractFileSystem, the home directory came from the server side. Our current default of /user/<uname> is used for FileSystem since it has no notion of a server defaults. \nEnter Viewfs -- there is no notion of a server side. Also a viewfs could have mount points to different file systems; so I can't pick the ss defaults for home directory from any one of them. \nThis hit home when i tried to run the tests because the mac and linux and hdfs have different home directory pathname.\nSO the test exposed a real problem in the system design by the fact that our tests run on different platforms and hence different file systems. \n\nI haven't figured out what is the cleanest way to fix this (but I give a suggestion below that I will file as a jira).\nThe intermediate solution is that the person configuring the view file system will create a mount point for  /user or /Users etc  depending on what he wants as the default home dir. So I simply coded a rule in viewfilesystem impl,  for now,  to see if it has mount point of /user or /Users etc, till we figure out a better solution.\n\nHere is proposal on which I am going to shortly file a jira: let the viewfs config indicate the home directory. In a sense \nit is like a SS default. Should this simply be a key in the config or something else (like pick it up from a hdfs?)\n\nI could have made the tests work by simply not using a mount point and test path starting with  \"/user\" or \"/Users\" but then it does not test our most common usecase. BTW I plan to add a test to HDFS also.\n\"","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-17T21:40:29.191+0000","updated":"2011-05-17T21:40:29.191+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507038/comment/13035225","id":"13035225","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Minor fix - removal of a warning,","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-18T07:19:08.867+0000","updated":"2011-05-18T07:19:08.867+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507038/comment/13035226","id":"13035226","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.

The solution in this patch is:  the viewfilesystem impl\nhas a set of heuristics that make it work for some common conventions: /user /Users, /home, /homes. It is an okay solution but clearner not general enough to work in all environments. In the short term it will work till we figure out a cleaner solution.
