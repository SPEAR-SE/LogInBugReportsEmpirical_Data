The place where you are using MIN_TIME_BEFORE_RETIRE in finalizeJob to prevent retiring very recently finished jobs seems wrong to me. You should check for the condition before the job is even removed from JT.\n\nFurther, are you sure we want to throw an exception in the job-client? An exception would throw a non-zero error code to the client; I'd rather log the message and just break out of the loop, thus returning a zero exit code, as we know for sure that the job is indeed complete.\n\nHaving said that, I think introducing MIN_TIME_BEFORE_RETIRE here, in this blocker, doesn't seem to be very right. It is a feature. The later fix, patching the client, is the correct and sufficient fix for the problem that Joydeep initially reported.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-10-17T18:54:27.642+0000","updated":"2008-10-17T18:54:27.642+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12405296/comment/12640631","id":"12640631","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"quick comment: if the job is complete - but we don't know the status (ideally this should never happen, but if it does ..) - it's better to return a non-zero error status.
