This is a race between the block report in Step 3 (\"Now P is marked dead and P comes back up again\") and the block-delete-call that the namenode issued in Step 1. The block report inserted a block in the blocksmap that is going to be deleted from the datanode.\n\nTwo options come to mind:\n\n1. On every block report processing, the NN clears out blocks from invalidateSets that belong to that datanode. This might  consume non-trivial amount of CPU on the namenode.\n\n2. The datanode sends its current time on every block report, let call this as the reportStamp. The NN stores the reportStamp in the DatanodeDescriptor and sends it back to the DN on every block deletion message.
