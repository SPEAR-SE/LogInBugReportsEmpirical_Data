Limit the maximum replication to something reasonably small.\n\n2. When a file is highly-replicated, sample the replicas rather than sorting and returning the full list.  For example, one could first try to return only the first-N replicas on the same rack as the client.  If that fails, then the off-rack replicas might be randomly sampled.\n\nDo we think it is reasonable to set replication to numbers proportional to the cluster size?  If so, do we think it is reasonable for namenode requests to take time proportional to the cluster size?  If not, then, in these cases, we should try to never return or process the full list, but rather only a fixed-size subset of it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-31T19:08:00.370+0000","updated":"2007-05-31T19:08:00.370+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12370626/comment/12500458","id":"12500458","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Does this test have patch from HADOOP-1155?
