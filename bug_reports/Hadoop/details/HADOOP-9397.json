I left detailed comments explaining all of the changes there.  I'm pasting the most relevant part here:\n\n{code}\n-                      run tar czf hadoop-${project.version}.tar.gz hadoop-${project.version}\n+                      run tar cf hadoop-${project.version}.tar hadoop-${project.version}\n+                      run gzip hadoop-${project.version}.tar\n{code}\n\nThe 'z' flag for compression causes tar to fork a separate process for gzip. GnuWin32 tar has a limitation in that fork was never implemented, so this would fail on Windows with \"Cannot fork: Function not implemented\". Splitting this into separate tar and gzip commands works cross-platform.\n\nAnother option here would have been to control the pipeline explicitly using a shell pipeline (tar | gzip), but the \"run\" helper function used here isn't compatible with passing a command that has a pipe.\n\n{quote}\nDo we really need the intermediate .tar file kept around?\n{quote}\n\nNo, and gzip actually replaces the original file, so we don't have this problem.  I just ran it again and confirmed that the end result was a .tar.gz file (and no separate .tar file).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-13T20:19:13.808+0000","updated":"2013-03-13T20:19:13.808+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12636663/comment/13601628","id":"13601628","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks for the clarification, but I'm still wondering why this isn't consistent with the tar scripts used by hadoop-yarn-project, hadoop-mapreduce-project, etc.  Any legitimate reason this is different?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-03-13T20:58:43.917+0000","updated":"2013-03-13T20:58:43.917+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12636663/comment/13601680","id":"13601680","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The difference is the use of the helper run method for error reporting (hadoop-dist) vs. not explicitly reporting errors (hadoop-yarn-project, hadoop-mapreduce-project, etc.).
