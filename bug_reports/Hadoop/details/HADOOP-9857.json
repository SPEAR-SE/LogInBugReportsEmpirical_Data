See line 256 here:\n\nhttp://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6/jdk/file/ffa98eed5766/src/share/classes/sun/security/provider/SunEntries.java\n\nAlso, see the logic starting at line 96 here:\n\nhttp://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6/jdk/file/ffa98eed5766/src/share/classes/sun/security/provider/SeedGenerator.java\n\nBy enabling {{-Djava.security.debug=all}}, I was able to see that it was entering the \"Failed to create seed generator\" code path after a 5-second delay.\n\nThe problem was made more obvious recently by the introduction of client ID in each RPC client instance.
