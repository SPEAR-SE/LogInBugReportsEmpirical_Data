At this point I'm looking for feedback on some points from below. I also have to do some additional testing.\n\nA few points I'm interesting in hearing other peoples opinion:\n1. At the moment, I did not expose File#set* APIs that accept the {{ownerOnly}} parameter. Adding this is strait forward, the only question is whether we need it. I didn't find use-cases in Common and HDFS projects, but I've seen some in Yarn (only on one or two places, and those could be changed to use chmod instead).\n2. For File#canRead/canWrite/canExecute I check whether the current user has read/write/execute permissions on the given File thru winutils. This is generally fine from the correctness perspective as winutils provide a POSIX compatible view of Windows ACLs. However, this is different than what we did in HADOOP-8973. Will have to think a bit more about pros and cons but I'm definitely interested in getting input from others.

See Ivan's patches on HDFS-4610 and YARN-506 for some examples where the codebase needs to get/set permissions on individual files.\n# There was also the question of performance, because my code actually performed file access and forked new processes to implement the access checks.\n\nThese were not problems for HADOOP-8973, because {{DiskChecker}} is used only for directories and it's used rarely enough that the performance impact would likely be unnoticeable.\n\nI'm wondering if it's time for us to write a JNI call to {{AccessCheck}}:\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374815(v=vs.85).aspx\n\nThis would only be used if (Windows && JDKversion < 7).  Otherwise, we expect the JDK APIs to work.\n\nObviously, this will take longer to implement.  A potential compromise would be to go with the patch's current implementation of the new functions, but leave {{DiskChecker}} as is temporarily, just until we get the JNI call written.  That way, the other permission checks in the codebase get pretty close to working (not 100% correct, but certainly better than the current state), and we still maintain full correctness for the very important {{DiskChecker}} piece.\n\nIvan and Bikas, do you have any follow-up thoughts?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-27T17:57:03.333+0000","updated":"2013-03-27T17:57:03.333+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637696/comment/13618472","id":"13618472","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am in favor of any proposal that leaves the code and expected functionality consistent.

I went in the direction of exposing a native access check API as Chris’ suggested above. The problem with the previous patch that bothered me was that it used the owner information to do the access check, what is not accurate in all cases on Windows (a user can still read/write/exec files/folders even if he is not a user/group owner). The new access check API checks if a user has the appropriate read/write/execute permission by checking the file ACLs. Another good side is that API could be substituted with JDK7 Files#isReadable/isWritable/isExecutable once Hadoop moves to Java 7.\n\nlibwinutils.c: I noticed that GetEffectiveRightsForSid() does not do proper cleanup so I fixed that with my patch as well.\n\n[~cnauroth][~bikassaha] let me know how this looks.\n\nI'll prepare the branch-1-win patch once the trunk patch is ready for commit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-04-20T17:21:06.739+0000","updated":"2013-04-20T17:21:06.739+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637696/comment/13637312","id":"13637312","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

Will review the patch for HADOOP-9290 and see if I can somehow help there.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-04-23T18:52:25.618+0000","updated":"2013-04-23T18:52:25.618+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637696/comment/13639683","id":"13639683","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ivan, I just uploaded a new patch on HADOOP-9290.

I kicked off a full test run on Windows to validate the approach.\n\nIn parallel, I have a few questions/comments on the latest patch:\n1. hadoop-project/pom.xml: It seems that the currently defined value for LD_LIBRARY_PATH is invalid. I think it should have the following value:\n{code}\n<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>${env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${project.build.directory}/native/target/usr/local/lib:${basedir}/../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/bin</LD_LIBRARY_PATH>\n{code}\n2. hadoop-project/pom.xml: Assuming that we specified a valid value for LD_LIBRARY_PATH above, the following section might not be needed:\n{code}\n                <!-- Specify where to look for the native DLL on Windows -->\n                <PATH>${env.PATH};${basedir}/../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/bin</PATH>\n                <PATH>${env.PATH};${hadoop.common.build.dir}/bin</PATH>\n{code}\n3. Other pom.xml files: Can we just define a new value for LD_LIBRARY_PATH next to HADOOP_HOME and point it to the appropriate /target/bin folder in every subproject? This would provide a nice symmetry with how we locate winutils on Windows.\n4. Might make sense to either remove hadoop.common.build.dir or use it for both winutils.exe and hadoop.dll\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-04-24T05:00:02.518+0000","updated":"2013-04-24T05:00:02.518+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637696/comment/13640077","id":"13640077","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Wrong Jira, please ignore my previous comment :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-04-24T05:01:48.997+0000","updated":"2013-04-24T05:01:48.997+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637696/comment/13640098","id":"13640098","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Rebasing the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-04-24T05:22:56.034+0000","updated":"2013-04-24T05:22:56.034+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637696/comment/13640132","id":"13640132","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
