You encounter the test timeout before possibly hitting the (elongated by this patch) connection timeout.\n\nAs this issue looks like it has some people fairly new to testing S3A, a small side note: I will extend the testing guidelines in the documentation while I pass by to document my recently accepted patches. A quick preview: \n- When testing against Amazon S3, tests can sometimes randomly fail due to eventual consistency. I frequently get this on TestS3AFileSystemContract.testRenameRootDirForbidden. Retry and it should run fine (or use a strong consistent object store :p)\n- Beware test failures during multi-part uploads. Completed parts of a failed multi-part upload do not show up in \"ls\" but linger (and are billed) eternally. One can remove them manually or through purging: setting fs.s3a.multipart.purge to true.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thodemoor","name":"thodemoor","key":"thodemoor","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Demoor","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-01-20T17:13:55.331+0000","updated":"2015-01-20T17:13:55.331+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12768345/comment/14285344","id":"14285344","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daisuke.kobayashi","name":"daisuke.kobayashi","key":"daisuke.kobayashi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daisuke Kobayashi","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"body":"[~thodemoor], thanks for the confirmation!

It happens synchronously at the end of fs.initialize(). The test might timeout if the bucket has too much (thousands?) in-progress uploads that need to be aborted. However, the s3a docs explicitly state that a dedicated test bucket should be used and the current test classes do not perform multiple concurrent multiPartUploads so typically 0 and at most 1 upload will be purged. Consequently, we can safely assume \"too much in-progress uploads\"  to be a \"should not happen\" during testing.\n\nI see 2 ways to implement this:\n1. add purge = true, purgetime = 0 secs to the conf in S3ATestUtils.createTestFileSystem\n+: 2 lines of code\n-: cleaning up only happens on the next test run\n\n2. in tearDown() of each test class : run S3ATestUtils.createTestFileSystem with a config that has purge=true, purgetime = 0 secs\n+: immediate cleanup at end of test (except if test is interrupted, f.i. ctrl-c)\n-: each test class has to explicitly include the code path\n\nLet me know what you prefer and I'll create an issue addressing this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thodemoor","name":"thodemoor","key":"thodemoor","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Demoor","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-01-26T13:28:21.347+0000","updated":"2015-01-26T13:28:21.347+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12768345/comment/14293333","id":"14293333","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"although option #2 is \"purest\", I'm going to recommend #1.
