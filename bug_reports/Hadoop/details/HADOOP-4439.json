the max memory per TT / number of slots. The problem with this model is that in a heterogenous cluster, different TTs could give different default memory per task values for the same job, which is confusing.\n- Instead, we introduce a default memory per task configuration variable that is expected to be controlled by the cluster admin. This is the value that will be used for a job which does not specify any memory requirements. The advantage with this model is that it eases configuration, and makes the default value consistent for the users.\n- If a job has not specified any memory requirements, this variable would be set to the job's configuration, maybe via the {{Task}} object.\n- We modify the algorithm of protecting RAM limits introduced in HADOOP-3581 to use the configured memory per task instead of the default memory per task.\n- We remove the reporting of the default memory per task, introduced in HADOOP-3759, done via the {{TaskTrackerStatus.ResourceStatus}}. Instead we report the total memory available on the TT instead of the default memory per task.\n- When HADOOP-4053 is fixed, the above values would be used to schedule tasks.\n- However until HADOOP-4053 is fixed, these configuration parameters and the corresponding {{JobConf}} variables should not be exposed in any public API or documentation, as they could confuse users.

If a job has not specified any memory requirements, this variable would be set to the job's configuration, maybe via the Task object.\n\nThis value is a cluster configuration that should be the same across all task trackers. Hence, we were trying to see if this can be configured in the job tracker and passed on to the task trackers. The only way I could find to do it is to change the {{Task}} object to hold this variable and write it via RPC when it is transferred to the tasktrackers.\n\nThe other option is to simplify, and say that all tasktrackers will be configured with this value. This has a chance that there could be errors in configuration if the admin configures different values for different TTs. But, in an offline discussion with Devaraj, we felt it was simpler to do it this way, rather than introduce a new field in the {{Task}} object. I am OK with this approach.
