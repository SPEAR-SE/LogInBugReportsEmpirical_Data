First, I tried to avoid using {{KerberosName}} if possible, but that caused problems because kerberos is always favored regardless of the client config.  I actually think that's a good thing, more on that later.  I believe the last approach was to blindly strip the realm if the client is insecure.\n\nMy problem is running an insecure mini-cluster on my laptop.  If I have no TGT, the unix principal has no realm so passes the rules.  If I do have a TGT (bound to corporate directory), it wants to strip the realm from the kerberos principal.  If the default realm cannot be determined, or does not match my principal's realm, the rules fail.  \n\nOn favoring kerberos:  If I'm kerberos authenticated, it stands to reason that's who I am so the user should be derived from the kerberos principal regardless of whether security is enabled/disabled on the client.  Similarly, shouldn't an \"insecure\" client be allowed to communicate with a secure cluster if the user has the necessary kerberos credentials?  Maybe I'm trying to copy data between secure/insecure cluster.\n\nI spoke to Owen awhile back about this issue, and we agreed that the client should be able to use kerberos credentials regardless of the client config.  Where we had mild disagreement is whether the client should be trying to apply the name rules.  I'd make the case that the client should never apply rules which are meant for arbitrarily rewriting the principal.  All we are using the rules for on the client is stripping the default realm - if the client changes the username in the principal I believe it's going to fail the kerberos auth with the server due to a mismatch with the TGT.  Only the server should use the rules to arbitrarily rewrite the principal into a simple username for the namesystem.  The problem is how some of the fields in a token are converted to a simple username on the client, which Owen and I agreed is probably wrong.  We might be able to fix this w/o causing incompatibility.\n\nOn a tangent: These issues illustrate the growing problem with not being able to have (semi)universal configs that allow communicating with multiple clusters.  Client security setting shouldn't matter, client shouldn't need the server's name rules.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-03-12T16:52:38.705+0000","updated":"2013-03-12T16:52:38.705+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12632071/comment/13600226","id":"13600226","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"On the 'On the tangent': Yep, this has always been a pain (for Oozie) for different motives.

In UGI, the skip check should be kept, else it will break things for things using hadoop-auth which don't use hadoop config files in their classpath.\n\nI think in those cases the defaults will kick in, which is the behavior we'd want?  Or is there a quirk that will cause problems?\n\nbq. Unless I'm missing something, we are using the Kerberos principal short name when interacting with an unsecure cluster, that seems wrong, no?\n\nPlease elaborate?  Overall, I don't believe this patch causes any fundamental change in behavior - other than making insecure clients/servers be able to perform simple reduction of a principal in the absence of explicit rules.  A few observations:\n* Within the UGI, the short name appears to be computed in the ctor for use as a key in the group name cache.  That's typically not required on the client-side.  External to the UGI usage should experience no change in behavior.  In either case, I don't think new issues have been introduced?\n* An IPC connection will (already) pass the full principal in the connection context.  It's up to the insecure server to reduce the principal to a short name.  I haven't tested, but w/o this patch, I think an insecure server will choke on the kerberos principal unless configured with rules.\n* The token operations do already inconsistently pass a short name or principal for the various fields.  Now that's wrong, and should always be the full principal, but it's a separate issue to fix.\n\nIs there somewhere that I've made something \"worse\"?  Or are you referring to pre-existing issues that should be addressed on another jira?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-03-14T13:46:25.778+0000","updated":"2013-03-14T13:46:25.778+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12632071/comment/13602358","id":"13602358","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Oh, I see the problem regarding skipping rules.
