That sounds like an internal implementation issue of the {{pthread_getthreadid_np}} function on FreeBSD and possibly even a kernel-level detail.

I'm not sure under what conditions an {{unsigned long}} is different than a {{uint64_t}} on Mac (on Linux, that would be the case with 32-bit compilation).  So this patch may have a buffer overflow in that case.\n\nShould we file a follow-on to fix this?  Simplest fix is just using a temporary variable of type {{uint64_t}} and copying that into the {{unsigned long}}.  It's not a perfect solution since two threads may get the same ID in 32-bit land ( you can blame openssl's boneheaded use of a long here instead of a uint64_t) but it's sure better than a buffer overflow.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
