One thing that we noticed was that the JobTracker's DFS operations like saveOutput and discardOutput were taking too long in the large cluster. The unfortunate thing was that the JobTracker stays locked when the DFS operation is happening. So that might result in lost trackers since the JobTracker is not able to process any RPC that requires taking a lock on itself. This patch moves out the DFS ops to a separate thread. It also introduces a new task state called DFS_OPS_PENDING. This is the state after the task completes and before the JT does the DFS ops. The state helps to prevent anomalies like marking a task as successful before the dfs operation (rename) is done. Only when the dfs rename completes successfully is a task considered successful. The state is also used to not run speculative tasks (since we know that the task is in the last stage). \nThis patch is up for review. It is not well tested yet.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2007-09-13T18:36:09.355+0000","updated":"2007-09-13T18:36:09.355+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12377940/comment/12527219","id":"12527219","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Long-term we intend to avoid using the FileSystem API directly in MR tasks (HADOOP-1558).

I was wondering if the following would happen when I was submitting server throttle hack (looks like it does :():\n\n- Server gets backed up at one momemnt, and it reads slower from the client.\n- It looks like if there it does not receive anything from a client for 2 min, it closes the connection. I was not yesterday, when the client closes a connection.\n- Ideally what server should do in that case is not to process _any_ more RPCs from that connection. But since there is still readable data on the closed socket it patiently reads and executes the RPC that are going to be thrown away. Any such unnecessary work done will result in bad feedback of ever increasing load since client retries the same RPCs on different socket. I wonder what 'netstat' would have shown in this case on the namenode. My guess is that there should be a LOT of these exceptions while writing the reply.\n\nLet me know if you want to try an updated server throttle patch.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-09-19T01:12:14.540+0000","updated":"2007-09-19T01:12:14.540+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12377940/comment/12528628","id":"12528628","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Christian, could you pls use the patch for HADOOP-1904 and see whether it helps the dfs issue.
