Usually this not much of a problem. It takes even more cpu when it needs to search multiple racks for a datanode. We could probably reduce some CPU for these searches. The benefit should be measurable.\n# Once NameNode can not find any datanode that has space on a rack, it could mark the rack as \"full\" and skip searching the rack for next one minute or so. This flag gets cleared after a minute or if any new node is added to the rack.\n#* Of course, this might not be optimal w.r.t disk space usage.. but only for a short duration. Once a cluster is mostly full, the user does expect errors.\n#* On the flip side, this fix does not require extremely CPU optimized version of chooseTarget(). \n#* I think it is reasonable for NameNode to throw DiskOutOfSpace exception, even though it could have found space if it searched much more extensively.\n\n---\nedit : minor changes\n\n

It identified one cause of the problem is that ReplicationMonitor holds the global lock while replicating blocks in one iteration. So this patch made the following change:\n1. does not allow ReplicationMonitor to hold the fsnamesystem global lock while replicating block in one iteration. Previously the logic is like:\n{code}\nsynchronized computeReplicationWork( int blocksToProcess) {\n  for (int i=0; i<blocksToProcess; i++) {\n    select one block from under-replicated queue;\n    Compute replication work for the block;\n  }\n}\n{code}\nNow it is changed to be:\n{code}\ncomputeReplicationWork(int blocksToProcess) {\n  (synchronized) select blocksToProcess under-replicated blocks;\n  for each selected block {\n    (synchronized)compute replication work for the block;\n  }\n}\n{code}\n2. While computing replication work for a block, releases the global lock while choosing targets because this is the most computation intensive part.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-03-30T21:39:35.176+0000","updated":"2009-03-30T21:39:35.176+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12400774/comment/12693950","id":"12693950","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I did an experiment on a full cluster with 3000 data nodes and 1000 under-replicated blocks.
