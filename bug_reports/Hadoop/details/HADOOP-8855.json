So, by the time it got back to our code, it was already complete and the Set-Cookie was present with the auth token, and a HTTP 200 result. This was causing fallback to the PseudoAuthenticator, which had a separate bug that it wasn't setting the SSL configuration in its connection\n\n- I also found a separate bug that the dfsadmin -fetchImage code needed a doAs to work properly in this type of secure cluster\n\nWith this patch in place I'm able to fetch the image on a krb5+ssl cluster. I'll swing back and double-check that it also works on a krb5 (no ssl) and ssl (no krb5) cluster.\n\nI'd also like someone who knows this code to comment whether we need the SPNEGO code in KerberosAuthenticator at all.
