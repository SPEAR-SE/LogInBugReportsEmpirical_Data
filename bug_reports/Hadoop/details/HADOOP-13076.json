Chris: I believe the MD5 checks are in the SDK download automatically, at least from my cursory review of the AWS code on github;\n\n[~stevel@apache.org], I just checked out that code, and I think you're right.\n\nbq. there's nothing equivalent in upload\n\nI think I found MD5 verification for uploads too.  It's kind of clever about it too.  If the caller supplied an MD5, then it will go ahead and send the Content-MD5 header.  If not, then it will do the MD5 calculation internally for the caller, but it won't actually send the Content-MD5 header.  That would imply needing to buffer the entire content and finish the MD5 calculation before sending the HTTP request headers.  Instead, it checks the ETag returned by the S3 service in the HTTP response, so it doesn't need to use an inefficient buffering strategy.  I found this logic for both plain put and multi-part upload.\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/1.10.6/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Client.java#L1385-L1505\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/1.10.6/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Client.java#L2893-L2944\n\nThose links are for the 1.10.6 code, which is our dependency as of Apache Hadoop 2.8.0.
