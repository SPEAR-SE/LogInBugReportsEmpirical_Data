It looks like he found the root cause is that {{validateFiles}} checks for existence of files against a {{FileSystem}} instance, but this {{FileSystem}} instance is obtained before handling -D options.  This would mean we then have an instance sitting in the {{FileSystem}} cache that was created without the -D options set in the {{Configuration}}.  Later, during MapReduce job split calculation, it would use the cached instance that didn't have the override of {{fs.azure.block.size}}.\n\nI agree with the change here, because the expectation is that the command line arguments take precedence.  However, I don't think we should move the -D handling all the way to the top of the method.  Right now, the handling is such that -D options would take precedence over -fs and -jt.  The current patch would reverse that.  I don't know if anyone depends on that behavior, but we can avoid changing it by doing the -D handling in between the handling of -conf and the handling of -libjars.  I'd be +1 for the patch with that change if you test it and it still works for overriding {{fs.azure.block.size}}.\n\nbq. Should the API Path.getFileSystem(Configuration conf) be that the returned file system object always apply the up-to-date conf ?\n\nThis is a long-standing weakness of the {{FileSystem}} cache.  It has been discussed in other jiras, but I can't find those now.  The {{FileSystem}} cache key is composed of scheme, authority, and {{UserGroupInformation}}.  However, the {{FileSystem#get}} API is phrased in terms of a whole {{Configuration}}.  Various other configuration properties can tune the behavior of a {{FileSystem}}, but if you get a cached instance, then these configuration properties might not be applied.  OTOH, it would be too costly to make the whole {{Configuration}} part of the cache key.\n\nThis is an existing problem, unrelated to the current patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-26T20:25:15.648+0000","updated":"2015-01-26T20:25:15.648+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769991/comment/14292397","id":"14292397","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the comment.

Based on my code review, I thought this change was OK for backwards compatibility.\n\nThe first version would have been backwards-incompatible, because it would have changed the precedence of -D arguments over -fs and -jt.  (See 2 comments back from me for more details.)\n\nThe committed version of the patch still moves the -D handling before the handling of -libjars, -files and -archives.  However, these are not analogous to -fs and -jt.  They do not map directly to an underlying user-facing configuration property, so I expect the change in precedence isn't relevant.  While it is a change in behavior, I think the prior behavior can only be considered a bug due to validateFiles caching a FileSystem with configuration that didn't consider the -D arguments.\n\nPlease let me know if you disagree or if you think I missed something in the review.

However, this has its own problems.  Disabling the cache can cause a performance problem.  If using {{FileSystem#newInstance}}, then it's very important that the owner of the instance eventually call {{close}} to avoid bloating memory over time.  In the case where the {{FileSystem}} instance creation happens indirectly, these workarounds might not be viable, because you might not want to change code several layers below just to accommodate a new patch.\n\nIssues like this have made the {{FileSystem}} cache a frequent source of confusion.  This might warrant a redesign at some point.  I'd prefer that a lot of the implicit behavior around use of {{Configuration}} and {{UserGroupInformation}} were made explicit to the caller in the API.  I also think we'd benefit from full reference counting instead of the current \"best effort\" caching where an unrelated thread could call {{close}} and trigger a cache eviction.  I believe doing this would require changing the contract so that callers must always call {{close}}.  Unfortunately, that would be backwards-incompatible.  There is a ton of existing code all over the ecosystem that doesn't bother calling {{close}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-28T17:11:45.745+0000","updated":"2015-01-28T17:11:45.745+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769991/comment/14296677","id":"14296677","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"UGI and Config setup are irreversible.
