It will take a *really* long time to cycle through all ids.  Migration should not be expensive, since it just requires renaming block files, not copying them.

So all blocks in the name table are out-of-range, and hence need renaming.  Renaming can be handled like other blockwork: the namenode can give datanodes rename commands.  While a block is being renamed it must be kept in side tables, so that, e.g., requests to read files whose blocks are partially renamed can still be handled.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-04-19T06:38:46.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-19T06:38:46.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12332335/comment/12383237","id":"12383237","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=milindb","name":"milindb","key":"milindb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Milind Bhandarkar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I have attached a patch that fixes block-id conflicts for randomly generated block-ids.
