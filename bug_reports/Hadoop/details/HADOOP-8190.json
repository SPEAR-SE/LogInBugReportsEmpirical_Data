This will be of great help for map/reduce testing without touching remote shell (especially to run M/R on a small data set for quick prototyping)\nAfter this it would be really nice to eclipse plugin be able to access HDFS with proxy as well as kerberos authentication.\n\nIntent:\nI am thinking of this as a Google Summer of Code 2012 project (I am an undergrad)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashar103","name":"ashar103","key":"ashar103","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ambud Sharma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-03-20T03:24:39.913+0000","updated":"2012-03-20T03:24:39.913+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12547130/comment/13269270","id":"13269270","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"No patch submitted in time for 1.0.
