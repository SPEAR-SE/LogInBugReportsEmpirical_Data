System load would be characterized by the total number of map slots\navailable across the whole cluster and the number of unfinished map tasks in\nthe queue.\n\nFor example,\nLoad = (Total Map Slots available - Total Unfinished Maps) / Total Map Slots\n\nOne possible strategy (Possible default vaues for x = 50%, y = 75%)\n1. If (Load < x), re-execute on first fetch failure notification itself.\n2. If (x < Load < y), re-execute on second fetch failure notification.\n3. Always re-execute (irrespective of the system load) on third notification.\n\nOptimization 2 (At reduce task)\n===========\n\nThe strategy is to categorize the time outs (while fetching map outputs) as\neither connection Timeout or Read Timeout and then handle each case\ndifferently. Currently, there is no distinction and all timeouts are handled\nthe same way.\n\nHandling Connection Timeouts\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1. Try connecting with the default timeout of 30s.\n2. Follow the existing algorithm of Exponential backoff for retries. This\nalgorithm is provided below for quick reference.\n\nHandling Read Timeouts\n-----------------------------------\n1. Read with a time out = MAX(3 minutes, map_run_time)\n2. Back off for a value = (map_run_time/2)\n3. Send notifications after every read time out.\n\nExponential Back Off Algorithm\n########################\nBACKOFF_INIT = 4000\n\nmaxFetchRetriesPerMap =\ngetClosestPowerOf2(map_run_time * 1000 / BACKOFF_INIT) + 1;\n\ncurrentBackOff = (noFailedFetches <= maxFetchRetriesPerMap)\n                                     ? BACKOFF_INIT\n                                       * (1 << (noFailedFetches - 1))\n                                     : (this.maxBackoff * 1000 / 2);\n\nFirst notification after maxFetchRetriesPerMap attempts\nSecond notification after 2 more attempts\nThird notification after another 2 attempts\n\nExample scenarios for Optimization 2\nAssumptions\nMap run time = 5 mins\nOnly one reducer per node (All fetch failures will be from this task alone)\n\nCase 1. Connect fails.\n\nExisting algorithm:\n1. First notification = At end of 6 (maxFetchRetriesPerMap) retries. The Exponential backoff algorithm\ncomes into play here. \nApprox time = 3mins * 7 + (4+8+16+32+64+128) = 21 + 4.2 = 25.2 mins\n                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n                                                                EBO\n2. Second notification = After 2 attempts. Approx time = 25 + (3+2+3) = 33 mins.\n(Back Off = 2 mins after maxFetchRetriesPerMap.)\n2. Third notification = After another 2 attempts. Approx time = 41 mins\n\nNew algorithm:\n1. First Notification = 4.2 mins + 30*7 = 7.5 mins\n                                        ^^^^^^\n                                          EBO\n2. Second Notification = 7.5 + (0.5+2.5+0.5) = 10.5 mins\n3. Third Notification = 10.5 + (0.5+2.5+0.5) = 13.5 mins\n\nCase 2. Connect successful, read fails.\n\nExisting algorithm:\nSame as Case 1, 41 mins for map re-execution.\n\nNew algorithm:\n1. First Notification = 5 mins (read time out = map_run_time)\n2. Second Notification = 5+2.5+5 = 12.5 mins (back off = map_run_time/2 = 2.5 mins)\n3. Third Notification = 12.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 20 mins\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-05-29T10:28:41.307+0000","updated":"2008-05-29T10:28:41.307+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12395088/comment/12608285","id":"12608285","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching patch for review","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-06-26T05:58:17.198+0000","updated":"2008-06-26T05:58:17.198+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12395088/comment/12608352","id":"12608352","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

A few points\n* Some comments on the changes in the code would be good.\n* The percentages that we use to decide maxNotifications and fetchRetriesPerMap should be configurable?\n* Since fetchRetriesPerMap is computed during every iteration as per the current copiedMapOutputs.size, it is possible that we might delay a notification to the JT by one failure. For example, consider maxFetchRetriesPerMap = 5 and numRetries=4. During the next failure numRetries = 5, and let us say we cross the threshold and reset fetchRetriesperMap = 2 (5/2). As per the existing logic, we would have sent a notification as  numRetires = maxFetchRetriesPerMap. But with the new logic, we will wait as 5%2 != 0.
