If you try to rename a directory and you don't have read or delete perms to a path underneath, rename() fails *without updating s3guard as to its current state*. It needs to sync up & add tombstones for all deleted entries, new entries for created stuff. \r\n\r\n* Delete will also need to add the tombstones for all successful deletes, \r\n* createFakeDirectory to handle failure on the GET or the PUT\r\n* maybe also: add specific metric for permissions failures \r\n\r\nrename() is what worries me the most with s3guard, as its the one which will end up most inconsistent. \r\n\r\nEverything is setup to add tests for these; harder part is fixing.
