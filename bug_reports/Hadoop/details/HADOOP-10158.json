Thanks for the effort put in to satisfy our requirements.\n\nThis will not work for us since the patch canonicalizes the hostname with the call _request.getLocalName()_. This restricts the server principals that can be used to the canonicalized one.  If I have CNAME to HOSTNAME and want to authenticate with  both {HTTP/CNAME, HTTP/HOSTNAME} then that will not work. _request.getLocalName()_  will always return HOSTNAME. \n\nAn alternate implementation can be like this:\n\n1. During init, login all the principals specified in principal conf key . If no principals are specified, read all principals matching HTTP/*@* from keytab and login all of them and cache them with a servername-Realm map\nThis avoids any synchronization , caching and Realm determination.  This is an optional improvement. If needed, I can provide an implementation for this. \n\n2. In authenticate, look up a principal with _request.getServerName() _ in addition to  _request.getLocalName()_  .  This is required for us to work. This removes the canonicalization issue.
