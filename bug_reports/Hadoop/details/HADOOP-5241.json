The maps which have 0 input create lot of skew. In the current code, consider this case:\n1. first map completes blowupOnThisTask (output/input) = 1000/200 = 5\n   mapBlowupRatio = 5\n2. second map completes blowupOnThisTask  (output/input) = 50/1 = 50 (in this case the input was 0 and there is some output produced)\n    mapBlowupRatio becomes 50/2 + ((2 - 1) / 2) * 5 = 27.5 \nThis leads to unreasonable blow up from 5 to 27.5\n\nThe fix I propose is as follows:\nInstead of adding the blowup ratio, calculate the blow up based on (cumulative completed map output size)/(cumulative completed map input size). For above example, it works out as follows:\n1. first map completes blowupOnThisTask (output/input) = 1000/200 = 5\n   mapBlowupRatio = 5\n2. second map completes blowupOnThisTask  (output/input) = 50/1 = 50 (in this case the input was 0 and there is some output produced)\n    mapBlowupRatio becomes (1000+50)/(200+1) ~ 5.2\nThis leads to reasonable blow up from 5 to 5.2","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sharadag","name":"sharadag","key":"sharadag","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sharad Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-02-17T08:49:28.208+0000","updated":"2009-02-17T08:49:28.208+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12414705/comment/12674182","id":"12674182","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sharadag","name":"sharadag","key":"sharadag","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sharad Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"attaching patch with the fix.
