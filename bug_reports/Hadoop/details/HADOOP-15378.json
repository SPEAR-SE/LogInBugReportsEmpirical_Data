Catalogd was unable to log in because of a Kerberos issue. The JDK expects the first kerberos ticket of a principal to be a TGT, however it seems that after this error, because it was unable to login successfully, the first ticket was no longer a TGT. The patch HADOOP-13433 removed other tickets of the principal, because it expects the TGT to be in the principal’s ticket, which is untrue in this case.

Finally, it turns out that the DataNode's host has an incorrect krb5.conf, which points to a decommissioned KDC, inconsistent with the rest of the hosts in the cluster. Upon authentication, it seems the error handling for the SaslException has a race condition, and occasionally it removes valid credential from the UGI. When we corrected the krb5.conf on that host, this error disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis is not easy to reproduce, but we are told this issue seems to occur after Impala user performs a \"refresh\" command. Presumably this command forces Impala catalog server to connect to the problematic DataNode and triggered the buggy code.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI don't have a patch to fix it but I want to raise this issue for discussion.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Hadoop client unable to relogin because a remote DataNode has an incorrect krb5.conf","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"CDH5.8.3, Kerberized, Impala","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13151417/comment/16432530","id":"16432530","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~Apache9] appreciate if you could also look at this one since you were the author of HADOOP-13433.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-04-10T16:07:07.712+0000","updated":"2018-04-10T16:07:07.712+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13151417/comment/16432583","id":"16432583","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"This is bizarre even in the category of bizarre-kerberos errors.
