During create-release's development, it was found that various combinations that we had documented in various locations left many broken and incomplete HTML pages when building the pages for the site.  e.g., jdiff output\n\n* We currently don't link a lot of content that we build, despite a lot of the effort put into maintaining it. e.g., jdiff output\n\n* It might be time to actually make three tarballs instead of two:  src, bin, docs.
