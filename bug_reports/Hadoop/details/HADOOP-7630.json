Note, this has nothing to do with graphs, just the snapshot/publish period. Typical metrics aggregator (simon is configured at 60 seconds for graphing resolution) needs a few samples in the aggregate period for derived metrics.

I changed the blurb rate to 60 seconds around August 2008 on Y! clusters.\n\nThe blurb period (for metrics, config blurb is on another period) was actually still 5 seconds in metrics1, when we were deploying metrics2 (where we use the default blurb period 10 second) in 2010 on Y clusters. Rajiv can confirm this. Are you saying simon aggregator could not process less than 1k udp packets per second? In any case, the throughput I saw (a few months ago) on the simon aggregator is way more than that. Rajiv said that the limiting factor is not the udp packets processing at aggregator level but the iops to store the data.\n\nbq.  The Simon plugin is only doing add and average of samples.\n\nI'm sure you meant simon aggregator. It also does user defined calculations (defined in the simon config file), if you lose the sole udp packet in the reporting period, the derived metrics will not be correct, so you need a couple of samples at least in the reporting period. While MetricVaryingRate in metrics1 and MutableRate in metrics2 do averaging and compute throughput, which are used mostly in rpc related metrics, most metrics in mapred are counters and gauages and almost all the mapred throughput metrics (*PerSec) are actually derived metrics from the simon config. This approach half the packet size vs using the *Rate metrics in metrics sources. Simon sinks send one packet per update, unlike ganglia, which sends one packet per metric per update.\n\nbq. Are you concerning that the metrics might overflow if the publish rate is at 60 seconds?\n\nNo. Even if some of them do, it's easy to see and explain on the graphs.

On all production cluster, on the status page, it shows 93% packets lost for disk metrics.  Disk metrics are emitted per disk.  On a typical 2000 nodes cluster, there used to be 4 disk, which turns out to be 8k metrics per 5 seconds.  Single simon aggregator has problem to handle aggregation load at this scale.  Hadoop metrics is supposedly smaller than system metrics, but multiply the type of metrics (jvm, roc, mapped, hdfs), the number of output udp packets would reach the same scale of disk metrics, if something is not done to reduce the repeated noise.\n\nbq.

With the current change, you're relying on zero udp packet loss, which is OK for small clusters. To give an example why this is a problem: for derived throughput metrics, which is calculated with (counter-current - counter-last)/period, if you are missing a few packets, you will see zero throughput in 60 second windows, which is clearly wrong for many metrics.\n\nThere is simply no need to change the period.\n\nIn any case, make sure Rajiv know about this (just added Rajiv to the watchers).
