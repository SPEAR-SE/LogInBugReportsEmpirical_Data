Then scripts will later directly do \". hadoop-env.sh\".\n\nThis double-include is error prone.\n\nNote several Jira's reporting issues with HADOOP_LOG_DIR set to /user/user (e.g. /root/root, /hadoop/hadop, etc).  This is because hadoop-env.sh has done \"HADOOP_LOG_DIR=$HADOOP_LOG_DIR/$user\".  Many fixes for those issues are around addressing that one line, but it seems that this is going to be a recurring theme of breakages.  It's probably also why services are routinely started with many command line arguments repeated multiple times.\n\nI'm not familiar enough with the \"design\" of all the scripts, so not sure what the solution should be.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"43556","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"hadoop-env.sh is included twice: once via hadoop-config.sh the again explicitly via scripts","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jayf","name":"jayf","key":"jayf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jay Finger","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jayf","name":"jayf","key":"jayf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jay Finger","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12558971/comment/13290014","id":"13290014","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Ideally calling hadoop-env.sh multiple times should not create any problems.\n\nBecause hadoop-config.sh itself called from so many files.
