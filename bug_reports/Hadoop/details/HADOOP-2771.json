What's the value of io.sort.mb? This will give a rough estimate on the number of spills a map does. If there are multiple spills while the map is running, one suspect is that we are spending too much time in the final merge across the spill segments (merges to produce the final map output). We'd also do a lot of seeks during that merge. It'd be nice to remove the seeks, before the merge of the segments belonging to a certain partition, since we are ultimately reading the files sequentially anyway.\n\nBut again, the above depends on whether the map does multiple spills or not.
