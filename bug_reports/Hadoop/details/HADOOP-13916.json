This repo will be responsible for...?\n{quote}\n\nThe repo provides a place where we can show use of the client facing modules, similar to how Steve mentions the cloud integration stuff.\n\nbq. Does this need to be a separate repo though?\n\nOver in HBase it's been very useful for our similar downstream example to be in its own repo. For one thing, it ensures that updates to it have attention called to them. If it were in the main repo it'd be too easy for a dev that introduced a breaking change to just also update the example at the same time. Additionally, it has allowed us to recently start expressly show downstream examples that successfully cross major versions.\n\nhttps://github.com/saintstack/hbase-downstreamer/\n\nThus far, there's been no downside to that repo being just some github hosted thing. I do, however, think it'd be better generally for these things to be in repos under the control of an appropriate PMC.\n\nbq. Do we need to branch it and release it with Hadoop versions?\n\nOne gap on the hbase downstream is that we haven't ever really done releases. Here in Hadoop we could continue that tradition, but I'd much rather have something we can refer back to later. That would mean having releases, though I'd hope at a much lower rate than the main code. \n\nbq. How does precommit work? \n\nThis is an excellent question. The most familiar course would be an additional JIRA tracker and then a copy of the existing tracker specific precommit jobs would work. That sounds like a fair bit of overhead.\n\nbq. maybe \"hadoop-downstream-tests\", create one in github as a PoC\n\nI'm happy to do this however the PMC prefers. Our goal is compilable code that we can have snippets of in project documentation. That documentation should live in the main repo along with the rest of our web facing stuff. Since the educational value should be in the documentation that walks through things, we'd hopefully mitigate the long term risk of e.g. that code coming from a personal github repo that might cease to be.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=busbey","name":"busbey","key":"busbey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233"},"displayName":"Sean Busbey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-09-01T12:21:19.133+0000","updated":"2017-09-01T12:21:19.133+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13029189/comment/16150883","id":"16150883","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the pointer to Stack's repo; I get it, now.
