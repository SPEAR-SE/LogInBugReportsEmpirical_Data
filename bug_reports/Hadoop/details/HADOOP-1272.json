I agree that moving the SafeModeInfo out of the FSNamesystem file makes the code layout has become a little more involved that earlier.

I think this patch actually ensures that methods in SafeModeInfo cannot access private members of FSNamesystem directly. This should improve code maintainability and cleanliness. \n\nThe fact the SafeModeInfo cannot access private members of FSNamesystem means that a log message that was earlier present in one place is now duplicated at two or three places. I have removed the assert because SafeModeInfo cannot be accessing private variables in FSNamesystem.\n\nThanks for catching the problems with javadoc.
