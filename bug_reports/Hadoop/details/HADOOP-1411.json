Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I did put some logic in the patch to HADOOP-1263 to handle retries for AlreadyBeingCreatedException. But it turned out it did not work. The problem is that any IPC call returns only RemoteException. When a server operation throws AlreadyBeingCreatedException, the client only gets RemoteException and it has to examine the content of RemoteException to find out the real exception. So the DFSClient retry framework implemented in HADOOP-1263 never catches an AlreadyBeingCreatedException and therefore it never gets retried.\n\nI'd like to propose the following changes to the general retry framework so it is able to handle RemoteException well:\nMethod shouldRetry of RetryPolicies.exceptionDependentRetry checks if the exception is a RemoteException. If yes, find out the retry policy for the real exception from the exceptionToPolicyMap. Because RemoteException contains only the class name of the real exception, I would also propose to change the exceptionToPolicyMap to map an exception class name to a retry policy. Currently it is a map from a exception class to a retry policy.
