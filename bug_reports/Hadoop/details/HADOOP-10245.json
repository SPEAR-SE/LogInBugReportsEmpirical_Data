Sorry I didn't see HADOOP-9870 before I submit this one. I also found similar JIRAs HADOOP-9211 and HDFS-5087.\n\nI went through these JIRAs and here are my thoughts:\nWe should only rely on $HADOOP_HEAPSIZE to control Java heap size, instead of $HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS. Otherwise it would be very confusing and hard to debug issues. And I've seen many real world issues caused by this confusion.\n\nThere are arguments that $HADOOP_HEAPSIZE is only for service, and client should have its own settings. Well, we could create HADOOP_CLIENT_HEAPSIZE which is initialized to 512m and used in hadoop.sh. But personally I think it does not worth it to add this new env variable. The client can just simply use $HADOOP_HEAPSIZE which defaults to 1000m. Also, there are scenarios that a java class executed by \"hadoop jar\" command has a large memory requirements. A real world example: Hive's MapredLocalTask calls \"hadoop jar\" to build a local hash table.\n\nAlso, if there's a need to change the heapsize, one can always set env variable $HADOOP_HEAPSIZE.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shanyu","name":"shanyu","key":"shanyu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"shanyu zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-21T01:21:46.337+0000","updated":"2014-01-21T01:21:46.337+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12689912/comment/13877774","id":"13877774","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shanyu","name":"shanyu","key":"shanyu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"shanyu zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~drankye], [~qwertymaniac] would you please help review this patch?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shanyu","name":"shanyu","key":"shanyu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"shanyu zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-21T19:31:59.113+0000","updated":"2014-01-21T19:31:59.113+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12689912/comment/13877837","id":"13877837","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ywskycn","name":"ywskycn","key":"ywskycn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Wei Yan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~shanyu], as discussed, there are multiple places configuring -Xmx.

If we remove -Xmx512m from HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS in hadoop_env.cmd, there will be one and only one -Xmx, which is the $JAVA_HEAP_MAX in bin/hadoop. \n\nHADOOP-9870 may have solved the problem for you, but I think the fix in HADOOP-9870 might be too complicated and hard to maintain. For example, what about user use \"-Xmx\" in HADOOP_OPTS instead of HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS? I think we should avoid using HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS or HADOOP_OPTS to specify memory, because the fact that we've defined HADOOP_HEAPSIZE but not using it for memory specification is confusing. If you want to change heap size, just change HADOOP_HEAPSIZE, I think this is simple and clear.
