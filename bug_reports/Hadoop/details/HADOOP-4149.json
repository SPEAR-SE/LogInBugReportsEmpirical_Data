This is true irrespective of whether we use {{JobInProgress}} or any new object like the proposed {{JobSchedulingInfo}}. And a {{SortedSet}}, like a {{TreeSet}} seems to be required here. However, this also means that when we want to delete (or update) an object, we would need to iterate over all the objects in the structure to find the one we want to remove. This is because our sort ordering is based on different parameters from how we treat the objects as equal (which for all practical purposes should be based on the Job id).\n\nI also think updates are rare operations, compared to accessing the list in a sorted order, which happens almost everytime the scheduler needs to look at a new job. Hence, I think it makes sense to go with an implementation that has an O(n) scan for removals.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-10-07T10:27:47.950+0000","updated":"2008-10-07T10:27:47.950+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404075/comment/12637440","id":"12637440","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"O(n) is O( n ). *Smile*","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-10-07T10:29:13.031+0000","updated":"2008-10-07T10:29:13.031+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404075/comment/12637466","id":"12637466","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bq.
