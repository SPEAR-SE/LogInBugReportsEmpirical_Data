Added corresponding envs for KRB5KEYTAB and KRB5PRINCIPAL.\n\nIf KRB5KEYTAB is defined, the ticket cache will continue to be searched first but it will fallback to the keytab if there is no ticket cache, no TGT in the ticket cache, or if the ticket cache TGT cannot be renewed.  KRB5PRINCIPAL may optionally be specified if the keytab principal does not match the unix user.\n\nIf both KRB5KEYTAB and KRB5CCNAME are defined, a TGT acquired via the keytab will be written to the ticket cache to avoid constantly acquiring a new TGT.\n\nRemoved an unnecessary re-instantiation of the UGI (just after it's instantiated and assigned an auth type) to avoid double writing the ticket cache. \n\nThere is no change to existing behavior if the KRB5KEYTAB env is not defined.

The launches may perform dozens of hadoop commands before actually submitting the job.  We are seeing a huge failure rate, necessitating unnecessary retry loops, because of this kinit issue whether it be explicitly by the user or implicitly by hadoop's background renewal.  As the job load is increased, we are seeing more and more failures that are \"breaking through\" the retry loop.\n\n@Aaron:\nI have not tested with IBM's java.  If you have convenient access, would you be able to test it for me?  On the bright side, even if it's broken, it won't be a problem unless the user sets the KRB5KEYTAB env to activate the new code.  If it is broken, could I file another jira to make it work for IBM's java?\n\n@Allen:\nYes, kinit will regardless of -R, unlink the file, open/write the principal, open/write the TGT.  So your suggestion won't work because concurrent launches issuing the kinit will still result in the race condition where one process may be issuing the kinit while another is trying to run hadoop commands.  Obtaining a new TGT for every launch would place tremendously more pressure on the KDC, thus why this change tries the ticket cache, falls back to the keytab, and updates the ticket cache if it had to fallback.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-02-21T14:31:26.701+0000","updated":"2013-02-21T14:31:26.701+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633001/comment/13663400","id":"13663400","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=robsparker","name":"robsparker","key":"robsparker","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=robsparker&avatarId=15639","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=robsparker&avatarId=15639","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=robsparker&avatarId=15639","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=robsparker&avatarId=15639"},"displayName":"Robert Parker","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Refreshed the patch to latest trunk/branch-2","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=robsparker","name":"robsparker","key":"robsparker","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=robsparker&avatarId=15639","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=robsparker&avatarId=15639","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=robsparker&avatarId=15639","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=robsparker&avatarId=15639"},"displayName":"Robert Parker","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-05-21T21:05:52.055+0000","updated":"2013-05-21T21:05:52.055+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633001/comment/13663430","id":"13663430","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
