Same holds for task_script_path if execlp fails.\n- run_task_as_user: Regarding the removal of chown, though the call is not necessary, I am thinking a better idea is to actually do this *after* switching the user. I don't see why root privileges are required to do this operation. This way, the file would be written as owned by the child, with the right permissions (so, no need for the chmod as well).\n- kill_user_task: Like above, I think we can have the reading of the pid file happen after switching the user. Coupled with that change, since the file will be written as the user itself, it can be read back by him as well.\n- run_task_as_user: We are doing an fclose of LOGFILE (both explicitly and by the fcloseall call) before execlp, but afterwards, we are writing to it in some error conditions. Maybe we can just remove these prints. Coupled with the above changes to do more operations after switching the user, it may mean that we cannot log in even more cases. Because the error codes are indicative enough, I think this is fine though.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-04-06T06:37:29.008+0000","updated":"2009-04-06T06:37:29.008+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416629/comment/12696004","id":"12696004","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sreekanth","name":"sreekanth","key":"sreekanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sreekanth Ramakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Removed chown and chmod calls in the run_task_as_user.\n\nChanged the way binary switches user, now binary immediately switches to the passed user and then writes out the .pid file, so chown and chmod calls is no longer required.\n\nRemoved fprintf statements which were called after switching the user.
