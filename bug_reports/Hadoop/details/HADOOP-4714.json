There are some bad outlayers of up to 3 MB, but their frequency is too small to be the reason for failure of reorting progress.\n\nI checked the full syslog of one of the tasks. The last merge started exactly 20 minutes (the configured timeout) before the time of failure, i.e. there was no progress reported at all. I am not familiar with progress reporting, but does progress() in writeFile() just set a flag with maybe no consequences?\nWhen checking the log of a successful task I noticed that the final merge lasted longer than 20 minutes, i.e. this task reported progress, but from the TaskTracker log there was no progress reported for 18 minutes into the merge phase (before it was every few seconds), i.e. with a default timeout of 10 minutes this task attempt would have failed as well.\n\n2008-11-24 08:39:13,142 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask: Finished spill 12\n2008-11-24 08:39:16,383 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:16,681 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:16,832 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:17,020 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:17,302 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:17,995 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:18,109 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:18,360 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:18,487 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:18,844 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:19,016 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:19,081 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:19,119 INFO org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CodecPool: Got brand-new decompressor\n2008-11-24 08:39:19,350 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Merger: Merging 13 sorted segments\n2008-11-24 08:39:20,240 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Merger: Down to the last merge-pass, with 13 segments left of total size: 111126 bytes\n2008-11-24 08:39:20,338 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask: Index: (0, 194236, 96533)\n2008-11-24 08:39:20,989 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Merger: Merging 13 sorted segments\n2008-11-24 08:39:21,343 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Merger: Down to the last merge-pass, with 13 segments left of total size: 115642 bytes\n2008-11-24 08:39:21,381 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask: Index: (96533, 199588, 100312)\n2008-11-24 08:39:21,427 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Merger: Merging 13 sorted segments\n2008-11-24 08:39:21,864 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Merger: Down to the last merge-pass, with 13 segments left of total size: 126500 bytes\n...\n2008-11-24 08:59:10,877 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask: Index: (1318384976, 240135, 108120)\n2008-11-24 08:59:10,899 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Merger: Merging 13 sorted segments\n2008-11-24 08:59:11,057 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Merger: Down to the last merge-pass, with 13 segments left of total size: 109385 bytes\n2008-11-24 08:59:11,798 WARN org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskRunner: Parent died.

Progress should always be reported at smaller intervals than the timeout which is configurable and could be a small number.\n\nFair point. Still, it's far from the only profile that makes unobserved progress and the current approach isn't guaranteed to work in this hypothetical case, either. Balancing performance against accuracy in the current model admits the possibility of spurious timeouts by definition. The heuristics we use- every N records out of the merge, every partition, etc.- are, as you point out, not guaranteed to fit each job's profile, but they're usually good enough without being too expensive. Continuing to refine them is a stop-gap, admittedly.\n\nThe TaskTracker could try to look for external signs of progress in tasks it suspects are stuck (e.g. spills/merges generated between heartbeats), but that mistakes MapTask side-effects for task health. Adding a thread to poll for progress within the task adds modest benefits, but the cost in complexity (and likely performance) is discouraging. It also separates the checks for progress from the code effecting it, making it harder to maintain. While it's possible to imagine an adaptive system that would sample the frequency of status updates generated from each component and tune each threshold to the particular job, that's a long, long way from what is currently in place.\n\nFor the scope of this JIRA, I think it's sufficient to flag progress after each partition. Doing more reporting out of the merge would be OK, but I see no reason to enshrine the N records/progress update heuristic.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-11-30T04:59:12.223+0000","updated":"2008-11-30T04:59:12.223+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409106/comment/12651807","id":"12651807","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Had an offline discussion with Chris.
