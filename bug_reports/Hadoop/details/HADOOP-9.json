I wrote a patch Dec. 29 2005 and used it at archive.org Jan-Feb 2006.  Looking at my old notes, I created this issue on Jan. 11 2006, and prepared the patch on Feb. 28 2006, but it was either lost in a Jira transition or the attachment somehow failed.  \n\nWhen I looked at your patch yesterday, it was similar enough to what I remembered (5 years ago) that I thought it must be a revision of the patch I did.  Today I found my source and 2005-2006 work notes and it is clear that you implemented the change without seeing mine.\n\nThanks for doing it in same \"roulette-y\" spirit of my lost patch! \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pbaclace","name":"pbaclace","key":"pbaclace","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=pbaclace&avatarId=10630","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=pbaclace&avatarId=10630","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=pbaclace&avatarId=10630","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=pbaclace&avatarId=10630"},"displayName":"Paul Baclace","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-11-06T05:27:57.066+0000","updated":"2010-11-06T05:27:57.066+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-9/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0dwyn:"}}
