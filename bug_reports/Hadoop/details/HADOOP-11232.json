This results in faulty parent resolutions, which when asked for a pom file, get erroneous results.\n\nThe only way around this seems to be to add a series of exclusions for jersey-core, jersey-json, jersey-server and a bunch of others to hadoop-common, then to hadoop-hdfs, then to hadoop-mapreduce-client-core. I don't know how many more excludes are necessary before I can get this to work.\n\nIf you update your jersey.version to 1.14, this faulty pom goes away. Please either update that, or work with build infra to update our nexus pom for jersey-1.9 so that it does not include the faulty glassfish repo.\n\nAnother interesting note about this is that something changed yesterday evening to cause this break in behaviour. We have not had this particular problem in about 9+ months.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"jersey-core-1.9 has a faulty glassfish-repo setting","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12750574/comment/14185069","id":"14185069","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Probably the remote repo going down triggered this.
