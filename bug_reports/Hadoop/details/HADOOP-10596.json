I think there is a configuration to toggle whether NN web UI can be accessed without spnego in secure mode.\n\nLet me introduce more background about SPNEGO:\n\n1.  We can configure to use authentication or not.\n2. When authentication is enabled, we can choose whether to use SPNEGO for web access.\n3. When SPNEGO is enabled for web, we need to define what URLs we want to protect.\n\nThe configuration you mentioned sounds like the 2nd step.\n\nThe problem I found is with the 3rd step. All YARN daemons use initSpnego to initiate the authentication filter to protect web resources (not sure HDFS is using the same method or not as there's an alternative way). The problem is:\n\n1. The authentication filter is actually protect nothing since no urls has been applied to this filter.\n2. initSpnego doesn't provide enough flexibility of configuring secret file and the customized filter class programmatically. YARN daemons start the web app inside it instead of putting it into another container, such as Tomcat (It seems that web hdfs is doing this and can use web.xml to configure the filter) ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-13T17:30:13.665+0000","updated":"2014-05-13T17:30:13.665+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12713703/comment/14001686","id":"14001686","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I'm also not sure I agree with adding the secret file to the http server.
