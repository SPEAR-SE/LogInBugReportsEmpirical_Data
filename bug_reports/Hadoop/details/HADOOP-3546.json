come out. But taskcleanup thread comes out only when the flag _shuttingDown_ is set true. So, the tasktracker is stuck in close().\n\nAfter analysing the code in TaskTracker.java, these following improvements in the code will actually fix the bug,  \n1. _taskCleanupThread_ is started by static code block. That should be moved to _initialize()_. Since we want to stop the thread and start again in the reintialization. \n2. There are two flags _running_ and _shuttingDown_. _running_ is set true in _intialize()_ once all the data structures are intialized , all the threads and servers are started etc.. And _shuttingDown_ is set in the method _shutdown()_ .  _shutdown()_ is nothing but  _close()_  and stops the StatusHttpServer. So, we can move _shuttingDown_ to _close()_ and rename it to _closing_.\n3.The following code in TaskTracker.run() is not necessary:\n {noformat}  if (shuttingDown) { return; } {noformat}\nSince the flag is never set in the loop. \n4. _intialize()_ is called even for Denied tasktracker before shutting down (easily reproducible). So, We can call _intialize()_ only if task tracker is stale state.\n5. The method _isRunning()_ (introduced in HADOOP-2393) can be removed and the flag can be directly accessed from the thread.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-06-13T11:34:05.854+0000","updated":"2008-06-13T11:34:05.854+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12398158/comment/12604828","id":"12604828","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Here is a preliminary patch with proposed modifications for the review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-06-13T12:35:11.725+0000","updated":"2008-06-13T12:35:11.725+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12398158/comment/12604890","id":"12604890","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Although, we could handle the problem by introducing additional synchronization, I'd suggest that we remove the join for the threads and instead make the threads run as daemons.
