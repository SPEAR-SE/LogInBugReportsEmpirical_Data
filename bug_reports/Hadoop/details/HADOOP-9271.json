Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm attaching a patch to remove the Python scripting.  I tested the build on Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu, including native support and bundling Snappy on Ubuntu.\n\nFor the most part, this is just a revert back to the trunk version of each of these pom.xml files.  There are a few differences for Windows compatibility though:\n\n{code}\n-                      ROOT=`cd ${basedir}/..;pwd`\n+                      ROOT=`cd ../..;pwd`\n{code}\n\nThis command was not working on Windows because it would generate a mix of \\ and / in the destination path.  (i.e. cd C:\\foo\\bar/..)  Switching to a relative path and using only / as the path delimiter worked cross-platform.\n\n{code}\n-                      run tar czf hadoop-${project.version}.tar.gz hadoop-${project.version}\n+                      run tar cf hadoop-${project.version}.tar hadoop-${project.version}\n+                      run gzip hadoop-${project.version}.tar\n{code}\n\nThe 'z' flag for compression causes tar to fork a separate process for gzip.  GnuWin32 tar has a limitation in that fork was never implemented, so this would fail on Windows with \"Cannot fork: Function not implemented\".  Splitting this into separate tar and gzip commands works cross-platform.\n\nAnother option here would have been to control the pipeline explicitly using a shell pipeline (tar | gzip), but the \"run\" helper function used here isn't compatible with passing a command that has a pipe.\n\n{code}\n-                      if [ $? = 1 ]; then\n+                      if [ $? != 0 ]; then\n{code}\n\nOn Windows, failure of the prior command might result in some non-zero exit code other than 1, so I changed this to check for any non-zero exit code.\n\n{code}\n-                      tar xzf ${basedir}/downloads/apache-tomcat-${tomcat.version}.tar.gz\n+                      gzip -cd ../../downloads/apache-tomcat-${tomcat.version}.tar.gz | tar xf -\n{code}\n\nSee explanation above about tar failure to fork on Windows.  This one was solveable using gzip | tar.\n\n{code}\n+                      BIN_DIR=\"${BUILD_DIR}/bin\"\n+                      if [ -d $${BIN_DIR} ] ; then\n+                        TARGET_BIN_DIR=\"${BUILD_DIR}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}/bin\"\n+                        mkdir -p $${TARGET_BIN_DIR}\n+                        cd $${BIN_DIR}\n+                        $$TAR * | (cd $${TARGET_BIN_DIR}/; $$UNTAR)\n+                      fi\n{code}\n\nThis is required to bundle the native Windows components (winutils.exe and hadoop.dll) from the bin directory.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-01T07:57:18.837+0000","updated":"2013-02-01T07:57:18.837+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12630223/comment/13569647","id":"13569647","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the explanation.
