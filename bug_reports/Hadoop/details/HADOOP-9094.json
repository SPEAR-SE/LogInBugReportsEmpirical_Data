Question is why is this necessary? This is an error condition and what can you programmatically do?\n\nMincing strings is always problematic and makes it difficult to enhance error messages w/o breaking compatibility.  Allowing an exception to be interrogated for information frees us to change the message string.\n\nWhen performing an operation on multiple paths you have the ability to easily determine which failed and why, so perhaps corrective or cleanup action can be performed.  Awhile back I think pig requested this ability to avoid mincing strings.  Since they call into FsShell for some operations we'd need to ensure we don't break them if a change is deemed necessary.\n\nbq. I feel adding equivalent exceptions already available in java and used in hadoop code to me seems unnecessary, even at the expense of losing some grouping.\n\nI understand where you're coming from, and I pondered the same issues when initially creating the exceptions.  Since the exceptions were confined to FsShell, I favored consistent and easy manipulation of exceptions.  If we change the existing exceptions, I'd reluctantly (in the sense of more catch clauses) lean towards subclasses of FNF and ACE to maintain consistent manipulation of path based exceptions.
