streaming tests to fail.\n\nHighlights:\n1. Removes port-rolling by passing port '0' and letting the OS pick a ephemeral port.\n2. Changed org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server to bind in its constructor and not in the 'run' method to be sure of the ephemeral port.\n3. Since the 'port' changes from the one passed (which previously is stored in some data-members/configuration), this resets them in all necessary places.\n4. Removed support for 'dataNodeFirst/taskTrackerFirst' flag to the Mini{DFS|MR}Cluster since they cannot be supported now (we can't know the NameNode/JobTracker ephemeral ports until we start them).\n5. Fixed all the test-cases and deprecated the unecessary constructors in Mini{DFS|MR}Cluster which cannot be supported.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-03-11T16:22:08.894+0000","updated":"2007-03-11T16:22:08.894+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364400/comment/12483378","id":"12483378","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am running \"ant test-core\" with this patch and without.\nHere are my results\n=============================================\nWithout  1085:\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\nTotal time: 19 minutes 2 seconds\n\n=============================================\nWith 1085 patch:\n\n    [junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.dfs.TestReplication\n    [junit] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Time elapsed: 29.525 sec\n    [junit] Test org.apache.hadoop.dfs.TestReplication FAILED\n\nBUILD FAILED\n\n/home/shv/kryptonite/hadoop/build.xml:461: Tests failed!\nTotal time: 19 minutes 18 seconds\n=============================================\n\n1) It breaks TestReplication\n2) It runs slower.\n3) Looking at the code I don't see how it eliminates dataNodeFirst parameter \nThere is a public construtor (not deprecated)\n  public MiniDFSCluster(int namenodePort, \n                        Configuration conf,\n                        int nDatanodes,\n                        boolean dataNodeFirst,\n                        boolean formatNamenode,\n                        String[] racks) throws IOException {\nand code inside supports the parameter.\n if (dataNodeFirst) {\n   startDataNodes(conf, racks, data_dir);\n }\n4) I, like Owen, don't like sleeps.

I tested this patch using HADOOP-1047 which seemed to solve TestReplication's failure, it's out of sync with trunk now - anyway I've linked it to this issue to keep track.\n3. The idea is to keep the dataNodeFirst (and equivalently taskTrackerFirst for MiniMRCluster) so that people can manually run them if needed. However the automated test cases don't use it; and hence that constructor isn't deprecated.\n4. The sleep there is a busy wait till the namenode comes up. I agree with both of you that we shouldn't use them to solve timing issues, which isn't the case here. We absolutely need to wait for the NameNode to start so that we can then query it and start the datanodes. :)\n\n@Jim\nJim, you wouldn't have to modify any config to get it to work, it is, as before, completely automated (we just let the OS pick the ports).
