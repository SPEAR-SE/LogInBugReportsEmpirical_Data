For standard development work, the cost of building and deployment can be significant when aggregated, with no benefit.\n\nOne of the perhaps not-clear benefits is to guarantee that changes in the system code haven't brake the bindings of the system framework.\n\nI think I'm ok with moving these out of 'mvn-install' target to say 'mvn-system-install'. However, the following should be stated:\n - if a code bindings are broken it will bite back at {{test-patch}} validation\n - deployment of system testing artifacts should remain in 'mvn-deploy' target for the above stated reasons.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cos","name":"cos","key":"cos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741"},"displayName":"Konstantin Boudnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-12-17T19:44:13.606+0000","updated":"2010-12-17T19:44:13.606+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12479101/comment/12972652","id":"12972652","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The patch incorporates cos' feedback.\n\n* mvn-install no longer install si artifacts\n* mvn-si-install will install system integration test artfiacts.\n* test-core no longer runs fi tests\n* test-fi is introduced as an alias to run fi tests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-12-17T21:28:45.232+0000","updated":"2010-12-17T21:28:45.232+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12479101/comment/12972657","id":"12972657","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cos","name":"cos","key":"cos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741"},"displayName":"Konstantin Boudnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Luke, fault injection tests are the part of test cycle (again, they are _different_ from system tests using code injection).

The issue is trying to shorten cross-project build times. It takes no position on the value of the work done during a {{mvn-install}}, only its relevance to the immediate, development context. I hope the following are uncontroversial:\n\n# If test-patch takes an extra minute, 10 minutes, or hour to verify the correctness of the framework, it's time well spent. That doesn't require that it happen during development cycles, where things are often partially, temporarily broken.\n# A patch breaking the test-patch cycle prevents that automated process from validating the framework, admitting preventable regressions. Patches that break it should not be committed, modulo reasonable exceptions.\n# If a patch _is_ committed that breaks the test-patch cycle, it should not halt all downstream development.\n\nI don't care if these are system tests, fault-injection tests, or unit tests. They're taking a long time to build in an inner loop of the dev cycle, and while building them _is important_, pulling it into the outer loop- validation of the patch- is an admissible optimization.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-12-20T20:45:12.823+0000","updated":"2010-12-20T20:45:12.823+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12479101/comment/12973355","id":"12973355","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cos","name":"cos","key":"cos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741"},"displayName":"Konstantin Boudnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 patch looks good.
