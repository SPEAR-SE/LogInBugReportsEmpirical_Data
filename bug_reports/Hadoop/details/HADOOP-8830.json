It is as per [~vinodkv] suggestion. I think both approaches are trying to solve the same problem. However why I preferred updating cookies was that for AuthenticationFilter it is very clear to check cookie first (assuming it is getting called for the first time only) if not found then try to create one. Today even if AuthenticationFilter finds auth cookie then it DOESN'T remove it from request but it is just passed on. So clearly there is a behavior difference between cookie (isPressent and isAbsent). Also please take a look at YARN-621. Issues like that are quite annoying.
