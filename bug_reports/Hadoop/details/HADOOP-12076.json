Are we worried about how the cache gets aged off?\n\nI don't think so - at least not in this jira. The purpose of this patch is to complete the mechanism that should be on par with that of the JavaKeyStoreProvider in the KeyProvider API. If we want to add a TTL or the like then I think that should be a follow on jira as an enhancement. \n\nbq.  Since AbstractJavaKeyStore isn't thread safe, do we know what happens if multiple instances are pointing at the same jks file?\n\nI'm not entirely sure of the usecase that you have in mind. There are read/write locks in this class for providing thread safety. Perhaps there are state issues not covered properly? If so, we should file separate jiras for them. At any rate, I assume that you question is in the context of the cache. Multiple credential provider instances pointing at the same file should be fine assuming that these credentials are generally rather static. The initial usecases are primarily around the passwords that would otherwise be in config files such as those for SSL related keystores or LDAP bind passwords, etc. Therefore, multiple readers are largely not a problem. Now, if someone changes any of those stored passwords the consumers of the credential provider will either need to instantiate new providers (which the Configuration.getPassword call does on each call anyway) or restart.\n\nbq. Presuming the above works, how do we reconcile changes that happen to the underlying jks against the cache?\n\nI think this is largely answered by in the previous question. I guess if passwords are added to the store that they will be picked up without any need for restart or new instances - due to them not being cached. If you used the CLI and deleted an SSL password it would still be returned by the cache until restart or new instances (again, Configuration.getPassword isn't a problem there). If you change the existing password to a keystore then it will probably continue to work until you restart and try to load the certs again. In which case, if the new password matches the keystore it will work otherwise it won't.\n\nbq. You should do something to ensure that deleting the file means that non-cached entries won't be returned.\n\nThat's a good idea - I'll add that additional check to ensure that the keystore is actually gone and whether we blow up - which we probably will. Will have to determine whether that is good or bad...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2015-06-10T04:33:52.154+0000","updated":"2015-06-10T04:33:52.154+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12836330/comment/14580384","id":"14580384","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Interestingly, based on trying to change the test to ensure that non-cached items are not returned when the underlying store is deleted, it seems that the in-memory keystore instance itself serves as a cache.
