My cluster is pretty unevenly loaded, and, without speculative execution, I'm waiting for very long times for tasks to timeout on short jobs. Speculative execution is enabled, so there's no reason that, say, two maps out of ~1900 should be holding up execution. I suspect the \"progress\" accounting being done in the Job isn't being done correctly.\n\nBut, even then, perhaps we need more metrics - with the current metrics, if one of the job units happens to be running really slowly on a given node, but might run faster on other nodes, it might never get executed on another node because the progress on the slow node might be reported as close enough to done so as to not trip the speculative execution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bpendleton","name":"bpendleton","key":"bpendleton","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-05-13T04:49:04.000+0000","updated":"2006-05-13T04:49:04.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12332443/comment/12498493","id":"12498493","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This was fixed when we fixed the thresholds for launching speculative tasks as part of HADOOP-76.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-24T06:08:13.571+0000","updated":"2007-05-24T06:08:13.571+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-152/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0iq2v:"}}
