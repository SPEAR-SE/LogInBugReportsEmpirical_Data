I did take a look at this none the less, and it doesn't look like a quick job. Some issues to consider:\n\n - Will all the codecs throw EOFException in this case, or will some throw IOException?\n - What if a decompressor gets a consistency check? Should it hit this same case? Certainly it should throw IOException rather than EOFException.\n - Clients include SequenceFile, TFile, offlineImageViewer, FSImageCompression, a few classes in mapred(uce), rumen, gridmix and various tests - no small patch.\n - Soon we should address compression stream usage in general to address reducing copies. Lots of places we buffer the stream when the CompressionInputStream is already buffering, resulting in still more copies. If we need to pick through these one by one, perhaps that would be a good time to touch up error handling as well?\n\nSorry to wimp out on you, but it seems like a little much right now.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tbroberg","name":"tbroberg","key":"tbroberg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tbroberg&avatarId=22860","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tbroberg&avatarId=22860","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tbroberg&avatarId=22860","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tbroberg&avatarId=22860"},"displayName":"Tim Broberg","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-25T06:41:17.144+0000","updated":"2012-07-25T06:41:17.144+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599898/comment/13422046","id":"13422046","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thomastechs","name":"thomastechs","key":"thomastechs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thomastechs&avatarId=25660","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thomastechs&avatarId=25660","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thomastechs&avatarId=25660","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thomastechs&avatarId=25660"},"displayName":"Thomas Sebastian","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"As the descriptions says, we need the file name in the exception printed.I think of a simple way to pass the filename to the constructor of the DecompressorStream.

Can you port the patch to trunk?\n\nbq. When the user uses this method and pass the filename, it would be printed in the EOF exception thrown, if any. So I believe the test cases may not be necessary. I was able to test it locally by forcefully creating an EOF Exception and verifying the new message as \"java.io.EOFException: Unexpected end of input stream in the file = filename\"\n\nI think this should be fairly easy to test -- just write a compressed stream, truncate the compressed stream, then try to read it, catch the EOFException and verify that the filename shows up in the exception text.  Or am I missing something?\n\nI'm a little worried about the places where your {{fileName}}-using methods add new default values, for example:\n{code}\n+  public CompressionInputStream createInputStream(InputStream in, \n+    Decompressor decompressor, String fileName) \n+  throws IOException {\n+    return new DecompressorStream(in, decompressor, \n+               conf.getInt(\"io.file.buffer.size\", 4*1024),fileName);\n+  }\n{code}\nI'll have to think about it longer, but having a default value of 4k hidden in this method seems wrong to me at a first glance.

Your patch will be applied against trunk when it's committed, so in some cases you will need to make changes to merge with trunk, and there's never a downside to refreshing your patch against trunk.\n\nFrom the patch file formatting it looks like you're using svn, so you can probably just \"svn up\" and resolve any merge conflicts.  I use git, and use \"git pull --rebase\" to get a similar effect on my working branches.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-06T21:08:51.457+0000","updated":"2012-11-06T21:08:51.457+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599898/comment/13491836","id":"13491836","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"BTW, the wiki page http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute is supposed to answer these questions, but it doesn't currently answer them very well I think.
