The idea behind the fix is to restrict the parsing of XML entities from a configuration Resource when that Resource may not be trusted.  Untrusted resources that are parsed from Resources that come from the classpath are trusted, but resources that come from file streams as a proxy user are not.  When parsing configs outside of the classpath as a proxy user, the contents are likely coming from conf data provided by a cluster user, and we would need to restrict certain XML entities in those cases.  Failing to do so could expose the contents of local files on the server to the cluster user which is the crux of the CVE.\r\n\r\nI'll try to work through the repro steps listed in SPARK-25330 to see if I can reproduce the issue locally.  If successful it should be relatively straightforward to see where the suspect conf is coming from and why it breaks when parsing of that conf is restricted. Note that restricted parsing doesn't mean the contents are not parsed at all, rather that the parser won't honor certain requested directives in the XML stream.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2018-09-07T16:35:18.465+0000","updated":"2018-09-07T16:35:18.465+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13183174/comment/16607592","id":"16607592","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I haven't been able to reproduce the issue yet, but looking closer at the logs I think it's related to variable expansion.  Another aspect of restricted parsing is they are unable to access system properties or environment variables from the config since those could potentially contain secrets.
