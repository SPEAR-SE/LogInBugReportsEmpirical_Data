Trimming the string values may make sense in fs/hdfs paths but it may not for the other usages.  Personally, I wish the trimming was done in the beginning.  Unfortunately, it was not.  If we change it now, then it breaks existing semantics.  I think that users rarely use leading or tailing spaces in configuration values but we cannot break them.\n\nWhen I worked on HADOOP-2461, I think that the property names should be trimmed but not the values. Otherwise, it forbids the potential use of leading and trailing spaces. If there is a need, the codes using the conf values should do the trimming.  In this issue, only the values for dfs.data.dir should be trimmed.\n\nIf a trimmed version of getStrings(..) is needed, I think it is better to provide new methods, say getTrimmedStrings(..) in Configuration and StringUtils but not changing the existing ones.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-16T20:33:30.451+0000","updated":"2009-06-16T20:33:30.451+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12384096/comment/12720438","id":"12720438","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pirroh","name":"pirroh","key":"pirroh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michele Catasta","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I attached a separate patch which exposes a getTrimmedStrings() method and modifies only the behavior of the Datanode.\nWhen the property value is empty, the behavior of getTrimmedStrings is by purpose different from getStrings().
