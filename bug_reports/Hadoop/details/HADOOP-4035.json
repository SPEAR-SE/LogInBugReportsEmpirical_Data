Therefore the user must be 'charged' the additional usage so that he would hit his limits and capacities sooner.\n\nTo handle the first requirement we obviously have to consider what happens when the job in the front of the scheduler's list does not match the tasktracker's memory availability. We considered the following choices:\n- Move on to consider the next job (this can cause starvation ?)\n- Block, and do not look at any other job, subject of course to other limits etc.\n- Some variant of the first option where we move on to consider the next job some configured number of times, and then block.\nSince it is not very clear what would be the right approach, we decided in favor of option 2, which had the advantage that the system behavior is very, very predictable. Of course, this is open for discussion.\n\nIn order to solve the second requirement, we need to match tasks to slots in the scheduler. One simplifying assumption made to achieve this is mentioned in the comments above. We assume that cluster wide, the default memory per slot is a fixed value, and specified in configuration. Note that this does not preclude heterogenity of cluster nodes. By tweaking the maximum memory on the tasktracker and the number of slots, it is possible to have the same value for all nodes in a cluster.\n\nUsing this configuration variable, it is possible to map tasks to slots as follows:\nslots for a job = tasks for a job * (ceil(memory requested by job / configured memory per slot)). All computation of limits and capacities uses this formula for computing slots used / required etc.\n\nClearly, this issue requires discussion and consensus. It likely will not make 0.19. But we are hoping we can reach a consensus on the approach.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-09-19T15:09:05.551+0000","updated":"2008-09-19T15:09:05.551+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12633620","id":"12633620","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"We need this for 0.19.

So, this assumption is no longer valid. We had this assumption to help us map tasks to slots easily. This in turn was to meet the 2nd requirement I'd put up above: \n\nbq. A user whose job requests for higher resources than usual would decrease the free memory on the tasktracker more than other jobs would. Therefore the user must be 'charged' the additional usage so that he would hit his limits and capacities sooner.\n\nBut as I described above, we would like to keep things simple, and not do this mapping for now. It is a little less fair, but we can try out how it works.\n\nbq. It would be nice if the JT/TT can compute the memory capacity per slot and then schedule tasks accordingly.\n\nHADOOP-3759 laid down the framework for the TT to do this. This JIRA will address the scheduling aspect.\n\nbq. Also, the JT scheduler can generate more affinity of reduce tasks to slots with larger memory-capacity-per-slot because reduce tasks possibly take more memory than map tasks.\n\nWe do not differentiate specifications between memory requirements of map and reduce slots currently.

The cluster will be blocked till the job at the head of the queue is served. This is according to the above proposal.\n\n- Modified TaskTrackerStatus to report free memory for map tasks and for reduce tasks separately, and the total memory available to the TT is distributed between map tasks and reduce tasks in the ratio of their slots. This is needed because we don't want map tasks to use memory allocated to reduce tasks and vice versa.\n\n* Jobs that cannot be run on any TT will be killed on the first heartbeat of any TT.\n    ** Jobs cannot run on any TT for two reasons - 1) no TT in the cluster can serve the job's tasks because of the job's very high memory requirements, 2) there were TTs in the cluster that could run the job, but after the job has started, ALL of these TTs have gone down. We need to kill these jobs because they would otherwise block the whole cluster for ever.\n    ** Maximum size of job that is allowed in the cluster is determined by going through the list of all TTs alive, and seeing the biggest job size that can be supported. Note that this is done on every time assignedTasks is called (i.e. there's a free slot on a TT), but this can be bettered if we have a TaskTrackerListener interface which will tell us precisely when new TTs get added to the cluster or when old TTs expire.\n\n- Added test-cases for both schedulers testing high-RAM job requirements.\n- Changed CapacityTaskScheduler.TaskSchedulingMgr.Type to an enum instead of a string. It's more convenient this way.\n- Changed a couple of log statements so that they are more helpful in debugging.\n\nTestHighRAMJobs needs a major rewrite because of the separate free memory values for map and reduce tasks. It doesn't even compile now; will work on that. Negative values for memory on TT or in job may adversely effect the working of this patch. Will investigate on that and see if it needs some fix.

So, I'd propose that we extend the plugin interface as:\n\n{code}\npublic abstract class MemoryPlugin {\n  public abstract long getVirtualMemorySize(Configuration conf);\n  public abstract long getRamSize(Configuration conf);\n}\n{code}\n\nI'd propose that these values be the real values and that we have a configured offset for both values.\n\nmapred.tasktracker.virtualmemory.reserved (subtracted off of virtual memory)\nmapred.tasktracker.memory.reserved (subtracted off of physical ram, before reporting to JT)\n\nJobs should then define a soft and hard limit for their memory usage. If a task goes over the hard limit, it should be killed immediately.\n\nThe scheduler should only allocate tasks if\n  sum(soft limits of tasks) <= TT ram\n  sum(hard limits of tasks) <= TT virtual memory\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-10-30T20:44:19.618+0000","updated":"2008-10-30T20:44:19.618+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12644267","id":"12644267","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Since the issue of dealing with memory-intensive and badly behaved jobs has spanned more than one Jira, here's the latest summary on the overall proposal (following some offline discussions). \n\nThe problem, as stated originally in HADOOP-3581, is that certain badly-behaved jobs end up using too much memory on a node and can bring down that node. We need to prevent this. A related requirement, as described in HADOOP-3759, is that the system respects different, and legitimate, memory requirements of different jobs.\n\nThere are two independent parts to solving this problem: monitoring and scheduling. Let's look at monitoring first. \n\nMonitoring\n----------------\n\nWe want to ensure that the sum total of virtual memory (VM) usage by all tasks does not go over a limit (call this the _max-VM-per-node_ limit). That's really what brings down a machine. To detect badly behaved jobs, we want to associate a limit with each task (call this the _max-VM-per-task_ limit) such that a task is considered badly behaved if its VM usage goes over this limit. Think of the _max-VM-per-task_ limit as a kill limit. A TT monitors each task for its memory usage (this includes the memory used by the task's descendants). If a task's memory usage goes over its  _max-VM-per-task_ limit, that task is killed. This monitoring has been implemented in HADOOP-3581. In addition, a TT monitors the total memory usage of all tasks spawned by the TT. If this value goes over the _max-VM-per-node_ limit, the TT needs to kill one or more tasks. As a simple solution, the TT can kill one or more tasks that started most recently. This approach has been suggested in HADOOP-4523. Tasks that are killed because they went over their memory limit should be treated as failed, since they violated their contract. Tasks that are killed because the sum total of memory usage was over a limit should be treated as killed, since it's not really their fault. \n\nHow do we specify these limits? \n* *for _max-VM-per-node_*: HADOOP-3581 provides a config option, _mapred.tasktracker.tasks.maxmemory_ , which acts as the _max-VM-per-node_ limit. As per discussions in this Jira, and in HADOOP-4523, this needs to be enhanced.  _mapred.tasktracker.tasks.maxmemory_ should be replaced by _mapred.tasktracker.virtualmemory.reserved_, which indicates an offset (in MB?). _max-VM-per-node_ is then the total VM on the machine, minus this offset. How do we get the total VM on the machine? This can be done by the plugin interface that Owen proposed earlier. \n* *for _max-VM-per-task_*: HADOOP-3759 and HADOOP-4439 define a cluster-wide configuration, _mapred.task.default.maxmemory_, that describes the default maximum VM associated per task. Rename it to _mapred.task.default.maxvm_ for consistency. This is the default _max-VM-per-task_ limit associated with a task. To support jobs that need higher or lower limits, this value can be overridden by individual jobs. A job can set a config value, _mapred.task.maxvm_, which overrides _mapred.task.default.maxvm_ for all tasks for that job. \n* Furthermore, as described earlier in this Jira, we want to prevent users from setting _mapred.task.maxvm_ to an arbitrarily high number and thus gaming the system. To do this, there should be a cluster-wide setting, _mapred.task.limit.maxvm_, that limits the value of _mapred.task.maxvm_. If _mapred.task.maxvm_ is set to a value higher than _mapred.task.limit.maxvm_, the job should not run. Either this check can be done in the JT when a job is submitted, or a scheduler can fail the job if it detects this situation. \n\nNote that the monitoring process can be disabled if _mapred.tasktracker.virtualmemory.reserved_ is not present, or has some default negative value. \n\n\nScheduling\n-----------------\n\nIn order to prevent tasks using too much memory, a scheduler can ensure that it limits the number of tasks running on a node based on how much free memory is available and how much a task needs. The Capacity Scheduler will do this, though we cannot enforce all schedulers to support this feature. As per HADOOP-3759, TTs report, in each heartbeat, how much free VM they have (which is equal to _max-VM-per-node_ minus the sum of _max-VM-per-task_ for each running task). The Capacity Scheduler needs to ensure that: \n# there is enough VM for a new task to run. This it does by comparing the task's requirement (its _max-VM-per-task_ limit) to the free VM available in the TT. \n# there is enough RAM available for a task so that there is not a lot of page swapping and thrashing when tasks run. This is much harder to figure out and it's not even clear what it means to have 'enough RAM available' for a task. A simple proposal, to get us started, is to assume a fraction of the _max-VM-per-task_ limit as the 'RAM limit' for a task. Call this the _max-RAM-per-task_ limit, and think of it as a scheduling limit. For a task to be scheduled, its _max-RAM-per-task_ limit should be less than the total RAM on a TT minus the sum of _max-RAM-per-task_ limits of tasks running on the TT. This also implies that a TT should report its free RAM (the total RAM on the node minus the sum of the _max-RAM-per-task_ limits for each running task. \n\nJust as with the handling of VM, we may want to use a part of the RAM for scheduling TT tasks, and not all of it. If so, we can introduce a config value, _mapred.tasktracker.ram.reserved_, which indicates an offset (in MB?). The amount of RAM available to the TT tasks is then the total RAM on the machine, minus this offset. How do we get the total RAM on the machine? By the same plugin interface through which we obtain total VM. \n\nHow do we specify a task's _max-RAM-per-task_ limit? There is a system-wide default value, _mapred.capacity-scheduler.default.ramlimit_, expressed as a percentage. A task's default _max-RAM-per-task_ limit is equal to the task's _max-VM-per-task_ limit times this value. We may start by setting _mapred.capacity-scheduler.default.ramlimit_ to 50 or 33%. In order to let individual jobs override this default, a job can set a config value, _mapred.task.maxram_, expressed in MB, which then becomes the task's _max-RAM-per-task_ limit. Furthermore, as with VM settings, we want to prevent users from setting _mapred.task.maxram_ to an arbitrarily high number and thus gaming the system. To do this, there should be a cluster-wide setting, _mapred.task.limit.maxram_, that limits the value of _mapred.task.maxram_. If _mapred.task.maxram_ is set to a value higher than _mapred.task.limit.maxram_, the job should not run. Either this check can be done in the JT when a job is submitted, or a scheduler can fail the job if it detects this situation. \n\nThe Capacity Scheduler, when it picks a task to run, will check if both the task's RAM limit and VM limit can be satisfied. If so, the task is given to the TT. If not, nothing is given to the TT (i.e., the cluster blocks till at least one TT has enough memory). We will not block forever because we limit what the task can ask for, and these limits should be set lower than the RAM and VM on each TT. In order to tax users on their job's requirements, we may charge them for what the value they set per task, but for now, there is no penalty associated with the value set for mapred.task.maxmemory by a user for a job. \n\n\nOpen issues\n-------------------\n\nBased on the writeup above, I'm summarizing a few of the open issues (mostly minor): \n# Should the memory-related config values be expressed in MB or GB or KB or just bytes? MB sounds good to me. \n# If a job's specified VM or RAM task limit is higher than the max limit, that job shouldn't be allowed to run. Should the JT reject the job when it is submitted, or should the scheduler do it, by failing the job? The argument for the former is that these limits apply to all schedulers, but then again, they are scheduling-based limits, so they maybe they should be done in each of the schedulers. In the latter case, if a scheduler does not support scheduling based on memory limits, it can just ignore these settings and run the job. So the latter option seems better. \n# Should the Capacity Scheduler use the entire RAM of a TT when making a scheduling decision, or an offset? Given that the RAM fractions are not very precise (they're based on fractions of the VM), an offset doesn't make much of a difference (you could tweak _mapred.capacity-scheduler.default.ramlimit_ to achieve what the offset would), and adds an extra config value. At the same time, part of the RAM is blocked for non-Hadoop stuff, and an offset does make things symmetrical. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-10-31T11:56:37.946+0000","updated":"2008-10-31T11:56:37.946+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12644275","id":"12644275","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"On the scheduling, wouldn't it be nice if all schedulers could use this feature?

The Capacity Scheduler, for example, chooses to block, i.e., it prefers returning nothing to the TT, so that it doesn't starve a job with high-mem requirements. However, another Scheduler might choose to look at the next job, or find some other task to give the TT. \n\nFor this reason, you don't want to put the memory checks in _shouldRunOnTaskTracker()_. Schedulers will behave differently if a TT is blacklisted, versus if the TT doesn't have enough free memory. \n\nNow, you could argue that we can add a new method to JobInProgress, something like isMemoryAvailable(), that decides if the TT has enough free memory. You could call it from obtainNewMapTask() or obtainNewReduceTask(), but again, you'd have to modify what these methods return to the schedulers. If obtainNewMapTask, for example, returns no task, the Scheduler needs to know why. It can behave differently if there was no task to run, or if the TT was blacklisted, or if the TT didn't have any free memory. This will make things messy. \n\nI think there is a lot of scheduling code in the JobInProgress object that needs to be moved into the schedulers. IMO, JobInProgress, and other objects, should expose their data structures, and maybe simpler methods that decide whether a TT is blacklisted or if a TT has enough free memory (methods that return the same response irrespective of schedulers). The various Schedulers should compose these methods as they seem fit. One may check for user quotas before it checks for memory fit (maybe the former is a faster check) while another may do something else. This does imply a fair bit of refactoring, and could be a longer term effort. This will also help share common code across Schedulers. \n\nShort term, I think it's better that each scheduler decide if it wants to support memory checks when scheduling, what it does if the TT does not have enough free mem, and implement that individually. To ease this, maybe you can put the logic of deciding whether a TT has enough free memory for a task in a separate method in JobInProgress, but call that from each Scheduler, not from another JobInProgress method. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-03T04:38:17.864+0000","updated":"2008-11-03T04:38:17.864+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12644657","id":"12644657","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei%40eecs.berkeley.edu","name":"matei@eecs.berkeley.edu","key":"matei@eecs.berkeley.edu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"That makes sense Vivek.

Based on what we've described in the summary, the following three configuration settings are required for the TT to do monitoring: {{mapred.tasktracker.virtualmemory.reserved}} (the offset of total VM on the machine), {{mapred.task.default.maxvm}} (the default for maximum VM per task), and {{mapred.task.limit.maxvm}} (the upper limit on the max VM per task). It is proposed that: \n* if one or more of these three values are missing in the configuration, the TT disables monitoring and logs an appropriate message. \n* At startup, the TT should also make sure that {{mapred.task.default.maxvm}} is not greater than {{mapred.task.limit.maxvm}}. If it is, the TT logs a message and disables monitoring.\n* if all three are present, the TT has enough information to compute the _max-VM-per-task_ limit for each task it runs and can successfully monitor memory usage.\n* Without scheduler support, the TT can get a task whose _max-VM-per-task_ limit is higher than {{mapred.task.limit.maxvm}} (i.e., the user-set value for a job's {{mapred.task.maxvm}} can be higher than {{mapred.task.limit.maxvm}}). In such a case, the TT can choose to fail the task, or it may still run the task while logging the problem. IMO, the former seems too harsh and not something that the TT should possibly decide just based on its settings for monitoring. In the latter case, the TT can still continue monitoring, but may end up killing the wrong task if the sum of VMs used is over the _max-VM-per-node_ limit. I propose we do the latter. \n\nThe TT also needs to report memory information to the schedulers. As per HADOOP-3759, TTs currently report, in each heartbeat, how much free VM they have (which is equal to _max-VM-per-node_ minus the sum of _max-VM-per-task_ for each running task). This makes sense if monitoring is on, and the three necessary VM config values are defined. If they're not, and the TT cannot determine its free VM, what should it report? \n* It can report -1, or some such value, indicating that it cannot compute free VM. \n* If we let schedulers decide how they want to behave in the absence of monitoring, or rather in the absence of the  necessary VM config values being defined, a TT should always report how much total VM (as well as RAM) it has, as well as its value for {{mapred.tasktracker.virtualmemory.reserved}}. \n\nI propose the latter. TTs always report how much VM&RAM they have on their system, and what offset settings they have. They're the only ones who have this information, and this approach gives a lot of flexibility to the schedulers in terms of how to use that information. \n\nWhat about schedulers? The Capacity Scheduler should do the following: \n* If any of the three mandatory VM settings are not set, it should not schedule based on VM or RAM. The value of {{mapred.tasktracker.virtualmemory.reserved}} comes from the TT while the other two can be read by the scheduler from its own config file. \n* If the mandatory VM values are set, as well as the mandatory RAM values ({{mapred.capacity-scheduler.default.ramlimit}}, {{mapred.task.limit.maxram}}), the scheduler uses both VM and RAM settings to schedule, as defined in the earlier [summary|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4035?focusedCommentId=12644267#action_12644267]. \n* If the mandatory VM values are set, but one or more of the mandatory RAM values are not, the scheduler only uses VM values for scheduling. \n\nIt's possible that other schedulers may choose a different algorithm. What's important is that they have all the available information, which they should as per this proposal. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-18T09:20:56.641+0000","updated":"2008-11-18T09:20:56.641+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12649678","id":"12649678","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Initial patch for overall code review.

Here are a few initial comments. I am still to look at scheduling and test cases:\n\nConfiguration:\n- We can now introduce the config variables back into hadoop-defaults.xml\n- I think the variables should be in bytes. As Doug mentioned in comments above, we should move to supporting formats mentioning units like 'KB' in a separate JIRA. When we do that, it makes more sense to say that if no unit is specified, it is the lowest possible value which will be bytes. Hence treating it as bytes here will  support backwards compatibility easily.\n- As I've mentioned above, I still recommend changing the term 'reserved' to 'excluded'. Also, I would recommend consistent names for the variables.. for e.g. we can use pmem and vmem everywhere to indicate physical and virtual memory.\n- In the javadoc for the JobConf variables we should have a note asking readers to refer to the documentation of the scheduler being used to see how it does memory based scheduling.\n\nMonitoring:\n- Can we change the TODO in TaskMemoryManagerThread to remove the \"I'm not comfortable...\" part. We should still explain the alternative that you've mentioned in the comment, though.\n- We should also do a sanity check that the reserved limit is < the total memory, and turn off monitoring if it's not.\n- MemoryCalculatorPlugin requires ASF, Likewise LinuxMemoryCalculatorPlugin","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-11-26T11:53:29.767+0000","updated":"2008-11-26T11:53:29.767+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12650991","id":"12650991","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Comments on the scheduling portion:\n\n- The config value for % of VMEM for RAM should be in capacity scheduler's conf - no ? I am OK leaving it in JobConf as well. But in comments above, it seemed like we were going to define this in the CapacityScheduler config.\n- killJobsWithInvalidRequirements is looking at every single job in the waiting list of jobs in a queue. This would be a very costly operation. I think instead, just before a scheduler considers a job for scheduling, it should check for this, maybe by looking at the count of running maps / reduces to decide if it's looking at it the first time.\n- In getTaskFromJob, we are using a switch on Type being Map/Reduce. We should instead use the pattern of defining an abstract method in TaskSchedulingMgr, and implementing it appropriately for Map/Reduce in the specific type of TaskSchedulingMgr. So, pendingTasks would be an API in TaskSchedulingMgr.\n- If scheduling based on memory is disabled, we are logging at INFO level a statement regarding this. This might get to be too verbose since most jobs aren't going to specify any memory requirements. Switch to a debug level.\n- Should we cache the value for the jobId -> value for running jobs. It will be low on memory and will be more performant maybe if we use a HashMap. Maybe we should consider this after benchmarking the capacity scheduler with and without this patch.\n- We should definitely cache the value of the JobInProgress across computation of reservedPmem and reservedVmem. Actually the lookup is done thrice - twice in getting reservedPmem.\n- Rename usedUpVmem to getVmemReservedForTasks(taskTracker), likewise for usedUpPmem.\n- isSchedulingBasedOnMemoryEnabled - for consistency, rename to isSchedulingBasedOnVmemEnabled\n- It seems a little complicated to have the decision to lookup a job in the queue, or another queue to be in TaskLookupResult. I think a simpler model would be for the TaskLookupResult to only state the *reason* why it did not find a task, and then let callers decide what to do next. This will make it simpler to change scheduling decisions if required later.\n- For better readability, I am thinking if all the memory related scheduling should be moved to a separate class that will be used by the CapacityTaskScheduler, maybe a class like MemoryMatcher. This can have a package private method boolean matchesMemoryRequirements(JobInProgress jip, TaskTrackerStatus ttStatus). Essentially move over everything starting from TTHasEnoughMemoryForJob to this class. In future, if these algorithms seem reusable this class can move out of the capacity scheduler into mapred itself.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-11-26T13:07:21.313+0000","updated":"2008-11-26T13:07:21.313+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12651262","id":"12651262","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Test cases seem fine.

Though this is an unlikely case, in general, I think job recovery shouldn't fail due to one faulty job.\n- InterTrackerProtocol's version should change\n- Some log statements at info level would be too verbose. Recommend moving them to debug level. Including:\n-- initializing jobid statement in JobInProgress\n-- info statement in matchesMemoryRequirements\n- The memory related APIs in JobInProgress need not be public, no ?\n- For the MemoryPlugin, I think we should use the ReflectionUtils mechanism. By default, the config value for this could be null, and this would mean that we would use the operating system specific class. If it is not null, then am object of the appropriate class would be used. Then the class that you are using for testing purposes can move to the test code and need not be in the production code.\n- Properties in the capacity scheduler conf should be defined in capacity-scheduler.xml.template and should be read from the capacity scheduler conf object and not from JT's configuration object.\n- I would suggest a few changes to the names in TaskLookupStatus, such as TASK_FOUND, NO_TASK_IN_JOB, NO_TASK_IN_QUEUE, NO_TASK_MATCHING_MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-12-01T11:32:10.714+0000","updated":"2008-12-01T11:32:10.714+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12652266","id":"12652266","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching new patch.\n\nI had done changes to capacity-scheduler.xml.template earlier itself, somehow that got missed in the patch, adding it now.\n\nThe testcase TestCapacityScheduler.testHighMemoryJobWithInvalidRequirements was failing intermittently because of timing issues with JobInitializationPoller.

This should be verified by looking at the job.xml from JT UI.\n\nThe following currently work only on Linux. mapred.task.limit.maxvmem and mapred.task.limit.maxpmem should be considerably high so as to not interfere with jobs.\n\n- Verifying vmem based scheduling: Start cluster with 1 map and 1 reduce slots on all TTs. First submit a sleep job *job1* with map tasks occupying the whole cluster and only one reduce task. Job's mapred.task.maxvmem should be such that it is less than (TT total vmem - mapred.tasktracker.vmem.reserved). TT total vmem can be calculated by running \"cat /proc/meminfo\" and adding up MemTotal and SwapTotal. While the tasks of this job are still running, submit another sleep job *job2* with one map tasks and reduce tasks occupying the whole cluster with the same mapred.task.maxvmem. This job should be blocked by the cluster till tasks of the first job start finishing. Now submit *job3* identical to job1. This should be blocked till tasks of job2 start finishing.\n\n- Verifying pmem based scheduling: Start cluster with 1 map and 1 reduce slots on all TTs. First submit a sleep job *job1* with map tasks occupying the whole cluster and only one reduce task. Job's mapred.task.maxpmem should be such that it is less than (TT total pmem - mapred.tasktracker.pmem.reserved). TT total pmem can be obtained from the MemTotal field of the output of \"cat /proc/meminfo\". While the tasks of this job are still running, submit another sleep job *job2* with one map tasks and reduce tasks occupying the whole cluster with the same mapred.task.maxpmem. This job should be blocked by the cluster till tasks of the first job start finishing.  Now submit *job3* identical to job1. This should be blocked till tasks of job2 start finishing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-12-10T12:39:47.334+0000","updated":"2008-12-10T12:39:47.334+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403145/comment/12678185","id":"12678185","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chansler","name":"chansler","key":"chansler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Chansler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Edit release note for publication.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chansler","name":"chansler","key":"chansler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Chansler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-03-03T01:28:04.474+0000","updated":"2009-03-03T01:28:04.474+0000"}],"maxResults":70,"total":70,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-4035/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0i9bj:"}}
