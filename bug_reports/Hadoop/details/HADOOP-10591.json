The JIRA talks about \"direct buffers allocated by compression codecs like Gzip (which allocates 2 direct buffers per instance).\"\nI assume this is a reference to {{ZlibDecompressor#compressedDirectBuf}} and {{ZlibDecompressor#uncompressedDirectBuf}}.  Those are buffers inside {{Decompressor}} objects, not buffers inside {{Codec}} objects.\n\n*However*... {{CodecPool}} has a cache for {{Compressor}} and {{Decompressor}} objects, but it seems to be optional, not mandatory.  For example, this code in {{SequenceFile}} is careful to use the {{Decompressor}} cache:\n{code} \n         keyLenDecompressor = CodecPool.getDecompressor(codec);\n          keyLenInFilter = codec.createInputStream(keyLenBuffer, \n                                                   keyLenDecompressor);\n {code}\n\nOn the other hand, there are also one-argument versions of the {{createInputStream}} functions that always create a new {{Decompressor}} (and similar one-argument versions for {{createOutputStream}}).\n\nWhat's the right resolution here?  Is it just to mark the one-argument versions as deprecated and audit HDFS and Hadoop client programs to remove usages?  That certainly seems like a good idea, if we want to cache these {{ByteBuffers}} without adding more caching mechanisms.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
