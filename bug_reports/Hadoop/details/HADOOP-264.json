That will help when we factor the different servers (jobtracker vs. tasktracker) into separate packages (org.apache.hadoop.mapred.job vs org.apache.hadoop.mapred.task ???) and fundamentally the RPC interfaces are _public_ with a capital P.\n\nHowever, the WritableFactory factory is still very useful for serialization and such. I'd propose that classes that want to register do:\n\nstatic void registerWritableFactory() {\n  WritableFactories.setFactory(Foo.class, new WritableFactory () { ... });\n}\n\nstatic {\n  registerWritableFactory();\n}\n\nThen when WritableFactory wants to create an instance of a class, if no factory is registered, it uses reflection to find a \"registerWritableFactory\" method and calls it, if such a method exists. (We can use setAccessable to make it callable, even if it is not public.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-06-01T07:10:23.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-01T07:10:23.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343759/comment/12414185","id":"12414185","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree with Owen that DatanodeRegistration as well as other classes passed through RPC should be public.\nThe counter-patch :-) with only one word added is attached.\nSince it is related to HADOOP-124 making some classes non-public,\nI would return public status to the exceptions as well.\nJust speculating: if RPC would have to convert RemoteException to the real\nexceptions like LeaseExpiredException then it would crash for the same reason.\nWe do not have that mechanism (for converting exceptions) yet, but one day we will.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-06-01T08:40:05.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-01T08:40:05.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343759/comment/12414276","id":"12414276","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here is a patch that matches the standard idiom.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-06-02T01:51:54.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-02T01:51:54.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343759/comment/12414292","id":"12414292","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this.
