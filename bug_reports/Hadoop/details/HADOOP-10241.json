Summary:\n# getfacl now uses {{PathData#toString}} so that it prints either the path's full URI or just the path, depending on whether the user called the command with a full URI or just path.  This behavior is consistent with other commands like ls.\n# getfacl now prints a blank line after every path's ACL.\n# The column formatting of ls now considers the possibility of an extra '+' character on the end of the permission string to calculate padding.\n\nThere are no tests in this patch, because [~vinayrpet] plans to add a comprehensive test suite for the new ACL CLI commands in HDFS-5702.  For now, I tested the changes manually by building a distro from the HDFS-4685 branch.  I also ran {{TestCLI}} and {{TestHDFSCLI}} to verify that there are no regressions.\n\nWhile working on this, I discovered an existing bug in the column formatting for recursive ls.  That's a trunk bug, so I'm not going to attempt to fix it here.
