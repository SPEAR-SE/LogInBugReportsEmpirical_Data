In general, it is user unfriendly and does not do comprehensible error reporting. \nHere's a list of things that can be improved:\n\n1) There isn't a man page that explains the various command line options. We should have one.\n2) Malformed URLs cause a NullPointerException to be thrown with no error message stating what went wrong\n3) Relative paths for the local filesystem are not handled at all\n4) The schema used for HDFS URLs is dfs:// it ought to be hdfs://, 'dfs' is far to general an acronym to use in URLs\n5) If a copy to the local filesystem is specified with a relative path, for instance\n    ./bin/hadoop distcp dfs://localhost:8020/foo.txt foo.txt\nthen the job runs successfully but the file is nowhere to be seen. It looks like this gets copied to the map/reduce jobs\ncurrent working directory\n6) If a copy to a dfs is specified and the namenode cannot be resolved, the job fails with an IOException, no comprehensible error message is printed\n7) If an HTTP URI has a query component, it is disregarded when constructing the destination file name, for instance, if one specifies the following two URLs to be copied in a file list\n  http://myhost.mydomain.com/files.cgi?n=/logs/foo.txt\n  http://myhost.myfomain.com/files.cgi?n=/logs/bar.txt\n\na single file called 'files.cgi' is created and is overwritten by one or both source files, it's not clear which. The destination\npath name should be constructed in the way that 'wget' does it, using the filename+query part of the URL, escaping characters as necessary.\n\n8) It looks like if a list of URLs is specified in a file distcp runs a separate map reduce job for each entry in the file, why?\nSeems like one could do a straight copy for local files since the task needs to run locally, followed by a single MR job that\ncopies HDFS and http URLs\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"107016","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"distcp defeciencies and bugs","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348931/comment/12519117","id":"12519117","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HADOP-1569 attempts to resolve these as follows:\n\n1) Usage updated to include explanation of options\n2) URIs are handled by the FileSystem classes\n3) Relative paths are interpreted using whatever is defined in the config; if it's the local filesystem, it should work\n4) This was fixed in HADOOP-564\n5) In the case above, the file is copied to the user's home directory.
