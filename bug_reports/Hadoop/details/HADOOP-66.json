On the other hand, an application ought to be able to control the buffering strategy to some extent. Most stream implementations have a setBufferSize() or equivalent method that allow programmers to do this. The default buffer size is reasonably small so that many files can be opened without worrying too much about buffering.\n\nBesides the issues with filling up /tmp (32MB is a pretty large chunk to be writing there), it's unclear that the scheme adds a lot of value, it may even be detrimental. If a connection to a Datanode fails then why not try to recover by re-connecting and throw an exception if that fails. If it's just the connection that has failed the client should be able to reconnect pretty easily. If the Datanode is down for the count the odds are low (or are they?) that it'll come back by the time the client finishes writing the block and the write will fail anyway, so why write to a temp file. If it's common for Datanodes to bounce and come back then Datanode stability is an problem that we should be working on. In that case, the temp file is only a workaround and not a real solution, it might even be masking the problem in many cases.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-03-08T04:14:35.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-08T04:14:35.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329861/comment/12369308","id":"12369308","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"It's hard to resume writing a block when a connection fails, since you don't know how much of the previous write succeeded.  Currently the block is streamed over TCP connections.  We could instead write it as a series of length-prefixed buffers, and query the remote datanode on reconnect about which buffers it had recieved, etc.  But that seems like reinventing a lot of TCP.\n\nIf the datanode goes down then currently the entire block is in a temp file so that it can instead be written to a different datanode.  Thus if datanodes die during, e.g., a reduce, then the reduce task does not have to restart.  But if reduce tasks are running on the same pool of machines as datanodes, then, when a node fails, some reduce tasks will need to be restarted anyway.  So I agree that this may not be helping us much.

For each block a client writes there will be memory allocated containing the path name to the temporary file that cannot be gc'd.

But writing 1M blocks means writing 32TB from a single JVM, which would take around a month (at current dfs speeds).
