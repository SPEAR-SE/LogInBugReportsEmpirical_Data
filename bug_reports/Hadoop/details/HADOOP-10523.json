In your scenarios, I'd say the user shouldn't be canceling tokens that have been submitted with a job unless they are trying to pre-maturely abort the job.  I know that oozie tokens aren't cancelled which is unfortunate.  I think last year I posted a patch that would cancel after all jobs using the tokens completed but it ran into roadblocks.  I need to lookup and revisit that jira.\n\nIn the two suggested approach, I'm not sure how they would be implemented if I understand them correctly.  For #1, the RM can't really test the validity/existence of a token w/o issuing a renew or cancel and catching the exception.  For #2, the RM still won't know that the token was externally cancelled, and the issuing service like the NN must cache cancelled tokens and periodically clean the cache.  Due to the complexity, I'd be reluctant to endorse the approach.  I'd also be reluctant to not return errors to a client - instead returning a token already cancelled instead of token doesn't exist exception.\n\nI think the better solution is for users to not cancel tokens.  Tokens are supposed to be an \"invisible\" implementation detail of job submission and thus not require user manipulation.

Their secret manager periodically purges their own tokens and won't ever emit the exception trace in the description.  A client, which is what the RM is while renewing on behalf of the job, will receive an exception for an already cancelled token if something else cancelled it.\n\nI should have asked before where the log snippet is from?
