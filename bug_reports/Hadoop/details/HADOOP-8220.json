I was testing it via the \"integration test\", but you're right that adding to the unit tests makes sense too.\n\nbq. How does NPE occur when the elector makes sure the client is recreated upon rejoining the election? Which zkClient are you talking about?\n\nThe NPE occurred in the previous code because we had the following sequence:\n- createNode succeeded\n- called ZKFC becomeActive() callback\n-- becomeActive() throws exception\n-- ZKFC had a catch() clause which called quitElection () (it turned out this wasn't the right behavior)\n--- quitElection() nulled out zkClient\n- ActiveStandbyElector called monitorNode(), which tried to use zkClient, which had just been nulled out.\n\nThe new behavior avoids this, since the error handling patch is in ActiveStandbyElector itself. This makes it easier to get the right semantics.\n\nbq. What is the purpose of adding the sleep? Could you please elaborate?\n\nWithout the sleep, it will do a tight loop retrying to become active. This generates a lot of log spew and has little actual benefit.

For example, NN might decide that it cannot become active since it does not have access to the resources to become active. We would need to handle these two return values. If the return value is false, FC will give up the ephemeral znode for one \"timeout\" iteration to allow other NN's FC to take over the znode.\n\n2. becomeActive() should be protected by a timeout also.

Exceptions are generally preferred for cases like this -- since we have to handle the error condition regardless of whether it's a usual error or whether it was something like a NPE or other truly exceptional condition. So even with a boolean return type, we'd need a try/catch clause. Does that make sense? (I also had originally made it return boolean but then changed it to an exception)\n\nbq. I did not understand where the tight loop is? Do you mean (Elector gets lock<->ZKFC fails to becomes active)?\nYep. In my test I saw that the standby would retry in a tight loop like that:\n# Succeed in getting lock\n# Call becomeActive()\n# drop ZK session (lock disappears)\n# reconnect to ZK\n# Goto 1\n\nI simply inserted a sleep between dropping the connection and reconnecting. This gives the old active a better chance to become active again (or if there is a third node in the future, it would have a chance to take the lock). In the future we may want to add some random jitter and exponential backoff, but at this point let's keep it simple.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-03-27T21:11:23.970+0000","updated":"2012-03-27T21:11:23.970+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548239/comment/13239976","id":"13239976","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Do you mean?\n1.
