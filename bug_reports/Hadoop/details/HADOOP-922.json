The amount of data cached by the receiving size of the TCP connection could possibly depend on the latency of transfer and the amount of memory available to the sender and received.\n\nBy default, the TCP sending window size is usually 128KB and receiving windows size is 4MB. I propose that I change the above patch to trigger the optmization only if the skip length is <= 128KB.
