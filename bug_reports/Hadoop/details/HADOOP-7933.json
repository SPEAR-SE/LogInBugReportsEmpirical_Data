Credentials serializes these tokens using the service name for the actual namenodes. Effectively, tokens are not cached for viewfs (some more details in MR 3529). Affects any job which uses the TokenCache in tasks along with viewfs (some Pig jobs).\n\nTalk to Jitendra about this, some options\n1. Change Credentials.getAllTokens to return the key, instead of just a token list (associate the viewfs canonical name with a token in credentials)\n2. Have viewfs issue a fake token.\nBoth of these would allow for a single viewfs configuration only.\n3. An additional API in FileSystem - something like getDelegationTokens(String renewer, Credentials credentials) - which would check the credentials object before making token requests to the actual namenode.\n4. An additional API in FileSystem - getCanonicalServiceNames - similar to getDelegationTokens, which would return service names for the actual namenodes. TokenCache/Credentials can work using this list.\n5. have getDelegationTokens check the current UGI - and fetch tokens only if they don't exist.\n\nHave a quick patch for 3, along with associated MR

This forces the caller of {{getDelegationTokens(renewer,creds)}} to use a {{Credentials}} object when ideally the caller should be able to use any object to store the tokens.  The method returns a generic {{List}}, so maybe take a generic {{Set}}?  (It appears {{Credentials}} was selected for convenience since that's what the MR's {{TokenCache}} uses internally?)\n\nWould it be reasonable to populate the {{Credentials/Set}} directly?  Ie. {{ViewFileSystem}} takes a set of existing tokens, then returns the subset of tokens for its mounts that are not already in the existing tokens.  Then the new tokens are added right back into the existing tokens, loop again.\n\nI'm concerned that this appears to be creating a cross-component dependency whereby {{ViewFileSystem}} it required to \"assume\" how MR's {{TokenCache}} will want the tokens keyed within its {{Credentials}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-01-03T19:10:21.962+0000","updated":"2012-01-03T19:10:21.962+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12534861/comment/13178941","id":"13178941","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Darn, missed the commit by minutes.
