On the Hadoop project, we keep that directory inside of the working directory of the source checkout (due to legacy reasons that [~aw] has mentioned a few times). As a start-up step, Yetus cleans up the local git working directory to ensure that it is testing the patch against the then-current version of whatever relevant branch the patch is for.\n\nOn most hadoop branches, .gitignore ensure that git doesn't mess with the {{patchprocess}} directory when this cleanup is happening. On branch-2.7, the ignore directive is missing and so the \"clean up git\" step wipes out the in-progress log files that Yetus expects to keep writing to. This leads to the failures you've seen.\n\nI'm happy to update my patch for whatever review feedback you have, but a blind copy seems like the fastest way to builds working again. {{.gitignore}}ing files that don't exist and won't be created by the build process on a particular branch does no harm, after all.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=busbey","name":"busbey","key":"busbey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233"},"displayName":"Sean

He's just saying he's not willing to spend his time as a volunteer working on a particular branch, a position he's held consistently about branch-2 derivatives for a long time. Frankly, I was pretty surprised when he was willing to spend time on this JIRA at all. HADOOP-11746 is entirely irrelevant to our current issue. The result of it was a version of the precommit testing that we've since replaced in Hadoop like 2 or 3 time over.\n\nI _am_ willing to spend my time as a volunteer chasing this down, because I personally try to push folks towards the 2.7.z releases. I only ask that you try to be a little more patient in your phrasing. I tend to be bursty in Hadoop because my attention is often elsewhere, so I have no way to know what the condition of the ASF build server was when you observed things working on branch-2.7. I can help chase down specific failures, but a different JIRA that tracks examples will be more helpful than an extended conversation on an issue we've already solved.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=busbey","name":"busbey","key":"busbey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233"},"displayName":"Sean Busbey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-07-28T02:32:31.776+0000","updated":"2017-07-28T02:33:09.493+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13090113/comment/16108423","id":"16108423","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"We can use HADOOP-14689 for further fixing the build.
