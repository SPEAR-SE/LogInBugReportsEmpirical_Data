As it extends {{java.io.OutputStream}}, the real concurrency semantics should be defined there. And, looking at that openjdk code, it appears to be \"no guarantees\". HBase have some expectations that may already be invalid.\n# We've also seen from HDFS-6735 that HBase likes non-blocking reads for performance enhancements...they clearly have different/needs expectations. HBASE-8722 is where someone proposed writing them down. If you look at HDFS-6735 we had to spend a lot of time thinking about & looking at what is going on, trying to understand the implicit concurrency guarantees of HDFS & the expectations of code as seen by IDE-based scans for usage.\n# If you are proposing we define those concurrency semantics more strictly, in the filesystem specification and the code that would be great: someone did need to sit down and define the APIs as based on HDFS behaviour. This is not something we can rush into in the last minute though. I also worry about the proposed culling of +10 sync blocks, especially on the basis that \"they appear to be unneeded\". That's the kind of question that needs to be answered by looking at the git/svn history of those lines & correlating them with past JIRAs, before doing what could potentially cause problems. And, at write() time, that means data-loss/corruption problems beyond just encrypted data.\n\nShort term? I'd say note the concurrency expectations of HBase and an output stream & come up with a change for the CryptoOutputStream which implements consistent concurrency semantics. The runup to a release is not the time to change something so foundational.\n\nLonger term? Decide what the concurrency guarantees should be, scan through the core code stack to identify risky uses of flush() (actually I'd add log/count to DFSOutputStream & see if we could detect & log re-entrant ops across threads: flush/write overlap., flush/flush concurrency, hflush+write, ...). As with HADOOP-9361, HDFS defines the defacto semantics, but its the uses of that code which really set the expectations of applications. Here we've just found HBases\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve
