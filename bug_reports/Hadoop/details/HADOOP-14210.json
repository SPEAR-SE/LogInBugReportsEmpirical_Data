When I stat a mount point, it's a directory, not a symlink.\n\nSymlinks are currently not enabled in HDFS, so no downstream apps have ever encountered a symlink. Again looking at Unix as a guide, applications still don't handle symlinks correctly from a correctness or security POV after decades of existence. So, if we can roll out VFS without requiring apps to understand symlinks, I'd be happy.\n\nA lot of our apps use HDFS APIs like the shell or {{FileSystem#listFiles}}. We'd want these to work the same way regardless of how the VFS is sharded, for transparency.\n\nCan we dredge up any of the initial motivations from the VFS design docs or JIRA?\n\nGiven that existing FSs can already span to 100s of millions of files, clients need to handle high scale no matter what. For the CLI ls command, I'm hoping we're using the iterator-based listing methods, as well as providing a mode that doesn't try to align columns (which requires buffering all the output).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-24T01:21:32.138+0000","updated":"2017-03-24T01:21:32.138+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12830173/comment/16396260","id":"16396260","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanishakoneru","name":"hanishakoneru","key":"hanishakoneru","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hanisha Koneru","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"It would be good to have {{-ls -R}} operation on ViewFs to work as it would on Unix. But I do have a concern/ question about recursively listing files/ directories in ViewFs. How are we handling the scenario where one mount target is a parent of another mount target. For example, in the config below, if we recursively list the files/ directories under viewFs root, then the files/ directories under {{/user}} will be listed twice (once for {{/nn1}} and once for {{/user}}). I think this would be a bad experience for users.\r\n{code:java}\r\nfs.defaultFS = viewfs:///\r\n\r\nfs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./nn1 = hdfs://ns1/\r\n\r\nfs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./user = hdfs://ns1/user/\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n \r\n\r\nOne option is to duplicate the behavior as is for symlinks in Unix. In Unix, {{ls -R}} does not list the contents of a symlink's target. We need to add \"*{{-L | --dereference}}*\" option to recursively list contents of symlinks along with directories.\r\n We can copy this behaviour in ViewFs. That is, we recursively list the contents of mount's target filesystem only when {{-ls -R}} is called with the option {{-L}}. This would still list the contents of \\{{/user}} twice for the scenario mentioned above, but I think that should be fine. \r\n\r\nWould love to hear thoughts on this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hanishakoneru","name":"hanishakoneru","key":"hanishakoneru","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hanisha Koneru","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-03-12T23:52:44.989+0000","updated":"2018-03-12T23:52:44.989+0000"}],"maxResults":7,"total":7,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-14210/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2es93:"}}
