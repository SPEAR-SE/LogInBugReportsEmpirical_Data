Main cause will be programmer error but I suppose it could happen during normal processing. Whichever, would be grand if hadoop was better able to deal.\n\nMy map task completed 'successfully' but because I had started threads inside in my task that were not set to be of daemon type that under certain circumstances were left running,  my child stuck around after reporting 'done' -- the JVM wouldn't go down while non-daemon threads still running.  After ten minutes, TT steps in,  kills the child and does cleanup of the successful output.
