We can make the client bail out early in {{RetryInvocationHandler}} before it even consults {{RetryPolicies}}.\n\nAnother potential place of hang is after making the call. In {{Client#call()}}, when waiting for a response, it catches {{InterruptedException}} to sets a local variable and continues to wait for a response. The connection thread has to either get a response or get shutdown and notify the client for it to exit the loop. It allows graceful termination, but may cause extra delay or hang during shutdown.
