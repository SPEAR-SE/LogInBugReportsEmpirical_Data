Make the namenode exit when a system thread encounters a RuntimeException. Have another deamon that monitors HDFS processes and restarts them if they die.\n\n2. Make the namenode fall into safemode when a system thread encounters a runtime exception.\n\n3. Make the namenode exit when a system thread encounters a RuntimeException.

I'd simply add a loop to NameNode.main() that creates and starts a new NameNode when the existing namenode exits unexpectedly.  We should only restart if it's stopping due to an error, and not due to an explicit call to stop().  So perhaps NameNode#join() could return a boolean indicating whether it's exiting normally or should be restarted, and the catch in the ReplicationMonitor should call a NameNode method to trigger that kind of exit.

But, if the namenode auto-restarts slowly, the admin can always kill & restart it manually, so I don't see the harm in it attempting to auto-restart.  Restarting slowly isn't worse than being down, is it?  So my instinct would be to try auto-restarting.
