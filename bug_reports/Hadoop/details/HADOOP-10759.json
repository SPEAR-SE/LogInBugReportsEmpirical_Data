Java does a good job on calculate initial heap size, and it will use 1/4th of machine memory up to 1GB.  See:\n\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/gc-tuning-6-140523.html#par_gc.ergonomics.default_size\n\nTherefore, without this being specified, it may use up to 1GB for heap on machine that has greater than 4GB physical memory.  However, for smaller machine such as a virtual machine, it would be nicer if it can scale dynamically.  Another benefit of removing this hard coded value is to make sure that the Hadoop command line is not capped to 1GB for trivial operation such as GetConf, or dfs client operation to reduce memory starvation in executing too many cli operations in parallel to map reduce tasks. We have notice that while the machine may already hand out most memory to map reduce tasks, and some amount of cli command happens in parallel, may trigger excessively allocating memory and causes JVMs to aggressively running garbage collection and increases chances of dead lock in highly fragmented memory pages.  It is somewhat a serious bug that I think it is worth while to be included in 2.x releases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric

But it's still a feature, not a bug fix, and it's still incompatible with the existing expectations of the system.  It breaks the principal of least surprise.... so I'm still -1 for branch-2.\n\nFor trunk, this patch is very much incomplete if we want to change how this works:\n* All hard-coded values to JAVA_HEAP_MAX need to be found and removed (hadoop-config.sh, yarn, yarn-env.sh)\n* The content in hadoop-env.sh needs to get rewritten\n* The content in yarn-env.sh needs to get rewritten (and a good chunk removed) ... oh yarn, you make our lives so hard by doing the wrong thing 90% of the time... :(  On the plus side, it perfectly demonstrates my point about the confusion with having two vars that do the same thing....\n\nSo even with this change, JAVA_HEAP_MAX really shouldn't be exposed to users.  It's a terrible variable name (there is no JAVA_HEAP_MIN which sets Xms, for example).  It also doesn't begin with HADOOP_ which means it could conflict with other software.\n\nHADOOP_HEAPSIZE has really awful semantics (forced into m's) and one really should be able to specify your own unit.  But my concern is that it might be \"too late\" to fix it unless we're very willing to break the universe.  That would probably be a common-dev@ level decision.  (My own vote would be yes, let's break users on this one, because everyone I've ever talked to hates the semantics here too.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2014-08-07T13:00:19.304+0000","updated":"2014-08-07T13:00:19.304+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12724032/comment/14089314","id":"14089314","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"After a bit more thinking about this idea, I have a proposal to make that I think will accomplish the ultimate goal of this JIRA while also giving the users much more control than they have now (a win-win):\n\n# We introduce HADOOP_HEAPSIZE_MAX and HADOOP_HEAPSIZE_MIN, both default to empty.
