Another patch coming up...\n\n> I'm pretty sure there are some contexts where the JobTracker is not locked. I'll take a look.\nI've run Devaraj through the whole synchronization logic here, basically the functions assume that the JobTracker is locked on entry (as in the javadoc) and happens so since most of the calls emanate from\n\npublic synchronized JobTracker.heartbeat() -> JobTracker.processHeartbeat() -> JobTracker.updateTaskStatuses\n\nI'd definitely appreciate another closer look at this...
