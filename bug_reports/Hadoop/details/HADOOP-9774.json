Then after listStatus() the path is changed to absolute path, hive failed to find the path in its map reduce job.\n\nYou'll see the following exception:\n[junit] java.io.IOException: cannot find dir = pfile:/E:/GitHub/hive-monarch/build/ql/test/data/warehouse/src/kv1.txt in pathToPartitionInfo: [pfile:/GitHub/hive-monarch/build/ql/test/data/warehouse/src]\n[junit] \tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveFileFormatUtils.getPartitionDescFromPathRecursively(HiveFileFormatUtils.java:298)\n\n\nThis problem is introduced by this JIRA:\nHADOOP-8962\n\nPrior to the fix for HADOOP-8962 (merged in 0.23.5), the resulting paths are relative paths if the parent paths are relative, e.g., [\"file:///mydata/t1.txt\", \"file:///mydata/t2.txt\"...]\n\nThis behavior change is a side effect of the fix in HADOOP-8962, not an intended change. The resulting behavior, even though is legitimate from a function point of view, break consistency from the caller's point of view.

The reason why I didn't add a unit test is because this behavior cannot be tested on Linux. I'm reusing HADOOP-8962's unit test case to verify that this change doesn't break on Linux.\nPlease include a unittest that catches the issue on Windows, otherwise, some other change could break this functionality again.\n\n\nbq. I think the behavior of RawLocalFileSystem.listStatus() will diverge with this patch, which is not a very good practice.\nI share the same concern.  Now that we realized that HADOOP-8962 does not work in all scenarios I'd like to consider other options first. I think we can solve this problem in Path properly. There is a comment in HADOOP-8962 stating that changing Path is scary (what I have to agree with), but at this point, I'd rather go with a clean fix. Others, please comment if you agree.\n\nThe root cause of the problem for HADOOP-8962 is actually in the Path(String, String) constructor, coming from the internal Path URI parsing logic. I don't think we want to change the parsing logic as that would be really risky. What we can do is change the constructor:\n{code}\n  public Path(String parent, String child) {\n    this(new Path(parent), new Path(child));\n  }\n{code}\nnot to create a Path() object directly out of a child path string, but to first create an URI (with assumption that child string is just a path portion of the URI), and then construct the child Path object using this URI. One gotcha to keep in mind is the URI encoding/decoding of escape chars. Otherwise, I think this will work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-07-28T18:16:26.675+0000","updated":"2013-07-28T18:16:26.675+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659946/comment/13722022","id":"13722022","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"bq. with assumption that child string is just a path portion of the URI\nActually, looking at the documentation for [URI resolution|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URI.html#resolve(java.lang.String)], above sentence, although possibly the right thing to do, would be an incompatible change. \n\nWouldn't the following solve both this and problem from HADOOP-8962:\n{code}\nresults[j] = getFileStatus(new Path(f, new Path(null, null, names[i])));\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-07-28T18:30:44.492+0000","updated":"2013-07-28T18:30:44.492+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659946/comment/13722814","id":"13722814","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shanyu","name":"shanyu","key":"shanyu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"shanyu zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Ivan for chiming in.

I also spent some time looking at the problem and it seems to be more complex than I initially thought.\n\nI'll try to respond by later in the evening today with my proposal for the fix. My current line of though is the following:\n - If we revert things to before HADOOP-8962 fix we have a problem where file names with colon are not interpreted the way we want them to be. Basically \"a:b\" will result in an URI with scheme \"a\". This behavior is by design and we shouldn't try to change it.\n - The question is now how to address the problem from HADOOP-8962. One approach is to encode URI special characters in the given file name before it is passed to Path. This \"seems\" like the right thing to do, but I’ll have to look into it a bit more. It is also not obvious what would encoding mean for the rest of Hadoop codebase (i.e. do we just do a targeted fix for the RLFS scenario?).\n\n\nAnother possibly relevant factor is that HDFS does not allow colon character in the file name. This means that supporting colon in RLFS does not help in scenarios where we copy HDFS context to RLFS and vice versa. \n\nIn parallel feel free to share your thoughts.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-07-30T18:12:05.125+0000","updated":"2013-07-30T18:12:05.125+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659946/comment/13724419","id":"13724419","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shanyu","name":"shanyu","key":"shanyu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"shanyu zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Ivan for your suggestions. You are right, the Path(String parent, String child) constructor is not designed to accept ONLY relative path in child. There are some unit test cases where child is absolution path like \"file:/mydata\". My previous patch failed those cases.\n\nSo basically we cannot support file names with colon in child parameter in constructor Path(String parent, String child). This is because a string like \"file:/\" can be interpret either as a scheme or a file named \"file:\".\n\nThat being said, we can still use the trick Ivan mentioned - the Path(String scheme, String authority, String path) constructor. If we expect the path to contain colon, then we should use this explicit constructor to avoid ambiguity. So we can try adding \"./\" to the path string in this constructor to deal with colon character.\n\nAttached is a new patch to implement this idea.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shanyu","name":"shanyu","key":"shanyu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"shanyu zhao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-30T20:59:47.383+0000","updated":"2013-07-30T20:59:47.383+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12659946/comment/13724454","id":"13724454","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
