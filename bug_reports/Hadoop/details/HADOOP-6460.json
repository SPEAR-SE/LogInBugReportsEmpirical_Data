It grows doubling every time. Any large response results in growth of this buffer, resulting in large heap usage. This memory is never reclaimed by GC. \n\nOn namenode, the following RPC calls have huge impact on the buffer growth:\n# publi# BlocksWithLocations NameNodeProtocol.getBlocks(DatanodeInfo datanode, long size)\n# public DatanodeInfo[] ClientProtocol.getDatanodeReport(FSConstants.DatanodeReportType type)\n# public FileStatus[] ClientProtocol.getListing(String src)\n\nOf this, I think getBlocks() is the issue. On production clusters I saw this heap growing to 167MB. This does not explain buffers growing to the size of 167MB (byte[] grew to as big as 167772160 entries). Given this kind of large responses, we should relinquish the old buffer and create a new one, when ever the response buffer grows to a large size and let the old buffer garbage collected. This is safe, as currently the buffer is used as intermediate storage for serializing the response.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-12-21T23:12:52.168+0000","updated":"2009-12-21T23:12:52.168+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443842/comment/12793409","id":"12793409","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The attached patch:\n# Introduces shrinkable byte array stream to be used by the handler for serializing response.

As regards to printing the warning, would we be hitting response sizes of more than 1MB very often? In that case the logic of resetting the buffer back to 10240 does not seem like a good idea. Hoping that log would give a good idea about the size of the buffer for large responses and based on that we could make additional tweaks.\n\nIn the case of NN, the log is is fine. Not sure if HBase clients still fetch data over RPCs those servers could see a lot warnings with some tables.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-12-23T06:25:56.154+0000","updated":"2009-12-23T06:25:56.154+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443842/comment/12793964","id":"12793964","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"New patch","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-12-23T07:45:34.334+0000","updated":"2009-12-23T07:45:34.334+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443842/comment/12793967","id":"12793967","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
