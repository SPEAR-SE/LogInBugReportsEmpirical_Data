I don't yet see this warranting an incompatible change.\n\nSome ways to deal with this that would not involve incompatible changes might be:\n - use a WeakHashMap for the cache and close FileSystem instances in a finalize() method.\n - remove the cache, and allocate a new FileSystem instance per call to getFileSystem().\n\nThe latter would be cleanest.  I wonder if it would have much performance impact?  Those few cases where it does should be easy to fix.\n\nBut overall I still see this as a non-problem for now.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-11-24T22:49:07.589+0000","updated":"2008-11-24T22:49:07.589+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408452/comment/12677254","id":"12677254","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I would like to resurrect the discussion on this issue.\n\nI am in the process of integrating a distributed log aggregation service called Scribe (http://developers.facebook.com/scribe/) to be able to store directly into HDFS. The scribe server invokes HDFS APIs using libhdfs. Scribe is a multi-threaded software module, each thread should be able to independently open files from different hdfs clusters. It will be very convenient for scribe to be able to invoke hdfsConnect() just before every time a file is opened. Similarly, after closing a file, it would invoke hdfsdisConnect(). This reduces complexity in the scribe-hdfs integration to a large extent. However, with the current caching behaviour of FileSystem.get(), the above is not possible. Scribe has to maintain reference counts for each open and understand the caching behaviour of FileSystem objects.\n\nI would like to implement the second option that Doug has suggested, i.e. \"remove the cache, and allocate a new FileSystem instance per call to getFileSystem()\". However, this will be an incompatible change, especially because pre-existing applications might be rely on this singular behavour to elegantly open file systems. To ensure than existing implementations do not break, we can introduce a new method FileSystem.getNewFileSystem() that skips the CACHE and allocates a new FileSystem object every time it is invoked.  \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-02-27T05:55:37.108+0000","updated":"2009-02-27T05:55:37.108+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408452/comment/12677516","id":"12677516","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Here is a small patch that introduces FileSystem.getUnique() to return a unique file system object per invocation.

It is just that 0.20 is an \"unreleased\" branch.\n\n> Also, what's the use case for newInstanceLocal()? \n\nAn application that uses newInstance() method assumes that a new filesystem object is created (irrespective of the path that is being passed in). It does not matter whether it is a local path or a hdfs path. The application logic does not have to change depending on the FileSystem that it is trying to access. So, I would like to keep the newInstanceLocal() method.
