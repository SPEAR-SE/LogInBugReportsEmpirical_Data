And why are we trying to guess the usage pattern of the data based off of a hard coded read size of 256k?\n\nIt seems to me that there are other HDFS use cases that are not random reads of < 256K, like the distributed cache or who knows what in the future with MRV2 where we want to keep the data cached in memory on the data node if possible.\n\nI would much rather see an optional parameter to the open API for flags like O_DIRECT.  Then when HDFS talks to the data node it can also pass that information off to it when initiating a block read.  That way the application can indicate how it expects to use the data.  MAPREDCUE can say this is a streaming read where we will probably never reread the data again and it can also say this is reading a file from the distributed cache and 900 others are going to read this same file so keep it in memory if possible.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-10-03T18:08:28.427+0000","updated":"2011-10-03T18:08:28.427+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525550/comment/13119455","id":"13119455","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I agree with all of the above - I did the lame 256KB heuristic here because adding an open API flag would be impossible while keeping it protocol compatible.

I looked into the BlockSender code and there seems to be an error in the fadvise call:\n\nNativeIO.posixFadviseIfPossible(blockInFd, lastCacheDropOffset, offset - 1024, NativeIO.POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED);\n\nshould be\n\nNativeIO.posixFadviseIfPossible(blockInFd, lastCacheDropOffset, offset - lastCacheDropOffset, NativeIO.POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED);\n\nI am not sure what the \"- 1024\" is for, but in any case that parameter should be the length instead of an offset. Having said that, this is not what is causing the 8MB to stay in the page cache. I tried changing the fadvise call to:\n\nNativeIO.posixFadviseIfPossible(blockInFd, 0, offset, NativeIO.POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED); // Yes, I know, this is redundant since it is being called frequently\n\nand that reduced the number of pages in the cache from 8MB to a varying value between 0-2MB.\n\nI looked into what pages were remaining in the cache and it seems that a few random pages are staying every time, plus some pages at the end.\n\nNathan (Roberts) and I looked through this issue and thought the kernel's read ahead mechanism may be preventing some pages from being removed from the page cache so we changed the POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL to POSIX_FADV_RANDOM and that seemed to make things better in the sense that now I am only seeing very little pages staying around (around 4-8 4KB pages in the latests tests I ran today). Having said that, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL is of course what we should be using. Any ideas on how to make all the fadvised (DONT_NEED) pages to go away? We are puzzled on why those last few pages seem to hang around, specially since I modified the fadvise calls to go from offset 0 every time; in other words, we are repeatedly telling the kernel to remove those pages and still a few manage to stay around. I'll keep looking into this issue and will try to get some performance numbers but would love to have the code working as expected before doing the tests.\n\nBTW, I did not look into the BlockReceiver code; once BlockSender is working as expected I'll look into it.\n\nI hope that what I wrote makes sense; if something is not clear I'll be happy to explain the issue in more detail.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cabad","name":"cabad","key":"cabad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Cristina L.

I believe the reason is due to the way the socket buffers inside the kernel keep track of the data that needs to be sent. It's basically just a reference to the page cache page. Therefore, if the data has not actually left the box when the fadvise is called, the references are still there so the pages cannot  be invalidated. I tried this with a small native app and a 128MB file, and sure enough everything except for the first few pages stayed in the page cache. \n\nI can't immediately think of a surefire way around this. We could just call fadvise once at close and just live with the fact that everything still buffered at the time won't be affected. We could do what Cristina was doing and always call fadvise with offset of 0 so that we try to invalidate pages multiple times. We could call the fadvise asynchronously after a second or so.

The default is 128K, but it can be upped significantly which helps quite a bit on sequential reads to SATA drives.  Additionally, the 'deadline' scheduler is better at sequential throughput under contention.  I wonder how much of your manual read-ahead is just compensating for the poor OS defaults?  In other applications, I maximized read speeds (and reduced CPU use) by using small read buffers in Java (32KB) and large Linux read-ahead settings.\n\nAdditionaly, I always set up a separate file system for M/R temp space away from HDFS.  The HDFS one is tuned for sequential reads and fast flush from OS buffers to disk, with the deadline scheduler.  The temp space is tuned to delay flush to disk for up to 60 seconds (small jobs don't even make it to disk this way), and uses the CFQ scheduler.\n\nThis combination reduced the time of many of our jobs significantly (CDH2 and CDH3) -- especially job chains with many small tasks mixed in.\n\nThe Linux tuning parameters that have a big effect on disk performance and pagecache behavior are:\nvm.dirty_ratio\nvm.dirty_background_ratio\nswappiness\nreadahead (e.g. blockdev --setra 4096 /dev/sda)\next4 also has inode_readahead_blks=n and commit=nrsec\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=scott_carey","name":"scott_carey","key":"scott_carey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Carey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-07T08:30:29.532+0000","updated":"2011-10-07T08:30:29.532+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525550/comment/13122796","id":"13122796","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Scott, I too suspect that linux fs parameter tuning may yield a large(r) boost.
