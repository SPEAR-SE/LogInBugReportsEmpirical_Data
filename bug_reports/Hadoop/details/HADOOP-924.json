Two tasks assigned to a TT were never rescheduled although the TT was lost and this led to the job getting stuck forever. This TT was assigned lots of tasks and everyone got rescheduled except these two. Here are the relevant log messages (below the JT logs has been split into two parts to bring out the sequence of events) for one of the tasks.\n\nJT log:\n---------\n2007-01-24 10:53:09,564 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobInProgress: Choosing normal task tip_0001_m_020699\n2007-01-24 10:53:09,564 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker: Adding task 'task_0001_m_020699_0' to tip tip_0001_m_020699, for tracker 'foo.com:7020'\n\nTT log:\n---------\n2007-01-24 10:53:09,564 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskTracker: LaunchTaskAction: task_0001_m_020699_0\n2007-01-24 10:53:12,180 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskTracker: task_0001_m_020699_0 0.0% hdfs://foo:50000/user/ddas/somedir/part002444:134217728+134217728\n\nJT log:\n---------\n2007-01-24 11:05:32,409 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker: Lost tracker 'foo.com:7020'\n\nLooks like there is some race condition.
