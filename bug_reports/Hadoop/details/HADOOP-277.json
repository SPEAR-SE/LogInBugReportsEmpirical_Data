If we need to synchronize, we really need to do it everywhere and do it consistently.\n\nOn a side note, the Configuration's getFile roll-over between local directories is problematic. The problem is that readers need to find the file regardless of where it was written. So if the writer can spill over to other directories, there should be a findFile(?) that looks in all of the directories (in the right order) until it finds it. That way readers can find the file regardless of which directory the writer was spilled in to.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-06-06T23:46:28.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-06T23:46:28.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343976/comment/12414991","id":"12414991","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Not sure I understand that, a sync block would still not  protect againt multiple processes trying to create the same hierarchy, and the races would still bite you...\n\nMaybe the safest thing to do is to traverse the hierarchy in getLocalPath(), creating each directory and checking\nfor it's existence.\n  \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-06-06T23:56:12.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-06T23:56:12.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12343976/comment/12414996","id":"12414996","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=psutter","name":"psutter","key":"psutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"p sutter","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\nSameer -> I think you're right.
