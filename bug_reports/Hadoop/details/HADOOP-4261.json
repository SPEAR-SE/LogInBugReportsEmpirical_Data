It would make more sense to call the job run-state as SETUP when logInited() is invoked\nThis would not be in consistent with JobStatus. Adding SETUP as JobStatus is not necessary.\n\nbq.I dont see any code that deals with setup task in job-recovery i.e recovery-manager\nThere is no specific change required. Change in checkAndInit method will do.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-09-29T11:39:03.105+0000","updated":"2008-09-29T11:39:03.105+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12405065/comment/12635546","id":"12635546","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Having separate enum for TaskType will break the existing checks such as Task.get(Keys.TASK_TYPE).equals(Values.Map().name()), because they have to be modifed for the new enum.  *And also I strongly feel HADOOP-4122 should be done in 0.19*, because re-factoring the code breaks many things.
