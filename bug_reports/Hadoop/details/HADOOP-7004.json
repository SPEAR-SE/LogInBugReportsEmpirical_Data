That method\nuses the REGISTRY static WeakHashMap to reach out to all reachable Configuration \ninstances to reset their properties.\n\nThe method addDefaultResource is called by e.g. ConfigUtil in org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.util (hadoop trunk) or \nJobConf (hadoop 0.20.2).\n\nThe problem has been observed in Hadoop 0.20.2 but the code in trunk has\nessentially the same structure. \n\nThere are a few problems here:\n\n1. You cannot safely use addResource(InputStream), if Configuration\nobjects are to be re-used (you can however use addResource(URL) instead)\n\n2. Modifying the state of Configuration instances at some later point in\ntime as a side effect of some class initialization in some completely\nunrelated thread leads to unpredictable behavior (properties change under the hood)\n\n3. Configuration instances keep context classloaders to find resources.  After redeployment these may not be \"valid\" anymore. \nAs long as the Configuration instance has not been collected, addDefaultResource will still invoke reloadConfiguration on them. \nWhile that is harmless today (only resetting members), this looks like a ticking time bomb.\n\nSuggestion:\nDefine all default resources in Configuration once. Do not hold on to\nother configuration instances and do not modify their state as a side\neffect of some other activity.\n\nSee also: http://osdir.com/ml/general/2010-10/msg25893.html\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"102838","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Problem with org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.REGISTRY","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gnomie","name":"gnomie","key":"gnomie","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henning Blohm","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gnomie","name":"gnomie","key":"gnomie","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henning Blohm","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"hadoop 0.20.2, hbase 0.20.6","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-7004/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0hyf3:"}}
