I have the lock around the JT for the other two methods because update() will require a lock on the JT once preemption is introduced in order to safely call killTask() on the JobTracker without causing a deadlock. If you just lock the JT independently or the FS independently, you can't cause a deadlock, but the problem is that the assignTasks method in the JobTracker locks first the JT and then the FS and thus causes a problem. However, maybe a better solution is to forget the lock on the JT in this patch, and change the way killTasks is called so that it's not called with a lock around the FairScheduler. This could be done by adding the tasks to kill into a queue and having a second thread kill them. Since the preemption patch, HADOOP-4665 is not going into release 0.20, I'm going to do that for this patch and fix up the patch for HADOOP-4665 to ensure that you only need a lock on the FS when calling update().\n\nI can also turn off the refresh by default. How is it handled on the JobTracker's web UI? For some reason I thought that refreshed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-02-18T19:53:45.816+0000","updated":"2009-02-18T19:53:45.816+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413761/comment/12674767","id":"12674767","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here's a patch with the changes in my previous comment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-02-18T20:03:36.846+0000","updated":"2009-02-18T20:03:36.846+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413761/comment/12674884","id":"12674884","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq.
