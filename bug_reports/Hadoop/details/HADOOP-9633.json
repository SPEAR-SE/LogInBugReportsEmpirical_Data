However, we can't check this (depthOfAllLeaves != node.getLevel()) before if (clusterMap.add(node)), because node.getLevel() will work correctly only after clusterMap.add(node) has been executed.\nA possible solution to this is checking the depthOfAllLeaves in clusterMap.add(node). Note that this is a recursive call. A check should be put at the bottom of this recursive call. If check fails, don't add this leaf and all its upstream racks.
