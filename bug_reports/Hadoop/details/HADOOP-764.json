Now when we update Dx.block in processReport(), we do Dx.blocks.clear() : i.e. Bx_ref is removed. Bx_new_ref in newReport array is added to Dx.block. So there are two separate objects referenced by namenode.blockMap and Dx.block. \n\nnewReport[] does not hold reference to blocks in namenode.blockMap (as far as I can see). What I am missing?\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-12-07T18:33:12.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-07T18:33:12.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12357304/comment/12456626","id":"12456626","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I agree with your observation.
