We should not provide atomic renames, mostly because it will extremely hard to support if we ever build a distributed namespace service. Atomic rename is relatively easy within a single name-node, but supporting it down the road for renames across two or more name-servers is really hard.\n\n2. We should not support posix definition for renames. Mostly because of [1] above. But also because there are other (local) file systems which don't support it either, which means that we cannot guarantee posix behavior for hadoop {{LocalFileSystem}}. E.g., if you run {{LocalFileSystem}} on a local WinNT drive then renaming of a file to an existing file and a directory to an existing empty directory (posix 2 and 4) will fail, but if you run it on an ext3 volume it will succeed.\n\nTo support the legal basis for these inconsistencies between different file systems I cited Java definition of rename, which says:\n\"Many aspects of the behavior of this method are inherently platform-dependent: The rename operation might not be able to move a file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname already exists.\"\n\nImo, rename should always be treated as a convenience method. Posix semantics for rename has been problematic for traditional file systems, for distributed ones it should be avoided by all means.\nFor example, rename is the only operation in HDFS, which makes edits logs non-idempotent, and we could have done so many things so much better with idempotent journal records.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-09-11T18:03:27.343+0000","updated":"2009-09-11T18:03:27.343+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12434871/comment/12754277","id":"12754277","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"LocalFileSystem can do necessary things (such as deleting an existing dst) before calling java File.renameTo() to make is consistent across different operating systems.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-09-11T18:48:20.454+0000","updated":"2009-09-11T18:48:20.454+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12434871/comment/12754283","id":"12754283","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> We should not provide atomic renames [ ... ]\n\nA middle ground might be to be very clear about where they can be relied on and where they cannot, so that applications are forewarned.

Think about the case where a distributed application uses HDFS as the source of record for some metadata (eg there is a small text file on HDFS with some application information). As an application developer it would be nice to simply open the file, read it, and be sure you won't fail. Without the atomic rename-replace, the reader can hit a race where the file has been deleted but the new version hasn't been written. Surely the application can know about this and continually retry until it gets a valid read, but it's a bit of an aggravation.\n\nI could certainly be convinced that this kind of behavior is out of scope for HDFS and applications should use a database or zookeeper if they need semantics like this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-09-14T18:08:47.695+0000","updated":"2009-09-14T18:08:47.695+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12434871/comment/12755143","id":"12755143","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> it would be nice to simply open the file, read it, and be sure you won't fail.\n\nEven with atomic rename/replace I'm not sure this would be guaranteed to work.

My goal is to determine which mandate an HDFS-specific implementation for 0.21 (before we've added AbstractFileSystem) and cannot be correctly implemented in FileContext.\n\nMy guesses are:\n # rename will return void and throw IOException to indicate failures.  This is new, but would be easy to fix generically in FileContext, right?\n#  rename will fail when renaming from file to directory or directory to file.  Do we permit this currently?  If so, then, in FileContext, we could first stat the files and throw an exception.  That would potentially be incorrect if another process removed and/or replaced the files between the stat and the rename, since an illegal rename might then succeed.  Is that sort of atomicity critical?\n # rename from /a/b to /c/d will fail if {c} does not exist.  I assume this currently succeeds.  A generic implementation in FileContext would stat the parent directory, and, if it does not exist, throw an exception.  That would potentially be incorrect if another process created the parent directory between the stat and the mkdir, since the rename would succeed.  Is that sort of atomicity critical?\n# rename will not have consistent behavior when the dst directory exists - if dst directory exists it will not behave like move as it does today.  Again, this could be handled by first stat'ing the file, and again, it has the same atomicity concerns.\n\nSo the question is, would applications that depend on atomic rename have troubles with a generic implementation of these?  Mostly what folks depend on atomic rename for is to know that something has indeed completed.  So rename-by-copy is especially dangerous here, since a file or directory's existence can give the appearance of completion when the copy did not in fact complete.  But I don't see that peril in the above cases.\n\nWhat are the actual risks of a generic implementation of the above?

For example, the trash feature relies on non-copying rename to be efficient, but it does not require atomic rename, since when a file with the same name is already in the trash we generate a new unique name.\n\nPerhaps we could have options, e.g., enum RenameOptions {OVERWRITE, ATOMIC}, that are passed to rename.  If you don't specify OVERWRITE, and the destination exists, and exception is thrown.  If you specify ATOMIC and it cannot be done atomically then an exception is thrown.

I think \"best effort by default\" with the addition of an explicit flag like \"ATOMIC\" that will fail when unavailable is the best course of action.\n\nbq. I routinely write applications that are to be deployed on HDFS. But I often test these apps on the local file system. The atomic flag prevents me from doing such tests\n\nPlaying devil's advocate: if the tests pass without the ATOMIC flag on your local filesystem, then why would you be passing ATOMIC? It seems to me that you either need ATOMIC for correct operation or you don't.\n\nNot devil's advocate: I guess there are plenty of cases where you need ATOMIC to be strictly correct, but in single-threaded test cases there's no worry of a race. In that case it might be useful to have overrides for LocalFileSystem so you can say (only in the context of a test case, and only with some effort!) \"Pretend to be atomic even though you aren't.\" Or, if the global override seems too dirty, it would be up to the application writer to get hooks in their tests to not pass ATOMIC when running tests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-09-17T18:51:17.218+0000","updated":"2009-09-17T18:51:17.218+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12434871/comment/12756707","id":"12756707","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> I often test these apps on the local file system. The atomic flag prevents me from doing such tests [ ... ]\n\nGood point.  I agree that if the local file system cannot perform atomic renames then the atomic flag would probably be counterproductive.  When atomic is specified, we could exec 'mv', which is atomic when used within a filesystem.  We have DF#getFilesystem() that we can use to determine if two files are on a common filesystem.  So I think we could probably could implement the ATOMIC option correctly for the local filesystem if we wanted.\n\nIt looks to me like S3 implements atomic copy.  So you still need to remove the source as a second step, but one can presumably tell by dates that the copy succeeded, so the failure cases are not as bad, but I don't know if that's good enough.\n\nMore generally, would throwing an exception for filesystems where the rename cannot be done atomically ever be useful?  Let's say that we don't feel that S3 implements atomic rename sufficiently well.  Would it be better, when an application wants an atomic rename, to perform the rename non-atomically or to throw an exception?  If the application's okay with non-atomic, then they shouldn't specify ATOMIC.  So then the question becomes, should any applications ever specify ATOMIC?  Is it ever so important that you'd rather fail than have it non-atomic?  My guess is probably not, so perhaps we should, as you suggest, skip the ATOMIC option.  What do others think?\n\nEven if we only have a single option initially, OVERWRITE, we should still probably make the method accept multiple options, to future-proof it.  Also note that, if the signature is new, we may not need need a different name!\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-09-17T19:11:25.683+0000","updated":"2009-09-17T19:11:25.683+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12434871/comment/12756716","id":"12756716","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 to suresh's proposal.\nI suspect he has used enum rather than boolean precisely because we can extend it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-09-17T19:19:06.893+0000","updated":"2009-09-17T19:19:06.893+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12434871/comment/12756717","id":"12756717","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Suresh, I was thinking we'd use varargs, e.g.:\n\n{code}\nenum RenameOption { OVERWRITE }\npublic void rename(Path src, Path dst, RenameOption... options);\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-09-17T19:22:55.636+0000","updated":"2009-09-17T19:22:55.636+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12434871/comment/12756756","id":"12756756","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 for varargs.
