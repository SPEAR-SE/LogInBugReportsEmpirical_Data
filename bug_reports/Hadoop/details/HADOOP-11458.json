The default install location for both JDK and JRE are in \"Program Files\"  That space causes problems with the %JAVA% variable\n#. Adding quotes around the CLASSPATH and JAVA variables fix a great number of problems, but breaks the platform detection\n\nDue to my fix in the script breaking the platform detection, I can't recommend it outright.  My work-around for the platform detection was to run it from the command line directly, and then embed the result in the JAVA_PLATFORM variable with those results.  I.e. it will only work on my machine.\n\nThis is an old problem that several projects had to fix when Java went to 1.3, not sure why it's back again.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Dos Scripts fail when spaces are in Java Path","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bloritsch","name":"bloritsch","key":"bloritsch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bloritsch&avatarId=22240","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bloritsch&avatarId=22240","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bloritsch&avatarId=22240","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bloritsch&avatarId=22240"},"displayName":"Berin Loritsch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bloritsch","name":"bloritsch","key":"bloritsch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bloritsch&avatarId=22240","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bloritsch&avatarId=22240","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bloritsch&avatarId=22240","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bloritsch&avatarId=22240"},"displayName":"Berin Loritsch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12764815/comment/14268572","id":"14268572","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hello [~bloritsch].
