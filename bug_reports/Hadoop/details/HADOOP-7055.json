EventCounter works correctly with this version of commons logging. Hadoop 0.21.0 uses commons logging 1.1.1 which causes EventCounter to count logging events incorrectly. I have verified it with Hadoop 0.21.0. After start-up of hadoop, I checked jvmmetrics.log after several minutes. In every metrics record, \"logError=0, logFatal=0, logInfo=3, logWarn=0\" was shown. The following text is an example.\n\njvm.metrics: hostName=jingguolin, processName=DataNode, sessionId=, gcCount=3, gcTimeMillis=31, logError=0, logFatal=0, logInfo=3, logWarn=0, maxMemoryM=888.9375, memHeapCommittedM=38.0625, memHeapUsedM=3.6539612, memNonHeapCommittedM=18.25, memNonHeapUsedM=11.335686, threadsBlocked=0, threadsNew=0, threadsRunnable=8, threadsTerminated=0, threadsTimedWaiting=6, threadsWaiting=6\n\nThen I stopped hadoop and replaced commons logging 1.1.1 with 1.0.4. After the re-start of hadoop, a lot of logging events showed up in jvmmetrics.log.\n\nI have checked the source code of Log4JLogger for both 1.0.4 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/logging/tags/LOGGING_1_0_4/src/java/org/apache/commons/logging/impl/Log4JLogger.java?view=markup) and 1.1.1 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/logging/tags/commons-logging-1.1.1/src/java/org/apache/commons/logging/impl/Log4JLogger.java?view=markup). For 1.0.4, Level instances such as Level.INFO are used to construct LoggingEvent. But for 1.1.1, Priority instances such as Priority.INFO are used to construct LoggingEvent. So 1.1.1 version's event.getLevel() always returns Priority instances. EventCounter append method's \"==\" check always fails between a Level instance and a Priority instance. For \"logInfo=3\" metrics records produced by commons logging 1.1.1., I think that these 3 logging events are produced by log4j code directly instead of through commons logging API. The following code is EventCounter's append method.\n\n    public void append(LoggingEvent event) {\n        Level level = event.getLevel();\n        if (level == Level.INFO) {\n            counts.incr(INFO);\n        }\n        else if (level == Level.WARN) {\n            counts.incr(WARN);\n        }\n        else if (level == Level.ERROR) {\n            counts.incr(ERROR);\n        }\n        else if (level == Level.FATAL) {\n            counts.incr(FATAL);\n        }\n\n    }","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"0.5h","remainingEstimate":"0.5h","originalEstimateSeconds":1800,"remainingEstimateSeconds":1800},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12474763","id":"12474763","filename":"HADOOP-7055.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaojingguo","name":"yaojingguo","key":"yaojingguo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582"},"displayName":"Jingguo Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2011-03-28T08:39:11.929+0000","size":1543,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12474763/HADOOP-7055.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":1800,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"53779","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Update of commons logging libraries causes EventCounter to count logging events incorrectly","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaojingguo","name":"yaojingguo","key":"yaojingguo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582"},"displayName":"Jingguo Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaojingguo","name":"yaojingguo","key":"yaojingguo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582"},"displayName":"Jingguo Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":1800,"percent":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":1800,"percent":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12491620/comment/12970571","id":"12970571","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Good catch Jingguo.

But we need to make sure that no log4j API is used directly for logging. log4j API uses Level instances such as Level.INFO to create LoggingEvent. Otherwise, such kind of logging will not be taken into account by EventCounter. And Level instances such as Priority.INFO are deprecated in log4j.\n\nAnother option is to use equals instead of ==. Priority has the following equals method. \n\n  /**\n     Two priorities are equal if their level fields are equal.\n     @since 1.2\n   */\n  public\n  boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if(o instanceof Priority) {\n      Priority r = (Priority) o;\n      return (this.level == r.level);\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\nLevel does not define equals method by itself. So it inherits this method. This method will return true if level fields (int type) are equal. It will return true for things like Level.INFO and Priority.INFO. So LoggingEvent created by both commons logging API and log4j API will be taken into account for this option. The downside for this option is that equals check is slow than == check.\n\nAnd there are some mistakes in my original comment. Let me correct them here.\n\nFor 1.0.4, Level instances such as Level.INFO are used to construct LoggingEvent. But for 1.1.1, Level instances such as Priority.INFO are used to construct LoggingEvent. Level.INFO and Priority.INFO are different Level instances. 1.1.1 version's event.getLevel() always returns Level instances from Priority. So EventCounter append method's \"==\" check always fails between different Level instances from Level and Priority.\n\npublic class Priority {\n  //...\n  final static public Priority INFO  = new Level(INFO_INT, \"INFO\",  6);\n  //...\n}\n\npublic class Level extends Priority implements Serializable {\n  //...\n  final static public Level INFO  = new Level(INFO_INT, \"INFO\",  6);\n  //...\n}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaojingguo","name":"yaojingguo","key":"yaojingguo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582"},"displayName":"Jingguo Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2010-12-12T07:02:38.848+0000","updated":"2010-12-12T07:02:38.848+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12491620/comment/12971129","id":"12971129","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This looks like a regression in the common log 1.1.1 implementation (passes in Priority.* instances instead of recommended Level.*) to me.

If don't believe it, just benchmark it and make sure you have at least two threads doing the update, so jvm doesn't elide the locks.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-03-27T17:50:45.247+0000","updated":"2011-03-27T17:50:45.247+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12491620/comment/13011958","id":"13011958","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaojingguo","name":"yaojingguo","key":"yaojingguo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582"},"displayName":"Jingguo Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Per Luke's suggestion, use equals instead of == for Level check.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaojingguo","name":"yaojingguo","key":"yaojingguo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yaojingguo&avatarId=35582"},"displayName":"Jingguo Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2011-03-28T08:37:32.666+0000","updated":"2011-03-28T08:37:32.666+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12491620/comment/13021495","id":"13021495","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
