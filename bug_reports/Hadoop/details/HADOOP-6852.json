Next to that, when we flush log lines, we compress, which in turn causes different bzip2 block sizes.\nAnyway, we're also getting the 'bad block header' exception.\nLooking through some code and trying different things, we get things to work when we change the following in org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.bzip2.CBZip2InputStream:\n\n{noformat}\n  public CBZip2InputStream(final InputStream in) throws IOException {\n    this(in, READ_MODE.CONTINUOUS);\n  }\n{noformat}\n\nto\n\n{noformat}\n  public CBZip2InputStream(final InputStream in) throws IOException {\n    this(in, READ_MODE.BYBLOCK);\n  }\n{noformat}\n\nWhich causes CBZip2InputStream to use the block size in initBlock(), instead of looking for the magic numbers.\n\nI'll be digging into some code more tomorrow, but to quickly move forward on this issue, I would like to know why is CONTINUOUS the default mode and is there a place where the read mode is determined? BZip2 is block based, so why not default to that? \n\nI'll also try the above piece of code and see if that works with BYBLOCK.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wouterdebie","name":"wouterdebie","key":"wouterdebie","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Wouter de Bie","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2010-08-26T21:14:40.985+0000","updated":"2010-08-26T21:14:40.985+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12468769/comment/12986044","id":"12986044","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Wouter: do you have HADOOP-6925 in your build?

Essentially when crossing block boundaries the skipToNextMarker method leaves the stream position at the end of the block delimiter, but initBlock expects to be at the beginning of the block delimiter. After looking at the poor structure of the initBlock method, and the thread-unsafety that has been introduced into this class with the numberOfBytesTillNextMarker() method, we decided to avoid the hadoop version of this class altogether.

Where did these come from? Since these are tests that were commented out at some point, I suspect you just restored them from before, but we should make sure that's documented. Ideally we'd document the source and how they were generated. I wonder if it's possible that generating them at run-time would cause problems to get missed because we're testing recently compressed files and not files compressed with an old implementation. Both should work.
