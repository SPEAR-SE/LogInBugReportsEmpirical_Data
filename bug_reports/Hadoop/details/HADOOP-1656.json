I don't know whether this patch will break the\nsemantics of generating splits.\nOn the other hand if we store the block size per file, what is the semantics of that field?\nCurrently we have flexibility to create blocks of different sizes within the file, do we loose that flexibility\nfrom now on? And if we don't why do we need to store it?\nThis looks like one of those simple changes that can lead to big consequences.\n\nCurrently if there is more than one block in the file the block size is returned correct;y. The problem is with one block files only.\nI'd propose one of the 3 variants in this case:\n# keep it as it is: return the first block size;\n# return the default block size;\n# return -1 as the block size from the name-node, and let DFSClient return its default size further up to the application. \nMost probably that will the size this file was created with.\n\nOn a side note we need to deprecate getBlockSize() both in DFSClient and ClientProtocol because it is never used.\nThe correct way is to call getFileInfo().getBlockSize().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-08-11T01:03:55.621+0000","updated":"2007-08-11T01:03:55.621+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12374712/comment/12519451","id":"12519451","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"The blocksize is a heuristic that HDFS uses to chunk up a file.
