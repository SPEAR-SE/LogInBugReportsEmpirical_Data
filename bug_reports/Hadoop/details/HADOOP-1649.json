trunk.  io.file.buffer.size is 64K and io.bytes.per.checksum is 512.\n\n * pre-1134 : 3190 sec\n * cur trunk : 3290 sec.\n\nOnly once, trunk took 3600 secs, not sure why.  \n\nEither of the following fixed this gap :\n # matching buffer size for  in/out sockets and for block file while writing a block with buffering on pre-1134\n # set io.bytes.per.checksum 64K\n\nRegd matching the buffer size :\n\nI will attach a patch that does this. But one negative thing about this is that it has 3 extra copies compared to pre-1134. But this does not affect the benchmarks since usually our benchmarks are not cpu bound on datanodes. The following occur because datanode processes one checksum chunk at a time :\n *  from in-socket buffer to small buffer (of size io.bytes.per.checksum)\n *  small buffer to mirror-socket buffer,\n * small buffer to block file buffer.\n\nIt personally feels pretty bad to be responsible for so many copies even if  benchmarks are not affected. (May be in Hadoop-0.15), we can avoid first two copies by changing the write loop a little to do larger buffer reads instead of on checksum chunk. The third can be avoided if checksum is sent on different socket.\n\nAnother regression we have seen is with TestDFSIO. This one is not affected noticeably on small clusters (<100) but aggregate rate came down by about 30% on 500 node cluster. This is a shorter test in terms of time and I will look into this as well.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-07-24T22:57:33.244+0000","updated":"2007-07-24T22:57:33.244+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12374408/comment/12515121","id":"12515121","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In HADOOP-1134 we talked of subsequently testing with larger values for bytes.per.checksum.

Still sort runs are taking a little longer. Looking at aggregate read and write rates during the sort benchmarks (using Simon), most of the difference is attributable to 'long tail' of maps/reduces. It is not clear if Block CRCs or this patch causes a few extra map or reduce failures. Currently looking at various logs.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-07-31T06:15:26.876+0000","updated":"2007-07-31T06:15:26.876+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12374408/comment/12516685","id":"12516685","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Could you please apply the patch for HADOOP-1651 and see if it helps in the 'long tail' problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2007-07-31T12:28:57.262+0000","updated":"2007-07-31T12:28:57.262+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12374408/comment/12516819","id":"12516819","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"\nTestDFSIO is a simpler test. After analyzing files written during DFSIO-write test, it looks like just handful of slow nodes (disk or network) slowdown the over all job.

I will look at time taken to write these files during sort.\n\nFor writes, Hadoop can work around slow nodes problem by avoiding nodes that have many pending writes inside chooseTarget. Since we don't keep track of reads, adaptively avoiding slow nodes is harder. But this problem is more severe for writes. Also once we write less to a node, we will end up reading less as well.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-07-31T23:00:08.811+0000","updated":"2007-07-31T23:00:08.811+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12374408/comment/12516823","id":"12516823","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"\nDigressing from this jira little bit..

With this patch most of of the performance gap in benchmarks is closed. With TestDFSIO we are still seeing 3-5% difference on average. Each time this difference can be traced to nodes with slow disks. Whether block crcs makes  bad nodes worse is not clear. \n\nThis patch adds buffer while writing data to disk as well as while reading from disk. From the tests, buffer while writing is more important. I guess OS read-ahead while reading the data makes  buffer for reading.\n\nOf course, extra buffering add extra data copies. I will file another jira to remove majority of these copies without changing buffering.\n\nAnother change is that DataNode opens block file with RandomAccessFile() and seeks to first read position.
