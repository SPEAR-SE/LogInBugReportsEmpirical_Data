But this could cause a subtle problem. The problem is the above fix could cause a call to \"append\" fail when it should not. let me try to explain.\n\nSuppose, a writer is writing data to a file and dies before closing the file. A new writer starts and invokes \"append\" to try to append to this file. This \"append\" call triggers lease recovery, and thereby causes the Primary Datanode to invoke commitBlockSync. Meanwhle, the append call fails (as expected) with AlreadyBeingCreatedExcetion\". The commitBlockSync call removes the lease but does not update block locations of the last block. The datanode(s) that have the last block  sends blockReceived to the NN, but before they reach the NN, the NN starts processing another call to \"append\". This append will now find that the file is not under construction anymore but that the last block of the file does not have any block locations associated with it. This means that the \"append\" call will fail.
