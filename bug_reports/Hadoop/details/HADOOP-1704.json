It deletes in a single thread and each deletiion results in editsLog entry.. these two naturally throttle the rate to around 700-800 deletes a second. Deleting a directory deletes whole tree with sigle editsLog entry. This is the difference. \n\nThe similarity is that that none of these 5M blocks were removed from the namespace until after the upgrade is complete. In that sense memory overhead is same as deleting 5M files in one shot.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-09-06T17:55:28.693+0000","updated":"2007-09-06T17:55:28.693+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12375725/comment/12525486","id":"12525486","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> Why not just apply that throttling code to trash as well?\n\nIf this is really a problem, that wouldn't fix it when an application deletes a bunch of files.  So, if throttling is required for deletions, we should implement it generically, either on the namenode or in DFSClient.
