This new thread can avoid the clean up, so that the process held by it can be leaked causing leaked localized files/etc.\r\n\r\nYes, there's a small bug where Shell#runCommand should be synchronizing on CHILD_SHELLS as it starts the subprocess. That way it either won't be started before destroyAllShells is called or it will be part of the list as long as it's been started.  However I would argue it's outside the scope of the getAllShells and destoryAllShells APIs to prevent all future shells from being launched, as there may be a use case where someone wants to cleanup all current shells but still launch future ones. Its job is to kill all active ones which client code outside of Shell cannot do.\r\n\r\nIn the specific case of localizing, it looks like we need a second destroy pass after awaiting the shutdown of the executor to catch any shell that was trying to launch just as we destroyed the active ones.\r\n\r\n{quote}I see another issue as well.
