Did you have more than one directory in dfs.name.dir?\n> 2. Was this a new cluster or was it an existing cluster and was \n> upgraded to 0.9.0 recently?\n\nIt happened after we restarted the DFS when upgrading from 0.7 to 0.8.\n In the process, we also added multiple directories to dfs.name.dir.\n\n> 3. Did any unnatural  Namenode restarts occur immediately before the \n> problem started occurring?\n\nNot sure about this one.\n\n> 1. Will it help to make the fsimage/edit file ascii, so that it can be \n> easily edited by hand?\n\nThat's a good idea, but I don't know if the effect on backwards compatibility is worth it.  Editing these files is probably not something that most people will do.  Maybe some sort of conversion tool that goes from the binary to text and vice versa would be more useful.\n\n> 2. Does it make sense for HDFS to automatically create a directory \n> equivalent to /lost+found? While EditLog processing, if the parent \n> directory of a file does not exist, the file can go into /lost+found?\n\nYes.  At least this way people can start up their DFSs after corruption.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2006-12-13T06:36:24.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-13T06:36:24.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12356440/comment/12458936","id":"12458936","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The name-node should fall into safe mode when a log edit transaction fails, and\nwait until the administrator fixes the problem and turns safe mode off.
