I don't see this when running the same job on a real cluster managed with hadoop-ec2.\n\nWith a no-reducers streaming job, I'm getting several output files, each truncated to 325.24 KB, and several zero-length output files.  With \"cat\" as my reducer, I get one output file, again truncated to 325.24 KB.  This only happens in a pseudo-distributed Hadoop run - when I run the mapper on the command line (cat input_file | ./mapper.py | sort), I get the full output.  Input splitting isn't a factor, my input file is small enough to fit in one input split (and truncated input would just break the mapper, not truncate its output).\n\nMy mapper is outputting the default key-value lines for streaming, with a tab separating the key and the value, and no newlines or tabs in the value.\n\nTruncation happens in the middle of a line.  My lines are very long, the lines themselves are over 325.24 KB.  This isn't the most efficient use of Hadoop, I know, I'm just putting a job in my pipeline while I work on a better implementation.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"104613","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"mapper output truncated on pseudo-distributed cluster","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=karl","name":"karl","key":"karl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karl Anderson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=karl","name":"karl","key":"karl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karl Anderson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403034/comment/12625559","id":"12625559","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=karl","name":"karl","key":"karl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karl Anderson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This could be an architecture issue.
