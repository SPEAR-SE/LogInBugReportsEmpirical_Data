This code computed the number of pending tasks, if required, from the list of waiting jobs. We need to know if there are pending tasks in queue in order to start reclaiming capacity for the queue if necessary. It's not enough to look at running jobs only. We must start the timer for reclaiming capacity the moment a job is submitted to a queue that does not have its Guaranteed Capacity. Consider the following case. You have a queue that is empty, and its capacity is being utilized by other queues. Now someone submits a job to it. That job will only show up in the run queue once the initialization thread gets to it, so by looking at the jobs in the run queue only, you're starting its reclaim timer later than you should. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-17T03:56:54.065+0000","updated":"2008-12-17T03:56:54.065+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410761/comment/12657289","id":"12657289","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sreekanth","name":"sreekanth","key":"sreekanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sreekanth Ramakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching new patch incorporating Vivek's comments based on an offline discussion.\n\n1.
