With a GUID, this is no longer an accident that can happen. The original issue that spawned this discussion was with this kind of situation - settings in a config file lead to data \"cleanup\" that wasn't desired. With a GUID, this risk goes away. Without it, especially with default data directories like /tmp/, it's very easy for two different people to clobber each others data by running datanode instances on the same machine(s).\n\nI understand there's a big push back against complexity. But hadoop is a component likely to be used in a lot of situations, by users who might or might not have complete control of their cluster. The DFS layer is supposed to provide data reliability, so it seems appropriate to put in guards against bad end-user behavior/misconfigurations, if it's not going to be a big cost in performance (it shouldn't - what, an extra string during the initial chat between namenode/datanode?), or storage (it shouldn't add more than a few extra bytes to the filename of each block - or a whole GUID subdir, rather than/in addition to the suggested named paths).\n\nAn much weaker alternative to prevent only the one worst-case I'm highlighting, would be for a datanode to shutdown with an error if *none* of the blocks on in a datanode's storage directory are from live files in the DFS. I think that is a far less powerful fix, with the only benefit being that it doesn't require changing the behavior of virtually any of the existing code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bpendleton","name":"bpendleton","key":"bpendleton","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Pendleton","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-02-28T04:46:29.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-28T04:46:29.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12329366/comment/12368159","id":"12368159","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sorry Bryan, I misinterpreted GUID as a group/user id.\nSo, yes a global unique id is for identifying particular data instances of the file system.\nIt can be generated by \"format\".
