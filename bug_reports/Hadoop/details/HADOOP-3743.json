Adds org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobShell and org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestJobShell\n2. Adds the static Configuration in JobClient\n3. Parsing in JobShell is removed as is not necessary. Because JobShell implements Tool and ToolRunner does the parsing for it. So, JobShell is used to set the static config for JobClient for the applications that doesnt implement ToolRunner.\n\nbq. but we make it pass the original arguments strings to runJar.\nWe cannot send all the remaining arguments to RunJar, because RunJar expects the first argument to be the MainClass if there is no MainClass in the manifest.\n\nA warning is printed in JobClient if _mapred.used.genericoptionparser_ is not set to _yes_\nAnd also applications that implement ToolRunner, but use JobShell for -libjars or -files or -archives are warned.\n\nAdded earlier usage documentation patch again.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-07-15T12:51:11.134+0000","updated":"2008-07-15T12:51:11.134+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12400049/comment/12613601","id":"12613601","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"The patch applies to both trunk and branch 0.18","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-07-15T12:53:01.620+0000","updated":"2008-07-15T12:53:01.620+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12400049/comment/12613740","id":"12613740","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"review comments:\n\n1) the file Jobshell has all the parser and options -- is it needed? since we are parsing with genericoptions parser? we can get rid of them.\n2) also since the generic options parser always does the parsing --- in case of JobShell as well --- the property     conf.set(\"mapred.used.genericoptionsparser\", \"yes\"); will always be set? right?
