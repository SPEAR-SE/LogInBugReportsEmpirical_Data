Suppose we have a project with {{foo-linux.c}} containing nonportable code, and {{generic.c}} containing POSIX portable code.  If I define {{_GNU_SOURCE}} in {{CFLAGS}} then unintentionally adding a call to {{sync_file_range}} to {{generic.c}} will silently work on Linux, and won't break the build until you try building on Darwin or Solaris or whatever.\n\nIf instead the project puts {{#define _GNU_SOURCE}} at the top of files intended to be platform-specific, then such portability breakage will be noticed immediately.\n\nThe argument doesn't extend to LFS support -- it's entirely reasonable to use 64-bit-{{off_t}} everywhere including Linux-32.\n\n{code}\n+# note: can't enable -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64: see MAPREDUCE-4258\n+set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE\")\n+set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE\")\n{code}\nIf we don't have FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, then shouldn't we also leave out LARGEFILE_SOURCE?  (This is a serious question, I don't know how those two defines interact, I just vaguely remember that there's a complicated rule about how they should be used.)\n\nIn summary -- I'd slightly prefer to limit the GNU_SOURCE to a {{#define}} in the files that we intend to be Linux-specific.  The rest of this patch is good though, cleaning up the LFS defines and adding that comment about MAPREDUCE-4258.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-16T20:00:44.388+0000","updated":"2012-07-16T20:00:44.388+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12597698/comment/13415619","id":"13415619","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

After I did the CMake conversion, the fact that it wasn't defined in the CMakeLists.txt was a bug, not a feature.  That's what I'm trying to fix here.\n\nI realize that it's tempting to assume that code that you write without _GNU_SOURCE defined will automatically be portable.  However, this is *NOT TRUE*.  For example, even without _GNU_SOURCE defined, you still get the non-POSIX definition of strerror_r out of glibc.\n\nThe only valid way to make sure your code is portable is to build and test it on multiple platforms.  Any other strategy is just a waste of time.  Defining GNU_SOURCE is similar to setting the correct DOCTYPE in your HTML file.  It tells the browser (or compiler in this case) to turn off \"quirks mode\" and give you the real deal.\n\nI don't think the CheckFunctionExists stuff in the CMakeLists.txt will work consistently without _GNU_SOURCE defined.\n\nThere are better ways to improve our portability.  For example, we should probably have some OpenBSD jenkins build slaves.  But let's not waste our time messing with macros.  It really adds nothing but inconvenience.\n\nbq. If we don't have FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, then shouldn't we also leave out LARGEFILE_SOURCE?\n\n_LARGEFILE_SOURCE exposes fseeko and ftello.   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS changes the default off_t type to be 64 bits.  Basically _LARGEFILE_SOURCE is something you need to define in addition to _FILE_OFFSET_BITS, but the two things do different things.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
