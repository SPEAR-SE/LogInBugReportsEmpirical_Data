This happens when there are a couple available slots, and map tasks cannot be scheduled yet, but the code in JobTracker:743 still allocates reduce tasks from the next job.\n\n* allow simple priority-based preemption, i.e. jobs with a higher priority (presumably short-lived) could be favored in task allocation over already running jobs.\n\n* alternatively, allow setting limits on the min/max % of cluster capacity the job is willing to accept. This gives some leeway to the scheduler to allocate the flexible portion of remaining tasks to old/new jobs.\n\n* allow setting different priorities for maps and reduces - e.g. in Nutch fetcher job, map tasks are very long running and in many cases need to fit within a specified time-frame (e.g. during the night). However, reduce tasks, which simply reshuffle the data, are not so time-critical.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ab","name":"ab","key":"ab","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ab&avatarId=36393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ab&avatarId=36393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ab&avatarId=36393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ab&avatarId=36393"},"displayName":"Andrzej Bialecki ","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2006-06-14T14:22:46.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-14T14:22:46.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12344337/comment/12416204","id":"12416204","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"*smile* I don't have that much free time!
