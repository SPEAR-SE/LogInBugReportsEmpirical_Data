The approach is:\n# To ensure backward compatibility, when applications use the old key \"dfs.umask\" and the server default has \"dfs.umaskmode\", old key overrides the new key. That is first the old key is used for getting umask and then the new key.\n# FsPermission.setUMask(Configuration conf, FsPermission umask) currently has a bug. When setting the \"dfs.umaskmode\" param in the configuration, it should convert the umask decimal value to octal.\n\nThis patch is not applicable to release 21, since it uses deprecation mechanism introduced in Hadoop-6105 and more work is needed to make this solution work in that realm.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-02-01T22:21:39.054+0000","updated":"2010-02-01T22:21:39.054+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12447039/comment/12828312","id":"12828312","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ran some manual tests just to verify the fix.

It deprecates the old param \"dfs.umask\". Previously for backward compatibility new deprecation mechanism introduced in 0.21 was used. This mechanism is useful when a config param name changes, to map the old config name to the new. However in case of umask, the semantics of the param also changes. Old param expects decimal value and the new param  expects symbolic or octal value. The deprecation mechanism in addition to mapping old to new names, must also translated the old value to new value. Given the lack of this capability, umask will no longer use config deprecation mechanism.\n\n# Following changes from 0.20 version of the patch is carried forward, with the exception of test changes. Test changes are needed in HDFS. I will created a separate jira for that.\n{quote}\n    1.
