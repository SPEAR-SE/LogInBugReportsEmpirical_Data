Its nice to have a GenericOptionsParser but we either need to pull out the things that aren't truly generic across the commands or better yet have a way for different commands to specify which apply and perhaps add to it so that the usage comes out nicely to differentiate subcommands from generic options.    We also need to remove the general usage of \"bin/hadoop command [genericOptions] [commandOptions]\"\n\nNote that this came about from discussion on YARN-126.\n\nNote that even within subcommands of particular CLI's are inconsistent.
