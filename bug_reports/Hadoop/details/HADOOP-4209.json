Consider a case where the JT runs for the first time and schedules an attempt from a tip tip_0. Let the attempt be attempt_0_0. Let assume that the jobtracker crashes while attempt_0_0 is still running. Upon restart, the JT might not have seen the attempt as its not logged to the history and so will go ahead and schedule another attempt from tip_0. Now this attempt will also have the same id as the earlier attempt (before restart) and hence the side-effect files will now clash. Consider a case where the attempt_0_0 is done but not logged. In such a case the same tracker can now ask for an attempt from tip_0 and might get attempt_0_0. Now not only the side effect files but also the local directories will clash. To avoid such issues we have kept the attempt id unique across restarts. This timestamp is redundant only if the jobtracker never restarts.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-09-19T04:39:40.165+0000","updated":"2008-09-19T04:39:40.165+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404696/comment/12632519","id":"12632519","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"After looking through the code some more and seeing the attempt ids like:\n\nattempt_200707121733_0003_m_000005_0_1234567890123\n\nThere are problems:\n  1.
