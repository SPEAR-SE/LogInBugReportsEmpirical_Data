Scheduler obtains running and pending count from JobInProgress. It does the following when giving out a new task - \n 1) Update queue information. This includes updating running count from all jobs.\n 2) Give a new Task. This includes incrementing running count for this job.\n\nThe incremented running count for a job in the last step is not reflected in the scheduler information till the TT reaches scheduler again i.e. when scheduler goes out for giving another new task to this TT. And when a TT hits the situation when it no longer needs new tasks, running count incremented in the last assignment doesn't get reflected in the scheduler information as the TT never reaches scheduler.\n\nA simple fix would be to updated queue information also after task assignment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-10-30T10:48:49.850+0000","updated":"2008-10-30T10:48:49.850+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406678/comment/12643808","id":"12643808","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

Even after doing what is done in the latest patch, we still will find the discrepancies because JIP.runningTasks is updated immediately after giving away new tasks but not when it is actually running (i.e when removed from expireLaunchingTasks list).\n\nAfter discussing this with Hemanth, realized that at the place where we actually use these counts (in the scheduler) we do *have* the correct values. We are anyway going to remove these counts from the scheduler UI (HADOOP-4445) as they are already displayed in cluster-summary. Once we fix HADOOP-4445, these issues will no longer be visible.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-10-30T11:59:20.175+0000","updated":"2008-10-30T11:59:20.175+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406678/comment/12643946","id":"12643946","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Closing it as duplicate of HADOOP-4445.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-10-30T12:00:54.842+0000","updated":"2008-10-30T12:00:54.842+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406678/comment/12644646","id":"12644646","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Please see HADOOP-4445 for the explanation of why all this is really happening.
