Historically KMS delegation tokens have ip:port as service, making KMS clients only able to use the token to authenticate with 1 KMS server, even though the token is shared among all KMS servers at server-side. The default value of this configuration is false, to be compatible with existing behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen the configuration is set to true, KMS delegation token will use uri as its service. This way, the clients can use it to authenticate with all KMS servers.\r\n\r\nNote that this should only be set to true if ALL clients and renewers are running software that contains HADOOP-14445. Clients running on software without HADOOP-14445 will fail to authenticate if the token is in uri format.","customfield_12310191":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10343","value":"Reviewed","id":"10343"}],"priority":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg","name":"Major","id":"3"},"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12310230":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12313422":"false","customfield_12310310":"34.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12329058","id":"12329058","description":"2.8.0 release","name":"2.8.0","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2017-03-22"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12335733","id":"12335733","description":"3.0.0-alpha1 release","name":"3.0.0-alpha1","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2016-09-03"}],"issuelinks":[{"id":"12523087","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issueLink/12523087","type":{"id":"12310000","name":"Duplicate","inward":"is duplicated by","outward":"duplicates","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/12310000"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"13047048","key":"HADOOP-14134","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13047048","fields":{"summary":"KMSTokenRenewer should renew token from the service address in token.","status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

Although, IIRC, the tokens are renewed only if they are expired, so if they are renewed serially, it should not be a problem.\n\nThe RM renews immediately to verify token validity and to determine the next renewal time.  If they are expired, it's too late.  Any kp token using just a service authority cannot determine the kp uri and is only renewable via the kp uri in the config – enforcing one and only 1 kms cluster.  If the kp client can be instantiated via the service, then multi-kms setups are possible.\n\nbq.  I do like the idea of using a nameservice though, as Yongjun Zhang suggested which will ensure that we will still have only 1 single entry.\n\nThere must be a disconnect here.  1 single entry is the advantage of just setting the service to the provider uri.  Adding an extra layer of indirection through the config creates a logistical mess with no added benefits.  I'm not going to bounce all my services and RMs because I added or changed a KMS cluster.\n\nHere's the big picture we are trying to achieve:\n* client requests kp uri from NN\n* client creates kp client from kp uri\n* client gets tokens and sets service to kp uri\n* RM calls kms token renewer which uses kp uri in service to create kp client\n* tasks use the NN->kp uri mapping established at job submission to locate tokens\n\nIt's +config-less+ other than a setting on the NN.  This is what we are running internally because the current kms client design is completely broken.  We now have the ability to enable EZs on a NN and/or change kms cluster configuration without changing configs or restarting services.\n\nWe only care about this load balancing provider because we need to ensure the kp client can be instantiated from the service.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-06-02T19:48:21.482+0000","updated":"2017-06-02T19:48:21.482+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073925/comment/16037585","id":"16037585","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~daryn],\n\nThanks for your detailed sharing.

HADOOP-14441. The patch would also take care of HADOOP-14134.\r\n\r\nTo summarize and make sure my understanding is correct:\r\n- We all agree the token sharing will be an issue\r\n- For HDFS clients, the kp uri is already provided by NN. (Already done by HADOOP-14104)\r\n- Token should be recognized from UGI credentials when clients trying to authenticate. (reason for HADOOP-14441)\r\n- Token renewal currently reads configs. We'd want this to be read from the token, and make sure it's HA'ed. (reason for HADOOP-14134)\r\n- Besides the ip:port of the KMS instance, there's also information about whether it's http or https. We'd need a way to get this information, during renewal/cancelation.\r\n- Backwards compatible: old clients should work with new server; new clients should work with old server. \r\n\r\nHaving a way to let clients work without reading configs feels to me to be a better approach, and more inline with HADOOP-14104, and the 'transparent' name of HDFS encryption. It feels to me a 'nameservice' solution doesn't add much value than the current way of using the full kp uri, which by itself is a representation of available services. For added KMS scenario, I think it's fine to let existing tokens to use the existing instances in that token's uri - presumbly this is better than deploying the config and restarting the client. For removed KMS instances, LBKMSCP handles it.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me the patch here has handled most of this pretty well. I plan to take a crack at this tomorrow to:\r\n- rebase to trunk\r\n- address some earlier comments\r\n- modify with some of my thoughts: seems we can use LBKMSCP to store the full provider uri; some tests to verify compatibility\r\n\r\nIf you have any comments, please let me know.

Even with this fix, we'd still need the conf. It's not reasonable to let client separate their configurations for different purpose of the hadoop rpc / apis. \r\n\r\nChecking the code, I think old clients / renewer should always work even with the new token. IMO we need to have a fall back logic to the configurations, rather than override. Specifically, when {new clients cannot find the new token format, new renewer cannot create kp from the token format}, they'll use the config as a last measure. Error handling is still tricky since we'd ideally want to tell from the exception or client log on what exactly was attempted and failed.\r\n\r\nOther than the above I think this really should work.\r\n\r\nSome minor comments:\r\n- I'd mark {{DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL#getDelegationTokenService}} as {{InterfaceAudience.Private}}.\r\n- Add comments on the KMSCP override of the above method to explain why.\r\n- I'm scared of {{SecurityUtil#useIpForTokenService}}, which is used to buildTokenService. I don't see any problems but would love to see a test covering it.\r\n- Can we extract the unit-test-only {{KMSUtil}} code to a test-only method, and make it only possible to execute from unit test?

branch-2.8 version of the patch.\r\nExcept for checkstyle warnings, the patch is ready to review.\r\nI thought the trunk and branch-2.8 patch would be identical but that is not the case.\r\nThere is some difference in {{KMSClientProvider}} because of HADOOP-14987.\r\nThe change in HADOOP-14987 is only for debugging purpose and there is no feature or major enhancement.\r\n@Xiao: Since you are one of the contributor in that jira, we can backport that jira all the way back to branch-2.8 if you don't mind.\r\n\r\nI implemented what we discussed in previous comments.\r\nTo summarize let me write below.\r\n* While instantiating {{KMSClientProvider}}, the token service will be initialized to be  the same as {{CommonConfigurationKeysPublic.HADOOP_SECURITY_KEY_PROVIDER_PATH}}.\r\n* {{KMSTokenRenewer}} will try to instantiate {{KeyProvider}} from token service field.\r\nIf it fails to instantiate, it will fallback to the configuration.\r\n\r\nI think that should take care of backward compatibility and key shell use cases.\r\nAlso added a test case to test backward compatibility for token renewal and cancellation.\r\nI have tried to incorporate all the previous review comments from everyone.\r\nPlease let me know if I missed one.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh

improve the comments with {{dtService}} to be clearer. Suggest something along the lines of:\r\n{quote}\r\n/* The value is read from\r\n   * CommonConfigurationKeysPublic.HADOOP_SECURITY_KEY_PROVIDER_PATH from\r\n   * the conf when creating the KeyProvider, and used as the token's service.\r\n   * With this value, later the KeyProviderFactory will be able to instantiate\r\n   * KeyProvider from the token to renew / cancel, without the need to read\r\n   * configs.\r\n{quote}\r\n- Now that we handle the port stuff nicely in unit tests, {{fallbackDefaultPortForTesting}} and related logic can be removed.\r\n- On {{renew}} and {{cancel}}, suggest to add a debug log when {{keyProvider == null}} for supportability.\r\n- Let's use {{HADOOP_SECURITY_KEY_PROVIDER_PATH}} instead of {{KeyProviderFactory.KEY_PROVIDER_PATH}}.\r\n\r\nKMSUtil:\r\n- When {{createKeyProviderForTests}} returns non-null value (before {{return kp}}), add a info log, since this should only happen in tests\r\n\r\nTestKMS:\r\n- It's great to see extra assertions were done in {{getTokenService}}.\r\n- {{doKMSWithZKWithDelegationToken}}, do we need to loop through the tokens and verify? After this fix, there would only be 1 kms-dt mapping to the entire url right? IMO we should verify there's just 1 kms-dt.\r\n- {{doKMSWithZKWithDelegationToken}}, besides verifying renewal, we should also verify some key operations.\r\n- Happy to see the compat test, thanks! We should also verify some key operations too here.\r\n- Trivial, {{createKeyProviderForTests}} should have a line break after.\r\n\r\nHdfsKMSUtil:\r\n- Looks like we can remove the not-used {{createKeyProvider}} method.\r\n\r\nThere is also 1 thing that I think missed in the recent compat discussions:\r\nFor the clients to 'work', besides creating the kp and the token renewer, there is also the complication of {{DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL}} recognizing the token. How would we handle the case there the job submitter's {{DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL#getDelegationTokenService}} did not match the cluster's mapper's version, to prevent issues similar to HADOOP-14441? In other words, if I submit a job using the new jar and get a new format token, but when it's distributed to the cluster, the mappers are still on the old version which tries to get the ip, it won't recognize it and will fall back to kerberos. \r\n\r\nIMHO, since {{token.setService}} is done in KMSCP, what matters here would be to require the job submitter (whoever gets the token) to be on the same version of the mappers (or whatever is actually authenticating using the token). Otherwise, handling this at code level bi-directional would require 1) duplicating the same token with ip (for new submitter, old mapper) and 2) falling back to check old format in DTAuthURL (for old submitter, new mapper), which sounds tedious and ugly. Curious to learn the thoughts from you and [~daryn].","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-12-28T06:35:29.695+0000","updated":"2017-12-28T06:35:29.695+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073925/comment/16308703","id":"16308703","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks [~xiaochen] for the review.\r\nbq. There is also 1 thing that I think missed in the recent compat discussions:\r\nThat is an excellent catch.\r\nThe general contract for hadoop upgrade is client should be the last one to upgrade after all the servers are upgraded.\r\nBut this argument doesn't hold true for multi cluster support. We need to support that.\r\nPersonally I don't like the idea of duplicatiing the tokens with different service fields because once the token lifetime expires, RM will have to renew 2 tokens instead of one.\r\n\r\nOne way I can think is have a conf like {{hadoop.kms.token.use.new.format}} and treat this release as bridge release.\r\nDefault this conf to false.\r\nIf the conf value is false, the client will create the token with old format.\r\nKMSCP will have support for renewing/cancelling both format of tokens.\r\n\r\nOnce all the servers, clients, servers and all the clusters are upgraded, set the conf value to true.\r\nIf the conf value is true, it will add the token with new format.\r\nI am also not a big supporter of conf based solutions but to ensure backwards compatibility I am proposing this.\r\nXiao: Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nDaryn is not back from vacation. He should be in tomorrow. I will discuss with him tomorrow and will update the ticket.\r\nI will address all the review comments in next patch when we have clear way for fixing the last compatibility issue.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-01-02T21:02:08.637+0000","updated":"2018-01-02T21:02:08.637+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073925/comment/16309242","id":"16309242","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the comments Rushabh.\r\n\r\nAgree on duplicating tokens is bad. Conf solution would be better than duplicating tokens, and is necessary for compat. This will bring us down to only support 1-direction compat (instead of bi-directional).\r\nBut even with conf, there could also be a time that it's not rolled to all nodes simultaneously (e.g. config deploy timing, multi-cluster etc.). Good we can control when the token creation would use new format, but it looks like we'd still need the fallback in {{DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL#getDelegationTokenService}} right (which I'm okay with...)? I thought this could be another layer of authfilters, which can be taken out once we're sure no one is using the old token format.

Quick recap since conversation has been fragmented across multiple jiras:\r\nThe LB provider requests 1 token, like it should, but it’s used only for that specific kms.  Ironic the load balancer increased load since it only works by retries cycling back to that kms, doesn't tolerate if that kms goes down, and it went unnoticed.  This Jira proposed originally proposed obtaining n-many tokens from each subordinate kms, even though a token from 1 will work for all.  The RM would have to unnecessarily renew n-many tokens and if one renew fails, job submission fails.  Not good.\r\n\r\nRushabh's original goal addresses a huge kms token renewal issue: it always uses the conf.  A server like the RM cannot support a multi-kms environment.  The fix is use the kms provider's uri as the token service so the same provider can later be instantiated for renewal.  This also elegantly allows the LB provider to use a single token for all subordinate providers by using its own uri.  But it poses compatibility issues for job submitted by a new client that runs old tasks.\r\n\r\n––\r\n\r\nThe semantics for getDelegationTokenService are oddly cyclical.  I'd expect it, like other hadoop clients, to premeditate the service name.  The latest patch is looking at the creds to decide the service based on whether a token exists so it can attempt to look up a token for that service – which it already looked up.\r\n\r\nI’d prefer for the compatibility to be cleaner, and easier to revoke in the future.  The patch falls back to conf by assuming URISyntaxException means old service, however a malformed new service should fail to avoid surprises.  If it looks like a uri, it must be a valid uri.  Simplest approach is check if it contains ://.\r\n\r\nI'm also uneasy about a client-side config to control compatibility since clients are notoriously hard to upgrade.\r\n\r\nAn alternative could remove the service guesswork, client conf, and be a bit more compatible by using a new token kind.  The current one is “kms-dt” whereas the standard naming convention should be “KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN”.  The old token kind could continue using the conf, as today, while the new kind requires a service uri.  Effectively the current/old code remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nThere are tradeoffs to support old clients that must use the host:port.  I know I objected to duplicating tokens, but I’ll acquiesce if it provides a cleaner approach.  Duplicating a new KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN/uri token into a single kms-dt/host:port is \"no worse than today\":\r\n* Pro: Old client finds kms-dt from old client.\r\n* Pro: Old client finds kms-dt from new client.\r\n* Pro: New client finds kms-dt from old client.\r\n* Pro: New client finds KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN from new client.\r\n* Pro: Old RM renews the kms-dt for both old/new clients.\r\n* *Con*: New RM renews KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN from new clients, effectively a double renew for the same token as kms-dt.\r\n\r\nIf we are willing to sacrifice a bit for new client + old RM:  Abuse fact that old kms clients look for a host:port service regardless of kind.  We can trick the RM into not renewing the unknown kind, ex. “kms-dt-deprecated”, to avoid the double renew.\r\n* Pro: Old client finds kms-dt from old client.\r\n* Pro: Old client finds kms-dt-deprecated from new client (remember, doesn't care about kind)\r\n* Pro: New client finds kms-dt from old client.\r\n* Pro: New client finds KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN from new client.\r\n* Pro: Old RM renews the kms-dt for old clients (all it knows about)\r\n* *Con*: Old RM renews nothing for new clients (doesn't know KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN or kms-dt-deprecated)\r\n* Pro: New RM renews kms-dt for old clients.\r\n* Pro: New RM renews KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN for new clients (not kms-dt-deprecated)\r\n\r\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2018-01-29T18:16:09.161+0000","updated":"2018-01-29T18:16:09.161+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073925/comment/16344105","id":"16344105","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~daryn] for circling back with the new idea. Mixed feeling (and head scratching)! :)\r\n\r\nI think a new and standardized token kind should work, and conveniently eliminate the need for changing client configs, so SGTM. We may also check in the RM, when its {{DelegationTokenRenewer}} received a set of tokens, and there are both kms-dt and KMS_D_T with the same sequence number, only renew the KMS_D_T.\r\nFor that to work, we'd need a new {{KMSDelegationTokenIdentifier}} class and a new {{DelegationTokenAuthenticationHandler}} too. \r\n\r\nCurious: with the current approach (patch 3) we need just an additional config deployment after the upgrade, right? What changed your mind from [earlier|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-14445?focusedCommentId=16279134&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16279134] (assuming the implementation comments are addressed) ?\r\n\r\nI'd rather prefer not to sacrifice old RM + new client.

Token issues are not the easiest to figure out, and IMO we should avoid this case when we can.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-01-29T22:12:31.310+0000","updated":"2018-01-29T22:12:31.310+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073925/comment/16383829","id":"16383829","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~shahrs87] [~daryn],\r\n\r\nWhat's the progress for this one?

Code needs cleaning up but it should show the general idea. [~shahrs87] and [~daryn], would you mind to take a quick look to see if this converges with what you had in mind?\r\n - Added a new token kind {{KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN}}, and made the old {{kms-dt}} deprecated.\r\n - New client will dup a legacy token if the newly created token is the new kind. This duplication is on by default but can be turned off by config.\r\n - On authentication, the token selection logic will first favor the new kind, and fall back to the old way if not found.\r\n - Added a dedicated Renewer to handle the new token kind. Old renewer behavior unchanged.\r\n\r\nTested this works via some cross-cluster bidirectional distcp runs, where one cluster was upgraded and one was not. Will go through the patch on Wednesday to polish things up, and add more unit tests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-03-07T08:00:30.849+0000","updated":"2018-03-07T08:00:30.849+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073925/comment/16390877","id":"16390877","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch 5 ready for review. \r\n\r\nAll previous comments addressed, except for this one from [~daryn] that I want some discussions:\r\n{quote}The semantics for getDelegationTokenService are oddly cyclical.  I'd expect it, like other hadoop clients, to premeditate the service name. ...\r\n{quote}\r\nIf I understand correctly, in this patch it would be {{KMSCP#getKMSToken}}.

Indeed client versions are hard to manage - the config is only a way to not duplicate tokens once we're sure everything is upgraded.

The method name suggests that we are just adding token to credentials object.\r\n But we are doing much more in this method.\r\n I would add {{credentials.addToken}} line to calling method {{addDelegationTokens}} and rename method {{addTokenToCredentials}} to something like {{createLegacyKmsToken}}\r\n and add some javadoc to it saying that creating this token is dependent on conf key {{KMS_CLIENT_COPY_LEGACY_TOKEN_KEY}}.\r\n\r\n+DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL.java+\r\n 1. Lets change the {{selectDelegationToken}} to {{getDelegationToken}}.\r\n In the base implementation, we are not implementing any Selector.\r\n We are just getting the token based on the service field.\r\n In {{KMSCP}} we can change the method name {{getKMSToken}} to {{selectKMSToken}} because there we are implementing {{TokenSelector}}.\r\n\r\n+core-default.xml+\r\n{quote}With the default value set to true, the client will locally duplicate the KMS_DELEGATION_TOKEN token and create a kms-dt token, all other parts of the token remain the same.\r\n{quote}\r\nTechnically this is not true. The service is also changed.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I _should have_ mentioned all the above comments in the previous review.\r\n\r\n+TestKMS.java+\r\n 1. This is unrelated to patch.\r\n Do we really want to stop kdc after every test ?\r\n 2. {{providersCreated}}: Should this be a list or just {{KeyProvider}} ?\r\n It will always create {{LoadBalancingKeyProivder}} which internally is a set of {{KeyProvider}}.\r\n {{LoadBalancingKMSCP}} never throws IOException back. It just swallows all the {{IOException}} and just logs it.\r\n Maybe we might want to return MultipleIOException from {{LoadBalancingKMSCP#close}}. Totally fine if we want to do it as a separate jira.\r\n But as far as this jira is concerned, we can get rid of {{MultipleIOException}} related changes and can just change it to {{IOException}}.\r\n 3. {{testKMSHAZKDelegationTokenRenewCancel(final Text tokenKind)}}\r\n Unable to understand why were are calling {{setupConfForToken}} multiple times.\r\n If we filter out all tokens other than passed {{tokenKind}}, then we can just call {{setupConfForToken}} once at the start.\r\n That way the code will be more clean and _will only_ work on {{token == tokenKind}}.\r\n In short just one for loop, filter out the token at the start and test renew, cancel and again renew(which should fail) in sequence.\r\n\r\n4. {{testTokenCompatibilityOldRenewer}}\r\n This test ran for {{34.887}} on my local machine.\r\n I am sure majority of time was spent in sleeping for token to expire.\r\n Can we decrease the {{renewInterval}} period to less than 30 seconds (maybe 5 seconds or so).\r\n Also the test renewed the token 30 times. Is that expected ?\r\n Did you mean to renew after while the code came out of while loop ?\r\n\r\n \r\n{quote}LOG.info(\"Rolling key {} via provider {} with tokenUGi.\",keyName);\r\n kp.createKey(\"newkey\", new KeyProvider.Options(conf));\r\n{quote}\r\nThe log line should be {{creating a new key}} instead of {{Rolling key}}.\r\nLet me know if any part is unclear.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-03-25T06:43:31.772+0000","updated":"2018-03-25T06:43:31.772+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073925/comment/16413343","id":"16413343","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~shahrs87], will work on the review comments this week.\r\n{quote}Daryn Sharp shared his concerns offline that this patch is dependent on config key and we will live with the baggage of 2 tokens forever. ...

While a small renew interval would mean less wait, it also poses higher risks of flaky test failures if the authentication did not run within that time. Jenkins slaves are usually unreliable. Ideally one should find a way to haul into the secret manager, and change intervals from the test - but that seems pretty messy to do so left as-is.

My collection from the earlier discussion was that this was deemed an acceptable behavior.

This means if the new software runs with old software (when the config {{hadoop.security.kms.client.token.use.uri.format}} isn't changed), it would behave the same. Hence the {{DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL#selectDelegationToken}} is simply a code refactor.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that refactor is that, we can override this behavior in KMSCP and work our way for the new format. The reason it falls back to DTAURL to select token is for compat.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-08-16T03:34:25.994+0000","updated":"2018-08-16T03:34:25.994+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13073925/comment/16586171","id":"16586171","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"{quote}Will the token selector still be able to find the matching token (AbstractDelegationTokenSelector#selectToken()) to renew?
