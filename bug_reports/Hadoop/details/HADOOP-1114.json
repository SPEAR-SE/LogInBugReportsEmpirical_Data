I'm coming to this rather late.  But, for what it's worth, the prior behavior was intentional.  The CLASSPATH environment variable is fragile to use.  Folks can end up with lots of crazy stuff on it (e.g., conflicting versions of libraries) that can break things in confusing ways.  Thus it's generally better to not rely on it.\n\nSun subtly discourages using the CLASSPATH environment variable:\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/classpath.html#env%20var\n\nTomcat's startup scripts erase any pre-existing CLASSPATH values:\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/container/tc5.5.x/catalina/src/bin/setclasspath.sh\n\nHowever, Ant does respect it:\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/ant/core/trunk/src/script/ant?view=markup\n\nTo add things to Hadoop's classpath one can simply add files to Hadoop's lib directory (as folks typically add junit's jar to ant's lib).  If that's insufficient, I'd rather we add a HADOOP_CLASSPATH environment variable than use the fragile, global CLASSPATH.\n\nWhat do others think?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-04-10T16:42:13.470+0000","updated":"2007-04-10T16:42:13.470+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364769/comment/12487857","id":"12487857","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bien","name":"bien","key":"bien","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Bieniosek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Currently, the hadoop runjar commands takes a single user jar as argument.  However, our jar depends on other (custom) java libraries.  So we get around this by this CLASSPATH hack.  We could drop dependent jars into the hadoop lib file, but I'd rather not mix shipped hadoop code with our user code.\n\nWe could package all the dependent code into the same jar, but that seems unnecessary.  A better alternative might be to set a CLASSPATH in the jar manifest, but I haven't thought very much about how that would work.\n\nSo unless there is another better yet simple method, we need some way to insert jar dependencies into hadoop.  Your example of Tomcat is a bit different, since there is a well-defined mechanism for getting dependent jars into servlet containers (using the WEB-INF/lib directory). \n\nIt doesn't seem very worthwhile to rename CLASSPATH to HADOOP_CLASSPATH.  \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bien","name":"bien","key":"bien","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Bieniosek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-04-10T18:04:43.331+0000","updated":"2007-04-10T18:04:43.331+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364769/comment/12487907","id":"12487907","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> We could package all the dependent code into the same jar, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nWhy is this unnecessary?
