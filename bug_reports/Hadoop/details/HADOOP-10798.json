The obvious solution is to have localFS sort its output on Linux, but this will cripple performance by forcing us to buffer the whole list of files before we return anything (in addition to the cost of the sort itself, of course).\n\nIt would be a bit easier to do in globStatus, since we always have an array there (unlike in listStatus where we might just have an iterator), but the same issues crop up.  We're slowing stuff down, for a feature most don't need.\n\nDo users really depend on this behavior, or can we just drop this from the spec?  I guess the shell probably wants sorted output, to provide a consistent display.  But it can sort it itself, of course.

McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"OK, I did a little more research into this.  The {{globStatus}} code back in 2.0.3-alpha does sort the entries it returned.  Around Hadoop 2.3, the sort was lost during the globber rewrite.  This was a bug, but it was hidden by the fact that HDFS sorts its listStatus entries (this behavior is undocumented, but 100% consistent).\n\nSince the API documentation says that sorted entries are returned, and since this is the case for the vast majority of use-cases (i.e. when using Hadoop with HDFS), I think changing this behavior in {{globStatus}} would be an incompatible change.  Any user code relying on the old documented behavior would break.  Let's commit the original patch I posted to fix this situation.  If we want to have a discussion about changing the API contract we can have that discussion for Hadoop 3.0 only.\n\nalso I feel that the facts that:\n1. globStatus has historically had a sort in it\n2. users who want to optimize by avoiding a sort can use listStatus\n\nstrongly suggest that changing this behavior is not a good idea, even in 3.x.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
