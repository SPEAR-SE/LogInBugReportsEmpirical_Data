Since the goal has been to mimic the real shell, this non-posix \"feature\" was intentionally (again?) removed to solve this jira.\n\nIt also resolves the inconsistency between single source vs. multiple sources copies.  Single source copy would formerly auto-create non-existent dirs, but a multi-source copy fails if the target isn't an existing dir.  Ergo, copying a glob to a non-existent path was indeterminate depending on the number of glob matches: 1 match auto-created, more than 1 match failed.\n\nInternally, we found the impact to be minimal (a single mkdir), so we favored retaining the posix semantics of copy.  Some relied on the auto-create because mkdir failed if the directory already exists, thus HADOOP-8175 added a -p flag.\n\nIf you feel strongly on restoring the former non-posix behavior and single/multi source inconsistency, I can look into doing so.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-03-26T14:33:23.983+0000","updated":"2012-03-26T14:33:23.983+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12544868/comment/13238632","id":"13238632","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli2","name":"eli2","key":"eli2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I like the new behavior as well, and I suppose an alpha is the best time to introduce it.
