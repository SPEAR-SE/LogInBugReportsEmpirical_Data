Would it make sense to go further and *require* all Paths to be dereferenced this way? There's a lot of string manipulation and special-casing in Path, particularly for Windows filesystems. Pushing that out to the FS seems like a reasonable abstraction. Introducing a new type would also let users employ POSIX semantics for Paths, but URI semantics for Hadoop Paths (as in HADOOP-1858). The new type could even be a subtype of Path, where Path assumes the default FileSystem where it's used in a URI context (just as it does now). It would be a pervasive/risky change, though...\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-09-25T20:17:44.956+0000","updated":"2007-09-25T20:17:44.956+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12378217/comment/12530271","id":"12530271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> There's a lot of string manipulation and special-casing in Path, particularly for Windows filesystems. Pushing that out to the FS seems like a reasonable abstraction.\n\nOne problem is that there's lots of code that passes things returned by File#getPath() to 'new Path(String)', and Windows file names are invalid URI paths.  When we added Path.java to Hadoop we needed to do so back compatibly, since lots of user code manipulates file names and we didn't want to break it.\n\nTo avoid processing Windows-specifics in Path.java and stay compatible, we'd need to either avoid creating URIs in a Path at all, or we'd have to escape backslashes and colons in the URI's path, and have FileSystem implementations remove those escapes.  Perhaps that would work, although it might be hard to make it back-compatible with existing code.\n\nI've pulled a lot of my hair out in the process of getting Path to work on Windows and am personally reluctant to revisit this.  But feel free to experiment and see if you can find a cleaner approach.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-09-25T20:46:19.640+0000","updated":"2007-09-25T20:46:19.640+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12378217/comment/12570504","id":"12570504","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"am closing this bug as a wont fix since have \".\" return an empty path suffices for now.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-02-19T23:46:29.135+0000","updated":"2008-02-19T23:46:29.135+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-1891/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0ihr3:"}}
