The old behavior looks at the full maven output, chops off everything after the first \"Javadoc Warnings\", and then counts anything with \"[WARNING]\" and \"warning\" in it. Unfortunately, that includes javac warnings as well. The new behavior doesn't bother with the chop, and thus results in counting more warnings, but still not the actual number of Javadoc warnings.\n\nI tried this, and it seems to work more reliably:\n\n{code}\ncat patchJavadocWarnings.txt | egrep \"^[0-9]+ warnings$\" | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}'\n{code}\n\nWe could also be more sure by doing something like \"egrep -A 1 ...\" and making sure the same number of \" # warnings\" lines matches the number of lines with \"[WARNING] Javadoc Warnings\" (i.e., each \"# warning\" line has an immediately following \"[WARNING] Javadoc Warnings\").","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-05T01:36:22.932+0000","updated":"2014-02-05T01:36:22.932+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12693246/comment/13892382","id":"13892382","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
