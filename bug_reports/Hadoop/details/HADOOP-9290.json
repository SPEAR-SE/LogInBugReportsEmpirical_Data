However, this doesn't seem feasible, because Maven evaluates variables after evaluating inheritance.  For example, this means that even if hadoop-project/pom.xml refers to basedir, then it evaluates to the basedir of the child project, and not hadoop-project's value.\n\nConsidering that, it seems we're forced into doing a bit of duplication.  Here is an idea that will at least minimize the amount of duplication:\n\n# hadoop-project/pom.xml defines a property, hadoop.common.build.dir, set to basedir/../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target.\n# hadoop-project/pom.xml defines LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH in terms of hadoop.common.build.dir.\n# For the majority of sub-modules, the default value will be correct, because most sub-modules have a depth of 2 in the source tree.\n# For sub-modules at a different depth, change its pom.xml to provide a different definition for hadoop.common.build.dir.  I believe the overrides needed would be:\n## hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/pom.xml needs to use ../../.. in the relative path\n## hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn needs to use ../../.. in the relative path\n## hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-applications needs to use ../../../.. in the relative path\n## hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server needs to use ../../../.. in the relative path\n\nIf my understanding of pom.xml inheritance is correct (which is not guaranteed!), then evaluation of LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH will end up using the child's definition of hadoop.common.build.dir.  This way, at least we won't have to duplicate the entire maven-surefire-plugin configuration in each sub-module.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-23T19:22:24.509+0000","updated":"2013-04-23T19:22:24.509+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12631183/comment/13639472","id":"13639472","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Chris,\n\nI spent some time on this back in Feb. As you have discovered Maven makes this hard to solve. The problem with my attached patch is that it requires the build to be invoked from the root directory.\n\nHere are my notes from then with a few other things I tried:\n\n# Setting a relative path starting with ${basedir}. This did not work because the other projects evaluate basedir independently so depending on the level of nesting this does not work. e.g. ${basedir}/../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/urs/local/lib works for HDFS tests but not for mapreduce tests. This is what you have just discovered too.\n# Using ${session.executionRootDirectory}/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/urs/local/lib works if the build is called from the root directory but fails otherwise.\n# Exporting the setting into a build.properties file via the root pom.xml using the Properties-maven-plugin. This causes a chicken and egg problem since the sub-projects do not know where to read the build.properties file from.\n# profiles.xml would have worked but it has been deprecated for Maven 3.\n# Setting a system property via the Properties-maven-plugin plugin but system properties are not exported to child projects.\n\n\nThe simplest solution which just works is to add duplicate entries in the path for different levels of nesting (2-4 should do the trick I think). i.e.\n{code}\n-                <PATH>${env.PATH};${basedir}/../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/bin</PATH>\n+                <PATH>${env.PATH};${basedir}/../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/bin;${basedir}/../../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/bin;${basedir}/../../../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/bin</PATH>\n{code}\n\nI am not sure if it is better or worse than requiring overrides in individual pom files.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-23T19:36:45.415+0000","updated":"2013-04-23T19:36:45.415+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12631183/comment/13639505","id":"13639505","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"{quote}\nThe simplest solution which just works is to add duplicate entries in the path for different levels of nesting (2-4 should do the trick I think).\n{quote}\n\nI'd be +1 for that approach.
