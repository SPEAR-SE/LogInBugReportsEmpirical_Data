Consider the case where you have /a/b, where\n// b is a symlink to \"..\".  In that case, listing /a/b will give\n// back \"/a/b\" again.  If we just went by returned pathname, we'd\n// incorrectly conclude that /a/b was a file and should not match\n// /a/*/*.  So we use getFileStatus of the path we just listed to\n// disambiguate.\n {code}\n\nUnfortunately, removing this code isn't possible.  In the presence of symlinks, the result of {{listStatus}} is simply ambiguous when it returns only one item.  Comparing paths won't work, because of the way symlinks play with paths.  The only way around this would be adding a new RPC (or a new option to the old {{listStatus}} RPC) that would let us know whether we listed a directory or file.\n\nAnyway, v2 of the patch is super minimal.  It basically just adds a fix for the case where we tried to recurse into a file when handling a glob.  I also took the liberty of fixing two lines that had bad indentation in Globber.java, and avoiding the \"no groups found for user\" spew by adding this:\n\n{code}\n-      UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser(\"myuser\");\n+    UserGroupInformation.createUserForTesting(\"myuser\",\n+        new String[] { \"mygroup\" });\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Unfortunately, removing this code isn't possible.
