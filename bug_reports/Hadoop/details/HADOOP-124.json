Locking at the directory level seems like a good hedge against that sort of problem. As a bonus - it'll prevent blocks from getting removed if someone mistakenly starts up a second set of datanodes against a different namenode, as long as the datanode daemon for the competing DFS instance is running on the machine.\n\nKeeping track of only one copy of a block for a given IP seems like a good start, but might be too simple. What if, by some unfortunate process, a lot of duplicates get stored on a node. If there's no way to detect this, it could be that a bunch of copies of a block end up being duplicated on a node unnecessarily. One way out of that would be to notice if a host is reporting more than one copy of a block, and kick off a knee-jerk fix: 1) Extra-replicate the block 2) Ask the node with dups to remove its copies of the block. Of course, in the case where two datanode instances are somehow servicing from the same directory, the knee-jerk reaction would kick off for all blocks that get stored into that space - so locking would definitely be necessary to make this work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bpendleton","name":"bpendleton","key":"bpendleton","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan

Then, if we need, we can reveal more later as needed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-06-01T01:08:36.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-01T01:08:36.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12331786/comment/12414128","id":"12414128","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this, modified to make most of the new classes package-private rather than public.
