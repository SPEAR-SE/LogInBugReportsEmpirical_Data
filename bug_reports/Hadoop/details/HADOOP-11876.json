The reason for this bug is that I was previously printing stats for every new directory, and later decided it's nicer to print stats for large number of new \"objects\" (files or directories) instead. \n\nThis is a minor issue - and since I'm refactoring this I've also changed the minor retry logic to make code nicer and more readable.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12727961","id":"12727961","filename":"HADOOP-11876.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=3opan","name":"3opan","key":"3opan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244"},"displayName":"Zoran Dimitrijevic","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-24T17:28:01.603+0000","size":2484,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12727961/HADOOP-11876.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Refactor code to make it more readable, minor maybePrintStats bug","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=3opan","name":"3opan","key":"3opan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244"},"displayName":"Zoran Dimitrijevic","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=3opan","name":"3opan","key":"3opan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=3opan&avatarId=32244"},"displayName":"Zoran Dimitrijevic","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":"2015-04-30","customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12823810/comment/14511608","id":"14511608","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\\\\\n\\\\\n| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | pre-patch |  14m 35s | Pre-patch trunk compilation is healthy. |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | @author |   0m  0s | The patch does not contain any @author tags. |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | tests included |   0m  0s | The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
