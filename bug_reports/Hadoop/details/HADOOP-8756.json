The patch could be revised to manually search java.library.path, I guess.

Flume would be a good example here: since it launches the JVM directly it has to also makes sure it sets up LD_LIBRARY_PATH if we don't provide the manual search capability in core hadoop itself.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that we have to have a solution for things like Flume.
