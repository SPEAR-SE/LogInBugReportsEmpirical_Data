JVMs can exit unexpectedly.  We hope it doesn't happen often, but we must be able to handle that situation.  If we need to, e.g., clean up temp files, we do that on startup.\n\nThe reason this was added was to handle the case where the tasktracker has exited and the child is somehow hung.  We must not leave stray, hung, JVMs around.  Thread.interrupt() is not reliable enough.  When a thread is hung, it will not recieve an interrupt.  I've seen this frequently when fetching, where socket read()  requests hang indefinitely, despite the socket having a short read timeout.\n\nSo I'd be happy to have this first try to exit more gracefully, but, after a time, it should still call exit().  The child processes do not have a pid file.  Once their parent has died, nothing tracks them, so they must reliably exit fairly quickly when their parent dies.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-04-14T04:40:22.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-14T04:40:22.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12332100/comment/12374423","id":"12374423","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ok, I can see wanting to try gently first and then pull out the exit sledgehammer if it doesn't work.\n\nChecking back with the taskTracker once a second seems too frequent.\n\nI'd also propose changing the ping message to return a boolean that means the task should exit, so that IOException can mean that there was a communication error.
