Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree with removing the call to exit(), but I don't see the need to change the exception.\n\nTo my thinking, this replaces the standard main() signature:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n  ...\n}\n\nFolks frequently write main() to not throw anything, and then catch exceptions and print the stacktrace.  This just makes the code bigger, since the JVM already prints the stack trace when a main() throws an exception.  It also makes it harder to call the main() programatically (which is ocassionally useful) since you'll have no idea whether it has somehow failed.  So this is why I argue that main() routines should throw Exception, and analagously, why our replacement should do the same.  Otherwise we'll just have folks catching other exceptions and repackaging them in IOException, adding pointless code.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-07-11T17:50:07.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-11T17:50:07.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12345029/comment/12420335","id":"12420335","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dbowen","name":"dbowen","key":"dbowen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Bowen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"\nI think it is better to be as explicit as possible about which (checked) Exceptions your main() routine is not handling.
