Since we can't know what else is running on the system, we can't really tailor ourselves to respect the global number of FDs.\n\nEven if we only consider the per-process limit, there are difficult race conditions involved.  For example, if there are 3 per-process fds left, the connection throttler can try to limit itself to 3 more connections-- but then, if another thread jumps in and opens a file for some reason-- you are unable to open the last socket.  Consequently, if we did do this, we'd have to have a high \"slop factor.\"\n\nI'm also a little bit afraid that if we automatically throttle ourselves in the case of a low per-process FD limit, this will result in users not realizing why their performance has degraded.  At the very least, if we do implement such throttling, we should prominently log an ERROR message when throttling kicks in.  I have a feeling that doing this kind of thing will hurt us significantly in benchmarks.  I also don't see a clear benefit, since running with a low number of max fds is almost always a misconfiguration.\n\nSo for these reasons, I would advocate a manually configured connection throttle.  The default should be either no limit or something very large.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Alas, it's not trivial but shouldn't be too hard.\n\nThe current approach of relying on the idle scan doesn't work because outstanding call metrics are wrong.  Out of band RPC messages (ex. sasl) don't increment on read, but do decrement on response.  I think I filed a jira a long time ago about it.  The acceptor will go into a spin loop scanning for connections that will never be considered idle, all the while spewing garbage and increasing GC pressure.\n\nThe easiest middle ground is probably to just accept & close the connection.  It's not very friendly to clients, but it's a lot better than the NN dying.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-01-30T21:37:13.272+0000","updated":"2015-01-30T21:37:13.272+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618360/comment/14299273","id":"14299273","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"The new patch closes the connection right away.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-01-30T22:00:32.286+0000","updated":"2015-01-30T22:00:32.286+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618360/comment/14299343","id":"14299343","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
