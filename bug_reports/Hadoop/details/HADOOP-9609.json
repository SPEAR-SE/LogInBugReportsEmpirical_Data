I don’t think we want to do this (see HADOOP-8037 for some history on what it’s done in packageBinNativeHadoop.sh). I see two possible alternatives we can move forward with:\n1.\tUse packageNativeHadoop.py for both package and bin-package target when on Windows, but still use packageBinNativeHadoop.sh when on Linux. This would be a quick and simple fix for this Jira.\n2.\tCreate packageBinNativeHadoop.py that would be a Windows equivalent of packageBinNativeHadoop.sh. This would however require a bit more work, as we’d want to satisfy the idea behind the bin-package target, which is to produce a platform specific target (for example, on Windows this would be hadoop-x.y.z-amd64-bin.winpkg.zip). \n\nI am personally fine with both approaches.

I did notice the difference between packageNativeHadoop and packageBinNativeHadoop.\n\nAfter taking a look at HADOOP-8037, I think your approach 1 makes more sense. In HADOOP-8037, the main reason to create platform (x64 vs amd64) dependent destinations was to accommodate Linux packaging requirements. On Linux, we have install scripts that will install the binaries to different destinations (/usr/lib vs /usr/lib64) and set java.library.path accordingly in .deb and .rpm packages. On Windows, we don't do such things, and it makes more sense to use 'package' settings, i.e. put the binary under 'lib/native'. Also the platform is already part of the path, so there will be no confusing.\n\nI still need to create a packageBinNativeHadoop.py because [Ant exec|http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/exec.html] does not support 'if' condition.\n\nI have tested building on Windows and Ubuntu, and both passes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-04T05:06:52.464+0000","updated":"2013-06-04T05:06:52.464+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12650188/comment/13684578","id":"13684578","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Thanks Chuan, sounds good.\n\nI noticed one difference between the new script and original sh script.
