Sigh!\n\n----\n\nUnrelated rant: My head still hurts from having to track this down in the mess that the TaskTracker has evolved into... I guess we need to seriously start thinking of cleaning up the TaskTracker, moving TaskTracker.TaskInProgress (very bad name too!) to it's own file, simplifying the interaction between the child TaskAttempt and the TaskTracker etc. Thoughts?
