In particular, these points need clarification:\n\n1.) Text: \"You should be able to obtain the MapReduce tarball from the release.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the MapReduce tarball?  What is its name?  I don't see such an object within the hadoop-0.23.5.tar.gz download.\n\n2.) Quote: \"NOTE: You will need protoc installed of version 2.4.1 or greater.\"\n\nProtoc doesn't have a website you can link to (it's just mentioned offhand when you Google it) -- is it really the case today that Hadoop has a dependency on such a minor project?  At any rate, if you can have a link of where one goes to get/install Protoc that would be good.\n\n3.) Quote: \"Assuming you have installed hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs and exported $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/$HADOOP_HDFS_HOME, untar hadoop mapreduce tarball and set environment variable $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME to the untarred directory.\"\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by the forward slashes: hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs and $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/$HADOOP_HDFS_HOME -- do you mean & (install both) or *or* just install one of the two?  This needs clarification--please remove the forward slash and replace it with what you're trying to say.  The audience here is complete newbie and they've been brought to this page from here: http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r0.23.5/ (same with r2.0.2-alpha/) (quote: \"Getting Started - The Hadoop documentation includes the information you need to get started using Hadoop. Begin with the Single Node Setup which shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation.\"), they've downloaded hadoop-0.23.5.tar.gz and want to know what to do next.  Why are there potentially two applications -- hadoop-common and hadoop-hdfs and not just one?  (The download doesn't appear to have two separate apps) -- if there is indeed just one app can we remove the other from the above text to avoid confusion?\n\nAgain, I just downloaded hadoop-0.23.5.tar.gz -- do I need to download more?  If so, let us know in the docs here.\n\nAlso, the fragment: \"Assuming you have installed hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs...\"  No, I haven't, that's what *this* page is supposed to explain to me how to do -- how do I install these two (or just one of these two)?\n\nAlso, what do I set $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME and/or $HADOOP_HDFS_HOME to?\n\n4.) Quote: \"NOTE: The following instructions assume you have hdfs running.\"  No, I don't--how do I do this?  Again, this page is supposed to teach me that.\n\n5.) Quote: \"To start the ResourceManager and NodeManager, you will have to update the configs. Assuming your $HADOOP_CONF_DIR is the configuration directory...\"\n\nCould you clarify here what the \"configuration directory\" is, it doesn't exist in the 0.23.5 download.  I just see bin,etc,include,lib,libexec,sbin,share folders but no \"conf\" one.)\n\n6.) Quote: \"Assuming that the environment variables $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME, $HADOOP_HDFS_HOME, $HADOO_MAPRED_HOME, $YARN_HOME, $JAVA_HOME and $HADOOP_CONF_DIR have been set appropriately.\"\n\nWe'll need to know what to set YARN_HOME to here.\n\nThanks!\nGlen","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"252346","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"\"Setting up a Single Node Cluster\" instructions need improvement in 0.23.5/2.0.2-alpha branches","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gmazza","name":"gmazza","key":"gmazza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Glen Mazza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gmazza","name":"gmazza","key":"gmazza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Glen Mazza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627478/comment/13553092","id":"13553092","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Note that the docs are being converted from XDOC to APT; see HADOOP-8427 and HADOOP-9190.
