It would be nice to:\n\n1) Have a \"health check\" running on a map reduce. If any data isn't available, emmit periodic warnings, and maybe have a timeout for if the data never comes back. Such warnings *should* specify which file(s) are affected by the missing blocks.\n2) Have a utility, possible part of the existing dfs utility, which can check for dfs files with unlocatable blocks. Possibly, even show a 'health' of a file - ie, what percentage of its blocks are currently at the desired replication level.
