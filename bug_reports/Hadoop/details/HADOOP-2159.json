A valid block is a block that belongs to a file. The counter is called blockSafe.  The name node does not leave the safe mode automatically if the ratio of blockSafe to the total number of valid blocks is less the threshold.\n\n I see a bug in maintaining this counter. Before the counter is incremented, the name node check if the block is valid.  Before it does not do the check before this counter is decremented.\n\nWhen a dfs cluster is started, if an early started data node has stale blocks, the name node will ask the data node to delete the stale blocks as the reply to its first block report. If its second block report comes in when the name node is still in safe mode, those blocks will be removed from the blocks map, and the blockSafe counter will also be decremented even though those blocks are invalid. So the cluster will end up with a blockSafe counter that's smaller than the number of valid blocks in namenode. If the threshold is set to be 1, the cluster will not be able to leave the safe mode.
