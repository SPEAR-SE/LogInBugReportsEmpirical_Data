Looks good.\n\nI still think that the algorithm is CPU-heavy in the case when there are many replicas to delete. But I do not have an alternative lighter-wright algorithm. HDFS allows an application to set the replication factor of a file. Even if dfs.replication.max is set to something reasonable (e.g. 40), the excess replica deletion could potentially need to get rid of 30 odd replicas. In this case, it could eat considerable CPU. This was the reason why I suggested that we can move this method outside the FSNamesystem lock.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2007-06-07T17:07:55.350+0000","updated":"2007-06-07T17:07:55.350+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12368158/comment/12502544","id":"12502544","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"First of all I think removing 30 replicas is not a common case. Even there is such a case, my algorithm should not be more CPU heavier than the current algorithm. The only overhead is to split all replicas into two sets, but this is done once for all excessive replicas. When selecting a replica to remove, my algorithm scans only one of the two sets while the current algorithm scans all replicas. So in average my algorithm should cut the scanning cost by half. \n\nAlternatively I can build a heap to support replica removal when the number of excessive replicas is big.
