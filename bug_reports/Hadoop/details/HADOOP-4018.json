The problem we saw was with 0.17.1. The number of completed jobs in memory has been reduced from the default of 100 to 20. When the problem occured there were about 400 total jobs in the JT (running + completed + failed). I do not know how many jobs were run by the JobTracker since it was last started. This particular job had 60,000 mappers. About half of these tasks had finished before the problem started being acute.\n\nI have the GC log enabled via -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails -Xloggc:/var/hadoop/logs/jobtracker1.gc.log\n\nThis log (as well as jconsole) showed that JT was busy running full GC. \n\nI agree that moving to later releases till help mitigate this problem to a certain extent, but as a system adminstrator, I would like to set the upper limit of number of tasks for a single job.

Since the num-maps passed by the user is just a hint to the jobclient while calculating the splits, this information is of no use to the jobtracker and hence the job-client can overwrite the num-maps parameter before uploading the {{job.xml}} on the dfs. With this the job that should fail will fail fast (i.e in the constructor itself) and the user will be informed as to why the job failed. \n\nComment #3 just states that {{totalNumTasks()}} will also count tasks from non-running (i.e killed/completed/failed) jobs.

Note that {{garabgeCollect()}} will be invoked before {{retireJob()}}. \n\n I think we should use {{numMapTasks}} and {{numReduceTasks}} instead of the sizes of the caches. Also reset the values of {{numMapTasks/numReduceTasks}} if the limit is crossed. If someone introduces partial expansion of tasks then we can think about it later.\n\n2) I am not sure if changing the log level of one class is sufficient. It would be nice if we can set the log level of the complete framework in the testcase. But again is it required?\n\n3) Did not check the test case completely but should take care of the following cases\n    - submit multiple jobs such that all of them should be accommodated. Both while the previous ones are running and also when the previous jobs are cleaned up.\n    - submit some small jobs and then a large job that exceeds the limit. Submit a small job after a limit-crossing job and make sure that the job gets accepted. The reason is to test if the cleanup is done and there is no side effect of large job being submitted and getting rejected\n    - submit two jobs back to back such that {{job1.totalTasks() + job2.totalTasks() > limit}}. Hence the first one should be accepted and the next one should be rejected.\n    - anything else?\n\n4) I dont see in the test case where the {{mapred.jobtracker.completeuserjobs.maximum}} is set.
