would be implicitly passed\n\nIt comes down to this: the reason the exceptions are being caught and processed is the assumption that all exceptions raised in the {{doAs}} clause indicate a problem with SASL, and that a new attempt should be made. I don't believe that's the case. things like NPEs, class-loading problems, etc, are not suitable to fallback, so should just be rethrown. \n\nmy first pass impl actually did\n{code}\n} catch (RuntimeException ex) { \n throw e; \n} catch (IOException ex) {\n ...\n}\n{code}\nDoing it this way guarantees that the rethrown exception retains the existing type and doesn't get lost in an IOE chain.\n\nThe current patch doesn' t need to do that, anything != IOE is impliciatly handled. The check for rpcclient == null is there to handle the case that the construction process fails for some other reason.
