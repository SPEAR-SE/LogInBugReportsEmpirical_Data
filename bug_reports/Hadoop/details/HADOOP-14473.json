That s3a work also added stream instrumentation {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AInstrumentation.InputStreamStatistics}} , so we could actually measure what is going on, *and use it in tests*. This seek work here & related is the opportunity to do the same for Azure, which will benefit production monitoring too. In particular, here I'd like to track the #of bytes skipped in forward seeks, and the #of close/open pairs, so we can detect when there's a lot of skipping going on, plus make better tests.

Tests were run against \"japan west region\" end point.\n\n{{BlobInputStream::skip()}} is more of a no-op call. Issue was related to closing the stream and opening it again via {{store.retrieve()}} as it would end up creating new {{BlobInputStream}}. And that would internally need additional http call as it needs to download blob attributes internally in {{BlobInputStream}}. This has been avoided in the patch. \n\nI completely agree that it would be good to get the instrumentation similar to s3a, and it was very useful.
