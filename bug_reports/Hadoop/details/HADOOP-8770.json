In FsShell get server defaults at shell initialization time and clobber the client config with the server config if set. This is simple and has the benefit of only retrieving the server defaults once rather than per path item but because operations can span NNs and each NN may have a different trash config this option doesn't work.\n\n3.

The issue here is that we have a handler thread making an IPC back to itself. So it's possible that, when you don't have enough threads, the IPC blocks forever because the client itself is holding the thread up.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-08-31T23:41:16.532+0000","updated":"2012-08-31T23:41:16.532+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605620/comment/13446500","id":"13446500","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
