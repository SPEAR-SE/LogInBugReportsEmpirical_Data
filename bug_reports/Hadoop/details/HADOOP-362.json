Now this would cause the reduces to also wait for the map output and they would never receive the output. This would cause the job to appear as if it was hung.\n \nThe following piece of code sends the status of tasks to the JobTracker:\n \n            synchronized (this) {\n                for (Iterator it = runningTasks.values().iterator();\n                     it.hasNext(); ) {\n                    TaskInProgress tip = (TaskInProgress) it.next();\n                    TaskStatus status = tip.createStatus();\n                    taskReports.add(status);\n                    if (status.getRunState() != TaskStatus.RUNNING) {\n                        if (tip.getTask().isMapTask()) {\n                            mapTotal--;\n                        } else {\n                            reduceTotal--;\n                        }\n                        it.remove();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n \n            //\n            // Xmit the heartbeat\n            //\n           \n            TaskTrackerStatus status =\n              new TaskTrackerStatus(taskTrackerName, localHostname,\n                                    httpPort, taskReports,\n                                    failures);\n            int resultCode = jobClient.emitHeartbeat(status, justStarted);\n \n \nNotice that the completed TIPs are removed from runningTasks data structure. Now, if the emitHeartBeat threw an exception (if it could not communicate with the JobTracker till the IPC timeout expires) then this update is lost. And the next time it sends the hearbeat this completed task's status is missing and hence the JobTracker doesn't know about this completed task. So, one solution to this is to remove the completed TIPs from runningTasks after emitHeartbeat returns.

What we saw was a large job with 5 maps that were not running (all maps were done) and yet all of the reduces were waiting for their output. Closer examination of the log showed that the maps had been logged as complete by the job tracker and were not being run anywhere. The TaskInProgress was showing 100% complete in the web ui. The Task details however was showing 50% and running.\n\nMy best guess as to the failure scenario is:\n\n1. task tracker sends progress of (50%, RUNNING) for map_123 to job tracker\n2. task tracker gets time out on progress message\n3. map_123 finishes\n4. task tracker send progress of (100%, SUCCEED) for map_123 to job tracker\n5. the two messages are taken from the rpc queue and given to separate handler threads\n6. the SUCCEED message thread gets the JobTracker lock and updates the status of the Task and TaskInProgress.\n7. the RUNNING message thread gets the lock and updates the status of the Task\n8. reduces ask for the map output and nothing is available\n\nTherefore, we also need to make sure that Tasks are not allowed to move from SUCCEED or FAILED to RUNNING. That will solve _this_ problem. However, this represents a much deeper and pervasive problem that we will need to address that any two rpc calls from the _same_ thread can be executed in an arbitrary order.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-07-21T23:03:03.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-21T23:03:03.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12345893/comment/12422822","id":"12422822","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Will timestamps help for the generic case? So the thread invoking the RPC timestamps the message and when the server handler pulls a job out of the queue for execution, it makes a note of the sender's timestamp. It then looks up a map from client address to client-timestamp and if the current call's timestamp happens to be older than the one found in the map, the server simply ignores that. This means that we don't guarantee  that all calls will be invoked at the server.\nAdditionally, we can have a flag that the client sets forcing the server to execute the call even if it violates the timeliness of the call. This may be required in the DFS operations where a client wants to, lets say, create a file (not absolutely sure whether this is a sensible use-case) but in general this may be helpful.\nBoth of the above can be implemented in the same lines as call-id is handled today (it is a part of each RPC call). In fact, the call-id itself can serve as the timestamp.

That's why in my proposal (the second part) I allow for this also - the sender of the RPC explicitly flags an RPC message that it should be executed no matter when it is considered for execution. That is, even if a message, m1, is received later than other messages that it sends after sending m1, the server should honor that and execute the RPC.\nSo basically, the client decides whether the server should ignore all (not-yet-executed) RPC requests sent before the current RPC request that the server is executing  OR  the server should execute all RPC requests.\nWe need to serialize the execution of RPC requests based on client addresses (to avoid the problem of multiple requests from the same client getting executed in parallel by different handler threads). This will avoid the race condition for cases like job status updates.\nYes, I agree that this we can implement the above in the protocol itself. I mean each protocol could have a flag signifying either  \"execute all RPCs\" or \"ignore RPC requests with timestamps later than the current RPC's timestamp\". \nSince in the RPC implementation in Hadoop, we have a single client for each protocol, this policy will work I think.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2006-07-24T09:53:55.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-24T09:53:55.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12345893/comment/12423089","id":"12423089","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The issue isn't that messages get handled out of order, but that messages from a single thread are handled out of order.
