This saves the overhead of making RPC connections to a overloaded/slow TaskTracker inline with the reducer method invocations. Ditto for Reporter.setStatus call (in Task.java).

I was too concentrated on the performance and lost track of the functionality. Anyway here's the updated patch. Some main points about the patch:\n1) Introduces a way for the progress reporting thread to block if there is no status to report. The calls to informReduceProgress wakes up the thread if it was blocked.\n2) Makes sure that the progress reporting thread is killed before the task exits. For this finally clause has been introduced in run(conf, umbilical). This caused quite a lot of indentation changes (making the patch seemingly complicated, sigh).\n3) Overides the method getReporter from Task.java. This is because in ReduceTask, setStatus behaves slightly differently. This ensures that MapTask's Reporter object behaves as it used to earlier (as an aside, the MapTask's Reporter.setStatus also needs to be tweaked on similar lines as the ReduceTask's, but think it could be a separate issue by itself).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2007-04-03T17:18:37.622+0000","updated":"2007-04-03T17:18:37.622+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364596/comment/12486530","id":"12486530","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think that we should limit this patch to just the bugfix to prevent any destabilization of the 12 line.
