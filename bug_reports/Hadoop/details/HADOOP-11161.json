If that isn't true then I am less concerned.\n\nOtherwise, I just wanted to make sure that if we were introducing a lifecycle that each stage is represented. Seems like the need for the close() may be pointing out  a smell in the original design of KeyProvider or of the extension for crypto. We just need to address the whole smell. :)\n\nIf there is no larger issue and closing and throwing away a provider after each use solves all such circumstances - then that may be just fine.\n\nJust some thoughts.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-10-03T19:26:42.565+0000","updated":"2014-10-03T19:26:42.565+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745739/comment/14158435","id":"14158435","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
