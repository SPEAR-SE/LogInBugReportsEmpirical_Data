The JT also stores the last seq and the JTResponse object sent to each of the task-trackers. OTOH the TT also stores the last 'seq' which it recieved from the JT, which is what it sends out in the subsequent heartbeat as 'ack'.\n\nHow does this help? If a TT misses the heartbeat response from the JT, it sends a stale which 'ack' disagrees with the newer 'seq' on the JT, this prompts the JT to resend the 'saved' JTResponse object back to the TT... thus solving the 'lost messages' issue. If JT never hears back from a TT for a long time the existing ExpireTrackers.run removes the TT from its queue and also discards the saved JTResponse object for that TT.\n\n-*-*-\n\nThoughts?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-11-22T16:23:59.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-22T16:23:59.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12353984/comment/12451988","id":"12451988","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"To clarify, the point of the type ids in the TaskTrackerActions is so that we can serialize the list of actions efficiently.\n\nI'd make TaskTrackerAction an abstract class like:\n\nabstract class TaskTrackerAction implements Writable {\n  /** Get the type id for a type */\n  public abstract int getTypeId();\n\n  /** Create an instance of the appropriate child type. */\n  public static TaskTrackerAction newInstance(int typeId);\n}\n\nand then the children look like:\n\nclass StartTaskAction extends TaskTrackerAction {\n  int getTypeId() { return 1; }\n  Task newTask;\n  public void readFields(...) throws IOException {...}\n  public void write(...) throws IOException {...}\n}\n\nKillTaskAction has a jobid and taskid.\nKillJobAction has a jobid.\n\nWe also need a action to reinitialize the task tracker (ReinitializeSelfAction?).\n\n\"JTResponse\" is too information free. How about \"TaskTrackerActionList\" instead.\n\nI think we are better off using a boolean than a special value for ackNo. As a side effect we can use short for ackNo because it is ok if it rolls around.
