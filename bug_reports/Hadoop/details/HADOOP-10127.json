I've seen this with flash-based devices where the boot time is constant for all nodes -it's why jitter is important, and why clock-based & time-since-boot jitter needs an extra bit of randomness\n# server offline explicitly with heavy client load coming in from outside. Here the more clients that block retrying connection requests build up more and more pending calls, so the server ends up receiving a massive multiple of the normal working load the moment it goes live.\n# more than one of the above problems. This is what led to the infamous facebook HDFS cascade failure -and hence why NN heartbeats now come in on a different RPC port from DFS client operations.\n\nShrink the retry time and the load generated against starting/failing over endpoints can increase massively. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be allowed -just that you need to understand that special problems arise at a few thousand servers and plan for it.\n\nIf it really is NM->RM calls you are worried about, then perhaps rather than make changes to the general IPC client, this is a good time to impose a better retry policy here, where exponential backoff with jitter is what I'd propose. The initial delay could be small, but it would back off fast if the cluster was down for any length of time","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2013-11-27T11:00:16.045+0000","updated":"2013-11-27T11:00:16.045+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681178/comment/13834463","id":"13834463","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~stevel] for clarifying the potential issues arising out of setting a higher frequency for retries. \n\nThe context for this is indeed YARN-1028 - ConfiguredFailoverProxy for RM failover. In an HA setting where the second RM is the active, with the current default for ipc.client.connect.max.retries (10), Clients / AMs / NMs retry the first RM for 10 seconds before trying the second RM. This leads to a significant performance hit. This delay in the clients failing over can be mitigated by setting ipc.client.connect.max.retries to 1, but I thought there might be merit to connect to the same RM multiple times (> 1) before trying the other one. Hence, the proposal to allow making the retry-interval shorter - try connecting to the same RM twice with a delay of half-a-second before failing over.\n\nbq.
