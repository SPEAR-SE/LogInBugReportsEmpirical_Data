So it should try its best to wire to requested number of replicas.\n\nIf you define this timeout to something else, then it is quite possible that much smaller timeout is ok. Please suggest different value (preferably redefining it).\n\n8min may not be the right value either. Even on 4 disk nodes, just doing 'generateData' stage of gridmix, we have seen that 2 min is not enough. On a heavily loaded cluster running multiple jobs on 2 disk machines, it might be much larger. Thats why making this configurable helps.\n\nOne change we could do is to use different write-timeout values when data is written to DFS and when data is read from DFS (DataNode to DFSClient write).\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu
