Looking at the ivy docs, I can't see a way to do multiple {{ivy:resolve}} calls in the same build.

There's also no way to specify multiple ivy.xml files, nor is there a way to look at the artifact jars that (may) already exist in another directory (e.g., the ivy cache for the base-hadoop project).\n\nI think that eventually auto-detecting these problems is a good goal, but I think for now the status quo of \"contrib owners are responsible for dealing with their own version conflicts\" isn't going to change.
