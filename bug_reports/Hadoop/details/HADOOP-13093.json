The split gives us more time to debate the proper default behavior and enables different target versions.\n\nTo test whether STDOUT is connected to a terminal, I will use {{System.console() != null}}, fully aware its limitation. JNI {{isatty(3)}} is possible but too problematic as pointed out by [~cmccabe].\n\nI will survey FsShell and hdfs commands and their proper expected default behaviors.
