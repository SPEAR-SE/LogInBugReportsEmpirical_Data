It refactored a bunch of connection-related params from being global (stay the same for new connections) to become per-connection params and their values are obtained from the conf used when calling RPC.getProxy(). This allows new connections to be set up based on the conf used for that connection, which is more intuitive.\n\n2. In particular, the server's Kerberos principal is now obtained from the per connection conf.\n\n3. The conf cached globally in Client is not removed since it provides a cache for Classes that ObjectWritable.NullInstance relies on to figure out the declaredClass. It seems to provide a useful function and the cache can be shared among connections. No per-connection params are obtained from this global conf.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kzhang","name":"kzhang","key":"kzhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kan Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-08-16T22:47:11.236+0000","updated":"2010-08-16T22:47:11.236+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471148/comment/12899550","id":"12899550","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jghoman","name":"jghoman","key":"jghoman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318"},"displayName":"Jakob Homan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch review:\n* Methods added for only unit testing should be marked as Private and Unstable\n* Move Client::getConnectionId to getConnectionID itself.
