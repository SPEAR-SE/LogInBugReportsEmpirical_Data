After _whenToKill_ units of time, tasks from job1 are killed. But at this point of time job2 is not set up and hence is not able to schedule tasks. So again job1 is selected for scheduling tasks. Now once job2 finishes setup, the reclaim request is added for the (extra) scheduled tasks. Hence the observation that there is some extra killings and the guaranteed capacity is allocated after few mins.\n\nI think the issue is more involved. Here are the choices\n1) Let it be : Since the setup task took time to schedule and finish, its ok to keep it as it is. What we guarantee here is that the slots will be allocated to the queue as soon as a request is made\n2) Delay : One way to avoid the _thrashing_ is to delay the reclaim until the job/queue which wants it, actually needs it. The obvious problem with this is that it will take sometime to kill the tasks and hence there will a little delay in reclaim. Also the _sla_ needs to be redefined.\n\nNote that this issue also depends on how set-up tasks are handled in future and when the job actually becomes _RUNNING_.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-10T11:00:55.477+0000","updated":"2008-11-10T11:00:55.477+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407600/comment/12646273","id":"12646273","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"We should leave this as is.
