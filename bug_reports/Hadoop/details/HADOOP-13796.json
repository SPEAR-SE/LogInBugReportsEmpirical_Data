However, failover may not work unless the fencing is configured properly.\n\nSince the graceful failover won't work, the fencing will kick in to make sure the failed node won't come back and act as an active. If you haven't configured a proper fencing method, fail-over won't happen.  E.g. if the only configured fencing method is ssh-based, it won't work for this case.  To fence off a completely unresponsive node, the fencing script should be capable of cutting the power.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-11-07T14:47:26.440+0000","updated":"2016-11-07T14:47:26.440+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-13796/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i35yvr:"}}
