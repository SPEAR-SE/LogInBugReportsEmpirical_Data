Currently, in the error scenario, for allocate we say:\nInvalid Permissions on clusters' data file : /home/yhemanth/.hod/clusters.state. It has to be a readable file.\nInstead, we can say:\nRequested operation cannot be performed. Cannot read /home/yhemanth/.hod/clusters.state: Permission denied. \nThis is somewhat similar to what Unix errors report.\nLikewise, for deallocate, when you don't have write permissions, we say:\nInvalid Permissions on clusters' data file : /home/yhemanth/.hod/clusters.state. It has to be a writable file. info and list operations might show old cluster data.\nInstead, we can say:\nCannot update /home/yhemanth/.hod/clusters.state: Permission denied.\\n Cluster is deallocated, but info and list operations might show incorrect information.\n- In the except block of the last part of the allocate command, the deallocation is still not happening, right ? It should be, as per your comment ?\n\nMinor points:\n- For the checkStateFile, I think we can pass in some const strings instead of the hardcoded numbers. In fact, it would be great if we can reuse os.R_OK etc. Can we not OR os.R_OK and os.W_OK to accomodate mode 3 ?\n- Likewise the error strings, if possible should be only at one place. That way, it will be easier to change.\n\nTest cases:\n- Move setupConf to a library type function.. maybe in a util class in the same module.\n- One more test case I can think of is what happens if the cluster state directory does not have write and execute permissions. This is actually the scenario that we have fixed\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-04-09T10:34:15.940+0000","updated":"2008-04-09T10:34:15.940+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392930/comment/12587497","id":"12587497","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching a second patch incorporating above suggestions.\n\n    - Allocate works now, even if .hod directory does not exist.\n    - Made changes to error messages.\n    - Incorporated minor points and suggestions for changes in test-cases.\n    - Now, deallocation happens when the except block of the last part of the allocate command is triggered.
