Suresh, I am not a Hadoop committer. I am just an end user who suffered from this issue and reported / responded on these tickets. I cannot point you to the code base / branch. That is the Hadoop team who knows where their code lives.\nThat is reasonable. However, in several comments you indicated the release as 0.2. This is indeed a release from may be 5-6 years ago and is not in use any more. My reason for asking you to point out the release is to understand the exact release you are talking about, so that I can out figure the release you were pointing out. When pointing out the issues, using the right release numbers would help.\n\nI also think there may be some confusion around release numbering and upgrade paths. It indeed is confusing.\n* Hadoop community decided to call the release 0.20.205 as 1.0 due to its stability. It is off of 0.20 branches.\n* 0.22, 0.23 and 2.x are later releases. These are off of the branches that come after 0.20. Hence upgrade from 0.22 or 0.23 to 1.0 is going from a later release to a release based on older branch. The right upgrade path is to go from 0.23 to 2.0. Going from 0.23 to 1.0 is not a supported upgrade path.\n\nbq. The problem is that this fix never went into any of the 1.x branches.\nBased on the above explanation, not all the major fixes go from 0.23 and 2.0 releases to 1.x release. Only the issues that are flagged by the community as important goes to 1.x releases.
