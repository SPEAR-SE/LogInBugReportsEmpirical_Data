When a TT reinits, the TaskLauncher object is created again. A task that is currently running might end up incrementing the free slots of the new TaskLauncher object if it takes time to exit. This would lead to the behavior described by Aaron in the bug report. The patch fixes this by moving all code to do with incrementing free slots to one method and is done inline in TaskInProgress.kill\n\nIn addition, the patch fixes a race condition to do with starting MapEventsFetcher thread. The thread starts the loop after looking at TaskTracker.running flag. However, when a TT reinits, the running field is set to true only after the thread is spawned. If the thread is immediately scheduled, it will find running false and exit. This would lead to hung reduces.\n\nI also cleaned up some code to do with TIP.cleanup during a task launch.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-11-10T05:12:45.772+0000","updated":"2008-11-10T05:12:45.772+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407883/comment/12646173","id":"12646173","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Marking this for 0.19","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-11-10T05:14:08.030+0000","updated":"2008-11-10T05:14:08.030+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407883/comment/12646174","id":"12646174","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"I anyway did run the tests locally.
