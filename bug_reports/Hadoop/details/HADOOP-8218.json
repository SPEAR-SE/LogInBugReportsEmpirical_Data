But, that defeats the whole purpose of throwing the exception when we pass non-closeables, so we might as well just revert the behavior back to the original rather than does this.\n2) In RPC.closeProxy, if the object doesn't implement Closeable, check if the proxy is a mock object. We can do this by looking for the string \"EnhancerByMockitoWithCGLIB\" in the class name. If we see that, pass through.\n3) Anywhere we mock out an IPC protocol, we could use the syntax {{mock(FooProtocol.class, withSettings().extraInterfaces(Closeable.class));}}. I am not a fan of this, since it leaks the issue out to all of the test code, rather than localizing the workaround in the one place that matters. Plus, newer users of the mock framework won't know this advanced usage syntax (I had to google for a while to figure it out)\n\nSo, I plan to implement #2.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-03-27T02:30:09.818+0000","updated":"2012-03-27T02:30:09.818+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548231/comment/13239123","id":"13239123","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Attached patch fixes the failing unit test.

Will that solve the problem?\n\nThat avoids the advanced syntax, but requires that you make such a fake interface everywhere you mock a protocol, which again is somewhat counter-intuitive.\n\nbq. #2 makes the main code aware of test specifics, which isn't a good idea. How about doing #3 by creating a helper method that encapsulates that code in one place?\n\nI was thinking about doing that... ie a MockitoUtils.mockIpcProtocol(FooProtocol.class). Since it seems people like this idea better than #2, I'll prepare such a patch.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-03-27T04:39:43.172+0000","updated":"2012-03-27T04:39:43.172+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548231/comment/13239179","id":"13239179","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This much bigger patch implements option #3 as Tom suggested.\nIt will also require a HDFS-side change to fix TestDFSHAAdmin which is currently failing.\n\nSo, I still think #2 is better, but you both think #3 is better, we'll go ahead with this, and I'll file a new HDFS JIRA to fix TestDFSHAAdmin to use the new mock util once this is committed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-03-27T04:57:19.755+0000","updated":"2012-03-27T04:57:19.755+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548231/comment/13239191","id":"13239191","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
