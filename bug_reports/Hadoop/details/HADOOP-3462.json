For example, there could be a faulty task which is writing to scratch space and making the disk out of space. Currently such tips would get failed in four attempts, thereby kill the job; which is the intended behavior. But making them FAILED_INTERNAL will not kill the job and just blacklist all the task trackers. \nAnd also if there are map tasks generating large map output files or reduce tasks generating large merge files, the job should get killed, instead of trying to run the map or reduce on all the tasktrackers.\n\nTo address this,\n1. One solution could be: we can have a configuration property _mapred.map/reduce.max.internal.failures_. And a tip can be killed if the number of internal failures of the attempts exceed the _mapred.map/reduce.max.internal.failures_. Then we have to decide on the default number for this. But, this approach could take more time to kill the job.\n2. Another solution could be to limit the disk space available for a task (something in the lines of process-ulimit?). And fail the task if it is exceeding the allotted space. But here, it would be difficult to keep track of disk space used by the task.   \n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-07-28T09:23:12.477+0000","updated":"2008-07-28T09:23:12.477+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12397029/comment/12617404","id":"12617404","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"*Please ignore my previous comment*.
