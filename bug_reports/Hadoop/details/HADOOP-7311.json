I anticipated possibility of #3 or #3a and put all metrics instrumentation behind interfaces in 0.20.2xx, so it's at least possible without changing the instrumentation code (besides the updater or metrics source implementation). As I pointed out in the original post in the mailing lists, there are down sides for #3, I'd really like to know the reasons for that.

I guess that they don't have strong opinions on how it should work as long as it can be easily made to work. I'm sure that you heard of lazy consensus.\n\nbq. I don't think Gary (the only one who cared) would be happy with the solution, when he sees it, as he was asking for \"a phased transition\" to metrics2 for HBase.\n\n#2 the OP clearly outlined the pros and cons of the approach. HBase will continue sending their specific metrics with metrics1 and Hadoop (common, hdfs, mapreduce) will send hadoop framework metrics with metrics2. i.e., in the transition period, ops would need to configure both hadoop-metrics.properties for HBase and hadoop-metrics2.properties for Hadoop. It's a working solution for the transition period.\n\nbq. Could you please elaborate or post links on how to get metrics2 run. We use Ganglia.\n\nThe syntax to configure a consumer/sink for metrics (in the hadoop-metrics2.properties):\n{noformat}\n[service-name].sink.[sink-name].[option]=value\n{noformat}\nSome examples are included in the trunk conf/hadoop-metrics2.properties for common and hdfs, as well as the [configuration section|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HADOOP-6728-MetricsV2#Configuration] of the [design doc|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HADOOP-6728-MetricsV2].\n\nAn example of metrics2 config using ganglia (3.0.x or 3.1.x?) would be:\n{noformat}\n*.ganglia.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.sink.ganglia.Ganglia31\n*.period=10\n\nnamenode.sink.ganglia.address=localhost:8649\njobtracker.sink.ganglia.address=localhost:8649\ntasktracker.sink.ganglia.address=localhost:8649\n{noformat}\n\nOf course, the org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.sink.ganglia.* classes don't exist yet. We'll have to implement them (sink examples can be found in the FileSink or the EchoPlugin in the design doc.).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-24T00:18:17.949+0000","updated":"2011-05-24T00:18:17.949+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12507827/comment/13038333","id":"13038333","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
