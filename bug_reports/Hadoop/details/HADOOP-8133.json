Two points:\n  # by moving to the one requiring libcap.so.2 you're killing off the distros where that is not available.

See HDFS-2303 for details. This is a much cleaner solution and you have a wide choice of what jsvc to depend upon ranging from bundled with your system (http://pkgs.org/search/?keyword=jsvc) all the way to the one we're curating in Bigtop (bigtop-jsvc package).
