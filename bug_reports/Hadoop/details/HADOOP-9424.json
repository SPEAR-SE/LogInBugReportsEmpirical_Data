What's included in HADOOP_CLASSPATH should be considered more like \"user classes\". I would rather put the content of HADOOP_CLASSPATH in the user classloader that loads the jar and remove it from the CLASSPATH. That way, the jar in the argument and the content of the HADOOP_CLASSPATH would be visible to each other. Note that the isolated classloading (HADOOP_CLIENT_CLASSLOADER) already takes that approach.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-08-10T00:55:22.777+0000","updated":"2016-08-10T00:55:22.777+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12638197/comment/15414536","id":"15414536","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue}  0m  0s{color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} patch {color} | {color:red}  0m  5s{color} | {color:red} HADOOP-9424 does not apply to trunk.
