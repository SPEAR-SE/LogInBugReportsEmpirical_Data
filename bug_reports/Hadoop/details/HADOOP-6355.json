overrides setUp to set fs=LocalFileSystem) results in 5 failures and 19 errors out of 28 tests.\nAdditionally, the unit tests expect a few undocumented behaviors (ie, it expects to get an IOException on mkdirs(subdir/of/a/file) rather than just returning false) and some contradictory behaviors (it expects that delete(directory, false) should succeed on an empty directory) compared to FileSystem's javadoc.\n\nI suspect that most of the fixes should come from changing the unit tests to be more sensible rather than modifying [Local]FileSystem, but however it's done these should all agree on expected behavior!","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"103236","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Make
