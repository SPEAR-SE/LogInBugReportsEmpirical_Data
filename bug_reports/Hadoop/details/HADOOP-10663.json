This is a continuation of comments that I left on MAPREDUCE-5912 here:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5912?focusedCommentId=14029597&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14029597\n\nThe issue raised in MAPREDUCE-5912 is that a change was made that started looking for map outputs on the default file system instead of the local file system.  This causes problems on Windows if HDFS is the default file system, because the path will have a colon due to the drive specifier, and a colon isn't a valid character in an HDFS file name.  As I said in my MAPREDUCE-5912 comment, I don't think that change was correct, even if it appears to be working in non-Windows environments.\n\nFor the patch here, imagine a situation where the default file system is neither the local file system nor HDFS, and that file system implementation does allow colons in file names.  With this patch, a {{Path}} with no scheme and a path that \"looks like\" a Windows path with a drive spec can get misrouted to local file system instead of the default file system.  I admit this is somewhat contrived, but it sure would create confusion if anyone ran into it.\n\nI'd like to resolve this as won't fix.

That code should work if {{mapOutput}} is a fully qualified {{Path}}, right?\n\nYes, that's correct.  You mentioned that MAPREDUCE-5269 includes changes to guarantee the {{Path}} instances are fully qualified.  Thanks for pointing that out.  The problem is that MAPREDUCE-5269 isn't committed yet, and it's a larger patch that will take more time to review, so I'm going to proceed with committing MAPREDUCE-5912 for a short-term fix.\n\nbq. Any heuristic that infers the FS from name can be defeated by a carefully constructed future FS  In other words scheme should be mandatory\n\nIn general, yes, I agree.  I prefer using a fully-qualified {{Path}}, particularly around service or process boundaries where the {{Configuration}} instances might be different.  Even better would be a way to statically type-check relative vs. fully-qualified, but this is a long-standing limitation of the {{Path}} class and the underlying {{URI}} that it wraps.\n\nHowever, we've also historically had the behavior that if the {{Path}} doesn't have a scheme, then it gets mapped to the default {{FileSystem}} based on configuration.  Like you said, it's imperfect, but it's sometimes convenient, and we need to maintain that behavior for backwards-compatibility.  The patch here would create a risk of bypassing that logic, which is an expected part of the contract.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-06-12T19:57:02.058+0000","updated":"2014-06-12T19:57:02.058+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12718399/comment/14029742","id":"14029742","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ah, I misunderstood this bug, then.
