S3A adds the fix for HADOOP-13188, not only doing the GET but failing if the destination path is a directory. That is, even if  overwrite==false, you want to make sure that you aren't unintentionally creating a file over a dir, so unintentionally losing all access to the data underneath (it'd break the listing code, see). If I were to go near S3n, I'd probably focus on that bug, rather than dealing with the intermittent caching of the 404 that S3 can do.\n\nYour particular problem is really due to the fact that the output committer is doing a rename(), which from a performance perspective is the wrong thing to ask an object store what to do. In HADOOP-13345, S3Guard, we're planning to deal with this —anything you can do to help there would be welcome.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-09-02T11:00:33.308+0000","updated":"2016-09-02T11:00:33.308+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13002277/comment/16051740","id":"16051740","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"This is an s3 list inconsistency surfacing on s3n job commits.
