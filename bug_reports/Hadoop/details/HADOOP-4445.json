Essentially, there are two sources of truth, regarding the number of running tasks in the system. Each JobInProgress object maintains counts of running map and reduce tasks. These counts are incremented when a task is assigned to a TT (in obtainNewMapTask() or obtainNewReduceTask()). These counts are used the by the CapacityScheduler . The cluster summary, represented by the ClusterStatus object, also contains counts of the total number of maps and reduce tasks. These are incremented by the JT using the TT status. The counts maintained by the JobInProgress objects and the ClusterStatus object, are off by a heartbeat. The former increments its counts when a task is assigned. Once the task runs on a TT, its running status is conveyed to the JT in the TT's next heartbeat. During startup, a lot of TTs approach the JT for tasks to run. As a result, the counts of running tasks across all JobInProgress objects are much higher than the cluster count, since the cluster count is updated only when the TTs report their status in their next hearbeat. That explains the discrepancy reported in this Jira. In steady state, these two counts are mostly identical, or off by a little bit, as TTs finish their tasks at different times. \n\nThis is not really a bug, as it's not clear which count is 'correct'. We're reporting from two different sources: the cluster summary and the Scheduler (which gets it info from the JobInProgress objects). But different numbers do get reflected in the UI. So the best fix is to probably indicate in the  Scheduler part of the UI that its computation is off from the cluster summary by a heartbeat. Maybe a little explanation in the bottom that says something like: \"This info varies from that of the cluster summary by a heartbeat\". \n\nI don't think we should change anything in the scheduler or the cluster summary. They're both doing the right thing their own way. An alternate solution is to have the cluster summary use the counts from the JobInProgress objects, but this is performance-intensive, and was presumably the reason why the cluster summary maintains its own count. \n\nYou do want to the leave the rest of the UI as is. The cluster summary is useful, as is the per-queue information of running tasks (reported by the Scheduler) as it lets users know whether the queue is running above/at/below its guaranteed capacity. \n\nbq. Hence, the waiting counts should be removed from the scheduler information.\nThe scheduler maintains  a partial waiting count of map/reduce tasks. It doesn't need to know the total number of pending tasks if this total is larger than the cluster capacity. So, for performance reasons, it only counts up to the cluster capacity. HADOOP-4576 has been opened for this purpose and suggests that we display pending jobs instead of pending tasks, as the former seems more useful to users. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-03T06:00:18.725+0000","updated":"2008-11-03T06:00:18.725+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406680/comment/12644695","id":"12644695","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Vivek's [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4445?focusedCommentId=12644645#action_12644645] makes sense.

I had an offline discussion with Vivek, and we came up with a few observations and ideas.\n\n- The information is accessed by the UI update thread and the updateQSI method without proper synchronization.This should be addressed. Currently, the QueueSchedulingInfo object is a simple data object, and the information in a given instance of this should be accessed together. Currently, the access to this object is done synchronized via the TaskSchedulingMgr object. Maybe then, instead of accessing the QSI fields directly, it should access it via the TaskSchedulingMgr.\n\n- The capacity scheduler also updates only the reduce scheduler or the map scheduler in a given heartbeat. So in a scenario where reduce tasks are finishing along with map tasks, since we update the reduce scheduler in preference to the map scheduler, the information for the map tasks could be off by more than a heartbeat. However, in a steady state, this may not be that big an issue.\n\nThere are some options to address this:\n- We could make it explicit that the information is not synch'ed with the cluster summary (as mentioned by Vivek above, though the information should probably not be treated as off by only a heartbeat)\n- We could ensure that the information of either the map and reduce scheduler is updated at least once every so often. For e.g. we could update it once every 3 heartbeats or so.\n- We could also have an updater thread that runs periodically and updates the numbers every time it runs. We could use the same code for updates as the updateQSI method itself, thought it could maintain a separate copy of the data, so as to not introduce synchronization constraints on the scheduler. \n\nThe advantage with the last two approaches is that we could deterministically say how far off the scheduling info would be, as compared to the cluster status. For e.g. if the updater thread runs once every 30 seconds, we could say the information would be off by 30 seconds.\n\nSince in any case it appears that the information cannot be completely in sync, maybe we should leave it simple for now, mark that the information is not synchronized with the cluster status, and see if in steady state the information is way off. If that happens, we could fix it using one of the methods I've stated above.
