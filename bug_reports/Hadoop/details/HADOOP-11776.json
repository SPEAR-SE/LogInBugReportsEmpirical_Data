That patch addressed the Null.java problem for me. In this patch I'm doing the following things:\n# Applied a quick fix for the jdiff compatibility param settings to eliminate the package \"\" error. I'd appreciate if there's background information about this setting, so that we can decide the correct long term fix. \n# Run the maven script against branch-2.6.0 to generate two sample API files, one for hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common and one for hadoo-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs\n# Fix the SAXParser not found exception when running jdiff. \n\nAfter this fix, hadoop hdfs can have API diff report after {{mvn package -Pdocs -DskipTests}} in its target/site/jdiff/xml folder. Hadoop common still has some problem with jdiff: jdiff is complainging the following:\n\n  [javadoc] Error: duplicate comment id: org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.MetricsSystem.register_changed(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, T)\n\nSince this is the only error we got in all components (we're also exploring YARN-3426 for yarn-api, yarn-client, yarn-common, and yarn-server-common), after briefly checking the original code of jdiff I highly suspect the error is triggered by a bug of jdiff. However, I'm not sure if jdiff is still maintained, so for long term fix we may want to find some alternative tools. \n\nSo far the script would generate a diff report for hdfs. I'm extending the YARN part in YARN-3426. \n\nThe patch in HADOOP-11377 appears to work on my local machine.
