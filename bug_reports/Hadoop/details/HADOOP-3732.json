See init() in DataBlockScanner(). A better time to obtain block information would be when the block scanner actually starts scanning and verifying, that is in DataBlockScanner.run(). During regular startup the difference in timing is negligible, but if there is distributed upgrade then it can take a while until the scanner will have a chance to run, besides it may read incorrect information since it will be reading the pre-upgrade block files.\n# The message itself is confusing for administrators mostly because it is repeated 80,000 times (2 * #blocks).
