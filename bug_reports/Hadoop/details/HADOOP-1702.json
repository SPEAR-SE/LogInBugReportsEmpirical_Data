Each of these datanodes verify CRC. Approximating cost of checksumming to be twice that of a memory copy, we get (8+6)/(14+6) == 70%. If we increase the size of checksum chunk, cost of CRC will go down. It is be 68% with a factor of 1.5 for CRC.\n\nTest Setup : three instances of 'dd if=/dev/zero 4Gb | hadoop -put - 4Gb'. More importantly, DataNode was modified to write the deta to '/dev/null' instead of the block file. Otherwise I could not isolate the test from disk activity. The cluster has 3 datanodes.

Can increasing buffersize (as in this case) reduce performance, i.e. should an implementation allow it?\n\nThis is what happens on trunk: \n- user specified buffesize is effectively does not matter on trunk. \n- Client sends buffers up packets of 64k size and flushes them after the pkt if full.

It would be a change in protocol that affects other datanode transfers like reading etc. We rarely send partial packets (mainly fsync). Also checksum data is less than one percent of the packet. I hope it is ok for this patch. Note that this is not a memory copy that did not exist before (previously all the data was copied).\n\n- #2: Yes it is a change from previous behavior. Before this patch it didn't matter since we handled 512 bytes at a time. The receiving datanode verifies the checksum anyway. Checking checksum after tunneling data downstream (theoretically) reduces latency. This is the same reason datanode first sends the data to mirror and then stores the data locally.\n\n- #3. sure.\n- #4. yes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-05-08T18:15:25.289+0000","updated":"2008-05-08T18:15:25.289+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12375709/comment/12595356","id":"12595356","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> Or, is it good to interleave data and checksums?\n:-).
