On an average, the map tasks take less than a minute for completion. However, we observed that there are a few stragglers at the end of the run which take an unduly long time for completion (~15 minutes) that were primarily resulting in the overall increased run time. Most of these tasks are data-local tasks. There were other few tasks that took about 4-5 minutes, but those are expected towards the end of the run and are not the suspects.\n2. The task logs for these tasks indicated that the actual map function (up to the beginning of the first spill) took about 14 minutes, sort and spill + merge parts took less than a minute\n3. The data node log indicated that the first contact by the map task was as soon as the job started, but the map task got its final data set only after 14 minutes. \n4. Most of these tasks ran on a few specific nodes. For example, in one run, 4 of these ran on node x, 3 ran on node y. \n5. However, the specific nodes x and y themselves do not have any problems. On the next invocation of sort (the cluster was not reallocated, it was the same), the problem nodes were a different x' and y', all the tasks on x and y ran fine.\n6. While these straggler tasks are running, the task tracker appeared to be busy handling shuffles\n7. The nodes where these tasks were running did not show any unduly high CPU usage or Memory usage\n\nGiven that the 3514 patch affects sort, spill and merge parts of the map task and not the functionality before it, it appears that the bug is more likely a side effect. \nOne change by this patch that could possibly be causing this side effect is the change to use the RawLocalFileSystem instead of the LocalFileSystem for the creation and handling of the intermediate files. However, It is not very clear how this change is affecting the data node performance?  Thoughts?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-10-14T17:36:40.811+0000","updated":"2008-10-14T17:36:40.811+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406236/comment/12639530","id":"12639530","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"minor : I was looking at patch for HADOOP-3511, it looks like 'getRaw()' method for LocalFS was redundant since ChecksumFS already has 'getRawFileSystem()'.

Notice the time when the map started running (15:05:15) and note the time when the first spill happened (15:13:17). The entire time duration (~8 minutes) was spent in consuming ~128MB of data from the dfs (and this happened to be a task that got scheduled on a data-local node). Quite unexpected since in the normal case it takes a few seconds... The strange thing is that it is not a node issue. So for this run of the sort400, on a particular node, a couple of maps exhibited this behavior but many ran normally..

This does not appear to be the ideal configuration for the cluster, Runping let me know that he uses parallel.copies=30 and http.threads=50. With this configuration, sort took the same time as 18 and gridmix completed in 40+ minutes, which is a reasonable time.\n\nWhen  reduce.parallel.copies=60 and tasktracker.http.threads=100, it is obvious that towards the end of the map phase, the load on the disks on the individual nodes is fairly high because the reducers are pulling in data from a lot more maps in parallel and possibly shuffling them to disk. This seems to be causing the stragglers that we observed. However, slowing down the maps by having them write in small chunks seems to somehow mitigate this problem as observed with both the LocalFileSystem and when breaking down the writes into chunks when using the RawLocalFileSystem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-10-17T05:25:17.160+0000","updated":"2008-10-17T05:25:17.160+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406236/comment/12640444","id":"12640444","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Yes, it looks like a configuration issue.
