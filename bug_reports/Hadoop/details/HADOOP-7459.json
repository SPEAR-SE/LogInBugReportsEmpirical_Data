We've looked at this in CDH and eventually removed the java package dependency. The reason is that there is no good java package to depend on. Just depending on \"jre\" or \"jdk\" will pull in the wrong package (eg the openjdk or the IBM jre on a SLES). Depending on java-1.6-sun package doesn't work for some people because it is only available in the Red Hat supplementary repo, which is a pain to configure (eg requires rhn), and not available on Centos. Therefore it's easier if the user installs java (there may be multiple javas installed) and Hadoop picks the best one when it runs (HADOOP-6605) if one was not explicitly configured using JAVA_HOME.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-07-26T02:12:04.058+0000","updated":"2011-07-26T02:12:04.058+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12513989/comment/13071063","id":"13071063","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"An alternate option is to have a set of RPMs that depend on both hadoop and different JDKs, are marked as exclusive, and user can install them.
