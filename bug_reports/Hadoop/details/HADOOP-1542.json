However, on the tasktrackers, the mapred-default.xml indeed overrides the config in hadoop-site/hadoop-default.xml, and hence sees speculative execution switched off.\nThis could be the cause of the dfs file-lost problem. Here's the theory (not yet validated from the source code): When the maps tries to create files on dfs, they try to the create the \"final\" files (as opposed to the speculative case where the output path for the files would point to task specific directories). Hence the spec instance of a map gets the AlreadyBeingCreatedException. Finally the JT, which thinks that spec exec is turned on, tries to rename the empty file path to its final destination and that overwrites the real file that the task originally created.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj
