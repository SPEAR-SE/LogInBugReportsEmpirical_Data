Indentation had been changed.\n2. Say, there is an optional parameter that has been set in the default configuration or site configuration, and the user wants to remove that, unset could be useful instead of leaving the property name in properties list and having a null there. By the default conf reading logic used in the program, if either attr or value were null while reading initially, the property isn't added to properties. Similarly, if at a later point, the value would be null, it sounds logical for me to remove the property. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n3. A Test Case has been added.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nrajagopal","name":"nrajagopal","key":"nrajagopal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rajagopal Natarajan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-11-21T03:14:18.764+0000","updated":"2007-11-21T03:14:18.764+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12369047/comment/12544152","id":"12544152","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nrajagopal","name":"nrajagopal","key":"nrajagopal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rajagopal Natarajan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Somehow a TAB had come into the previous patch. corrected in this patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nrajagopal","name":"nrajagopal","key":"nrajagopal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rajagopal Natarajan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-11-21T03:18:40.968+0000","updated":"2007-11-21T03:18:40.968+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12369047/comment/12544167","id":"12544167","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
