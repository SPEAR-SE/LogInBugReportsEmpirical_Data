The current implementation would seem to waste at least some time if one or more slave machines have to execute two reduce tasks simultaneously while other tasktrackers sit idle, with the amount of wasted time depending on how dependent the reduce tasks were on the slave machine's resources.\n\nI first thought that perhaps the jobtracker was \"overloading\" the tasktrackers that had already finished their map tasks (and avoiding those that were still mapping).
