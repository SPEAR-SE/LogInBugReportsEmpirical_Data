I don't think it needs to remain in .gitignore, because there is no other file anywhere in the source tree named contract-test-options.xml, besides the ADL one that the patch deletes.\n\nIn general though, trying to achieve some commonality across these file names and using .gitignore entries that can cover all sub-modules globally sound like a great move for future-proofing this.\n\nbq. Another question: can we add another property fs.contract.test.enabled (default true to be backwards compatible)?\n\nI'm not sure I completely understand, but does the lack of fs in this new property mean that it would be global, not tied to a specific file system's tests?  If it's global, then a weakness of this approach is that for developers running {{mvn verify}} at the root of the source tree or at the root of hadoop-cloud-storage-project, it would be all or nothing.  If a developer had credentials to AWS and Azure but not OpenStack, then they'd need to do something different to run just for the modules where they have credentials.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-01-06T18:27:33.312+0000","updated":"2017-01-06T18:27:33.312+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13029814/comment/15805670","id":"15805670","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"I understand the enable/disable thing.
