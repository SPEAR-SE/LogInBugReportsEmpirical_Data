The reason for this is that {{Ls#adjustColumnWidths}} executes separately for each recursion down the tree via the base {{Command}} class.  Therefore, it can calculate the max lengths and readjust only for the subset of paths that it encounters within that recursion.  If it encounters a larger max length lower down in the tree, then it's too late to adjust for the paths higher in the tree that were already printed.\n\nI don't see an obvious way to fix this completely.  I don't think we can iterate through all paths recursively to get a more accurate max length calculation, because that would require holding the whole tree in memory on the client side.\n\n{code}\n[chris@Chriss-MacBook-Pro:ttys003] hadoop-deploy-HDFS-4685                                                          \n> hadoop-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/hdfs dfs -ls -R /\ndrwxr-xr-x   - chris supergroup          0 2014-01-18 08:50 /dir1\n-rw-r--r--   3 chris        supergroup          6 2014-01-18 08:50 /dir1/file1\n-rw-r--r--   3 longusername supergroup          6 2014-01-18 08:50 /dir1/file2\ndrwxr-xr-x   - chris        supergroup          0 2014-01-18 08:50 /dir2\n-rwxrwxrwt   3 chris        supergroup          6 2014-01-19 10:56 /file3\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-21T19:37:03.403+0000","updated":"2014-01-21T19:37:03.403+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12690091/comment/13879309","id":"13879309","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yea, I agree with your analysis Chris.
