Distcp and other tools should not know or care whether it's being run via a real user, proxy user, via oozie, or something else.\n\nI briefly investigated a bit more, and the env var actually originates from UGI which internally uses it to automatically load the tokens, hence tools should not know about this internal implementation detail of UGI.  I think the issue is the tokens are being loaded into the login user instead of the real user.

Job submission gets missing tokens for input/output paths and adds them to the UGI for RPC connections.  Job submission doesn't check the UGI, so it doesn't think it has the token, thus requests another.  The NN connection uses the token that the job doesn't think it has!  The NN squawks that you can't use a token to get a token.\n# Similarly, distcp also does some prep work to acquire tokens prior to job submission.  So again, a task tries and fails to get the tokens it already has....  Invoking a command like distcp directly will \"work\" (masks the bug) because it uses the TGT to get another token even if it already has one in the UGI.\n# Job submission doesn't appear to propagate non-FS/MR tokens in the task's UGI into the new job submission.\n# Oozie uses a security manager to intercept an action's System.exit, throws a SecurityException containing the exit code, and later catches that exception to determine success/failure.  Devious!  Distcp calls System.exit(0) inside a try block which catches oozie's SecurityException, logs it, and then calls System.exit(-999), again generating an oozie SecurityException.  Due to the try/catch, distcp will ALWAYS appear to fail.\n\nSolutions:\n* #1,2,3: Seeding Job with existing UGI tokens\n* #4 Distcp calls System.exit OUTSIDE of the try block\n\nI seeded the Job's credentials with the existing UGI tokens because it seems unreasonable to require all apps that launch jobs to be aware of running as a task.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn
