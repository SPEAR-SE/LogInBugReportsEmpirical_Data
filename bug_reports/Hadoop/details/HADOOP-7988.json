I'll try to summarize what I've found, but I'll also give the full reference hyperlinks.\n\nThe [Kerberos RFC | http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4120.txt ] says this: {quote}\n6.2.1.  Name of Server Principals\n\n   ... The first component of the\n   two- or multi-component name will identify the service, and the\n   latter components will identify the host.  Where the name of the host\n   is not case sensitive (for example, with Internet domain names) the\n   name of the host MUST be lowercase. \n{quote}\n\nThe Oracle Java Docs say this: [Kerberos Requirements | http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html#realmnamereqs ] {quote}\nBy convention, all Kerberos realm names are uppercase and all DNS hostname and domain names are lowercase. On the Windows 2000 platform, domains are also Kerberos realms; however, the realm name is always the uppercase version of the domain name.\n\nHostnames are case insensitive and by convention they are all lowercase. They must resolve to the same hostname on the client and server by their respective naming services.\n\nHowever, in the Kerberos database hostnames are case sensitive. In all host-based Kerberos service principals in the KDC, hostnames are case-sensitive. The hostnames used in the Kerberos service principal names must exactly match the hostnames returned by the naming service. For example, if the naming service returns a fully qualified lowercased DNS hostname, such as \"raven.sun.com\", then the administrator must use the same fully qualified lowercased DNS hostname when creating host-based principal names in the KDC: \"host/raven.sun.com\".\n{quote}\n\nFinally, in an older IETF Draft related to [Distributing Kerberos KDC and Realm Information with DNS | http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-krb-wg-krb-dns-locate-03 ] the following commentary is provided: {quote}\nDNS vs. Kerberos - Case Sensitivity of Realm Names\n\n   In Kerberos, realm names are case sensitive.  While it is strongly\n   encouraged that all realm names be all upper case this recommendation\n   has not been adopted by all sites.  Some sites use all lower case\n   names and other use mixed case.  DNS on the other hand is case insen-\n   sitive for queries but is case preserving for responses to TXT\n   queries.  Since \"MYREALM\", \"myrealm\", and \"MyRealm\" are all different\n   it is necessary that only one of the possible combinations of upper\n   and lower case characters be used.  This restriction may be lifted in\n   the future as the DNS naming scheme is expanded to support non-ASCII\n   names.\n{quote}\n\nThese are the only authoritative references I could find.  However, there is a considerable body of archived email list correspondence that strongly implies the Java Kerberos packages work best if host names are forced to lower case in the Kerberos principle names.  \n\nThe key issue seems to be the statement in the second reference, {{\"The hostnames used in the Kerberos service principal names must exactly match the hostnames returned by the naming service,\"}} plus the observation in the third reference, {{ \"it is necessary that only one of the possible combinations of upper and lower case characters be used [the same way in Kerberos and DNS].\" }}\n\nSo, if DNS servers and Kerberos servers disagree on hostname case usage and/or sensitivity, authentication won't work.  For example, see this detailed complaint from 2010, [mixed case hostname issue |http://old.nabble.com/mixed-case-hostname-issue-td28097602.html], where the response from a Kerberos contributor was simply {{\"Hostnames are always case folded (to lower case) in principal names.\"}}\n\nThere are also threads that imply the Java Kerberos packages may have or had bugs around this issue that are resolved by forcing hostnames to lower case.  For example, see \nhttp://www.nexentastor.org/projects/site/wiki/CIFS : {quote}\nThere is a known bug in the kerberos package which breaks ticketing in Nexenta if your domain name (in the case of active directory users) is mixed case or all upper case. Because kerberos requires all lower case this causes ticket errors that can be hard to trace down.\n{quote}\nand http://linux-nfs.org/pipermail/nfsv4/2005-July/002278.html : {quote}\nBrowsing the code showed that handling keytab file has been done in\ndifferent ways in Server and Client. While the server code mandates\nhostnames/principals to be of lowercase, client code doesn't impose any \nrestriction...\nThe current theory on the client was that we would use any usable\nkey we found to do the mount.  It can be argued that with\nauthenticated delegation callback, the client becomes a server\nand therefore the server principal name restriction should apply.    \nIf everyone agrees with that, I will make the changes to restrict\nthe principal name to be used on the client.\n{quote}\n\nTo find other references, search the Web for \"kerberos mixed case\" and \"kerberos requires lowercase\".\n\nIt seems to me that given the above, it makes sense that both HBase and Hadoop would choose to fold hostnames to lower case, in the Kerberos principals only.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-01-27T17:44:28.547+0000","updated":"2012-01-27T17:44:28.547+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12539242/comment/13194959","id":"13194959","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"bq. So, if DNS servers and Kerberos servers disagree on hostname case usage and/or sensitivity, authentication won't work.\n\nRight.  Which is why prior to 4150, forcing case at the app layer could result in all sorts of surprising behavior since, as you pointed out, it was ill-defined.  The expectation was that the Kerberos principals would be set up to *match* DNS in those cases where DNS itself didn't return lower case.  So if your DNS server responded with hostname.Example.ORG, then your host principal would be host/hostname.Example.ORG.  From an administrative perspective, this was worked around by including both the \"real\" name and the folded name principals in the realm and associated keytabs.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen
