The pid returned by this class is that of the direct child(which would be the one with pid 28998 and which doesn't return till 300 secs in this test-case) and this explains the issue. The issue has gone away when I made simpleCommand to use /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh to run the given command.\n\nSo, a possible fix for this could be changing the implementation of simpleCommand to use /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh. Hadoop is using /bin/bash all over the places, so this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSide Notes:\n1) The first process(pid 28998) is odd in any case. Is this how solaris's /bin/sh behaves and why?\n2) Nigel observed that /bin/sh is a link to /sbin/sh on this machine (ok/weird?)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-05-14T12:30:41.727+0000","updated":"2008-05-14T12:30:41.727+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12396015/comment/12598974","id":"12598974","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"If it is true that Hadoop itself uses /bin/bash everywhere, including for working on Solaris, the fix seems reasonable atleast for now.
