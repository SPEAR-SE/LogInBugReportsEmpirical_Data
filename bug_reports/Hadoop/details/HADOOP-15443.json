It (poorly) documents four states:\r\n\r\n|| HDFS_DATANODE_SECURE_USER || dfs.data.transfer.protection || Mode ||\r\n| unset | unset | non-root start, non-reserved port, insecure |\r\n| set | unset | root start, reserved port, secure |\r\n| unset | set | non-root start, non-reserved port, secure(-ish) |\r\n| set | set | root start, reserved port, secure |\r\n\r\nHDFS_DATANODE_SECURE_USER (and it's deprecated form HADOOP_SECURE_DN_USER) should only be set if the privileged mode is needed. This requirement is pretty much unchanged from branch-2; only the names have been cleaned up.  The biggest difference is that JSVC_HOME was also required in branch-2.  As explained in HDFS-13501, it's not a particularly useful check (even in branch-2) given other portions of HDFS also required JSVC_HOME to defined.  [It's a supported configuration to have portmap running privileged and datanode unprivileged in a secure cluster.]\r\n\r\nAlso in reference to HDFS-13501, I could easily see how JSVC_HOME was being used as the pivot point for privileged vs. non-privileged startup. That won't work anymore in 3.x, given that JSVC_HOME is only referenced when jsvc is actually being used. Instead, it's now solely HDFS_DATANODE_SECURE_USER .  Again, this essentially matches real-world conditions under branch-2, but now much more formally.\r\n\r\nI wrote [this|https://effectivemachines.com/2017/07/08/powerful-_users-in-apache-hadoop-3-0-0-alpha4/] up last year to talk about how some of the _USER vars work in 2.x vs. 3.x.  In hindsight, using PRIVILEGED instead of SECURE would have been better, but c'est la vie.  I think I deferred to SECURE because it was more likely to be used in more configurations.  This was probably a mistake.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2018-05-05T18:29:09.076+0000","updated":"2018-05-05T18:29:09.076+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13156729/comment/16468028","id":"16468028","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ajayydv","name":"ajayydv","key":"ajayydv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ajay Kumar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~aw], thanks for detailed comment.
