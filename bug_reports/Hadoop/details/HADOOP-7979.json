The reason is that the default behavior of {{ld}} was changed in Ubuntu 11.10.\n\n*Background*\n\nFrom [Ubuntu 11.10 Release Notes|https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneiricOcelot/ReleaseNotes#GCC_4.6_Toolchain]:\n\n{code}\n    The compiler passes by default two additional flags to the linker:\n\n    [...snipp...]\n\n    -Wl,--as-needed with this option the linker will only add a DT_NEEDED tag\n    for a dynamic library mentioned on the command line if if the library is\n    actually used.\n{code}\n\nThis was apparently planned to be changed already back in 11.04 but was eventually reverted in the final release. From [11.04 Toolchain Transition|https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyNarwhal/ToolchainTransition#Indirect_Linking_for_Shared_Libraries]:\n\n{quote}\nAlso in Natty, ld runs with the {{\\--as-needed}} option enabled by default.  This means that, in the example above, if no symbols from {{libwheel}} were needed by racetrack, then {{libwheel}} would not be linked even if it was explicitly included in the command-line compiler flags. NOTE: The ld {{\\--as-needed}} default was reverted for the final natty release, and will be re-enabled in the o-series.\n{quote}\n\nI already run into the same issue with Hadoop-LZO (https://github.com/kevinweil/hadoop-lzo/issues/33).  See the link and the patch for more details.  For Hadoop, the problematic configure script is {{native/configure}}.\n\n*How to reproduce*\n\nThere are two ways to reproduce, depending on the OS you have at hand.\n\n1. Use a stock Ubuntu 11.10 box and run a build that also compiles the native libs:\n\n{code}\n# in the top level directory of the 'hadoop-common' repo,\n# i.e. where the BUILDING.txt file resides\n\n$ mvn -Pnative compile\n{code}\n\n2. If you do not have Ubuntu 11.10 at hand, simply add {{-Wl,\\--as-needed}} explicitly to {{LDFLAGS}}.  This configures {{ld}} to work like Ubuntu 11.10's default behavior.\n\n\n*Error message (for trunk/0.24)*\n\nRunning the above build command will produce the following output (I added {{-e -X}} switches to mvn).\n\n{code}\n[DEBUG] Executing: /bin/sh -l -c cd /home/mnoll/programming/git/hadoop/hadoop-common/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native && make DESTDIR=/home/mnoll/programming/git/hadoop/hadoop-common/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/target install\n[INFO] /bin/bash ./libtool  --tag=CC   --mode=compile gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.  -I/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include -I/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include/linux -I/home/mnoll/programming/git/hadoop/hadoop-common/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/src -I/home/mnoll/programming/git/hadoop/hadoop-common/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/javah -I/usr/local/include -g -Wall -fPIC -O2 -m64 -g -O2 -MT ZlibCompressor.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/ZlibCompressor.Tpo -c -o ZlibCompressor.lo `test -f 'src/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/zlib/ZlibCompressor.c' || echo './'`src/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/zlib/ZlibCompressor.c\n[INFO] libtool: compile:  gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include -I/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include/linux -I/home/mnoll/programming/git/hadoop/hadoop-common/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/src -I/home/mnoll/programming/git/hadoop/hadoop-common/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/native/javah -I/usr/local/include -g -Wall -fPIC -O2 -m64 -g -O2 -MT ZlibCompressor.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/ZlibCompressor.Tpo -c src/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/zlib/ZlibCompressor.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/ZlibCompressor.o\n[INFO] src/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/zlib/ZlibCompressor.c: In function 'Java_org_apache_hadoop_io_compress_zlib_ZlibCompressor_initIDs':\n[INFO] src/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/zlib/ZlibCompressor.c:71:41: error: expected expression before ',' token\n[INFO] make: *** [ZlibCompressor.lo] Error 1\n{code}\n\n\n*How to fix*\n\nThe fix involves adding proper settings for {{LDFLAGS}} to the build config.  In trunk, this is {{hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/pom.xml}}.  In branches 1.0 and 0.20.20x, this is {{build.xml}}.\n\nBasically, the fix explicitly adds {{-Wl,\\--no-as-needed}} to {{LDFLAGS}}.  Special care must be taken not to add this option when running on Mac OS as its version of ld does not support this option (and does not need it because by default it behaves as desired).","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12510965","id":"12510965","filename":"HADOOP-7979.trunk.v1.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miguno","name":"miguno","key":"miguno","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959"},"displayName":"Michael

While patching a similar issue for Hadoop-LZO we learned that the gcc on Mac OS X Lion doesn't support the {{-Wl,\\--no-as-needed}} option for LDFLAGS, hence the patch includes a Maven profile for not setting LDFLAGS on Macs.  But as you suggested there might be other OS'es (Solaris?) or gcc versions that behave differently but I don't have any direct experience there to provide further information.\n\n> Can users override?\n\nWhat would be the preferred way to do this in the current (trunk) Maven setup?  I have seen that native code compilation must explicitly be enabled by running the build with the proper Maven profile, e.g. {{mvn -Pnative ...}}.\n\nAt the moment, the patch is designed to work like so:\n\"By default enable the LDFLAGS option, and only disable it under /these/ specific conditions [currently: if running on a Mac box].\"  You'd prefer it the other way around (disable by default)?\n\n@Arun:\n\n> Can you please check if we need this for native code in other\n> parts of Hadoop? E.g. linux-container-executor in MR.\n\nI am still working on this (and it takes some time because re-running the build including tests takes several hours).\n\nI have only found a few occasions of native code references in pom.xml files in trunk, with linux-container-executor in MR being one of them:\n\n{code}\n$ find . -name \"pom.xml\" | xargs grep native | sed -r 's/^([^:]*):.*/\\1/' | sort -u\n./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/pom.xml\n./hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/pom.xml\n./hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/pom.xml\n./hadoop-project-dist/pom.xml\n./hadoop-project/pom.xml\n{code}\n\n\nHowever, at least for linux-container-executor (i.e. {{./hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/pom.xml}}), I could run the build via {{mvn -Pnative compile}} successfully as it is -- even on the \"problematic\" Ubuntu 11.10 OS version.  Should these components still be patched even though they compile without problems in their current state of development?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miguno","name":"miguno","key":"miguno","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959"},"displayName":"Michael Noll","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"created":"2012-01-24T08:20:48.322+0000","updated":"2012-01-24T08:20:48.322+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538766/comment/13192198","id":"13192198","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=butlermh","name":"butlermh","key":"butlermh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=butlermh&avatarId=10421","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=butlermh&avatarId=10421","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=butlermh&avatarId=10421","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=butlermh&avatarId=10421"},"displayName":"Mark Butler","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This is the same issue as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7868","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=butlermh","name":"butlermh","key":"butlermh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=butlermh&avatarId=10421","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=butlermh&avatarId=10421","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=butlermh&avatarId=10421","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=butlermh&avatarId=10421"},"displayName":"Mark Butler","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-01-24T15:00:39.850+0000","updated":"2012-01-24T15:00:39.850+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538766/comment/13203518","id":"13203518","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miguno","name":"miguno","key":"miguno","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959"},"displayName":"Michael Noll","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"body":"Allen, Arun, any updates on this?
