why I'm marking this for 0.14.0 rather than 0.13.0 - what do others think about this?\n\n-*-*-\n\nTwo possible solutions to break the deadlock cycle:\n\na) Make TaskTracker.purgeJob a synchronized method, thus it locks the TaskTracker before locking the RunningJob method.\nb) Make the TaskTracker.tasks map a *Collections.synchronizedMap*, thus doing away with the need to lock the TaskTracker in TIP.cleanup\n\nI'd prefer a) since the TaskTracker.tasks is referenced in multiple places in synchronized methods... and hence is a less intrusive change.\n\n-*-*-
