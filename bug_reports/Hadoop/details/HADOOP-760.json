(eg every 10 minutes or so.)\n\nEven if the namenode files are rsync'ed, what can be done in that particular case ? (if we periodically rsync the fsimage and its corrupted edits file).\n\nThis issue affects the 0.6.1 HDFS version. After looking at the hadoop trunk code, I am not able to says if this can be happening anymore...
