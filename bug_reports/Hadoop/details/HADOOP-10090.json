Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"I was able to repro the problem by looking at JMX metrics thru jconsole. See attached screenshot.\n\nThe bug appears to be coming from how the JMX metrics cache is managed in MetricsSourceAdapter.java. To be more specific:\na) MetricsSourceAdapter keeps track of the latest metrics records obtained from the call into MetricsSource#getMetrics (see MetricsSourceAdapter#getMetrics)\nb) Metrics system timer thread which periodically polls on all sources, only polls for the metrics that have changed (not all metrics)\n\nScenario from this bug (JobTracker metrics):\n - Let's assume that the timer runs once per minute\n - At time 0, there were 0 jobs_submitted and 0 jobs_completed, and internal JMX cache reflects this state\n - At time t1, MetricsSystem timer thread runs and there were 1 jobs_submitted, and 0 jobs_completed. Internal JMX cache is not updated.\n - At time t1 + 0.5 minutes, above job is completed, and jobs_completed counter is set to 1.\n - At time t1 + 1 minute, MetricsSystem timer thread runs, and only jobs_completed metric changes from 0 to 1. Internal MetricsSourceAdapter {{lastRecs}} contains only jobs_completed metric.\n - At time t1 + 1 minute + delta, JMX is polled for the current metrics, the current cache is updated using the current {{lastRecs}}, and the final outcome is jobs_submitted = 0, jobs_completed = 1.\n\nSince it is not obvious to me what is the intended behavior around metrics reported thru JMX is, I see two possible directions for the fix:\n# JMX always reports the latest snapshot obtained by the MetricsSystem timer thread. This means that JMX does not report the fresh/current metrics state. Each time metrics are fetched from the timer thread, internal MetricsSourceAdapter JMX cache would be refreshed to keep the state in sync.\n# JMX always reports the current metric values (with small TTL on the internal cache). In this design, MetricsSourceAdapter would (almost) always have to poll on the source for JMX.
