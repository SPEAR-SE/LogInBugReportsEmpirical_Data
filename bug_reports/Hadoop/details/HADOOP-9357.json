The new code can live in the first case of the existing if right? Ie all URIs that need fixing are absolute.\n\nI thought about this a bit, and I think you can have URIs with a scheme and relative path, e.g. {{hdfs:foo/bar}}, which should then just be treated as {{foo/bar}}. I added a test case for this.\n\nbq. More descriptive name than \"fixPath\"?\n\nSince \"fixRelativePartAndSchemaNoAuthority\" doesn't roll off the tongue so well, I just changed it back to the original \"fixRelativePart\". In FileSystem, this is done in checkPath (not a great name either).\n\nbq. Consider adding new Path method (similar to isAbsoluteAndSchemeAuthorityNull)\n\nGood idea, added. I didn't refactor FileSystem's handling to use this since it's kind of gnarly, but I could if desirable.\n\nOn putting this in the constructor, I don't think we can easily pursue that path. We can't do the fixup until we know the default scheme of the filesystem where the path is being resolved, which would mean passing un-fixed URIs around as a {{URI}} or {{String}} or {{NewPath}} before we can make it into a {{Path}}. FS and FC already process incoming paths in fixup/check methods, so that's probably the right place for this too.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-27T01:15:35.224+0000","updated":"2013-03-27T01:15:35.224+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12635177/comment/13614832","id":"13614832","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

I created this JIRA after some end user confusion when porting an app from FileSystem to FileContext. I felt that URIs like {{hdfs:///tmp}} should be discouraged but supported, since they are supported by FileSystem, and this case is specifically mentioned in the RFC as an okay fallback.\n\nA couple potentially clarifying points:\n\nbq. A user wanting /tmp on the default file system should say \"/tmp\" and not \"hdfs:///tmp\".\n\nThis code triggers when the schema matches the schema of the default FS. {{hdfs:///tmp}} will only work if the default FS is an HDFS instance.\n\nbq. While the notion of a default file system is very appropriate, the notion of default authority per scheme does not make sense, especially if it is derived from the default file system.\n\nThere is not a default authority per scheme, as per the previous.\n\nbq. In a multi-cluster environment, getting in the default authority/port from the default file system can lead to accessing the files at the wrong HDFS cluster/volume...\nbq. If you encourage the use of hdfs:///tmp then as you change your default file system from hdfs to localfs...\n\nI agree there could be ambiguity if you have multiple FS with the same schema, or change the default FS.\n\nMoving toward a meta question, we already have all these problems with FileSystem, which is the dominant interface to HDFS. Have we encountered these problems in FileSystem with ambiguity and changing the default FS? I at least haven't heard of any, but I did see the mail that led to this JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-02T03:41:10.474+0000","updated":"2013-04-02T03:41:10.474+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12635177/comment/13619546","id":"13619546","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3546 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3546/])\n    YARN-516.
