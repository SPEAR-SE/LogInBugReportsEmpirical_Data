More background about this issue:\n1. The nativetask code is only optimized for x86_64, so some function names are not ideal. like the name \"bswap\" are little confusing, it is used for \"ntoh\" purpose. \n2. so on all bigendian arch, bswap should be nop.\n3. I guess the use of inline assembly is because very old compilers(like gcc3 I use back at baidu)  don't optimize bit shift style ntoh function as bswap asembly, but most compilers do that now, so not sure the inline assembly is needed any more. \n\nSo I think a more clean way to fix this is to define ntoh32 and noth64 properly(use bit shift rather than assembly should be OK for modern compilers) based on BYTE_ORDER macro, and replace all bswap.

I'm not much of a gamer these days, but last time I was in a game shop, I didn't see Hadoop on the shelf next to Fallout and Halo, so I'm going to make the bold claim that we can always assume little endian for our Windows build.  :-)\n\nThe perfect way to solve this would be to convert the Windows build to use CMake like everything else.  HADOOP-11080 tracks that effort, but it's going to take a long time.  I wouldn't want to block this patch waiting for HADOOP-11080 to complete.\n\nIn the interim, we can have the native-win profile approximate this part of the CMake script by running a few Ant tasks to generate hadoop_endian.h with the correct macros for Windows.  I'm attaching patch v007 with this solution.  Compared to the prior patch, the only new changes are in pom.xml and native.vcxproj, so it should be a small incremental code review.\n\nI think this is slightly better than checking in a hard-coded hadoop_endian.h just for Windows.  It's possible this way will give us less of a dual-maintenance burden.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris

Is there any way of telling maven about the ordering requirement?\n\nThe last time I looked at the hadoop-maven-plugins problem, it really looked like a Maven bug.  Maven is supposed to be able to understand the dependency relationships of modules in the current build (what they call the \"reactor\").  It seems it doesn't identify the relationship though if one of those modules is a Maven plugin needed by a subsequent module.  I believe {{mvn compile}} at the root of the source tree wasn't working if the local Maven cache didn't have hadoop-maven-plugins, and people were forced to do {{mvn install}} first.\n\nThe case pointed out by Allen is a little different from that though.  Pre-commit will build only hadoop-mapreduce-client-nativetask if a patch only contains code in that module, and Maven won't have any reason to trigger an automatic build of hadoop-common first.  The Yetus Hadoop personality already handles some of our special cases like this by forcing a hadoop-common build.  I think the only solutions I see for this would be to make another change to the Yetus Hadoop personality, or duplicate the code.  I'd prefer not to do the latter.  The code is non-trivial enough that I'd prefer not to duplicate.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-08T18:57:30.687+0000","updated":"2015-12-08T18:57:30.687+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769440/comment/15047269","id":"15047269","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Rather than code duplication, couldn't it be a CMake module that gets called by the CMakeLists that need it and generates the endian.h file in the appropriate target directories?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2015-12-08T19:00:59.780+0000","updated":"2015-12-08T19:00:59.780+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769440/comment/15047347","id":"15047347","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, I think that would work.

McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for working on this, everyone.\n\n[~aw], if you want to run the native unit tests for hadoop-hdfs, you must build the native part of hadoop-common first, so that you can have access to {{libhadoop.so}}.  That's why the old (pre-Yetus) build script had a hacky piece of code that specifically compiled hadoop-common if anything native had changed.  I don't think the native components inside nativetask and yarn have the same issue, since I don't think they actually make calls into libhadoop.  So theoretically we might be able to decouple those from the compilation of hadoop-common.  As [~cnauroth] commented, one way of doing this would be splitting out stuff like the {{config.h}} generation code into a separate module or file that could be invoked by all {{CMakeLists.txt}}.\n\nAs [~alanburlison] pointed out, the patch here doesn't add any additional dependencies or change the existing ones.  I think we should address the build dependency issues in a separate JIRA.\n\n{{MCollectorOutputHandler.cc}}: I'm confused by the {{Endium}} enum here.  First of all, shouldn't it be {{Endianness}}?  \"Endium\" isn't a word.  Secondly, it looks hard-coded to {{LARGE_ENDIUM}}, but there is an \"if\" statement.  Is the intention to add additional flexibility in the future?  If we're not using this functionality right now, I would rather avoid \"speculative code\" that we may or may not end up using.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

That's because you can only have one ant <target> block within a maven-antrun-plugin section in the pom.xml. The recommended approach is to to move any complicated ant logic into a separate build.xml file and just call ant from maven. I think such a refactoring would also make it easier to develop/test the native build parts in isolation from the rest of the maven build. The one wrinkle in this case is the use of the native-maven-plugin in the pom.xml to run javah on the classfiles and generate the corresponding C headers. I've completely failed to find any documentation for it so I've no idea if it is smart enough to only regenerate the .h when the corresponding classfile is updated. However if the decision is to refactor the JNI build into an ant build.xml then I think the javah parts should be moved into ant as well.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alanburlison","name":"alanburlison","key":"alanburlison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Burlison","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-01-19T22:22:49.841+0000","updated":"2016-01-19T22:22:49.841+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769440/comment/15107584","id":"15107584","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alanburlison","name":"alanburlison","key":"alanburlison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Burlison","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Further to this, ant has a javah task that will search a classpath rather than requiring an explicit classfile list like the native-maven-plugin, so it looks like a better mechanism anyway.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alanburlison","name":"alanburlison","key":"alanburlison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Burlison","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-01-19T22:31:11.885+0000","updated":"2016-01-19T22:31:11.885+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769440/comment/15109231","id":"15109231","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

As per the comments earlier, it's kind of unpleasant to add a dependency on a header generated in hadoop-common when we don't have to.

So I pretty much stopped working on it since I assumed that HW would be spending it's considerable resources on it rather than what I could offer as a lowly volunteer. i.e., my time was better spent elsewhere. Almost 3 months ago, access to the PPC box was lost.  I have no idea what sort of support HW is putting towards PPC.  I'm guessing zero, given I haven't seen anything non-Linux/x86 come out of there.\n\n(I just did a quick test on the other PPC box that Jenkins has access to.  It is lacking docker, so that's pretty much a no go.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2017-10-04T15:54:28.072+0000","updated":"2017-10-04T15:54:28.072+0000"}],"maxResults":111,"total":111,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-11505/votes","votes":3,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i24ow7:"}}
