That is, the killing of maps is not based on the number of times the attempt to fetch failed, but instead dependent on the time the map will take to run if reexecuted.\n\n3) For example, if a map takes 30 minutes to run, and the fetch for the corresponding output fails, a reduce postpones giving the feedback to the JobTracker until it has tried for 15 minutes or so (exponential backoff within this time interval). In other words, we increase the number of retries for long running maps just so that we might be successful in fetching probabilistically. The time a reduce spends retrying is directly proportional to the time the map took to complete.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2007-11-14T19:18:46.365+0000","updated":"2007-11-14T19:18:46.365+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12379491/comment/12542794","id":"12542794","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Runping, it doesn't get to 10 minutes until it has failed 5 times.
