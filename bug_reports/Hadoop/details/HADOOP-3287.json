When the job submitter cares, it should include its preferred values. Using the final flag on the jobtracker hadoop-site.xml will lock the value ignoring the value set in the client jobconf.\n\nCurrently the only way of doing this is to distribute the jobtracker hadoop-site.xml to all clients and make sure they use it when creating the job configuration.\n\nThere are situations where this is not practical:\n\n * In a shared cluster with several clients submitting jobs. It requires redistributing the hadoop-site.xml to all clients.\n * In a cluster where the jobs are dispatched by a webapp application. It requires rebundling and redeploying the webapp.\n\nThe current behavior happens because the jobconf when serialized, to be sent to the jobtracker, sends all the values found in the hadoop-default.xml bundled with the hadoop JAR file. On the jobtracker side, all those values override all but the 'final' properties of the jobtracker hadoop-site.xml.\n\nAccording to the javadocs of the Configuration.write(OutpuStream) this should not happen ' Writes non-default properties in this configuration.'\n\nIf taken the javadocs as the proper behavior this is a bug in the current implementation and it could be easily fixed by avoiding writing default values on write.\n\nThis is a generalization of the problem mentioned in Hadoop-3171.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"105136","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Being able to set default job configuration values on the jobtracker","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"all","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12394409/comment/12591059","id":"12591059","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"-1 As I wrote on HADOOP-3171, these semantics lead to very hard to debug cases.
