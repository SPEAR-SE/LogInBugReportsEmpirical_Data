The problem isn't that FileContext does not throw the exception the problem is that it is inconsistent with the documented interface. This resulted in incorrect code being written in YARN. The above code is not going to solve the problem because there is a race.  If fs.exists returns false and then the file is created the mkdir will become a noop and the interface still is not followed.\n\nChanging the FileSystem definition to throw an exception on a mkdir is not acceptable either.  This will not just break tests it will break lots of downstream customers.  \n\nThe trick with changing the FileContext definition is that we have to be sure that it is in line with the other implementations as well.  If all of the FileContext implementations are wrappers around FileSystem implementations then it should not be a problem to change this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-05-03T14:22:14.724+0000","updated":"2013-05-03T14:22:14.724+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639155/comment/13649120","id":"13649120","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"I agree with Robert, changing the javadoc and the interface is the preferable fix for the reasons mentioned.
