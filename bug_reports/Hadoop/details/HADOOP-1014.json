This looks to be a blocker until it is resolved. There were two relevant messages on hadoop-dev:\n\nfrom Mike Smith:\n\nThe map/reduce jobs are not consistent in hadoop 0.11 release and trunk both\nwhen you rerun the same job. I have observed this inconsistency of the map\noutput in different jobs. A simple test to double check is to use hadoop\n0.11 with nutch trunk.\n\nfrom Albert Chern:\n\nI am having the same problem with my own map reduce jobs.  I have a job\nwhich requires two pieces of data per key, and just as a sanity check I make\nsure that it gets both in the reducer, but sometimes it doesn't.  What's\neven stranger is, the same tasks that complain about missing key/value pairs\nwill maybe fail two or three times, but then succeed on a subsequent try,\nwhich leads me to believe that the bug has to do with randomization (I'm not\nsure, but I think the map outputs are shuffled?).\n\nAll of my code works perfectly with 0.9, so I went back and just compared\nthe sizes of the outputs.  For some jobs, the outputs from 0.11 were\nconsistently 4 bytes larger, probably due to changes in SequenceFile.  But\nfor others, the output sizes were all over the place.  Some partitions were\nempty, some were correct, and some were missing data.  There seems to be\nsomething seriously wrong with 0.11, so I suggest you use 0.9.  I've been\ntrying to pinpoint the bug but its random nature is really annoying.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12351226","id":"12351226","filename":"TestMapRed.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj

I have a bunch of M/R jobs that process some 100Gb of text data and collect different types of stats. Since Hadoop 0.10.0 I started noticing that some of the reduce outputs were missing data (some of them were empty). I modified the TestMapRed() JUnit to run the following test. I create two separate sequence files by generating N random integers and storing them in one file as IntWritable() values and as Text() writables in the other one. Matching integers have the same key. Then I ran the M/R job with an identity mapper (I use GenericWritable() to wrap the different value types) and in the reducer I check if both the integer and the string representation are received for a given key. The job runs just fine until up about 50M keys, then it starts failing for 100M keys or more. The assertion exception is caused by the reducer receiving only one value not both. One problem is that the job does not fail consistently and it always throws the assertion exceptions for different keys and within different reduce tasks. Our M/R reduce cluster is composed of 10 high-end dual-core linux boxes with about 8Tb of aggregate HD capacity. I cannot get this JUnit (or any of my jobs) to fail  with Hadoop 0.9.2. They actually run on it like a breeze.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drboscolo","name":"drboscolo","key":"drboscolo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Riccardo Boscolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-02-14T03:59:31.249+0000","updated":"2007-02-14T03:59:31.249+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12362658/comment/12472990","id":"12472990","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Riccardo, could you please upload your test as a patch on this issue?

Hence the reduces won't get the intended map outputs. I have attached the fixed TestMapRed.java.\nIn your map method, you instantiate a WritableWrapper object which has the type field correctly set. After that you do output.collect which would have different behaviors in the versions 0.9 and 0.10+. In the version 0.9, the output.collect will write the data directly to the final map output file. However, with the 0.10+ versions, the output gets buffered and written later and there is deserialization/serialization happening when the output is finally written to disk from the buffer. In your code, the deserialization code (readFields) was not setting the type field and hence the serialization (write) would always write 0 (type - INT_WRITABLE) for the type field. The reducer, thus, would never see UTF8.\n\nAlso attached a patch that would disable inmem merge (basically sets the buffer size for the ramfs to 0, and does some checks for that). This should remove the blocker.\n\nMike, Albert and Riccardo - please comment whether this solves the issues you reported for the time being. I will continue to debug the inmem merge. Must be some race condition somewhere since the failures are not consistent.

From the JavaDoc on the Collections.synchronizedMap:\n\n| It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned map when iterating over any of its \n| collection views:\n|\n|  Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap());\n|      ...\n|  Set s = m.keySet();  // Needn't be in synchronized block\n|      ...\n|  synchronized(m) {  // Synchronizing on m, not s!\n|      Iterator i = s.iterator(); // Must be in synchronized block\n|      while (i.hasNext())\n|          foo(i.next());\n|  }\n| \n|\n| Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior.\n\nThe InMemoryFileSystem locks the InMemoryFileSystem rather than the synchronizedMap. This leads to the non-determinism since the other operations (add, remove, etc.) are locking the synchronizedMap.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-02-17T08:57:29.249+0000","updated":"2007-02-17T08:57:29.249+0000"}],"maxResults":19,"total":19,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-1014/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0ilkv:"}}
