If it is not a bug, then it should at least be documented, how to initialize hdfs correctly, by just using the hadoop tarball. It is somewhat mentioned in the docs, but the fact that you have to do that in the middle of the daemon start-ups ins non-obvious. At least to me. \n\nIt is also a regression from hadoop 1.x, where you could fire up a cluster with start-all.sh and it worked.
