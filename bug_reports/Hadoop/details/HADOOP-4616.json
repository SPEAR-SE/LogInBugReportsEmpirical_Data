This makes it  impossible to access the mounted partition until it is mounted again.\n\nA simple way to reproduce this bug is to remove enough datanodes to have part of the data missing, and to read each file listed in HDFS.\n\nthis is the assertion that fails (fuse_dfs.c:903) : assert(bufferReadIndex >= 0 && bufferReadIndex < fh->bufferSize);\n\nThe expected behaviour would be to return either no file or a corrupt file, but continue working afterward.\n\nremoving the assertion seems to work for now, but a special behaviour is probably needed to handle this particular problem
