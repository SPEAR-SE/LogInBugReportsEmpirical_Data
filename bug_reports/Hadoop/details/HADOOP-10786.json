If there are, then isKeyTab is set to true, and otherwise it's set to false.\n\nThus, in java 8 isKeyTab is always false given the current UGI implementation, which makes UGI#reloginFromKeytab fail silently.\n\nAttached patch will check for a KeyTab object on the Subject, instead of a KerberosKey object. This fixes relogins from kerberos keytabs on Oracle java 8, and works on Oracle java 7 as well.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12679752","id":"12679752","filename":"HADOOP-10786.2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schu","name":"schu","key":"schu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen

I am seeing the same problem in the most recent OpenJDK build.  With JDK 1.7.0_79, I could not repro the problem. After upgrading to JDK 1.7.0_85, I could repro the problem. I don't know the exact minor version number within JDK 7 that first introduced the change, but it's somewhere in that range.\n\nI also confirmed that this patch fixes the problem for JDK 1.7.0_85 too.  To verify, I ran the test without the corresponding fixes in {{UserGroupInformation}}.  I observed that the test failed on the assertion for {{ugi.isFromKeytab()}}.  Then, I applied the {{UserGroupInformation}} part of the patch, and the test passed.\n\nBottom line: If you want to run a secured Hadoop cluster on JDK 1.7.0_85 or later, then you must run Apache Hadoop 2.7.0 or later.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-12T21:14:49.845+0000","updated":"2015-08-12T21:14:49.845+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12725544/comment/14696592","id":"14696592","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Cherry-picked to 2.6.1","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-08-14T06:56:21.920+0000","updated":"2015-08-14T06:56:21.920+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12725544/comment/14696593","id":"14696593","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8300 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8300/])\nHADOOP-10786.
