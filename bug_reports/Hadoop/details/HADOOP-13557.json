The {{reloginFromKeytab()}} method then fails with an {{IOException}} \"loginUserFromKeyTab must be done first\" because there is no keytab associated with the UGI.\n\nThe {{checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab()}} method checks if there is a keytab ({{isKeytab}} UGI instance variable) associated with the UGI, if there is one it triggers a call to {{reloginFromKeytab()}}. The problem is that the {{keytabFile}} UGI instance variable is NULL, and that triggers the mentioned {{IOException}}.\n\n\nThe root of the problem seems to be when creating a UGI via the {{UGI.loginUserFromSubject(Subject)}} method, this method uses the {{UserGroupInformation(Subject)}} constructor, and this constructor does the following to determine if there is a keytab or not.\n\n{code}\n  this.isKeytab = KerberosUtil.hasKerberosKeyTab(subject);\n{code}\n\nIf the {{Subject}} given had a keytab, then the UGI instance will have the {{isKeytab}} set to TRUE.\n\nIt sets the UGI instance as it would have a keytab because the Subject has a keytab. This has 2 problems:\n\nFirst, it does not set the keytab file (and this, having the {{isKeytab}} set to TRUE and the {{keytabFile}) set to NULL is what triggers the {{IOException}} in the method {{reloginFromKeytab()}}.\n\nSecond (and even if the first problem is fixed, this still is a problem), it assumes that because the subject has a keytab it is up to UGI to to the relogin using the keytab. This is incorrect if the UGI was created using the {{UGI.loginUserFromSubject(Subject)}} method. In such case, the owner of the Subject is not the UGI, but the caller, so the caller is responsible for renewing the Kerberos tickets and the UGI should not try to do so.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"UserGroupInformation created from a Subject incorrectly tries to renew the Kerberos ticket","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13000989/comment/15446474","id":"15446474","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaochen","name":"xiaochen","key":"xiaochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xiaochen&avatarId=24893"},"displayName":"Xiao Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Seems like a duplicate of HADOOP-13558?\nGiven there are already some watchers there, I'm closing this one as a dup.
