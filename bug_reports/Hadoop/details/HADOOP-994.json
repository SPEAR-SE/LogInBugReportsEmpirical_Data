This block deletion is done by the heartbeat thread in the Datanode. If the number of files to be deleted is large, the Datanode stops sending heartbeats for this entire duration. The Namenode declares the Datanode as \"dead\" and starts replicating its blocks.\n\nIn my observed case, the block report returns 1669 blocks that were to be invalidated. The Datanode was running on a RAID5 ext3 filesystem and 4 active tasks were running on it. The deletion of  these 1669 files took about 30 minutes, Wow!
