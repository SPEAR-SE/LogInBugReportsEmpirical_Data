This optimization is based on the assumption that a previously under-replicated block should have already been in the queue.\n\nFor the case that Koji filed, due to for some bugs like HADOOP-4597, under-replicated blocks did not get to place in the under-replicated block queue at NameNode startup time. Later on changing a file's replication factor to be a bigger number does not trigger the move of the file's blocks into the queue if the replication factor change does not change their priority.\n\nThe fix for this problem is to remove the optimization.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-14T19:50:23.959+0000","updated":"2008-11-14T19:50:23.959+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407910/comment/12647750","id":"12647750","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"A patch for review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-14T23:08:36.879+0000","updated":"2008-11-14T23:08:36.879+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407910/comment/12648836","id":"12648836","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 This should work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-11-19T00:20:21.901+0000","updated":"2008-11-19T00:20:21.901+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407910/comment/12649492","id":"12649492","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Ant test-core passed on my local machine.\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\nTotal time: 124 minutes 24 seconds\n\nAnt test-patch result:\n     [exec] +1 overall.\n\n     [exec] +1 @author.
