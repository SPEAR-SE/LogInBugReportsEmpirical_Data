This would not be a backwards-compatible change, because those permissions would be filtered by the process umask.  The existing semantics of {{FileSystem}} are that the permissions passed by the caller are not influenced by the process umask.  For example, if you call {{FileSystem#create}} with 644 permissions, we make sure the final result is a file with 644 permissions, even if your process umask is 027, which would have silently changed the resulting permissions to 640 by POSIX semantics.
