When a cluster exists to run specific tasks, it seems reasonable that they can use all of its resources.\n\nOn this issue, a default {{ulimit -v}} will cause some pretty strange failures while also failing to prevent resource exhaustion in other cases. For example, some tasks may mmap multi-GB files but touch only a few pages. Others may link libraries that require 100s of MB of address space for code that's never executed (and thus never read). Still others may fork off lots of sub-processes and thus ultimately consume more RAM than any single process's virtual address space. (Btw, these examples are all taken from our deployed Hadoop apps.)\n\nFurther, when these tasks hit the virtual address space limit, it's likely they'll fail in confusing, difficult to debug ways, since few apps are written to gracefully handle that case, and when run outside of Hadoop the same commands will work fine unless the user reads the streaming code and notices that it is imposing this limit. (This is in contrast to the -Xmx limit, which can actually influence the garbage collector to be more aggressive, is a commonly used java option, and produces relatively clear OutOfMemoryErrors on failure.)\n\nThis is why I don't think {{ulimit -v}} is the right approach *in general*. That doesn't mean it's not the right approach for specific situations, and hence the original proposal for a wrapper script (possibly one mandated by the cluster admin) is attractive. In other specific situations, {{ulimit -m}} might be more effective than {{ulimit -v}}, or some {{jail}}-like mechanism might be employed, and of course Windows users will need something else. Adding support for all the different ways resources might be limited to streaming does not seem practical.\n\n(I realize this would all have been much more useful to bring up in the original issue, and apologize for not following that one more closely. As one path forward, we could reopen 2765 and continue this discussion there.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rickcox","name":"rickcox","key":"rickcox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Cox","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-18T19:06:56.811+0000","updated":"2008-04-18T19:06:56.811+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12394328/comment/12590618","id":"12590618","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> For example, some tasks may mmap multi-GB files but touch only a few pages.

This doesn't address the general problem of constraining/permitting resource usage in arbitrary ways, among other things.\n- Allow users/admins to specify a wrapper script. This will clearly work but feels like it creates unnecessary work for users and admins. Users/Admins have to worry about obtaining the command line from the Tasktracker and execing it. This is a chore if all you want to do is set a ulimit or specify a couple of environment variables.\n- Allow users/admins to specify a prologue script. The prologue is run before the task under the same shell. This will let people set resource limits, environment variables etc. that affect the task. This may be more limiting than a wrapper in some cases, but in those scenarios one always has the option of baking the wrapper into the job.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-04-18T21:19:28.601+0000","updated":"2008-04-18T21:19:28.601+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12394328/comment/12590619","id":"12590619","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"For the prologue, we'd introduce a config variable _mapred.task.prologue_ which can be used to specify a command line to run before the task.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-04-18T21:21:46.417+0000","updated":"2008-04-18T21:21:46.417+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12394328/comment/12590633","id":"12590633","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rickcox","name":"rickcox","key":"rickcox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Cox","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The prologue idea seems to support the variety of uses easily.

The solution seems very specific to a particular problem, and, though we're heavy users of streaming, we've never encountered this need. Will most streaming users run into processes using too much virtual address space? And will they expect that hadoop, by default, would limit that? \n\nThe flip side is that many streaming users will conservatively set Xmx (since Java's behavior with that setting is not comparable to ulimit -v, and the real work is being done by the streaming app anyway), and then wonder why their streaming processes refuse to start or fail randomly. For example, here's what {{ls}} does when it exceeds the {{ulimit -v}} on RHEL3:\n\n{code}\n$ bash -c 'ulimit -v 10; ls'\n$\n{code}\n\nNo error message is produced (bash -c doesn't even print the \"Killed\" message). The exit status is 137, but otherwise, there's no indication of what happened or why, and when the user tries to reproduce it outside of hadoop, it probably won't happen unless they know to set the ulimit -v.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rickcox","name":"rickcox","key":"rickcox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rick Cox","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-22T23:19:45.965+0000","updated":"2008-04-22T23:19:45.965+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12394328/comment/12591645","id":"12591645","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Summarizing the points: \n1) We don't want to have bash related dependencies in the config.\n2) We ideally want to have a wrapper for tasks.\n3) We don't want to have default values for the ulimit setting.\n4) Allen, in an offline email, brought up another point - that tasks can spawn processes from within.
