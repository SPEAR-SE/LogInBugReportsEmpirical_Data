I guess what concerns me now is that we are checking for {{(nread != len)}}, but then we're announcing that the read was short without actually checking that {{nread < len}}.  It might require a logic error for {{nread > len}}, but it still seems like something that could happen if there is a bug.  I think we should only log about a short read after we check that it was short.  There is also another place where this logic message and exception occur, so we should change both (or put them in a common function) if we are changing either.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
