As your tasktracker logs points out, the tasktracker is just too slow in processing the RPCs for some reason, and might eventually recover. In the case where the tasktracker is actually down, the _connect_ call would fail and task can kill itself. Also, the task should kill itself when the ping RPC is successful and returns a false.
