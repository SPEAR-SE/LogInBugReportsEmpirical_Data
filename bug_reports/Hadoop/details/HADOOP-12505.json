It's more a function of the hosting OS.  For example, Harsh has pointed out that for operators using the JNI-based implementation instead of shell-based, Hadoop users already can show up with membership in groups that don't have a POSIX-compliant name.  I've seen that for Windows deployments, and it sounds like the use case here was a Linux deployment connected to Active Directory.\n\nThe group mapping alone is not sufficient to enforce POSIX compliance either.  This is only used to populate the user's set of groups.  It does not control other input paths for group names.  For example, WebHDFS and Java {{FileSystem#setOwner}} API calls can accept names with spaces.  Here is an example, tested on Mac.\n\n{code}\n> curl -X PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:50070/webhdfs/v1/hello2?op=SETOWNER&owner=Chris%20Nauroth&group=Domain%20Users&user.name=chris'\n\n> hdfs dfs -ls /hello2\n-rw-r--r--   3 Chris Nauroth Domain Users          6 2014-07-10 11:24 /hello2\n{code}\n\nThis kind of data of course complicates parsing of shell output, and I imagine many operators would prefer to enforce POSIX-compliant names by policy.  However, I don't believe Hadoop has taken responsibility for that enforcement.\n\nI don't think the existing implementation of {{ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping}} really provides any POSIX compliance benefits, at least not intentionally.  In the example given, it would split the group \"Domain Users\" on spaces and decide to put the user into 2 groups: \"Domain\" and \"Users\".  While those split names don't have spaces, they're also still not POSIX compliant because of the capital letters, and more importantly, they're completely erroneous.  Hopefully the split isn't putting anyone into a real group where they don't really belong.\n\nI see this as a bug rather than a POSIX compliance feature.  I would prefer to see the -1 lifted and have the bug fixed.  That said, I also see it as low priority, since the majority of deployments I see use the JNI-based implementation now, which does not have the bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-26T16:16:15.875+0000","updated":"2015-10-26T16:16:15.875+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12907465/comment/14974493","id":"14974493","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just want to add that Linux also allows numerical group names (i.e. group names that starts with digits), so POSX-compliant is not strictly enforced.

Do you see it as a bug that it works correctly with non-Unix-compliant names?\n\nSomething else for us to consider is the severity to which tools break in the presence of non-compliant names.  For a local file system, it can break parsing in scripts, but it can't harm permission checks, which are based on numeric UID/GID.  In Hadoop, we don't have access to a canonical UID/GID, so we rely on the string names.  (Arguably, we'd be better off with a real UID/GID, but that would be a significant design change.)  Since the bug places users into incorrect groups (i.e. \"Domain\" and \"Users\" in the example), there is a risk of influencing permission checks.  I see this as a more severe problem and something worthy of a bug fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-26T17:47:48.264+0000","updated":"2015-10-26T17:47:48.264+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12907465/comment/14974671","id":"14974671","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"bq. I'm curious then about what is your stance on JniBasedUnixGroupsMapping. Do you see it as a bug that it works correctly with non-Unix-compliant names?\n\nYes, because it means unpredictable behavior.  Unpredictable behavior almost always turns into a security hole. It's trivial to construct a group that turns into ../.. (or whatever) in the path structure if I'm interpreting the output of hadoop fs -ls.  That's very very bad.  (that said: it'd be an awesome crack.  Change the default user's group and watch everyone nuke their own files...)\n\nbq.
