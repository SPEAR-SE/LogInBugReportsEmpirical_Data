I also get a \"The patch does not appear to apply with p0 to p2\" from the dev-support script. No idea what this is supposed to mean, nor do I find anything on googling for that message.\n\nI hope that this patch will do. I've spent about a day on it. If the patch still does not go through, it would be nice if someone more familiar with the workflow could make the modification on my behalf as it is just a single line of code that needs to be replaced in the code.\n\nThanks","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=SaschaC","name":"SaschaC","key":"saschac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sascha Coenen","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-10-13T15:13:19.548+0000","updated":"2014-10-13T15:13:19.548+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12747003/comment/14169439","id":"14169439","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
