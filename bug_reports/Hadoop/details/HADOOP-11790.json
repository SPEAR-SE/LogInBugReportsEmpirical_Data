Because it includes .so and DLL files inside the JAR file, you need those libraries for *all* the platforms it can run on. You also have to force it to statically link against both snappy and leveldb. And there's no tarball containing the JNI code, you have to pull it down with maven. And then of course it's hard-coded to use a specific autoconf version, so you have to regen all that, and then you have to patch the POM so it knows about the new platforms you are adding.\n\nBasically, if you don't have access to *all* the platforms it's exceedingly difficult to build. And even if you *do* have access to all the platforms, you are in a world of hurt anyway, building and then copying libraries and JAR files between platforms.\n\nIn my opinion, if there's any way leveldb can be removed as a dependency, it should be removed. It's pretty much toxic if you need to either build from ground up yourself, or are adding support for a new platform.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alanburlison","name":"alanburlison","key":"alanburlison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Burlison","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-07-28T17:05:45.100+0000","updated":"2016-07-28T17:05:45.100+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12787655/comment/15825580","id":"15825580","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ajisakaa","name":"ajisakaa","key":"ajisakaa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238"},"displayName":"Akira Ajisaka","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"body":"FYI: The next version of leveldbjni will support ppc64le. https://github.com/fusesource/leveldbjni/pull/81","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ajisakaa","name":"ajisakaa","key":"ajisakaa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238"},"displayName":"Akira Ajisaka","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"created":"2017-01-17T07:22:20.063+0000","updated":"2017-01-17T07:22:20.063+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12787655/comment/15972244","id":"15972244","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Ayappan","name":"Ayappan","key":"ayappan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ayappan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Trying to get leveldbjni community to make a new release but no luck so far.\n\nhttps://github.com/fusesource/leveldbjni/issues/85","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Ayappan","name":"Ayappan","key":"ayappan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ayappan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2017-04-18T07:30:37.732+0000","updated":"2017-04-18T07:30:37.732+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12787655/comment/16088813","id":"16088813","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Pending LEGAL review, it looks like RocksDB has changed their license to be ASF compatible.
