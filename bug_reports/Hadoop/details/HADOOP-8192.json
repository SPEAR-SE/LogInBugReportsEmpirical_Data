As per Robert Evans and Devaraj Das, it appears by design that the order should not matter. \n\n The reason order happens to play a role here is that as soon as all the blocks are accounted for, getMoreSplits() stops iterating through the racks, and depending upon which rack(s) each block is replicated on, and depending upon when each rack is processed in the loop within getMoreSplits(), one can end up with different split counts, and as a result fail the testcase in some situations.\n\nSpecifically for this testcase, there are 3 racks that are simulated where each of these 3 racks have a datanode each. Datanode 1 has replicas of all the blocks of all the 3 files (file1, file2, and file3) while Datanode 2 has all the blocks of files file2 and file 3 and Datanode 3 has all the blocks of only file3. As soon as Rack 1 is processed, getMoreSplits() exits with a split count of the number of times it stays in this loop. So in this scenario, if Rack1 gets processed last, one will end up with a split count of 3. If Rack1 gets processed in the beginning, split count will be 1. The testcase is expecting a return value of 3 which is the value returned if running on Sun JVM, but a value of 1 or 2 may be returned depending on when rack1 gets processed.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kumarr","name":"kumarr","key":"kumarr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kumar Ravi","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Easter"},"created":"2012-03-23T19:50:53.079+0000","updated":"2012-03-23T19:50:53.079+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12547241/comment/13237260","id":"13237260","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"One option is to make the relevant hashmaps sorted in CombineFileInputFormat, and then fix the testcase to check the correct (and consistent) values in the asserts.

If so, the next question is - Is this is a testcase scenario issue? --  In a production environment are there scenarios where a Datanode will contain all the blocks in a cluster?\n\n We would like to make sure that we are not fixing a non-existent problem to pass a test case, and inadvertently break the split functionality when it is working without issues. If this just happens to be a behavior issue between two JVMs for a given scenario then it might be more prudent to create separate test paths for each JVM. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kumarr","name":"kumarr","key":"kumarr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kumar Ravi","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Easter"},"created":"2012-03-26T15:23:47.433+0000","updated":"2012-03-26T15:23:47.433+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12547241/comment/13238585","id":"13238585","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I suggest that we split the JIRA into 3 separate ones, as they are technically unrelated, each requiring patches for trunk and branch-1.

E.g., TestCombineFileInputFormat failure is a result of relying on undefined HashMap iteration order in the implementation of CombineFileInputFormat; TestStreamingBadRecords, AFAICT, only fails on plinux (you guys need to figure out the root cause for this); TestCapacityScheduler failures is a bit more serious, as it expose a JLS compliance bug (that can crash JobTracker) in the current code base as well as the HashMap order issue.
