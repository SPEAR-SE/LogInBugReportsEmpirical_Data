JoBQueuesManager receives an event for the job's status being changed, and removes it from the run queue. The removal of the job from the wait queue is left to the initialization poller. The latter is unable to remove the job from the wait queue because of the bug in HADOOP-5020. Hence the job remains in the scheduler's wait queue and shows up in the jobqueue_details.jsp page. \n\nI recommend we do the following:\n* JobQueuesManager should be responsible for removing a job from both the run and wait queue when the job completes. It already does when the job's priority is changed, and so, is already aware that a job can be in both queues and thus needs to be removed from both. With this fix, the job will be removed from the wait queue, regardless of the fix for HADOOP-5020, as the JobQueuesManager receives the job state change event with the old job state. \n* The JobInitializationPoller needs some refactoring. It's really doing two separate things: it builds up a collection of jobs being initialized by walking through the wait queue. Separately, it needs to clean up job objects in its collection by walking through them and removing those jobs which have started running and those that have completed. This makes it responsible for its own collection and the JobQueueManager responsible for its run/wait queues. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-01-15T09:19:09.893+0000","updated":"2009-01-15T09:19:09.893+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12412448/comment/12664080","id":"12664080","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sreekanth","name":"sreekanth","key":"sreekanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sreekanth Ramakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching patch which does following:\n\n*JobQueueManager*\n\n* Changed the internal data-structure name from jobList to waitingJobs.\n* Changed method names addJob, removeJob, getJob to reflect the change to include Waiting in method name.\n* Added logic to remove jobs from waiting job queue in job queue manager.\n\n*JobInitalizationPoller*\n\n* Changed the initialized job list to accept JobInProgress instead of JobID.\n* Moved the job clean up code into a separate method.\n* Breaking out of the jobs list if the maximum number of jobs for the queue limit has been reached.

Then in next polling cycle the list of JobInProgress on which initTasks() has been called is checked and the finished jobs are removed from wait queue. \nWhat happens to the jobs in the wait-queue? I guess in this jira we expect that to happen via the job-state-change-event which wont happen, no?

What worries me is that there's no equals or hashcode defined on the JobInProgress, and we want to lookup only by JobId for semantic reasons. Elsewhere, for e.g. in the JobTracker, if we want to lookup JobInProgress objects, we have a map of jobid to JobInProgress. It would be good to retain the same model.\n- In the javadocs for getJobsToInitialize, where 'n' is introduced, it would be nice to mention that the computation of 'n' is shown later. I originally thought n was a parameter to the method. In that sense, it was a little confusing.\n- Also, it mentions that the method 'picks' first n jobs. However, if the job is already initialized but not running, we don't pick it again. So, maybe saying it 'looks at' first n jobs is a better phrase.\n- The pseudo code written as comments in the method is going to be hard to maintain, and as such was hard for me to even understand. It is also incorrect in a few details. For e.g. it says, if job is found in initialized job list:  noOfUsers++. What if there are 2 jobs for the same user that are initialized. The code doesn't even have a variable for noOfUsers. It is much easier to follow code if the comments are inline with the code. A summary of the algorithm would be good if it is required (in this case, I don't think it is), but not the entire pseudo code at any rate.\n- cleanupInitializedJobList has a redundant continue in the if condition checking for job status == Running.\n- testJobRemovals can be improved. Once again, I feel a summary and not the complete steps in pseudo code makes the comment readable. I think it must only focus on removals, and not on the state of running jobs. Note that testJobMovement already tests the movement of jobs across the queues. I would recommend that the test does the following:\n-- initialize, run and complete a job and make sure it is removed from both lists.\n-- initialize and kill a job, make sure it is removed from both lists (this condition verifies the actual bug fix)\n-- kill a job before initialization, make sure it is removed from the waiting list.\nAnd it is more pertinent to check that the job is not present, rather than check only for the counts.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-01-19T20:44:24.997+0000","updated":"2009-01-19T20:44:24.997+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12412448/comment/12665319","id":"12665319","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bq. The pseudo code written as comments in the method is going to be hard to maintain\n\nI had asked Sreekanth to put the algorithm logic in the comments. I feel it's important to do that because the actual code can be a bit different. You may combine some if statements, or move code around to make it better performing, perhaps, and this often leads to harder readability. The comments indicate what the logic is like, the code may implement it differently. The comments helped me understand what was going on, much more than the code (and accompanying logic) did. That said, the 'pseudo code' or comments need to be accurate. Perhaps they can be reworded a bit to read better. Let me work with Sreekanth to make them better.

The comments indicate what the logic is like, the code may implement it differently.\n\nVivek, if by this statement you mean that you want to give a gist of the algorithm, that's fine. But the way it is commented right now, it does look like the actual code (declaring variables etc) and is very verbose. Given such a level of verbosity, I started looking at code that matches the comments. I guess there are others who would do so too. Also, when one wants to change code in this area, they would look at the comments and the code, both. If they don't match, IMHO, it will confuse more than clarify, even if only the implementation has changed.\n\nIf you feel the inline comments that go with the code will not be good enough, I would recommend we give a gist of the algorithm that explains things. That way, we don't have to change it for every line or branch we touch as long as the summary remains the same.
