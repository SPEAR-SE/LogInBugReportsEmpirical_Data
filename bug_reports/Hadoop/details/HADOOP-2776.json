I don't think this is anything that we actually can fix here other than providing a complicated hostname mapping system for web interfaces.\n\nPart of the frustration I'm sure stems from a misunderstanding of what is actually happening:\n\nbq. The slaves file has the public names listed.\n\nThe slaves file is only used by the shell code to run ssh connections.  It has absolutely zero impact on the core of Hadoop.\n\nbq.  Resolving a public name inside EC2 returns the private IP (which would reverse to the internal DNS name).\n\nHadoop makes the perfectly valid assumption that the hostname the system tells us is a valid, network-connectable hostname.  It is, from the inside of EC2.  We have no way to know that you are attempting to connect from a completely different address that is being forwarded from some external entity.\n\nProxying connections into a private network space is a perfectly valid solution.
