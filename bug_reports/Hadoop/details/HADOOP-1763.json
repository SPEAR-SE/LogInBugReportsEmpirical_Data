The ipc.Server reads requests asynchronously in the listener thread, but responses are written synchronously in handler threads.  So handler threads are not just doing computation, they're also doing i/o, writing responses.  If, e.g., responses are large, and/or clients are slow to read them, then more handler threads will increase throughput.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-09-04T21:39:15.483+0000","updated":"2007-09-04T21:39:15.483+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12376647/comment/12524889","id":"12524889","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> If, e.g., responses are large, and/or clients are slow to read them, then more handler threads will increase throughput.\n\ntrue, more threads can help in this case. Do you think this is the cause of failure in this jira? I doubt it.\n\nHandling slow clients with more threads is inherently problematic and not scalable IMHO.

I doubt it.\n\nProbably not, but I don't really know.  With 2000 nodes, if even 1% get bogged down simultaneously then the jobtracker would run out of handler threads.  And hadoop can slam nodes pretty hard, so they're often not very responsive.  Or if a switch is temporarily saturated, all responses to it might get hung up for a bit.\n\nPerhaps this could be improved by buffering entire responses in handler threads, then having a separate, non-handler thread that uses non-blocking writes to asynchronously write queued responses.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-09-04T22:10:47.145+0000","updated":"2007-09-04T22:10:47.145+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12376647/comment/12524973","id":"12524973","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"bq.
