It is against 0.4, but I'll forward port it to head and integrate it more with the rest of the system, if the approach is generally accepted by the devs. Please consider the patch as a idea-preview, not as a serious stab at the problem.\n\nThe approach is to add a public JobStatus.lastError string, which can be set from any throwable like JobStatus.setLastError(Throwable t). Setting this at relevant places (fx. on errors in mapred.LocalJobRunner.run() as in the patch) is useful for debugging purposes (for me atleast).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kamstrup","name":"kamstrup","key":"kamstrup","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-08-01T11:02:03.000+0000","updated":"2006-08-01T11:02:03.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12344159/comment/12435951","id":"12435951","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The problem was that the web ui was not looking at the complete list of diagnostics, just the diagnostic that was sent with the last status report.
