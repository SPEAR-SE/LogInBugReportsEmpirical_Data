In fact, the fix in HDFS-4925 may not be correct, because it assumes when it returns from QuorumJournalManager.close(), IPC client connection threads are terminated. But the reality is the IPC code assumes connections are closed, not the IPC connection threads (which in any case is buggy as well).\n\nThis is also likely related to the bug reported in HDFS-4925 (TestQuorumJournalManager.testPurgeLogs intermittently Fails assertNoThreadsMatching)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12769872","id":"12769872","filename":"HADOOP-12532.001.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-30T21:22:54.559+0000","size":1297,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12769872/HADOOP-12532.001.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Data race in IPC client Client.stop()","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12909250/comment/14982957","id":"14982957","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think a simple fix is to remove the connection thread from the has map after connections are terminated.
