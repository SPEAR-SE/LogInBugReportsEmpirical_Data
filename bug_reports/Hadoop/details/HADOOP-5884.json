That's why we shifted to percentages. May be a good idea to retain the model. Same argument can be made for running tasks and numSlotsOccupiedByThisUser\n- \"Occupied slots\" seems too techie. Call it 'Used capacity' ? Likewise instead of '% of total slots occupied by all users', call it '% of used capacity' ?\n- TaskSchedulingMgr.isUserOverLimit() - we add 1 if we're using more than the queue capacity. It could be more than 1, depending on the task we are assigning (if it's part of high RAM job)\n- MapSchedulingMgr constructor: typo: schedulr - should be scheduler. Similar for Reduce...\n- Minor NIT: Use format instead of the complicated StringBuffer.append()... kind of code. Makes it really hard to find what's happening.\n- updateQSIObjects.

As of now, we are trying to avoid absolute numbers because of possible inconsistency between scheduler's information and cluster status. And, specifying running tasks as a percentage of total cluster capacity doesn't make sense now with each task possibly occupying multiple slots. The correct fix is to print absolute numbers after removing any inconsisteny possible. Hence pushing this to another follow-up jira issue.\n\n@Arun\nbq. Can we also add the number of slots to the UI?\nI didn't get this. Do you mean number of slots per job being displayed in job-scheduling information? We are already displaying the number of slots used by a queue as percentage.\n\nIf you meant the first, I already considered this, but let it go for another jira. The job scheduling information is being displayed on the jobtracker ui first page and it looked ugly when it spanned multiple lines. I think it would be good if we can remove job scheduling information from the first page. But as that might trigger discussion, I've decided to leave it for now.\n\nbq.Long term - we really should fix TestCapacityScheduler to not check strings and use relevant apis (even package-private ones).\nAgree, even I could realize the pain while modifying testcases, but decide to postpone it for another jira as it is slightly tricky.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-02T11:51:31.260+0000","updated":"2009-06-02T11:51:31.260+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426032/comment/12715857","id":"12715857","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm just proposing we add #slots (along with already available #running_tasks) to both per-queue info and per-job info (jobdetails.jsp) so that it's clear to users that the queue isn't being under-served (since #running_tasks might be lesser than #slots_taken).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-03T08:02:47.883+0000","updated":"2009-06-03T08:02:47.883+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426032/comment/12715926","id":"12715926","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Latest patch with Arun's comments incorporated, bringing back the absolute counts for running tasks, occupied capacities.
