Review as follows:\n\nNitty: lines longer than 80 chars:\n{code}\n        if ((componentIdx < components.size() - 1) && (!globFilter.hasPattern())) {\n...\n            FileStatus childStatus = getFileStatus(new Path(candidate.getPath(), component));\n{code}\n\n* Let's use @Ignore annotations on the tests instead of removing them, I assume we want to add them back in eventually?\n* I think we have an existing bug in the paths of the returned FileStatus. When going through a glob, it sets the path to the built-up path which can include symlinks, while for a non-glob it's using {{getFileStatus}} which has a resolved path. I'm pretty sure FileStatus are supposed to have a resolved path. This is complicated by how PathFilter still needs to compare against the complete built-up path; maybe we could do something like:\n{code}\nif (filter.accept(new Path(prefix, status.getPath().getName()))) {\n{code}\n* Our symlink resolution right now is inconsistent: listStatus does not resolve results, getFileStatus does. Shouldn't this be getFileLinkStatus? Or are we waiting to fix this again in HDFS-9877 when it gets recommitted? I know HADOOP-9972 with the new APIs is coming down the pipe, so I just wanted to bring this up.\n* I'd like to see tests that would have caught these correctness concerns: that resolved paths are returned correctly (with and without a wildcard), that PathFilters are matching against built-up paths as expected (with and without wildcards), and the looping {{/a/b -> ..}} symlink case you mentioned in a comment. Whether it's a terminal or intermediate wildcard also matters here. There are unfortunately a lot of edge cases.\n* Also noticed that we have a little duplication in TestGlobPaths: {{trueFilter}} is the same as {{AcceptAllFilter}}. {{AcceptPathsEndingInZ}} is also only used in the removed test.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-25T01:57:23.454+0000","updated":"2013-09-25T01:57:23.454+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12669562/comment/13777134","id":"13777134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
