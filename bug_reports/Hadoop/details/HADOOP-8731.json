Specifically, default permissions in terms of the Unix mask map to \"700\" on Windows. This means that by default \"others\" (EVERYONE group) do not have \"r+x\" permissions. This further means that, if we have a path \"c:\\some\\path\\file1\" and a user wants to upload \"file1\" to the public distributed cache he has to change the permissions on the whole drive to do so. Now, to make the scenario more \"Windows friendly\", we only require user to change the permissions on the \"file1\" to make it public (more precisely to give EVERYONE group read permissions on the \"file1\").\n\nOn Unix systems, given that default permissions are usually \"775\" or \"755\" the scenario is completely opposite.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2012-09-14T17:03:01.160+0000","updated":"2012-09-14T17:03:01.160+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605104/comment/13456045","id":"13456045","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the explanation, Ivan.\n\nPatch looks good overall.

Now, if I understood things correctly, based on whether the file is marked public or private on the JobClient side, it will be later downloaded from DFS to the public or private LFS location on the TT machine. What we are proposing with this change is to change the logic on the JobClient side that determines whether the file is public or private. Given that all files are by default private on Windows, it would be a real challenge for users to upload a file to the public distributed cache if we keep the old model (see my previous comments).

Why have the following comments been taken out between the patches? And we mean \"EVERYONE read permissions\"?\nTrackerDistributedCacheManager#determineCacheVisibilities is generally not called for local file system paths, so I removed this comment to avoid the confusion. Check Vinod's comment from above:\n{quote}\n - JobClient is given a URI: it could be a local file:// URI or one on hdfs:///\n - JobClient sees if the path is on the same FS as JobTracker's and if not, it copies it. So if you passed a file:///tmp/a.jar to -libjars/-files/-archives, JobClient will copy it into user's jobSubmitDir.\n - So for file:/// paths, the visibility checks are not made. Only in your test-case scenario, where FS = LocalFS, these checks will be made. Hence my comment.\n{quote}\n\nbq. Its old and probably needs a rebase.\nJust checked, the patch should apply fine.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-04-02T20:27:37.788+0000","updated":"2013-04-02T20:27:37.788+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605104/comment/13628313","id":"13628313","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The latest patch looks good, Ivan.
