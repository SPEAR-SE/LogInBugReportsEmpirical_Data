This is a bit dismaying, because the tests are trying to verify that the output contains the _exact path(s)_ as given on the cmdline.  I spent quite a bit of time ensuring one can parse the output for a given path.  Allowing either localhost or 127.0.0.1 to match means the tests won't catch if something mangles the host for non-windows platforms.  I'm not sure how to deal with that... :(\n\nThe majority of the code mangling the authority into another uri, that you had to touch, is basically trying to convert {{scheme-host:port}} into {{scheme://host:port}}.  Instead of all the null and -1 checks to rebuild the uri, it seems it would be simpler to just use {{replaceFirst}}.

The FsShell or FileSystem shouldn't be using the canonical host name or even mangling the URI at all unless a change recently slipped past me...\n@Daryn: Thanks for clarifying your concerns. Commands passed in by the test have the following form: {code}-fs NAMENODE -du /data15bytes{code} where the {{NAMENODE}} string gets replaced with the {{fs.default.name}}. Per my previous comment, namenode default FS URI resolves to {{hdfs://127.0.0.1:port}} on Windows, so from the FsShell perspective, output is equivalent to input.
