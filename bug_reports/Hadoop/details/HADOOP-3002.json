processing was removing blocks that do not belong \nto any file directly ignoring the regular mechanism that first adds invalid blocks into recentInvalidateSets \nand then schedules  them for deletion via heartbeats.\n# I changed block report processing to just placing invalid blocks to recentInvalidateSets\nand not returning any commands to data-nodes. This optimized processReport() because now it \ndoes not scan the block report once again looking for invalid blocks.\n# I changed heartbeat processing because it never checked the safe mode and would schedule\nreplications or deletions if there were any in the pending lists. \nDuring startup the pending lists are empty but in manual safe mode it may not be the case.\nSo now the only commands that are allowed when safe mode is on are requests for block reports \nand distributed upgrade commands.\nIt is not clear why some code in handleHeartbeat() is inside the synchronized section and some is not.\nPlaced everything inside.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-07-04T02:22:31.252+0000","updated":"2008-07-04T02:22:31.252+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12390802/comment/12611264","id":"12611264","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
