The following scenario explains this:\n\nThe client renews his lease every 30 seconds. The namenode declares a client as 'dead' if it does not get a lease-renewal message in 60 seconds. The namenode then reclaims the datablocks for that file; these datablocks may now get allocated from another file.\n\nIf it so happens that a client gets delayed for more than 60 seconds in its lease renewal (due to network congestion, slow response from datanodes, etc. etc), then the namenode will experience a lease expiration and will reclaim the blocks for that file in question. The namenode may now allocate these blocks to a new file. This new file may start writing to this block. Meanwhile the original file-writer may continue to flush his data to the same block because it has not yet experienced a lease-timeout-exception.  This may lead to data corruption. \n\nSimulating the lease-expiration timeouts to occur immediately causes crc corruptions to show up.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba
