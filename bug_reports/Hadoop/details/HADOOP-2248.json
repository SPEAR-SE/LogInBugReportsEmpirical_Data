Change the api of counters so that you can iterate through them using for loops.\n3. Change the api of counters so that applications can keep a reference to the counter.\n4. Change the serialization to use Text.writeString instead of UTF8.writeString.\n5. Change the map/reduce framework to keep reference to its internal counters (counts of map, combiner and reduce inputs and outputs)\n6.
