I don't think it is correct to throw a RuntimeException when a user is not found (ENOENT).\n\nWe can't throw an IOException because the JNI function does not declare \"{{throws IOException}}\"  Throwing an exception not in the throw spec causes undefined behavior.  If you want to change the throw spec, that would also work.\n\nYou can see in JniBasedUnixGroupsMapping.java that the JNI function is declared like this:\n{code}\n  native static String[] getGroupsForUser(String username);\n{code}\n\n(There is no \"{{throws IOException}}\")\n\nbq. The patch does not use errno. It explicitly use the return value. The code before my patch used errno.\n\nOK, I missed the part where you removed this line:\n{code}\n-    } while ((!pwd) && (errno == EINTR));\n{code}\n\nThat was indeed a good line to remove.\n\nHowever, your patch adds these lines:\n{code}\n+    // The following call returns errno. Reading the global errno wihtout\n+    // locking is not thread-safe.\n{code}\n\nThis is doubly wrong because\n* {{getpwnam_r}} doesn't set errno -- it returns the error code as a result\n* {{errno}} is not global and is always thread-safe\n\nSo we need to remove this comment.\n\nI think we need to get rid of {{MAX_USER_LOOKUP_TRIES}} and replace it with a maximum buffer size that we don't go over when we get {{ERANGE}}.  The problem with the current scheme is that it doesn't actually put a limit on buffer size since we don't consider this in our decision to multiply the buffer size by 2x or not.\n\n{code}\n+      char buf[128];\n+      snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"getgrouplist: error looking up user. %d (%s)\",\n+               ret, terror(ret));\n+      THROW(env, \"java/lang/RuntimeException\", buf);\n{code}\n\nShould use either {{newRuntimeException}} or {{newIOException}} here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

For user lookups, the buffer can be relatively small and {{_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX}} won't be too big. So the max buffer size here will mostly be for avoiding infinite lookup loop caused by a bug in library.  I think 32KB is far more than enough for containing a single user's passwd entry. So I set the buffer size limit to 32KB.  I did not change the initial buffer size as {{_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX}} won't be excessively big and using it as the initial buffer size will avoid realloc() in most cases, if not all.\n\nGroup lookups are different.The number of members in the group can vary a lot. {{_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX}} is usually very big and allocating this much upfront may not be ideal.  So I set the initial buffer to be 8KB and allowed it to grow up to 2MB. Assuming average user name length of 15 bytes, 8KB will be large enough to store a group with about 500 members. 2MB will be large enough for a group with about 130K members.\n\nWhat do you think about the new initial buffer size and the limit?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-22T22:07:43.492+0000","updated":"2014-04-22T22:07:43.492+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709632/comment/13977617","id":"13977617","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Sorry, I feel dumb now.\n\nbq. Group lookups are different.The number of members in the group can vary a lot. _SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX is usually very big and allocating this much upfront may not be ideal. So I set the initial buffer to be 8KB and allowed it to grow up to 2MB.... What do you think about the new initial buffer size and the limit?\n\nI was curious about this myself, so I ran the following program:\n{code}\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n  fprintf(stderr, \"%lld\\n\", (long long)sysconf(_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX));\n  return 0;\n}\n{code}\n\nFor me, it returned 1024.  So I don't think {{_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX}} is usually very big.  Apparently the value of {{_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX}} is merely \"an initial suggested size\" and not the actual maximum (as you might think by reading its name).  At least according to this:\nhttp://tomlee.co/2012/10/problems-with-large-linux-unix-groups-and-getgrgid_r-getgrnam_r/\n\nAnyway, I think your new starting size is good, because it will prevent re-allocation in most cases.  So I am +1 on the patch as-is.
