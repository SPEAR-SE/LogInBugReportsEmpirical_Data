Move the \"readSelector = Selector.open()\" statement from Listener() to the Reader() ctor, and change the ctor to have no arguments.\n2. In Reader.run(), wrap the whole method in a try/finally context, with your five-line fix in the \"finally\" clause, and make it conditional on (readSelector != null).\n3. In Responder.run(), similarly wrap the whole method in a try/finally context, with your five-line fix in the \"finally\" clause, and make it conditional on (writeSelector != null).\n\nI would have liked to recommend putting the \"readSelector = Selector.open()\" [Reader] and \"writeSelector = Selector.open()\" [Responder] statements at the beginning of their respective run() methods, so the try/finally context would really be structured right, but I'm not sure its okay in the Responder context -- it looks like some of its methods may invoke writeSelector without the run() being running.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattf","name":"mattf","key":"mattf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Foley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-23T05:12:56.869+0000","updated":"2011-05-23T05:12:56.869+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12498685/comment/13038734","id":"13038734","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I took all of your suggestions, except I didn't add null checks - the variables in question are never reassigned to null, so there's no way they could be, as far as I can tell.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-05-24T19:14:57.378+0000","updated":"2011-05-24T19:14:57.378+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12498685/comment/13038747","id":"13038747","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
