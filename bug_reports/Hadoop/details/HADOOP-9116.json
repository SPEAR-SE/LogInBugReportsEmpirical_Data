I think HADOOP-8723 would have gone in quite some time ago, but note that moving the test jars out of the classpath makes running the tests in those jars more cumbersome.  For example, sleep jobs don't \"just work\" anymore, because they depend upon test code in the common test jar.  I don't think the typical user will care much, but QE setups will have to adapt since sleep jobs are referenced pretty often there.  Maybe we could add a \"hadoop test-classpath\" or \"hadoop classpath tests\" command to spit out the classpath for running tests to make this easier.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-12-05T14:49:23.443+0000","updated":"2012-12-05T14:49:23.443+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618827/comment/13510627","id":"13510627","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Jason, I've done a quick search before opening this JIRA but I didn't hit HADOOP-8723.
