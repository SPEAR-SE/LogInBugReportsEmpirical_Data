The fix version says otherwise.\n\nWell, it's wrong.  One of the nice things about Yetus is that it reveals quite a bit about what is happening.

NPE in LinuxContainerExecutor due to null PrivilegedOperationException exit code.

So, no, this fix isn't in 2.8.2. I suspect what's in 2.8.2 vs. what JIRA thinks are in 2.8.2 is wildly wrong, again, because the branch was cut way too long ago and most people don't realize that branch-2.8 is actually 2.8.3 now.  It's a mess generated by aggressive RMs that then fall off the face of the earth, but it doesn't appear the PMC really cares about this problem enough to put an end to it.  Given that 2.8.1 was voted as a valid release almost 2 months ago and still hasn't seen the light of day says a lot.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2017-07-14T16:30:59.122+0000","updated":"2017-07-14T16:30:59.122+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13076384/comment/16087571","id":"16087571","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Side note:\n\n{code}HADOOP-14521-branch-2.8.2.patch{code}\n\ndoesn't follow\n\n{code}<jira#>-<target-branch>-<version#>.patch{code}\n\nTo match it with a single digit version number, it should be HADOOP-14521-branch-2.8-2.patch\n\nNote the dash vs. period in the last chunk.

You can see an example why periods tend to be confusing here: \n{quote}\nThen maybe we should change the wiki on \"How to contribute\" to be more clear.\nhttps://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute\n{noformat}\nNaming your patch\n\nPatches for trunk should be named according to the Jira, with a version number: <jiraName>.<versionNum>.patch, e.g. HADOOP-1234.001.patch, HDFS-4321.002.patch.\n\nPatches for a non-trunk branch should be named <jiraName>-<branchName>.<versionNum>.patch, e.g. HDFS-1234-branch-2.003.patch. The branch name suffix should be the exact name of a git branch, such as \"branch-2\". Jenkins will check the name of the patch and detect the appropriate branch for testing.\n{noformat}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-07-14T17:30:28.422+0000","updated":"2017-07-14T17:30:28.422+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13076384/comment/16087953","id":"16087953","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Keep reading:\n\n{code}\nHowever, many reviewers find it helpful to include a version number in the patch name (three-digit version number is recommended), so including a version number is the preferred style.\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2017-07-14T20:07:32.406+0000","updated":"2017-07-14T20:07:32.406+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13076384/comment/16154335","id":"16154335","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi, my latest 2.8.2 release docker build get failed, and I get following errors:\n{noformat} \n\"/usr/bin/mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/maven -pl hadoop-maven-plugins -am clean install\nError: JAVA_HOME is not defined correctly.
