There are two types of configuration items it writes into the hadoop-site.xml:\n\n- Entries it generates values for. E.g. the jobtracker URL\n- Entries it is given via the hod configuration file. These are user specified entries.\n\nIt is easy to split the first category. Since the list is a hardcoded set of configuration items, we can hardcode the decision of which file (core, mapred, or dfs) this item belongs to and generate the entries into the appropriate file.\n\nFor the user specified entries, the decision cannot be taken by HOD in a maintainable fashion. Further, it causes more of a problem because of interface and usability issues.\n\nCurrently, HOD has a very convenient command line syntax to specify the list of configuration items, as follows:\n\n-Cname=value - client params\n-Mname=value - Mapred server params\n-Fname=value - Final Mapred server params\n-Hname=value - HDFS server params\n-Sname=value - Final HDFS server params.\n\nOne approach to splitting the configuration is to split each of the categories into 3 as core, mapred and hdfs. However, I feel this might be too cumbersome for users to express.\n\nSo, a proposal is to introduce this syntax:\n{code}\n-<Option Letter>[category:]<name>=<value>, where category is 'core' or 'mapred' or 'hdfs'.\n{code}\n\nFor e.g.\n{code}\n-Mmapred:mapred.reduce.tasks=4 or -Ccore:dfs.client.buffer.size=1000000\n{code}\n\nBased on the category, the configuration item can be generated to the appropriate configuration file.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, we can say that if category is not specified, the configuration item would be generated in the hadoop-site.xml file. When hadoop-site.xml is completely removed from hadoop, HOD can also stop supporting options where the category is not specified.\n\nComments ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-01-27T14:52:49.316+0000","updated":"2009-01-27T14:52:49.316+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12412446/comment/13035743","id":"13035743","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nidaley","name":"nidaley","key":"nidaley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nigel Daley","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"hod contrib was removed","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nidaley","name":"nidaley","key":"nidaley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nigel Daley","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-05-18T22:03:37.819+0000","updated":"2011-05-18T22:03:37.819+0000"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-5047/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0i57j:"}}
