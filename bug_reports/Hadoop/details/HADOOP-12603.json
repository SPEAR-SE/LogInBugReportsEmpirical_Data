I'm linking the issues.\n\nThe failure on Solaris is the same as the way it fails on Windows (if you remove the {{assumeTrue}} that currently skips it on Windows).  The root cause in this case is lack of a native {{stat}} implementation on the platform's Hadoop native library.  This then causes the {{FileStatus}} to be populated with the atime from the target instead of the symlink.  For more details, refer to this comment of mine from HADOOP-12045, where decided to skip these tests on Windows:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12045?focusedCommentId=14606655&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14606655\n\nThe tests are intended to check the capability introduced in HADOOP-12045: changing atime on the local file system.  Removing the tests would leave us in a state where that enhancement was no longer tested regularly.  However, it seems as though the mere act of checking status of the symlink risks updating the atime, depending on timing.\n\nInstead of removing the tests, I suggest that we relax the assertion so that instead of strict equality, it checks that current atime is greater than or equal.  This would still serve the intent of the test, which is to check that {{setTimes}} alters the target instead of the link.

(Similar  to  noatime,\n              but  doesn't break mutt or other applications that need to\n              know if a file has been read since the last time  it  was  modified.)\n\n              Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided\n              by this option (unless noatime was  specified), and the strictatime\n              option  is  required  to  obtain traditional semantics. In\n              addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the file's  last  access  time  is\n              always  updated  if  it  is more than 1 day old.\n{code}\n\nThat's not POSIX-conformant behaviour, and as it says is the default from 2.6.30 onwards. Solaris has a noatime mount option which is the same as Linux's noatime, but no direct equivalent to relatime, although on UFS it has dfratime which is similar. ZFS, which is now the default Solaris filesystem, only has noatime. BSD only appears to have noatime as well. Linux also has nodiratime which isn't available on either Solaris or BSD. Windows varies depending on filesystem type but NTFS may defer updates to atime for up to an hour and you can also disable atime updates entirely. On FAT the resolution of atime is 1 day. \n\nLeaving aside the issue of POSIX correctness, unless you implement a probe that understands the semantics of atime updates across all relevant systems and that probes for the mount options of the filesystem you are testing on, any access time behaviour tests are almost certainly going to be unreliable.\n\nRather than trying to bodge up these tests, I believe it's better to remove them entirely.\n\nMore here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/POSIX_Reference/sys/stat.h/stat#Criticism_of_atime","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alanburlison","name":"alanburlison","key":"alanburlison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Burlison","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2015-12-01T17:55:16.945+0000","updated":"2015-12-01T17:55:16.945+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12916292/comment/15034356","id":"15034356","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jzhuge","name":"jzhuge","key":"jzhuge","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264"},"displayName":"John Zhuge","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Besides these actime mount options at OS/kernel layer, the filesystems below (especially network filesystems) favor performance over atime compliance.\n\nHave we ruled out any problem at JAVA library or JVM layer?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jzhuge","name":"jzhuge","key":"jzhuge","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jzhuge&avatarId=31264"},"displayName":"John Zhuge","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-01T18:55:33.652+0000","updated":"2015-12-01T18:55:33.652+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12916292/comment/15034382","id":"15034382","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alanburlison","name":"alanburlison","key":"alanburlison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Burlison","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"I traced the JVM and it doesn't seem to be doing anything other than normal stat()-type operations to get file times so I don't think there's a problem there.

It did not get involved at all with the automatic access time update semantics of any particular local file system, nor did the tests include any assumptions that atime is enabled on the local file system.  I would agree that our tests cannot make assumptions like that about the local file system.\n\nThe tests in question just need to be able to set an atime value explicitly, and then verify that the atime was changed on the target instead of the link.  If we can get cross-platform agreement on this basic level of functionality, then I expect we can keep the tests.  There won't be any need for complexity like checking the mount table.  I think we just have a corner case bug in that the test's call to {{FileSystem#getFileLinkStatus}} might inadvertently update atime of the link once again.  The proposed patch solves this by relaxing the assertion to use >=.\n\nHADOOP-12045 was implemented as a pass-through to {{BasicFileAttributeView#setTimes}}, which then appears to be a pass-through to [{{futimes}}|http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/futimes.3.html] in UnixNativeDispatcher.c in the OpenJDK source.  On Windows, it's a pass-through to [{{SetFileTime}}|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724933(v=vs.85).aspx] via WindowsNativeDispatcher.c.\n\nThe Linux man page for {{futimes}} says that the function is not specified by a standard and is only implemented for Linux and BSDs.  [~alanburlison], do you know if Solaris has {{futimes}}?  I couldn't find a definitive source on that.  As long as {{BasicFileAttributeView#setTimes}} somehow works correctly onn Solaris, then I expect we're fine.\n\nThe tests need to be skipped right now on Windows and Solaris due to a difference in native code implementation supported by the Linux side compared to other platforms.  I described this in more detail in my comments on HADOOP-12045.  HADOOP-11935 is an open issue that would fix this problem by using appropriate NIO APIs to get the {{stat}}/{{lstat}} behavior we need on those platforms.  I don't think we're indiscriminately skipping tests without trying to understand semantics.  We are skipping them temporarily until after resolution of HADOOP-11935.\n\nTo summarize, I am +1 for committing patch v02, which retains the tests but corrects for a corner case.  Follow-ups are tracked in separate JIRAs.  I will hold off on committing though in case there is further discussion.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-02T20:36:22.920+0000","updated":"2015-12-02T20:36:22.920+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12916292/comment/15037709","id":"15037709","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"do we need to care about atime at all, given we explicitly recommend turning atime off on filesystems used for mounting HDFS.

The standard recommendation to disable atime is less relevant on these client machines.  In some environments, these machines might not be governed by the same system administrators that operate the cluster nodes.  It might not be feasible for them to enforce a noatime policy everywhere.\n\nOne use case for setting atime on the local file system is {{hdfs dfs -copyToLocal -p}}.
