invalid by adding them to recentInvalidates. However the attempts to add them to recentInvalidates failed because of SafeMode. However, the replicas were also left in blocksMap. When NN were out of SafeMode, corrupted replicas were counted as valid ones and the block was treated as over-replicated.

Thus valid data got lost.\n\nIt seems to me that when corrupted replicas are first detected in block report, they should be put in CorruptedBlockMap instead of invalidating them directly.

This adds one more step before incorrect block gets into recentInvalidates. Namely you first place them into corruptReplicas, and when the blocks are fully replicated they will move into recentInvalidates. Verifying that all works correctly on that path is hard. I just tried.

If lease is not open, log an error that we got a length mismatch even when the file was not open.\n  Also file a jira for the case when the lease is not open to perhaps write to edits log to record the new length (I am not sure if writing the new length\nis right or wrong but we can  debate this on that jira).\n\n3) Your fix will not let us distinguish  between true corruption caused by some bug in HDFS,  and the normal mismatch that can occur during appends when \na client dies (I am not sure of this but that is my recollection from the append discussions with Dhruba last year at yahoo).\nThis is okay for now. But let us file a jira to fix this so that we can distinguish.\nThe easy code fix for this is to add a field to internal data structure to record the original length in fsimage - but this will increase the usage of memory in the system\nsince the 4 bytes will be multiplied by the number of  logical blocks in the system.\n\n4) In my opinion the correct behavior for shorter blocks (but longer than the fsimage recorded length) is to invalidate as in the original code - however our invalidation code does not handle the case because if the \"corrupt\" block is the last one it keeps it as valid.  Thus your patch is a good emergency fix to this very critical problem.\n I suggest that we  file a jira to handle invaliding such invalid blocks correctly.\nNote here I am distinguishing between *corrupt* blocks (caused by hardware errors or by bugs in our software) and *invalid* blocks (those lenght mismatches that\ncan occur due to client or other failures). Others may not share the distinction I make - lets debate that in the jira; we need to get this patch out ASAP.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay
