A release upgrade must\nautomatically convert the metadata and data as needed. Further, a release\nupgrade must allow a cluster to roll back to the older version and its older\ndisk format.

A release upgrade must\nautomatically convert the metadata and data as needed. During *minor* releases,\ndisk format changes have to backward and forward compatible; i.e. an older\nversion of Hadoop can be started on a newer version of the disk format. Hence\na version roll back is simple, just restart the older version of Hadoop.\nMajor releases allow more significant changes to the disk format and have be\nonly backward compatible; however major release upgrade must allow a cluster to\nroll back to the older version and its older disk format.\n With this minor release are very easy to roll back for an admin.\n Note this will restrict the kinds of changes that be made in minor releases.\n** Weaker: Limited Automatic Conversion:\nHDFS metadata and data can change across minor or major releases , but such\nchanges are transparent to user application. A release upgrade must\nautomatically convert the metadata and data as needed, but automatic conversion is supported across a small number of releases.

It's generally better to create a new format that programs must opt in to.  An unaltered program, when run against a new version, should ideally continue to generate data that can still be read by older versions and other potential implementations of the format.  Otherwise we break workflows unless every element of the flow is updated in lockstep.  Rather we'd like to permit both writers or readers of data files to be upgraded independently.  Many folks have multiple clusters that are not updated simultaneously and might move data files between them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-17T19:03:28.267+0000","updated":"2013-05-17T19:03:28.267+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12644988/comment/13660963","id":"13660963","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"-Doug, good, though to guarantee it will add new unit tests (pull in old release binaries, verify they can still parse newly created artifacts).\n\nI fear for the native binaries -we have to depend on libsnappy &c to generate compressed content that older versions of their libs can handle.
