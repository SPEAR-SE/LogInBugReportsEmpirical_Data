The Reader obtains such an instance from the pool on object creation and returns it back to the pool it when {{close()}} is called.\n\nSequenceFile.Reader implements the {{java.io.Closable}} interface and it's spec on the {{close()}} method says:\n\n{quote}\nCloses this stream and releases any system resources associated \nwith it. If the stream is already closed then invoking this \nmethod has no effect.\n{quote}\n\nThis spec is violated by the Reader implementation, because calling {{close()}} multiple times has really bad implications. \nWhen you call {{close()}} twice, one and the same Decompressor instances will be returned to the pool two times and the pool would now maintain duplicated references to the same Decompressor instances. When other Readers now request instances from the pool it might happen that two Readers get the same Decompressor instance.\n\nThe correct behavior would be to just ignore a second call to {{close()}}.\n\nThe exact same issue applies to the SequenceFile.Writer as well.\n\nWe were having big trouble with this, because we were observing sporadic exceptions from merge operations. The strange thing was that executing the same merge again usually succeeded. But sometimes it took multiple attempts to complete a merge successfully. It was very hard to debug that the root cause was some duplicated Decompressor references in the decompressorPool.\n\nExceptions that we observed in production looked like this (we were using hadoop 0.17.0):\n\n{noformat}\njava.io.IOException: unknown compression method\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.zlib.BuiltInZlibInflater.decompress(BuiltInZlibInflater.java:47)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.DecompressorStream.decompress(DecompressorStream.java:80)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.DecompressorStream.read(DecompressorStream.java:74)\nat java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(DataInputStream.java:178)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.DataOutputBuffer$Buffer.write(DataOutputBuffer.java:56)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.DataOutputBuffer.write(DataOutputBuffer.java:90)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Reader.nextRawKey(SequenceFile.java:1995)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter$SegmentDescriptor.nextRawKey(SequenceFile.java:3002)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter$MergeQueue.next(SequenceFile.java:2760)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter.writeFile(SequenceFile.java:2625)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter.merge(SequenceFile.java:2644)\n{noformat}\n\nor \n\n{noformat}\njava.io.IOException: zero length keys not allowed\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$BlockCompressWriter.appendRaw(SequenceFile.java:1340)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter.writeFile(SequenceFile.java:2626)\nat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter.merge(SequenceFile.java:2644)\n{noformat}\n\nThe following snippet reproduces the problem:\n\n{code:java}\n    public void testCodecPool() throws IOException {\n        Configuration conf = new Configuration();\n        LocalFileSystem fs = new LocalFileSystem();\n        fs.setConf(conf);\n        fs.getRawFileSystem().setConf(conf);\n\n        // create a sequence file\n        Path path = new Path(\"target/seqFile\");\n        SequenceFile.Writer writer = SequenceFile.createWriter(fs, conf, path, Text.class, NullWritable.class, CompressionType.BLOCK);\n        writer.append(new Text(\"key1\"), NullWritable.get());\n        writer.append(new Text(\"key2\"), NullWritable.get());\n        writer.close();\n\n        // Create a reader which uses 4 BuiltInZLibInflater instances\n        SequenceFile.Reader reader = new SequenceFile.Reader(fs, path, conf);\n        // Returns the 4 BuiltInZLibInflater instances to the CodecPool\n        reader.close();\n        // The second close erroneously returns the same 4 BuiltInZLibInflater instances to the CodecPool again\n        reader.close();\n\n        // The first reader gets 4 BuiltInZLibInflater instances from the CodecPool\n        SequenceFile.Reader reader1 = new SequenceFile.Reader(fs, path, conf);\n        // read first value from reader1\n        Text text = new Text();\n        reader1.next(text);\n        assertEquals(\"key1\", text.toString());\n        // The second reader gets the same 4 BuiltInZLibInflater instances from the CodePool as reader1\n        SequenceFile.Reader reader2 = new SequenceFile.Reader(fs, path, conf);\n        // read first value from reader2\n        reader2.next(text);\n        assertEquals(\"key1\", text.toString());\n        // read second value from reader1\n        reader1.next(text);\n        assertEquals(\"key2\", text.toString());\n        // read second value from reader2 (this throws an exception)\n        reader2.next(text);\n        assertEquals(\"key2\", text.toString());\n        \n        assertFalse(reader1.next(text));\n        assertFalse(reader2.next(text));\n    }\n{code}\n\nIt fails with the exception:\n\n{noformat}\njava.io.EOFException\n\tat java.io.DataInputStream.readByte(DataInputStream.java:243)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.io.WritableUtils.readVLong(WritableUtils.java:324)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.io.WritableUtils.readVInt(WritableUtils.java:345)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Reader.next(SequenceFile.java:1835)\n\tat CodecPoolTest.testCodecPool(CodecPoolTest.java:56)\n{noformat}\n\nBut this is just a very simple test that shows the problem.
