Looks like the patch doesn't apply anymore - was hard to see the changes to tests themselves, mind refreshing the patch? I ll try to review before it goes stale this time. \n\nLet me make sure I understand the fix here. Without the fix, adding a child service to a CompositeService while the CompositeService is initing all its child services leads to ConcurrentModificationException. The patch allows adding these services even during this time, but the newly added child service will never be inited if it not already. So, the patch allows adding services but places the onus on the caller to make sure it is in the correct state; otherwise, bad things can happen. \n\nI am not sure if it is better to have deterministic behavior where we force users to add all the services before CompositeService#serviceInit is called or to allow adding services but leave the onus on the users. \n\nIt would have been nicer to have a check for the child being in at least the parent's state. Would it make sense to have the parent service enter INIT only after all its child services have been INITed? That way, if the parent is already in INIT, we can disallow adding a service in UNINITED state. Also, the current usage pattern of adding services followed by a call to super.serviceInit() will remain valid?

Which is fine, because it will show up later\n\nbq. It would have been nicer to have a check for the child being in at least the parent's state.\nAs start() on a STARTED service is a no-op, it's legal to add a started service to a service still in the inited state. Add an inited child while started -you'll need to start it yourself. It won't break anything though, as it's only transition is stop(), which must be valid from INITED anyway.\n\nbq.

That way, if the parent is already in INIT, we can disallow adding a service in UNINITED state.\n\nroot service model MUST check for the valid transition before calling its execution operations -the whole YARN-117 work was to fix the situation where a lot of services were doing their init logic before super.init(), so could be called repeatedly before checking state, and weren't doing thread-safe operations either. \n\nthe only way could address this is to rework the service model with extra transitional states (initing, starting, stopping), the way some service lifecycles do (such as [Guava|https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ServiceExplained].
