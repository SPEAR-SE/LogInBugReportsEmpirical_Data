We have a theory that seems to fit all the symptoms.\n\nIf you look through the life story of blk_3903667269962316732, the following events appear:\n\n2007-03-16 01:21:05,248 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: *BLOCK* NameNode.reportWrittenBlock: blk_391490390916935261 is written to 1 locations\n2007-03-16 01:21:05,248 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: *BLOCK* NameNode.blockReport: from 72.30.52.207:50010 2627 blocks\n2007-03-16 01:21:05,250 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: BLOCK* NameSystem.blockReceived: blk_391490390916935261 is received from 72.30.52.207:50010\n2007-03-16 01:21:05,250 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: 72.30.52.207:50010 is added to blk_391490390916935261\n2007-03-16 01:21:05,254 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: BLOCK* NameSystem.processReport: from 72.30.52.207:50010 2627 blocks\n2007-03-16 01:21:05,255 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: BLOCK* NameSystem.removeStoredBlock: blk_391490390916935261 from 72.30.52.207:50010\n\nWhat seems to be happening is a race between a client reporting a block and a block report from a Datanode:\n\n- the client reports a written block\n- immediately after this the NameNode receives a block report from the DataNode which *doesn't* contain this block because the block report was generated while the block was in flight\n- the NameNode trusts the block report and blithely removes the block from block map\n- the next attempt by the client to allocate a block causes a NotReplicatedYetException\n\nOther tells for this condition:\n- The NRYE happens mostly in the Namenode benchmark, which generates lots and lots and lots of blocks with exactly 1 replica. With 'n > 1' replicas, 'n' block reports have to coincide with the client report in order for this to happen.\n\n- The NRYE shows up 1 hour into the benchmark and 1 hour is of course the block report interval. We validated this by setting the block report interval to 5 minutes and sure enough NRYEs showed up in 5 minutes.\n\nWe think the checksum patch caused this because it enforced a 1-byte blocksize on .crc files in NNbench. Earlier, setting the block size on a file had no effect on .crc files.
