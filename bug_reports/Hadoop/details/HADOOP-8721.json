The point of fencing is to ensure that if the previously-active NN returns from appearing to have been down, it doesn't start writing to the shared directory again while the new active is also writing to that directory.\n\nbq. I think we can set retries to 1/2 for avoiding unnecessary actions on small nw fluctuations? or we can set it to 0 as we are already setting the same values in ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider for failover clients.\n\nWe set it to 0 in ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider because we want to trying failing over immediately as the retry mechanism, instead of repeatedly trying to contact a machine that may in fact be completely down.\n\nI agree, though, that setting it to a lower number than 45 makes sense in the case of the client in the ZKFC, and perhaps making it configurable separately.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

Myers","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think some wires are getting crossed here. Some clarifications:\n\n* The ZKFC *always* performs the act of fencing, by executing the configured fencing methods.\n* There are two fencing methods shipped out of the box: 1) RPC to the active NN to tell it to move to the standby state, 2) ssh to the active NN and `kill -9' the NN process.\n* You can optionally configure more fencing methods, for example IP-based shared storage fencing, or IP-based STONITH via PDU fencing.\n* The ZKFC proceeds to execute the various fencing methods in the order they're configured.\n* One of the stated aims of the HA work was to favor data reliability over availability. So, if we can't guarantee the correctness of the data, we shouldn't cause a state transition.\n\nGiven all of the above, at least one of the fencing methods *must* succeed before the ZFKC can reasonably cause the standby to transition to active. Imagine a network failure wherein the ZKFCs can no longer reach the active NN, but can reach the standby. If we just try to ping the active NN for a while, without having successfully fenced it, and then transition the standby to active since we can't ping the previous active, then both NNs might be active simultaneously, write to the shared storage and corrupt the FS metadata. This isn't acceptable.\n\nAs I said previously, I'm very much in favor of lowering the number of graceful fencing retries to a reasonable value. Todd recommended 0 or 1, which sounds fine by me. What I'm not in favor of is changing the ZKFC to ever cause the standby to become active without *some* fencing method succeeding.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

I don't think the increased memory usage from having one extra copy of the conf object will be an issue at all. It will also be good from a future-proofing perspective to make sure that any mutations to the passed-in Configuration object don't affect the behavior of a long-lived FailoverController object.

The other two similar methods are necessary because they're called from the ZKFailoverController class.
