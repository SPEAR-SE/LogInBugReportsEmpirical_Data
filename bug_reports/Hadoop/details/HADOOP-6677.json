It seems odd to mandate a pre-determined audience for a particular API. To me, it seems better to say \"this is a developer-level interface\" (stability is independent), which may be used by different projects. A Private API, by contrast, is one that may not be used outside the project.\n\nWith this simplification, the LimitedPrivate annotation would be interpreted as being intended for developers rather than users of Hadoop. This would allow any project to use the API, including subprojects, contrib projects, or projects that are not a part of Hadoop.\n\nFor example, by marking the MapReduce interfaces that schedulers need limited-private the scheduler implementations could be hosted anywhere - as contrib modules as they are today, or as an independent project - it shouldn't matter. Futhermore, by making the Java visibility public, the scheduler implementations would not have to be in the same package as the interfaces, as they are today. Users would not see these interfaces, since they are not in public javadoc.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2010-04-05T04:19:56.838+0000","updated":"2010-04-05T04:19:56.838+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461059/comment/12853484","id":"12853484","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alangates","name":"alangates","key":"alangates","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Gates","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The thing I like about having a component name associated with the limited private interface is it tells developers who depends on that interface.
