By design the storage file is an indicator that the old layout is present.\n>     The order is important since the recovery is based on that order.\n\nThe \"storage\" file is a bad indicator precisely because the pre-13 versions of Hadoop's datanodes create it without question. The \"data\" directory is a much much better indicator, because it is _not_ created automatically. This is far too common a case to allow Hadoop's automatic upgrade to corrupt you data node's directory.\n\n> I think this works as designed.\n\nIt may work the way that you intended it, but it is really bad from a usability standpoint. My change isn't perfect, but it handles it much better and you haven't provided any use cases where it is worse.\n\n> You made a mistake, the software detected inconsistency and warned you. \n\nWhich is fine, except it also corrupted the repository such that I had to make hand edits to each node in the cluster to fix the problem. That is not ok.\n\n> I do not understand what is expected here. I do not understand what is it blocking.\n\nWhat is expected is that if you try to bring up a version 12 data node on a version 13 data node directory it will fail. However, when you fix the problem and use version 13 again, it must come up without a problem. Making the administrator log into every single node to delete a file is not ok.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-11T20:50:39.252+0000","updated":"2007-05-11T20:50:39.252+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366942/comment/12495215","id":"12495215","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"You leave data-node directories in an _inconsistent_ state, namely there are two repositories coexisting together.\nThis is going to create a confusion on whether the conversion really took place and to what extent.\n\nAnother problem is that exactly the same thing can happen if conversion fails after renaming the data directory\nto current, but before moving the storage file into the current dir.\nWith you patch this failure will not be detected.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-12T01:03:54.103+0000","updated":"2007-05-12T01:03:54.103+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366942/comment/12495857","id":"12495857","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nidaley","name":"nidaley","key":"nidaley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nigel Daley","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"A new approach to fixing this issue is being developed","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nidaley","name":"nidaley","key":"nidaley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nigel Daley","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-05-15T04:58:14.663+0000","updated":"2007-05-15T04:58:14.663+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366942/comment/12496371","id":"12496371","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think we should target a more general task here (if any), which could be called \"backward incompatibility\" I guess. \nNamely, a conversion from a pre-upgrade layout versions to the current one should be performed in a way that\nany attempt to run old version hdfs software in converted repository would fail.\n- For data-nodes this can be achieved by retaining the storage file in its original location but updating its\nversion to a newer one.
