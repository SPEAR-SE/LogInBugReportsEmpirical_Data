When does it expire? When anyone invokes a DNS, he/she should be aware of potential delays. Thats why in many places Hadoop is very careful about DNS.. avoids it in most places at runtime.  Though adding cache looks like 'obviously a good thing', I am not sure if it needs to be added to handle not so common error conditions. If it is required because the application is DNS-heavy, then it helps.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-07-09T18:25:59.011+0000","updated":"2008-07-09T18:25:59.011+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12396480/comment/12612224","id":"12612224","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> Regd cache : Should we enable all the time? \nOpps! the patch does not add a DNS resolution cache.

Most developers work from well managed networks where things like DNS work properly; its out in the mass-end-user world that networking becomes atrocious. I think for Hadoop, it would be important to list the supported/unsupported network configurations, and only target the supported stuff. The unsupported stuff -if it can be detected and warned about, then all is well, but some requirements \"you have a network and it is fairly reliable\" may be things that we can just rely on, and opt not to feel guilty if the code doesn't work when that requirement isn't met.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_l","name":"steve_l","key":"steve_l","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-08-29T09:27:11.094+0000","updated":"2008-08-29T09:27:11.094+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12396480/comment/12626989","id":"12626989","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> OK.
