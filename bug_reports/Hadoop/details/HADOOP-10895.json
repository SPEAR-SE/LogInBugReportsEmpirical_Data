Hightlight of the changes:\n\n* Since hadoop-auth doesn't have dependency on hadoop-common, we can't access the usual configuration object from within hadoop-auth.  I changed ConnectionConfigurator  from interface to class, and make it carry the info about whether fallback to pseudo authenticator is enabled. \n* I made it the client of this class' responsibility to pass the info to ConnectionConfiguration. \n* I used the same property used for HADOOP-9698 for enabling/disabling the fallback. The default is that the fallback is disabled.\n* Changed many related tests to enable the fallback so the tests work the same way as before this fix.\n\nHi [~tucu00], wonder if you will have time to review, I would really appreciate if you can. Please let me know if not.

If the default is going to be not to fallback, I think the tests should be updated to not require falling back (unless the test is specifically testing something that requires fallback to be enabled).\n{quote}\nIndeed quite some existing testcases count on the fallback behaviour. Enabling the config property make them to pass. So this indicates that the old behaviour is not broken as long as we enable the config property. I agree that we should have some tests that don't count on the fallback, however, I expect there should be some tests like that already (those I don't have to fix because they succeeded without fallback), because the fallback is just a fallback after all. I will probably dig some more to find some of those tests out. \n\n{quote}\nCan you add a test that verifies that you can't fallback when it's disabled?\n{quote}\nAdded \n{code}\n@Test(expected=AuthenticationException.class)\n  public void testDisallowFallbacktoPseudoAuthenticatorFail()\n{code}\n\n{quote}\nSetting \"ipc.client.fallback-to-simple-auth-allowed\"...\n{quote}\nIn the new rev I made it a requirement to pass the default authenticator to the constructor of AuthenticatedURL, because it's not easy to pass the config property to the  old default authenticator implemented in AuthenicatedURL.

I agree with you that though this jira looks simple but it's kind of tricky.\n\nI think rev3 is quite close to what you suggested. When I tried to address Robert's comments (especially comment #4), I came up with the idea of enforcing user to pass an authenticator to AuthenticatedUR (in rev4), because I thought if a client need to solve the issue here, the client code need to be changed anyways. But I agree with you that keeping the old interface is likely better.\n\nI think going with the approach in rev3 works with me too. Would you comment on rev3 if you have time? I will look into improving rev3 to address both Robert's and your comments.\n\nHi [~rkanter], thanks for your earlier comments. About your comment #4 of using property, the problem is that we need a way to communicate the property to AuthenticatedURL etc, which we don't have interface to do so. Thus it appears to me that it's unavoidable to add new interface (rev3) or enforcing user to pass an authenticator object (rev4).

The authenticator created here is dynamic instead of static.\n\n*the suggested change is to create a static authenticator when {{AuthenticatedURL#setAllowDefaultAuthToFallbackToPseudo}} is called.

I can make this change to {{AuthenticatedURL}}, I wonder whether there is any compatibility concern of doing so?\n\nThanks.\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-03T18:09:04.811+0000","updated":"2014-11-03T18:09:04.811+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729529/comment/14194887","id":"14194887","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Because the {{AuthenticatedURL}} creates the {{Authenticator}} with some constructor is that I was suggesting adding the {{getAuthenticator()}} method to the {{AuthenticatedURL}} so the {{Authenticator}} can be configured not do  fallback.

If my understanding is correct, the problem with allowing fallback is that a man-in-the-middle attack could trick the client into giving it information without needing Kerberos credentials.  For example, if a malicious fake NameNode somehow tricked a client into talking to it instead of the real NameNode, it normally would have a problem because it would have to get valid Kerberos credentials to actually talk to the client.  However, with the fallback enabled, it could trick the client into falling back to pseudo auth, where it could then continue talking to the client, and getting potentially sensitive information from it (e.g. you're trying to upload a file with social security numbers in it or something).\n\nIn that case, we should disable this and we'll just have to break compatibility.

Had to work on a critical internal issue for some time, so sorry for being late here.\n\nAbout your second comment, I also think it's a good practice for all client code to create an authenticator with the expected on/off setting and pass it to AuthenticatedURL or DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL's constructor. I actually tried to enforce that all client must pass a valid authenticator in rev004. But to be backward compatible, we moved on to rev007 now.\n\nCurrently KMSClientProvider uses constructor {{public DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL(ConnectionConfigurator connConfigurator)}} and counts on DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL to create a default authenticator of type {{DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL#DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATOR}}.\n\nTo address your comment #2,  we need to create an authenticator in KMSClientProvider. We need to know what type of authenticator to create. To be backward compatible, it seems we should continue to use the type  {{DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL#DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATOR}}, which is defaulted to {{KerberosDelegationTokenAuthenticator.class}} and is resettable by client code. \n\nSo to address your comment#1, we can replace the following code in KMSClientProvider\n{code}\npublic HttpURLConnection run() throws Exception {\n     DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL authUrl =\n             new DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL(configurator);\n{code}\nwith\n{code}\npublic HttpURLConnection run() throws Exception {\n     Class<? extends DelegationTokenAuthenticator> authType = DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL.getDefaultDelegationTokenAuthenticator();\n     DelegationTokenAuthenticator auth = (authType == KerberosDelegationTokenAuthenticator.class)? \n           new KerberosDelegationTokenAuthenticator(allowFallback) : authType.newInstance();\n     DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL authUrl =\n           new DelegationTokenAuthenticatedURL(auth, configurator);\n{code}\n\nWould you please confirm if this is what you are looking for? \n\nThanks a lot.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-08T05:12:33.433+0000","updated":"2014-11-08T05:12:33.433+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729529/comment/14203501","id":"14203501","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~tucu00],\n\nThe concern you raised in your comment #2  is that some code might mess with the default fallback setting in the KerberosAuthenticator and cause unwanted effect.  I came up an alternative solution that I think would address this concern without having to do the change described in my last comment. I just uploaded rev 008, with your comment #1 addressed too.\n\nThat is, let KMSClientProvider remember the value of allowFallback specified in the configuration file as a private boolean member when KMSClientProvider object is constructed, and then refresh the KerberosAuthenticator's default setting each time before KMSClientProvider object creates AuthenticatatedURL object.\n\nAfter all, our intention is that the default setting should be the same as specified in the configuration file all the time after initialization. What we are adding here is a protection in case some code accidentally changed the setting.\n\nBTW, as far as I can see, the only production code that has the need for this change is KMSClientProvider, other similar places are in testing code. I think it's ok for the other places to rely on setting the default fallback at initialization time without refreshing, which would even help us to find any culprit code that tries to mess with the default setting after initialization, if error happens.\n\nWould you please help take a look at rev 008?\n\nThanks a lot.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-08T17:01:17.436+0000","updated":"2014-11-08T17:01:17.436+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729529/comment/14203508","id":"14203508","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"BTW, I'm flexible going with this new alternative, or have a solution toward the direction mentioned in\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-10895?focusedCommentId=14203225&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14203225\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-08T17:22:05.346+0000","updated":"2014-11-08T17:22:05.346+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729529/comment/14203580","id":"14203580","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Appreciate your help very much!\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-07T02:22:39.988+0000","updated":"2014-12-07T02:22:39.988+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729529/comment/14241962","id":"14241962","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I've re-looked at rev 8 and it looks fine to me.

So while this release note is fine for Hadoop components, it doesn't look like it's accurate for non-Hadoop components.  You could just add something about setting it programmatically.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-11T01:20:36.381+0000","updated":"2014-12-11T01:20:36.381+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729529/comment/14243862","id":"14243862","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~rkanter],\n\nThanks a lot for your review, and sorry for getting back late.\n\nI just uploaded rev9 (rev8 rebased on latest trunk), and changed the release notes as you suggested. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-12T08:21:30.747+0000","updated":"2014-12-12T08:21:30.747+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729529/comment/14244041","id":"14244041","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

The idea would be that Oozie uses {{KerberosAuthenticator}} even in a non-secure cluster, relying on the fallback behavior.  With the patch, that should now fail because the fallback is disabled by default.  \n\nHowever, when we tried this, we saw that it still was able to connect with the {{KerberosAuthenticator}} (and also the {{PsuedoAuthenticator}}.  We attached a debugger and discovered that it wasn't even trying to use Kerberos and succeeding; it actually looks like the {{KerberosAuthenticator}} can be used to talk to a non-secure cluster, without falling back.  See this code here from {{KerberosAuthenticator}}:\n{code:java}\n      if (conn.getResponseCode() == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {    // <----- A\n        LOG.debug(\"JDK performed authentication on our behalf.\");\n        // If the JDK already did the SPNEGO back-and-forth for\n        // us, just pull out the token.\n        AuthenticatedURL.extractToken(conn, token);\n        return;\n      } else if (isNegotiate()) {                                   // <----- B\n        LOG.debug(\"Performing our own SPNEGO sequence.\");\n        doSpnegoSequence(token);\n      } else {                                                      // <----- C\n        LOG.debug(\"Using fallback authenticator sequence.\");\n        Authenticator auth = getFallBackAuthenticator();\n        // Make sure that the fall back authenticator have the same\n        // ConnectionConfigurator, since the method might be overridden.\n        // Otherwise the fall back authenticator might not have the information\n        // to make the connection (e.g., SSL certificates)\n        auth.setConnectionConfigurator(connConfigurator);\n        auth.authenticate(url, token);\n      }\n    }\n{code}\n\nIn the case we were expecting it to fail, we get to Line A.  Because it’s a non-secure cluster, we get an HTTP_OK when we talk to the server, even without Kerberos credentials.  Because of that, it goes ahead normally.  As the comment suggests, Line A can also occur sometimes in a normal Kerberos case.\n\nLine B occurs when we’re doing a Kerberos negotiation.  And Lince C occurs when we’re not doing Kerberos; which is what we were expecting to hit in our test but didn’t.\n\nWe can’t remove Line A; IIRC, we’ve tried that in the past and it’s caused problems.  So, I’m not really sure what we should do here.  Regardless of fallback, it looks like the KerberosAuthenticator can talk to a non-secure cluster, which was the point of this JIRA.

Due to the incompatibility of this fix, 3.0 would be an opportunity to get it in. However, there is some related change to be done in other components, per earlier discussion in this jira. We'd need a consensus before we can spend time to move this forward (I may not have the bandwidth at this moment).  I wonder what other people think. Any comment [~tucu00], [~rkanter], [~atm] and [~hitliuyi]? thanks.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-02T23:39:08.332+0000","updated":"2016-05-02T23:39:08.332+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12729529/comment/15267879","id":"15267879","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue} 0m 0s {color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} patch {color} | {color:red} 0m 4s {color} | {color:red} HADOOP-10895 does not apply to trunk.
