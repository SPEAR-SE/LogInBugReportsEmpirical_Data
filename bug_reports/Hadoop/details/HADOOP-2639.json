HADOOP-2247 introduced a new strategy for killing the maps i.e kill the map if {{(fetch-failure-notification/num-running-reduce-tasks) > 0.5}}. It seems that {{num-running-reduce-tasks}} can achieve negative value thus breaking the overall strategy and stalling the whole job by not killing the maps. This is because the reduce count is incremented if the TIP is not running and decremented for every task in the TIP. Providing a patch that addresses this issue by incrementing the counter for every task that gets scheduled.
