For example, the ACL code pre-populates this cache, so that any user-group mapping can be resolved for all groups defined in the service.\n\nHowever, the current refresh code only adds users to existing groups, so a loss of group membership won't take effect. This is because the internal user-groups mapping cache is never invalidated. If this is simply invalidated on clear(), the cache entries will build up correctly, but user-group resolution may fail during refresh, resulting in incorrectly denying accesses.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12575748","id":"12575748","filename":"HADOOP-9436.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-03-27T19:14:54.283+0000","size":10861,"mimeType":"text/x-diff","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12575748/HADOOP-9436.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"319912","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"NetgroupCache does not refresh membership correctly","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639101/comment/13615663","id":"13615663","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I tried to minimize contention in the patch.
