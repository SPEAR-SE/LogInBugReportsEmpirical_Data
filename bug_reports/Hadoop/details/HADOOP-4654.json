The load on the JT in terms of memory among other things would be simply doubled. Of course, there are other issues like the need to associate the commit task with the real task (since a task's success/failure would be governed by the success/failure of its commit task), and so on..\nSo for 0.19 (and the trunk), I propose that we keep the existing model of running the commit task (OutputCommitter.commitTask) in the same task context and just spawn new tasks for cleaning up the outputs of failed/killed tasks (for running OutputCommitter.abortTask). Presumably the number of failed tasks won't be many and hence the load on the JT shouldn't increase that much. Also, we can probably stop launching cleanup tasks for each failed/killed task once the job succeeds/fails (which also means that the job level cleanup task (OutputCommitted.cleanupJob) has run), with the assumption that the job level cleanup has cleaned all garbage up.\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-12-02T19:18:07.786+0000","updated":"2008-12-02T19:18:07.786+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408451/comment/12652668","id":"12652668","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Should this jira be used for 18.3 alone? and shall we have another jira for 19.1 and trunk?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-12-03T03:34:01.180+0000","updated":"2008-12-03T03:34:01.180+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408451/comment/12652680","id":"12652680","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"+1 to making a separate jira for 0.19/trunk.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-12-03T04:51:22.596+0000","updated":"2008-12-03T04:51:22.596+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408451/comment/12652698","id":"12652698","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Attaching patch after removing unnecessary fs. exists call from earlier patch.\n\ntest-patch result on branch 0.18:\n{noformat}\n     [exec] -1 overall.\n     [exec]\n     [exec]     +1 @author.
