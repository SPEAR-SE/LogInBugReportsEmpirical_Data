I tested the patch with a pipes application not emitting anything, just reading from DFS using libhdfs, and the application continued long after killing the task till it tried to shutdown the socket.\n\nAnother major headache of the current implementation is that the 'PING' enum value replaced the enum value for 'DONE' which increased by 1. This way the release process of applications needs to be sync'd up with Hadoop releases. It proved so inconvenient that I switched the two enums around in my patch.\n\nOn Unix checking for (getppid() == 1) works nicely.
