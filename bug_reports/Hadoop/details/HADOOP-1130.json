Since Hadoop may be used as a third party library, it must use finalizers and shutdown hooks to clean up properly. The problems with have an explicit close method that the user must call are:\n  1. Forcing users to remember to cleanup your library is error-prone.\n  2. Just because library Foo is done does not mean library Bar is done and Bar will lose when Foo calls close.\n\nThat said, I think that with some relatively minor changes, we can get the effect that you want (minimal garbage after the usage of the FileSystem is done):\n  1. Fix HADOOP-1160 so that the FileSystem.closeAll actually closes the client.\n  2. Have FileSystem.closeAll clear the CACHE map via reset.\n  3. Have the DFSClient.close method remove the client from the ClientFinalizer.\n  4. Have the constructor add \"this\" to the ClientFinalizer.\n\nSo after the closeAll call, you'll still have the DFSClient class loaded, but not much else.
