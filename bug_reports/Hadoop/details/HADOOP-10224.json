If new exists, it would imply that the flush did not proceed to completion.. in which case, I was thinking, the JKS should restart with the last know good configuration silently. Not sure if the admin should be flagged at this point.\n\nAlso, during startup, \n\n{code}\n..\nif (fs.exists(newPath) || fs.exists(oldPath)) {\n      if (fs.exists(newPath)) {\n        try {\n..\n{code}\n\nI was wondering if we have to check if \"new\" exist ? Ideally, on startup, the JKS should be brought to one of two states : \"old\" state or a completely flushed state (\"current\"). the \"new\" file in my opinion is an intermediate file (and should be deleted by flush() if it proceeds to completion)\n\nI was also wondering if :\n\n{code}\nif (fs.exists(newPath) || fs.exists(oldPath)) {\n    //THROW EXCEPTION, something weird happened, admin should take care of\n  }\n{code}\n\nis needed, since we can safely assume that if the JKS has initialized properly, there should not exits a \"new\" and \"old\" file at the time of flush. no ?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-31T18:00:22.768+0000","updated":"2014-07-31T18:00:22.768+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688362/comment/14081220","id":"14081220","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~tucu00], in my previous comment, for the first item, I now see why you need to throw an exception.. please ignore.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-31T18:17:03.444+0000","updated":"2014-07-31T18:17:03.444+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688362/comment/14082050","id":"14082050","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated patch with [~tucu00]'s feedback suggestions","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-01T08:04:10.347+0000","updated":"2014-08-01T08:04:10.347+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688362/comment/14082169","id":"14082169","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This may be acceptable given that an explicit action of configuring a password file was taken but misconfigured but I just wanted to make sure that we were aware that this is short-circuiting the previous behavior.\n* comment for the Need to save off the permissions in case it has to be rewritten should be moved to where that is actually being done now - or perhaps this whole block could be in a saveOffPermissions method.\n* I think that the comments in the following block are misleading and should be reworded to indicate that we are testing whether flush has completed successfully or they should moved inside the condition that proves that it hasn't:\n{code}\n      if (fs.exists(path)) {\n        // flush did not proceed to completion\n        // _NEW should not exist\n        if (fs.exists(newPath)) {\n          throw new IOException(\n              String.format(\"Keystore not loaded due to some inconsistency \"\n              + \"('%s' and '%s' should not exist together)!!\", path, newPath));\n        }\n{code}\n\nI'd also like to know whether and how this has been functionally tested with concurrent activity in order to tease out all of these scenarios.

Will post a followup patch with your suggestions. Couple of things though :\n\n* bq. .. consolidate the tryLoadFromPath and loadAndReturnPerm methods ..\nThe {{try..}} methods were intended to mark the different code paths and thereby reduce the size of the constructor making it a bit more readable. The {{loadAndReturnPerm}} method is more a utility method that is used in a couple of places. I agree it might look similar, but I feel we should keep it as it is to aid the readability.\n\n* bq. I'd also like to know whether and how this has been functionally tested with concurrent activity in order to tease out all of these scenarios. I am a little concerned about _NEW and _OLDs getting stepped on by concurrent requests. Especially in KMS.\nSo, The KMS is always configured with a single instance of the JKS and the {{flush()}} method is protected by a writeLock. The constructor is the only other thing that can mess up the _NEW and _OLD files, which I don't think will be called concurrently.

There are a couple things that I think would make it easier to understand:\n\n* javadocs on those private methods that really explain what is being done\n* the tryLoadFromPath takes a path argument but is being passed the oldPath which seems wrong from where it is being called. You have to read the method to understand that it is being passed to clean up or to fallback to. Either pass both paths as arguments, make them all member variables or somehow change the name of the method to make it more clear that it is the right argument to pass.\n* inside flush - I think you could extract a couple methods like backupOld, restoreOld or something to that effect. We are basically implementing a common pattern of backup, write-new and swap the current to new or old versions. We should be able to code to methods that are representing that pattern clearly.\n\nFunctionally, it all seems to hold together to me.\nGiven sufficient javadocs and maybe some new methods and names - I think it will be ready to go.\n\nThanks!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry
