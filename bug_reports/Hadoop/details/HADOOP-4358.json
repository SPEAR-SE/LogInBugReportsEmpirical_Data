We should change the time unit for {{dfs.access.time.precision}}. Now it is in milliseconds, we should measure it in hours.\n- Returning to the issue. The unit test calls a copy constructor of INode, which calls setAssessTime(), which in turn calls static method {{FSNamesystem.getFSNamesystem().getAccessTimePrecision()}}. So the problem here is to get rid of the static method call. And you cannot do it in the unit test, because the INode constructor used there does not even specify the access time.\nI agree with Nicholas that obtaining non-static members from FSNamesystem like that is not a good idea, it is more like a shortcut.
