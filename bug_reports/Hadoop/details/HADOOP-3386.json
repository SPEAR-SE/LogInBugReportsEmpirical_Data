On failed task, remove the task from runningJobs, but do not delete runningJobs job entry even if it's the only task of the job; (which means we should NOT call TaskTracker.removeTaskFromJob)\n\n2. JobTracker should keep another data structure: jobsToTracker, for recording all the TaskTrackers that a job has started a task on.\n\n3.
