However, it does help to skip the drive letter that may appear in a Windows path. Without the equivalent logic, the code follows will fail for a path that begins with drive letter. 1) We divide the path into \"components\" separated by path separator; 2) we begin list from root, and add file/directory that matches the \"component\" for each \"component\" in the \"components\" list to the candidate list. For path begins with drive letter, the code will think the drive letter as some path on root directory; thus leads to the failure.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-20T17:25:34.332+0000","updated":"2013-08-20T17:25:34.332+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12664565/comment/13745226","id":"13745226","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching a patch.
