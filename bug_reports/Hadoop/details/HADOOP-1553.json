Before the patch, running the word count example on a given input (Alice in Wonderland *smile*) would take 6 seconds normally and minutes if the program printed to stdout. After the patch, it takes 4 seconds with no stdout and 6 seconds with printing.\n\nThis patch includes several incompatible changes:\n  1. The user logs are no longer stored in segments, but rather complete files.\n  2. All tasks are launched via bash to get input redirection.\n  3. The cap on user logs has been turned off by default. It is still available, but makes the command used to launch tasks much more complicated.\n  4. The entire length of the user log cap is stored in memory now rather than disk. Thus, setting the cap to a large value may cause problems.\n  5. The task logger has fewer configuration knobs that have been removed from the log4j.properties.\n  6. The urls to access the task logs from the task tracker have changed. The new urls only have start and end offsets, but the offsets may be either positive from the start of the file or negative from the end of the file. \n  7. The jsp has been replaced by a servlet, so that the bytes don't need to be interpreted as a string.\n  8. The servlet does not buffer the entire log into memory before it sent to the user.\n  9. The TaskLog class is now public so that pipes can use it.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen
