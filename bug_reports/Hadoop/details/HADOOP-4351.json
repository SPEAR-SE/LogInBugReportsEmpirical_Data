(And I fixed the corrupt blocks: I didn't want to live with a problematic file system for too long!)\n\nThe code printed out the replicas in the blocksMap (node 10, 145, 117) and the corrupt entries in the corruptReplicas vairable (node16).  The existing code calculates that 3 - 1 = 2 replicas must be good (this is a mistake as corruptReplicas is not a subset of blocksMap); however, when it starts to populate the machineSet, it only gets as far as nodes 10 and 145, then throws the exception on 117.\n\nYou're right - there's possibly an underlying problem here which this patches a symptom of.  However, it still is a useful thing to fix: it is rather painful to go through filesystem cleanup when fsck dies instantly.\n\nI believe there log message was something like this one:\n\n2008-10-07 05:04:24,021 INFO org.apache.hadoop.dfs.StateChange: BLOCK NameSystem.markBlockAsCorrupt: block blk_-5420894356244363410_2169 could not be marked as corrupt as it does not exists in blocksMap\n\nI think if a data node reports it has a corrupt block, then it gets added to the corrupt map and not the blocksMap.
