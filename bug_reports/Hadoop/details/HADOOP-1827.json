We now need a separate {{Combiner}} interface, since the combiner's {{OutputCollector}} *needs* to be able to sort keys, hence requires a {{WritableComparable}} - same as the {{Mapper}}.\n2. We need a separate {{SortableOutputCollector}} (for {{Mapper}}/{{Combiner}}) and a {{NonSortableOutputCollector}} (for {{Reducer}}).\n3. Alas! As a consequence of (1) & (2)we cannot use the same class as both a {{Reducer}} and {{Combiner}} anymore, a serious compatibility issue.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this issue is two-fold:\n1. Spark a discussion among folks, both hadoop-dev & hadoop-users, to figure if this really is a problem i.e. do folks really care about this anomaly in the existing {{Reducer}} interface? Also, is it worth the pain (@see 'Cons') to go fix it.\n2. Even if we decide to live with it, this issue could record for posterity why we love hadoop, warts and all. *smile*\n\nLets discuss...\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"106007","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Reducer.reduce method's OutputCollector is too strict, it shoudn't need the key to be WritableComparable","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12377307/comment/12524435","id":"12524435","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think the benefits of having the Combiner and Reducer share an API outweigh the cost of requiring the outputs of the reduce to be sortable.
