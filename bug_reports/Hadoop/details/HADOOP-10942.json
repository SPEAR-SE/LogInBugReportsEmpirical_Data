In this patch, it does an immediate file status on the full path. This reduces the overhead for FsShell commands.\n\nYou always need to loop when there are globs.  You need to see which children match the glob and which don't.  I think what you meant to write is \"the prior code used to loop over the path components even if there are *not* globs\".\n\nLooping is not a problem, though.  Calling {{listStatus}} or {{fileStatus}} is what generates RPCs.  And the existing globber code doesn't do that unless it needs to.\n\nA simple way of seeing this is to add a LOG.info statement to {{Globber#listStatus}} and {{Globber#getFileStatus}}, and then try {{hadoop fs \\-ls}} on a path without globs.  The only output you will see is a single call to {{getFileStatus}}, because that's the only call that's needed.  The internal looping that it does inside the function is not important because most loop iterations don't generate an RPC.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
