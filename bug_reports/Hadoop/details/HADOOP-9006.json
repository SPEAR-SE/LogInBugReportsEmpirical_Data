Cite his words as follows.\n\n{quote}\nCurrent by design behavior is for winutils to ACL the folders only for the user passed in thru chmod/chown. This causes some un-natural side effects in cases where Hadoop services run in the context of a non-admin user. For example, Administrators on the box will no longer be able to:\n - delete files created in the context of Hadoop services (other users)\n - check the size of the folder where HDFS blocks are stored\n{quote}\n\nIn my opinion, it is natural for some special accounts on Windows to be able to access all the folders, including Hadoop folders.

In this case, we will set the permission according to the instruction instead of giving them full permission as in the default setting.\n\n2) For 'chown', we will get the old Unix permission, and set the ownership, then re-apply the old Unix permission to the new file owner.
