This patch should also have a fix for JobInProgress.kill() so that calling this on an uninitialized job kills the job completely.\nThis should have been taken care in HADOOP-4261. The task-initializer should call {{job.kill()}} which should do one of the 3 things\n- {{garbageCollect()}} is the job has not _started_ (HADOOP-4261)\n- mark for kill if the job is in _init_ (this issue)\n- mark for cleanup if the job is _running_\n\nIdeally there should be only one api to kill a job (say {{killJob()}}) which internally does the switching. Having 2 apis ({{killJob()}} and {{terminateJob()}}) is confusing.

Introduce a new job-status class with 2 booleans: killJob and initTasks.\n2. JobInProgress.kill should synchronize on the new status object, set the 'killJob' boolean to true (via a setter) and then check the 'initTasks' and call terminate if necessary while holding the lock on the status object.\n3. Similarly JobInProgress.initTasks should synchronize on the status object at the _end_ (not at the beginning, there-by eliminating the need for the 'initStarted' flag) and call terminate if necessary while holding the lock on the status object.\n\nBasically, the proposal is to keep a single object which tracks killJob and initTasks simultaneously rather than relying on too many pieces.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-10-15T00:37:14.497+0000","updated":"2008-10-15T00:37:14.497+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404833/comment/12639699","id":"12639699","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"When is a JobInProgress created, as soon as a job is submitted or when it is considered for running??\n\nIf the former then having a 'initStarted' flag would make sense.
