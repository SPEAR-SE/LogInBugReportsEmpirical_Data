The patch does the following:\n\n- If on Java6, do file copy instead of symlink. We've seen many problems with symlinks on files on Java6 and it is simply impossible to make all of them work. Recent examples include apps (like Oozie) built on top of MR that directly access symlinks using the Java File object (not thru RLFS), in which case things just don’t work.\n - If on Java7, symlinks work as expected. There is no need to provide Native API we exposed previously to properly extract the symlink size, so I removed this code.\n\nThe only remaining scenario I can think of that can have problems is distributed cache symlinks for archives. In this case, we have symbolic links on folders, what is fine as long no one is trying to do File#renameTo on the symlink. To fix this, we cannot change FileUtil#symlink to copy the folder content, since the content could be populated afterwards (so symlink would completely lose its purpose). We would instead have to scope down the folder copy to disc cache scenario only. We can fix this via a separate Jira if it turns out to be a problem. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2012-12-04T22:39:36.883+0000","updated":"2012-12-04T22:39:36.883+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616654/comment/13510085","id":"13510085","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"bq.
