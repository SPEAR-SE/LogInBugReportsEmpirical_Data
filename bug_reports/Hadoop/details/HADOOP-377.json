But basically allowing to pass an URL is much more flexible: that way the config file can be in a JAR  or ZIP file (even outside of the classpath), at an HTTP(S) URL, etc.  The java.net.URL architecture even allows you to implement easily a custom protocol handler (this information is from http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/protocolhandlers/).\n\nAnother point: we are using Spring to instantiate the Hadoop configuration.  And in Spring you can specify custom editors for the properties you set.  We pass something like conf://hadoop-client.xml and this is resolved to a Spring Resource with a ResourceEditor (a custom editor that resolves to a org.springframework.core.io.Resource), which is holding either a File or an URL.  Creating a String editor to resolve a path is a bit awkward since a String is not a concept that is appropriate to represent a file location in the realm of OOP, it is just too generic.  An URL clearly represents the location of some piece of data, in our case the Hadoop Client configuration file.\n\nTo sum up, I think providing URL support to Hadoop's Configuration gives more choice to the end developer.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbq","name":"jbq","key":"jbq","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jean-Baptiste Quenot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-07-28T20:48:17.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-28T20:48:17.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12346447/comment/12424982","id":"12424982","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this, minus the changes to the imports.
