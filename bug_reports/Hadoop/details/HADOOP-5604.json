This does make sense, in my opinion, since the old API is still used heavily (personally I'm using the {{BinaryPartitioner}} from Streaming, for instance, which still uses the old API and might continue doing so for while). The deprecated version just extends the one using the new API though, so there's not code duplication.\n\n* The {{null}} parameter is just because the value parameter is irrelevant for this particular partitioner, but obviously we do want it to take this parameter because it has to implement the partitioner interface.\n\n* The tests are indeed replicated, but they are not identical, since one of them uses the deprecated class while the other uses the class from the new API. In theory it would be sufficient to test only the non-deprecated class (because the deprecated one extends the non-deprecated one), but it felt safer to have a unit test for both.\n\nI was aware that the unit tests added by the patch generate javac warnings, but I thought javac warnings for unit tests were not considered harmful. We could suppress the warnings like Chris did in his patch, but apart from that I don't think anything should change.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=klbostee","name":"klbostee","key":"klbostee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Klaas Bosteels","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-04-01T21:33:59.176+0000","updated":"2009-04-01T21:33:59.176+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12421720/comment/12694781","id":"12694781","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=klbostee","name":"klbostee","key":"klbostee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Klaas Bosteels","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Fixed by the latest patch for HADOOP-5528.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=klbostee","name":"klbostee","key":"klbostee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Klaas Bosteels","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-04-01T22:00:04.550+0000","updated":"2009-04-01T22:00:04.550+0000"}],"maxResults":7,"total":7,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-5604/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0i387:"}}
