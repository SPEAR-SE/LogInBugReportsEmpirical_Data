However, the issue at hand is independent, as it is talking about what HOD should do in the event of an unresponsive JobTracker.\n\nWe discussed the point of missing small jobs while developing HOD 0.4. However, we didn't have any information then that this was a limitation on our user clusters, as HOD 0.3 essentially followed the same approach. Further, we needed support from Hadoop to do this. AFAIK, the JobStatus object doesn't give the information of completion time. All that said, there is room for improvement. I just file HADOOP-2859 for tracking this issue.\n\nMeanwhile, as the need to fix this issue is greater, I am going ahead with the basic approach and changing the error handling.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-02-20T16:54:12.221+0000","updated":"2008-02-20T16:54:12.221+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12388866/comment/12571131","id":"12571131","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"This patch adds some error handling around code which calls the hadoop client to determine number of running jobs.
