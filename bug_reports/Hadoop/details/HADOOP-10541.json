Thank you for providing the patch.\n\nI still see a few opportunities for a resource leak in this code.  For {{is1}}, there is a call to {{IOUtils#toString}} outside the try block.  This can throw {{IOException}}, which would then result in {{is1}} not being closed.  For {{is2}}, there is a similar situation with {{BufferedReader#readLine}}, which can throw {{IOException}}.  In both cases, I recommend moving the calls that can throw inside the try block.  These are existing issues that weren't introduced by your new patch, but it would be convenient to clean them up now, since you're changing this code path anyway.\n\nAlso, the standard indentation for the project is to indent by 2 spaces (no tabs).  I saw a few tabs in your patch, so would you please convert those to 2 spaces?\n\nThanks again!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-02T17:38:19.658+0000","updated":"2014-05-02T17:38:19.658+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12710792/comment/13988917","id":"13988917","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=swarnim","name":"swarnim","key":"swarnim","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Swarnim Kulkarni","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks for the feedback Chris.

Maybe another community member who does use Eclipse will chime in.  We also have this page:\n\nhttps://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/CodeReviewChecklist\n\nOur stated standard is \"follows Sun's code conventions except indentation is 2 spaces, not 4\".  Maybe it's sufficient simply to clone the default formatting profile you get with Eclipse and then switch the indentation to 2 spaces/no tabs.
