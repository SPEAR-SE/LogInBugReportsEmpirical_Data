(related to 2) Your patch includes configure/Makefile etc, which is great for testing the patch atm, but the version committed should NOT include these.\n{quote}\nI did \"make distclean\" before creating this patch. I understand this patch has an empty Makefile which we have to delete after submitting the patch to svn. \n\nPlease correct me if my understanding is wrong anywhere.\n\nThanks\nGiri","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gkesavan","name":"gkesavan","key":"gkesavan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867"},"displayName":"Giridharan Kesavan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-11-05T09:06:48.848+0000","updated":"2008-11-05T09:06:48.848+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12395262/comment/12649262","id":"12649262","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gkesavan","name":"gkesavan","key":"gkesavan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867"},"displayName":"Giridharan Kesavan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Craig, \nAny update on testing with linux?

\nBut make sure you have  \"autoconf-2.61\" installed \n\nBy using libhdfs=true flag we build libhdfs with other c++components.\nand the resulting .so file will be installed in  c++/<os_osarch_jvmdatamodel>/lib directory\n\nThis patch addresses all the three scenarios\n\n*32bit OS, 32bit java => libhdfs should be built 32bit, specify -m32 \n*64bit OS, 32bit java => libhdfs should be built 32bit, specify -m32 \n*64bit OS, 64bit java => libhdfs should be built 64bit, specify -m64
