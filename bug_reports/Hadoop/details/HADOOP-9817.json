The rewrite (with comments!) is much easier to follow.\n\nHere are some comments for Globber:\n\n- How about making this an abstract class, with subclasses for FileSystem and FileContext? Cleaner than having if statements.\n- Whitespace is weird for these lines:\n{code}\n    ArrayList<FileStatus> results = \n        new ArrayList<FileStatus>(flattenedPatterns .size());\n...\n    for (String flatPattern : flattenedPatterns ) {\n...\n      Path absPattern =\n          fixRelativePart(new Path(flatPattern .isEmpty() ? \".\" : flatPattern ));\n{code}\n\n- The comment around the {{sawWildcard}} if statement at the end could be beefed up. This looks like some kind of big compatibility wart for {{FileSystem}}, so it'd be helpful to see the expected cases laid out (and any more rationale, like the {{FSShell}}).\n- Minor optimization, but we can break out of the {{components}} for loop early if {{candidates}} is empty.\n- I think we can simplify this path expression:\n{code}\n            child.setPath(new Path(scheme, authority,\n                new Path(candidate.getPath(),\n                    new Path(child.getPath().getName())).toUri().getPath()));\n            // equivalent to this?\n            child.setPath(new Path(candidate.getPath(),\n                    new Path(child.getPath().getName())));\n{code}\n\n- Shouldn't this be comparing against just the relevant component {{child.getPath().getName()}}? Also, could we even just push this filtering down to the NN by doing {{listStatus(Path, GlobFilter}}?\n{code}\n            if (globFilter.accept(child.getPath())) {\n              newCandidates.add(child);\n            }\n{code}\n- I don't understand this bit. If the flattened pattern is empty, we list the current working directory? This looks like a carry-over from FileSystem, where it looks like \".\" and other non-glob paths trigger some special logic via {{components = null}}. Probably warrants at least a comment.\n- Also related, if we pass in some weird glob like \\{a,\\}/\\{b,\\}/\\{c,\\} that expands to an empty path multiple times, does this trigger listing the working directory multiple times?\n{code}\n      Path absPattern =\n          fixRelativePart(new Path(flatPattern .isEmpty() ? \".\" : flatPattern ));\n{code}\n- Noticed that Globber does manual slash removal. Could we use {{URI#normalize}} for this?

Normally the only component that gets removed is the first one (for /).  I agree that URI normalization should handle this, but this is kind of a belt-and-suspenders approach.\n\nbq. The comment around the sawWildcard if statement at the end could be beefed up. This looks like some kind of big compatibility wart for FileSystem, so it'd be helpful to see the expected cases laid out (and any more rationale, like the FSShell).\n\nI'll see if I can come up with a better comment.  And yes, as you guessed, it is a big compatibility wart (in my opinion at least.)\n\nbq. I don't understand this bit.

The code was much longer due to the need to create explicit interfaces, and I also was not able to make the abstract functions private in the superclass.  They had to be package-private, which is more visibility than I wanted.  I added some better comments, and fixed the whitespace and other issues you pointed out.  I'm not sure that empty string -> home directory merits a comment, since it's how we handle things elsewhere.  Basically, the path '.' gets mapped to a URI with an empty path, which then gets mapped to the current working directory (which happens to be home in this case).  This is similar to how we treat all non-absolute paths, as you can see in the unit tests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
