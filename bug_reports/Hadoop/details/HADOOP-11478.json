For direct access, user does kinit and then uses curl calls.\nNew file creation inside encryption zone goes ahead fine as expected. \nBut attempts to view the contents of the file fails with exception:\n\"User [httpfs] is not authorized to perform [DECRYPT_EEK] on key with ACL name [mykeyname]!!\"\n\nPerhaps, this is linked to bug #HDFS-6849. In the file HttpFSServer.java, the OPEN handler calls command.execute(fs) directly (and this fails). In CREATE, that call is wrapped within fsExecute(user, command). Apparently, this seems to cause the problem.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HttpFSServer does not properly impersonate a real user when executing \"open\" operation in a kerberised environment","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ranadip","name":"ranadip","key":"ranadip","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ranadip","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ranadip","name":"ranadip","key":"ranadip","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ranadip","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"CentOS","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12767536/comment/14293894","id":"14293894","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clamb","name":"clamb","key":"clamb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Charles Lamb","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"[~ranadip],\n\nI assume that when you configured your kms acls per the instructions in HADOOP-11479 that this problem went away.
