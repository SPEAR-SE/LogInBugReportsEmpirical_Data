In that sense I think the calculates well. Note that this calculation does not require costly du.\n\nAfter chatting with Hairong, I think Koji's impression of \"Reserved\" is : \"Disk space that Datanode avoids in its calculations whether it is used or free\".  Eg. if there is a partition of 100 GB, 50% is reserved, and DFS occupies 40 GB,  25GB is \"available\", then \"remaining\" should be 10GB. This requires equivalent of 'du' for Datanode's data.
