And #2 cannot be done without underlying FileSystem API. \n\nBut, as you point out, if someone does something like `echo hello >> foo` where foo does not exist, libhdfs will do the wrong thing probably.\n\nWe need:\n{code}\nFSDataOutputStream FileSystem.appendIfExistsElseCreate(Path p);\n{code}\n\nI can open a JIRA for it.   I guess that means anyone using libhdfs (e.g. fuse)  would have to do a hacky check if the file exists and decide whether to pass on the append flag, which of course is not transactional.\n\nAnd of course, let's not even get into passing on O_TRUNCATE :)  But, the libhdfs code should probably check for that flag and error out if it comes.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wyckoff","name":"wyckoff","key":"wyckoff","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pete Wyckoff","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-10-23T00:34:20.931+0000","updated":"2008-10-23T00:34:20.931+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407034/comment/12642035","id":"12642035","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wyckoff","name":"wyckoff","key":"wyckoff","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pete Wyckoff","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"idea -
