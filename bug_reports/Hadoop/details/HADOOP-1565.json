This puts some limitations on the size of the file system that a single namenode can support. Most of this overhead occurs because a block and/or filename is inserted into multiple TreeMaps and/or HashSets.\n\nHere are a few ideas that can be measured to see if an appreciable reduction of memory usage occurs:\n\n1. Change FSDirectory.children from a TreeMap to an array. Do binary search in this array while looking up children. This saves a TreeMap object for every intermediate node in the directory tree.\n2. Change INode from an inner class. This saves on one \"parent object\" reference for each INODE instance. 4 bytes per inode.\n3. Keep all DatanodeDescriptors in an array. BlocksMap.nodes[] is currently a 64-bit reference to the DatanodeDescriptor object. Instead, it can be a 'short'. This will probably save about 16 bytes per block.\n4. Change DatanodeDescriptor.blocks from a SortedTreeMap to a HashMap? Block report processing CPU cost can increase.\n\nFor the records: TreeMap has the following fields:\n\tObject key;\n\tObject value;\n\tEntry left = null;\n\tEntry right = null;\n\tEntry parent;\n\tboolean color = BLACK;\n\nand HashMap object:\n\tfinal Object key;\n\tObject value;\n\tfinal int hash;\n\tEntry next;\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12363003","id":"12363003","filename":"memoryReduction3.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2007-08-01T21:57:13.904+0000","size":5314,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12363003/memoryReduction3.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"106166","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"DFSScalability: reduce memory usage of namenode","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12373092/comment/12510751","id":"12510751","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Last time I checked couple of months back, file name String somehow ended up using 128 byte array.
