Myers","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hey Alejandro, I have a few issues with this approach:\n\n# What's the criteria for which settings belong in which file, i.e. core-site.xml vs. security-site.xml? The specific vulnerability which prompted this JIRA was only that {{hadoop.http.authentication.signature.secret}} needs to be kept secret from users, yet you put all of the Hadoop Auth filter settings in this file.\n# I don't think {{0600}} are the permissions we should be using. Since the MR and HDFS daemons are usually run as separate users, and this secret needs to be available to both, the file should probably be {{0640}}, and have a group which is shared by both user accounts.\n# I think we're asking for trouble by including this secret-containing file in the same directory as the other, public configuration files. {{security-site.xml}} is somewhat different from the {{taskcontroller.cfg}} file in that the latter just can't be writable by users on the cluster boxes, whereas the former must not be readable by any user anywhere. I can virtually guarantee that some unknowing admin will copy the whole contents of {{/etc/hadoop/conf/}} on some cluster box to create a user's {{HADOOP_CONF_DIR}}, and in so doing accidentally expose the secret. For that matter, those sites which share a {{HADOOP_CONF_DIR}} over NFS will have to do something different to make sure that everything *but* {{security-site.xml}} gets shared.\n# It seems like somewhere in the code (probably right before adding {{security-site.xml}} as a resource) we should check that the file doesn't have overly-permissive permissions, much as the {{task-controller}} binary currently does.\n\nFor all these reasons I think it makes the most sense to scrap {{security-site.xml}} entirely, and change the setting \"{{hadoop.http.authentication.signature.secret}}\" to \"{{hadoop.http.authentication.signature.secret.file}}\", which would be configured to point to a file whose contents are then interpreted in their entirety as the secret for generating/validating tokens.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

Myers","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. keep all auth config in one place\n\nSure, but it's called \"{{security-site.xml}}\", but it doesn't contain most of the Hadoop security configs, just the HTTP auth filter configs. For that matter, is it unreasonable that there might be some HTTP auth filter config which clients might need to know? It seems like we're unnecessarily overloading the purpose of this file to be both secret and to group like-configs in the same place.\n\nbq. make sense. Do we have such group today?\n\nThe answer to that is going to be specific to whatever method a user uses to install/configure Hadoop. FWIW, in CDH's packages there is a 'hadoop' group which both 'mapred' and 'hdfs' belong to. I don't know for sure, but I bet this is what the built-in Hadoop packages do, too.\n\nbq. so where would be the location of this 'secret' file?\n\nGood question. Kerberos has two distinct files: {{/etc/krb5.conf}} and {{/etc/krb5kdc/kdc.conf}}, where the former is world-readable, and the latter is not. Maybe, then, {{/etc/hadoop/conf/}} and {{/etc/hadoop/conf-secret/}} ?\n\nbq. AFAIK you can set permissions with File but you cannot check them.\n\nAh, that could very well be. Pretty sure Hadoop has some classes with helper methods to deal with getting/setting group permissions, which might use JNI or fork a sub-process.\n\nbq. using a 'secret' file just for this secret, what if there is something else needing a secret? we don't want those 'secrets' files to proliferate.\n\nThat's totally valid, and a very good point. Still, though, I'm not sure that the solution you have here is appropriate. For example, what if something should be secret only to the MR daemons, but not to the HDFS daemons, or vice versa? We couldn't reasonably put such a secret in {{security-site.xml}}, since as previously-mentioned this file must be readable by both.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
