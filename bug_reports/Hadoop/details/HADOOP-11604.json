I don't have complete information though, so I can't say for sure.\n\nOne potential problem is that the thread does not explicitly handle logging for unchecked exceptions, thrown either from the try body or the finally body.  Without an uncaught exception handler, the default behavior would be to log the stack trace to the console, which is likely getting redirected to a .out file instead of the normal DataNode daemon log.  An operator might not think to check the .out log.  Liang, do you still have a .out file from this incident?  If not, then a good first step might be to patch the logging so that we either set an uncaught exception handler to do the logging, or just catch and log {{Throwable}} explicitly.\n\nI agree that we need to find root cause before attempting a fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-18T17:38:38.919+0000","updated":"2015-02-18T17:38:38.919+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12775344/comment/14326933","id":"14326933","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

This makes sense now.\n\nI'm attaching a patch that avoids mutating the {{TreeMap}} during the iteration in the {{finally}} block.  It's not important to remove as we iterate, because after the loop, we {{clear}} the whole map anyway and let it drop out of scope.  I don't have a unit test for this.  I still need to look into whether or not that's feasible.  My intuition is that it won't be possible to repro the problem reliably in a unit test, because throwing {{ConcurrentModificationException}} is a best-effort check, not a guarantee.\n\nFor the logging problem, I decided to go with the approach of setting an uncaught exception handler.  The {{run}} method is already very deeply nested, and I think wrapping the whole thing in another try-catch for logging {{Throwable}} would hurt readability.\n\nLiang, I hope I'm not intruding by posting a patch on an issue assigned to you.

This adds a test, which was a bit tricky to write.  It was pretty easy to force the {{ConcurrentModificationException}}.  I've added {{testCloseSocketOnWatcherClose}} to do this.  However, the exception gets thrown on a separate thread from JUnit's execution, so it wouldn't actually cause the test to fail.  I've modified the test suite so that for every test, we track whether or not the thread terminated with an unexpected exception.  The new test fails without my changes in {{DomainSocketWatcher}}, and then it passes after I apply the fix.\n\nIt occurs to me that we still probably don't know the real root cause of what happened in Liang's cluster.  Why did the thread exit prematurely?  This {{ConcurrentModificationException}} thrown from the {{finally}} block would have masked any exception thrown from the {{try}} body.  Probably the best we can do at this point is to get in this fix, and then watch for additional reports of the problem afterwards.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-20T19:35:40.623+0000","updated":"2015-02-20T19:35:40.623+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12775344/comment/14329510","id":"14329510","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
