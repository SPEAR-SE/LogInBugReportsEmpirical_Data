That code shouldn't be there in the first place.  I was asleep when HADOOP-1127 was committed.  We should try to keep the mapred kernel from touching input or output files, leaving that to InputFormats and OutputFormats.  It's a church/state thing.  (Also, taskOutputPath stuff is reduce specific, so if anywhere, it belongs in ReduceTask, no?)\n\nFile renaming for speculative reduce belongs in OutputFormatBase (which should really be called FileOutputFormat).  We'll need to add another method to the OutputFormat interface, something like complete(JobConf, String tempName, String finalName), that's called for each task to rename its temporary output when speculative reduces are enabled, where tempName is what was passed to getRecordWriter().  I'll file an issue for this.\n\nBack to your question: I don't know why relative paths are used there.  Perhaps Arun does, since he wrote that code as a part of HADOOP-1127.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-22T18:37:24.131+0000","updated":"2007-05-22T18:37:24.131+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366753/comment/12498078","id":"12498078","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"<code>\n  private Path getTaskOutputPath(JobConf conf) {\n    return new Path(conf.getOutputPath(), (\"_\" + taskId));\n  }\n</code>\n\nThat is how taskOutputPath is created, and thus should be an absolute path.
