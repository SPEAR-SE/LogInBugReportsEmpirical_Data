This enables maps to generate multiple files with side effect and avoids duplicate functionality. \n\n2. Currently in case of reducer -NONE, the output of maps is written explicitly to a DFS file, so all map tasks try to write to the same file in DFS. (@see PipeMapRed.java:264) causing this problem. This part is changed to treat <-output> as  directory and map output goes in this.

Some map tasks writing to DFS were generating incomplete files, added flush() in MROutputThread\n2. Added extra checks in TaskTracker and PhasedFileSystem to check for temporary file existence before attempting delete. This avoids extra lines in namenode logs. \n3. Changed a variable name, sideEffectURI_ is now finalOutputURI and is used to get correct file name. \n\noff topic : I was not aware that there are real languages written bottom to top http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system#Directionality ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.dahiya","name":"sanjay.dahiya","key":"sanjay.dahiya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Dahiya","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-11-30T19:12:17.000+0000","updated":"2006-11-30T19:12:17.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12355800/comment/12454878","id":"12454878","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.dahiya","name":"sanjay.dahiya","key":"sanjay.dahiya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Dahiya","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Fixed another issue in PipeMapRed where output file may not get closed properly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.dahiya","name":"sanjay.dahiya","key":"sanjay.dahiya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Dahiya","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-12-01T11:15:08.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-01T11:15:08.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12355800/comment/12454965","id":"12454965","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1, http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12346211/Hadoop-728_1.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision 481099","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-12-01T17:50:06.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-01T17:50:06.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12355800/comment/12455028","id":"12455028","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this.
