That's the original direction I went with this patch, but then I thought more about it, and decided that it is not quite correct - for example, RawLocalFileSystem and LocalFileSystem (checksummed) both use file:/// URLs. But {{path.getFileSystem(conf)}} will always return the checksummed version. So using {{fs.makeQualified(path)}} in these wrapper functions fails to preserve the user's choice of file system when they explicitly want the non-checksummed version.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"an option that isn't forward compatible\"?

As we move to FileContext, we don't want to have to change all of the public interfaces. Even before FileContext, we have been ignoring FileSystem parameters in most of the MapReduce APIs.\n\nMoving forward, we should just use paths. Using FileSystem and path is a very confusing pattern.\n\nYou do have a valid point that we can't distinguish between checksum and raw filesystems. I suspect the fix for that is to define a new prefix for one of them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-01-07T19:02:03.109+0000","updated":"2011-01-07T19:02:03.109+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12494791/comment/12978940","id":"12978940","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"So would you be OK with this patch if I change the filesystem Option to be private, marked for removal when the createWriter methods are gone?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-01-07T20:12:02.175+0000","updated":"2011-01-07T20:12:02.175+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12494791/comment/12979032","id":"12979032","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Why not just do:\n\n{code}\nreturn createWriter(conf, Writer.file(name.makeQualified(fs)), Writer.keyClass(keyClass),\n{code}\n\nthen all of the code will be removed when the deprecated constructors are removed.
