In our case, Hadoop is consistently calling CreateProcess on winutils.exe and as part of preparations for CreateProcess read/write handles are created on pipes used to redirect stdout/stderr. In scenario where we create for example one ShortLived and one LongLived child process, the LongLived process can end up inheriting handles of the ShortLived process. This will further cause ReadFile on the ShortLived process’ stdout/stderr not to return until the LongLived process terminates, what is the behavior we observed. \n\nPre Windows-Vista, the only way to mitigate the problem was to serialize all calls to CreateProcess. On Vista and later, there is a way to specify the list of handles that should be inherited by a child via PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST in STARTUPINFOEX.\n\nThis KB article nicely explains the issue:\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/315939 - PRB: Child Inherits Unintended Handles During CreateProcess Call\n\nI looked over the OpenJDK implementation for Process#start(), and this is exactly what is going on. Since we can repro the problem in Oracle JDK, it should be safe to assume that they have the same issue. \n\nThe suggested workaround is to serialize all calls to CreateProcess. In Java world, this boils down to synchronizing on Process#start() as this call just delegates to CreateProcess. I tested this out and it worked out fine.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2012-08-27T17:40:29.137+0000","updated":"2012-08-27T17:40:29.137+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605105/comment/13442549","id":"13442549","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Attaching the patch with the fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2012-08-27T17:43:18.405+0000","updated":"2012-08-27T17:43:18.405+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12605105/comment/13444309","id":"13444309","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1.
