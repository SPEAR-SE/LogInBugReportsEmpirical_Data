Pre HADOOP-3245, missing job state meant that the job is running. HADOOP-3245 introduces the RUNNING state for jobs which indicates that the job meta-info is available in the history. {{loadhistory.jsp}} cached the analysis results and refreshed only if the job status was missing (which meant that the job is running). Fixed that to explicitly test the job runstate as RUNNING. Tested the patch with and without restarts. Also checked if the history analysis works after the job is complete.
