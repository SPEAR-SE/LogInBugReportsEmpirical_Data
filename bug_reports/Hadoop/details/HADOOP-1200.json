The new patch will rethrow the exception.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-05-04T20:47:44.505+0000","updated":"2007-05-04T20:47:44.505+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366500/comment/12493797","id":"12493797","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The new patch incorporates Raghu's comment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-05-04T20:48:41.974+0000","updated":"2007-05-04T20:48:41.974+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366500/comment/12493818","id":"12493818","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1\n\nhttp://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12356806/diskCheck1.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r534975.\n\nTest results:   http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/119/testReport/\nConsole output: http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/119/console","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-05-04T22:35:40.416+0000","updated":"2007-05-04T22:35:40.416+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366500/comment/12494132","id":"12494132","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this.
