It falls back to the default impl of {{canonicalizeUri}} which uses {{if (uri.getPort() == -1 && getDefaultPort() > 0)}} to decide if it should add the default port.  So... I think it might just work if {{DFS#canonicalizeUri}} calls super when it's HA logical, instead of returning the uri as-is.\n\nHA logical URIs are an interesting twist, where the port can be argued to be irrelevant.  However just as context for my concern, there's a distinct possibility that our HA logical uris will be the former primary NN's host address.  If so, it's critical that HA logical uris must have identical behavior to non-HA uris.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-06-03T21:30:49.786+0000","updated":"2013-06-03T21:30:49.786+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12650702/comment/13678603","id":"13678603","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
