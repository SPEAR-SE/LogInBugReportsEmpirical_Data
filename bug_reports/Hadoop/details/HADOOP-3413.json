White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"There is still clearly work to make the serialization framework fully supported in Hadoop, but I don't think the lack of support in SequenceFile.Reader is a blocker for 0.17.0.\n\nThe work done in HADOOP-1986 enabled serialization support in the MapReduce kernel, so you can use arbitrary types for keys and values. However, it is not yet possible to use arbitrary types for map inputs or reduce outputs out of the box, since the support from SequenceFile{Input|Output}Format and SequenceFileRecord{Reader|Writer} is still Writable-based as you point out. That said, it is possible to write your own InputFormat, OutputFormat, RecordReader, RecordWriter implementations to do this for you. For example, you can use SequenceFile.Writer#append(Object, Object) to write any objects to a sequence file (using a Serializer) and the SequenceFile.Reader#nextRaw methods to read bytes out to be manually deserialized using a Deserializer.\n\nOn a related note, unfortunately the RecordReader interface is incompatible with serialization frameworks that don't reuse objects - like Java Serialization. The problem is that \n\n{code}\nboolean next(K key, V value) throws IOException\n{code}\n\nhas no way of passing keys and values that are deserialized from the stream back to the client of the RecordReader. This is not a problem for Writables and Thrift since the client passes in objects that are updated in-place. To fix this will require some surgery on the API.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2008-05-19T12:37:35.121+0000","updated":"2008-05-19T12:37:35.121+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12396302/comment/12597939","id":"12597939","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"I agree that this shouldn't be a blocker for 17 for the reasons Tom outlined.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-05-19T13:01:13.316+0000","updated":"2008-05-19T13:01:13.316+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12396302/comment/12597957","id":"12597957","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Here's a patch for extending SequenceFile.Reader, as well as making SequenceFile{Input|Output}Format and SequenceFileRecord{Reader|Writer} all use the Serialization framework.

However, I wasn't proposing we make such a radical change in this Jira, instead we are making it possible to use the serialization framework with SequenceFile.Reader, and removing unnecessary dependencies on Writable in some of the MapReduce layers (so you could at least use Thrift there). Note that the changes to SequenceFile.Reader are compatible with Java serialization, since instead of adding\n\n{code}\npublic boolean next(Object key, Object val)\n{code}\n\nthere's\n\n{code}\npublic Object next(Object key)\n{code}\n\nand\n\n{code}\npublic Object getCurrentValue(Object val)\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2008-06-04T09:20:28.815+0000","updated":"2008-06-04T09:20:28.815+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12396302/comment/12602386","id":"12602386","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ah, ok.
