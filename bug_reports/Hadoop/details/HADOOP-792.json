For example:\n\n% hadoop dfs -mkdir target\n% hadoop dfs -mv / target\n\nI'm not certain whether this is reproducible in the current trunk, but I'd bet that it is.\n\nThis problem successfully circumvented my own patch to make dfs -rm a little safer (see my email c.2006-08-30 to nutch-dev for details). I had been deleting old crawl directories from the DFS by copying their names and pasting them into my command buffer. At one point, I paused to do something else, copied some other text (which unfortunately began with a Java comment and included carriage returns), then went back to removing the crawl directories. I must not have pressed hard enough on the \"c\" key when I did my next copy, since when I pasted into the command buffer, hadoop immediately began executing a dfs -rm / command. No problem - I'm protected, because my patched dfs command is just going to try to move / to /trash (and fail), right?\n\nWrong! Even though hadoop isn't really capable of such a move, it apparently tries hard enough to corrupt the namenode's DB.\n\nThankfully, I ran into this problem at a relatively opportune time, when the contents of my dfs had little value.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12346694","id":"12346694","filename":"renameerrorcode.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2006-12-07T18:01:38.000+0000","size":552,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12346694/renameerrorcode.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"106768","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Invalid dfs -mv can trash your entire dfs","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schmed","name":"schmed","key":"schmed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Schneider","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schmed","name":"schmed","key":"schmed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Schneider","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12357975/comment/12456500","id":"12456500","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"The 0.9.0 release does not have this problem.
