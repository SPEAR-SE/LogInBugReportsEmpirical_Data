There should only need to be a single Client for RPC.  Each Client keeps a cache of TCP connections to other host:port pairs expecting the same Writable class for requests and responses.  All RPCs use Invocation as the request class and ObjectWritable as the response class, so they can generally share connections.\n\nThe problem is that there's no longer a global configuration.  So a global client could be lazily constructed the first time a call is made with the invoker's configuration.  Or we could create a new client for each configuration.  But, you're right, we shouldn't do both, as the current code does.  Changing the global CLIENT shouldn't break anything, but it's also silly and wasteful.  The only thing the client reads from the configuration is the RPC timeout.  It might almost be better to remove the configuration from Client altogether and always explicitly pass the timeout as a parameter to call().\n\nI wonder if this could even be leading to socket leaks?  Hmm.  A client doesn't close it's connections until it's either explicitly closed (which these are not) or until the remote server dies.  So we should probably fix this somehow.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-04-20T06:11:43.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-20T06:11:43.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12332386/comment/12375220","id":"12375220","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just fixed this.
