Why no unit test? If you tested this manually, what steps did you perform?\n\nIt is pretty difficult to write a unit test for this patch as this patch just enables compression during intermediate merges. The files that are created during the intermediate merges are consumed soon after they are created and the final merged file was compressed even without this patch. I did the same test as Billy had done -- add print statements in the framework code (Merger.java) to verify if compression was turned on during intermediate merges.\n\nbq. Why no javadoc for new methods?\n\nThe newly added methods are in Merger, which is a mapred package private class\n\nbq. no commit for 0.19 branch?\nBilly, from this comment https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5539?focusedCommentId=12708570&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12708570, we thought you needed this only for 0.20. If you need it for 0.19 branch as well, I can generate a patch for that too.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-05-29T03:29:32.207+0000","updated":"2009-05-29T03:29:32.207+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12417354/comment/12714297","id":"12714297","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=viper799","name":"viper799","key":"viper799","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Billy Pearson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"No I do not need it my version patch with my original patch for 0.19 but other might sense there is still a lot of older version in production that will update to 0.19 branch now that it has a few minor releases on it.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=viper799","name":"viper799","key":"viper799","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Billy Pearson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2009-05-29T04:37:58.477+0000","updated":"2009-05-29T04:37:58.477+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12417354/comment/12718616","id":"12718616","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #863 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/863/])\n    ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-06-11T19:59:26.748+0000","updated":"2009-06-11T19:59:26.748+0000"}],"maxResults":25,"total":25,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-5539/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0i3h3:"}}
