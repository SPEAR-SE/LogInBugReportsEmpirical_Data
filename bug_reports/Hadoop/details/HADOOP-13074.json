These tests are intended to be run using an empty bucket, dedicated strictly for the purpose of running these tests.  Quoting the same documentation:\n\n{quote}\nThe contents of each bucket will be destroyed during the test process: do not use the bucket for any purpose other than testing. Furthermore, for s3a, all in-progress multi-part uploads to the bucket will be aborted at the start of a test (by forcing fs.s3a.multipart.purge=true) to clean up the temporary state of previously failed tests.\n{quote}\n\nIt is by design that the test aborts if it actually finds anything in the bucket that would be deleted.  That protects people from accidentally pointing the test suite at a bucket containing critical production data and deleting all of it.  Note the comment in {{AbstractContractRootDirectoryTest#testListEmptyRootDirectory}}:\n\n{code}\n  @Test\n  public void testListEmptyRootDirectory() throws IOException {\n    //extra sanity checks here to avoid support calls about complete loss of data\n    skipIfUnsupported(TEST_ROOT_TESTS_ENABLED);\n    FileSystem fs = getFileSystem();\n    Path root = new Path(\"/\");\n    FileStatus[] statuses = fs.listStatus(root);\n    for (FileStatus status : statuses) {\n      ContractTestUtils.assertDeleted(fs, status.getPath(), true);\n    }\n    assertEquals(\"listStatus on empty root-directory returned a non-empty list\",\n        0, fs.listStatus(root).length);\n  }\n{code}\n\nI have verified that the test passes as expected when running with an empty bucket.\n\nDoes this make sense?
