Anyway I am not worried about hdfs principal, for that any alternative principal name instead of \"_HOST\" such as 'hdfs/hadoop' will work. But especially for SPNEGO, we need 'HTTP' principal in the form of 'HTTP/<hostname>' only. \n\nIn a private cluster where machines dont have any DNS server and also mapping of all ip/hostnames may not be present in /etc/hosts. In that case we may need to use IP instead of hostname in configs. \n\nSo in that case, we need to resolve the above problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2012-11-16T09:37:36.392+0000","updated":"2012-11-16T09:37:36.392+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12615304/comment/13499159","id":"13499159","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.

In order for this to work, the cluster will have to be able to do reverse name lookups on the IP address, so properly configured DNS of some sort (either a DNS server or populated /etc/hosts) will have to be present.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
