The reason that methods like {{File#canRead}} are used here is that it checks if the current process can read the file, with full consideration of the specific user that launched the process.  Our {{FsPermission}} model considers permissions, but it does not consider how those permissions map to specific users (nor would it be trivial to expand it to include this information).\n\nFor example, using {{FsPermission}} + winutils ls, we could see that a particular directory has permissions 770, so the owner and members of the primary group have full access to this directory.  If the user that launched the process is either the owner or a member of the primary group, then {{DiskChecker}} must report that the disk is usable.  If not, then {{DiskChecker}} must report that the disk is unusable.  However, {{DiskChecker}} doesn't have enough information to choose the correct result.\n\nIt would be error-prone to go down the path of trying to duplicate the exact permission checking logic enforced by the OS on the local file system.  You might argue that we could solve the example above by trying to combine more calls to get the primary group and check if the current user's groups include that group.  However, that wouldn't be sufficient to cover more complex rules enforced by local file systems, such as POSIX ACLs.  It would be challenging to get this exactly right, and since the logic is different on different OSes, it wouldn't satisfy the goal of trying to keep this layer of code platform-agnostic anyway.\n\nI propose that we accept the patch I wrote earlier, still attached to the jira, so that {{DiskChecker}} actually attempts a few file system operations for verification when running on Windows.  These work-arounds could be removed whenever Hadoop upgrades to JDK7.  Then, we can rewrite {{DiskChecker}} to use the new Java {{FileSystem}} API, which doesn't have these bugs.  I've confirmed that the existing patch still applies cleanly to branch-trunk-win and fixes {{TestDiskChecker}} so that it passes on both Mac and Windows.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-04T22:21:20.781+0000","updated":"2013-03-04T22:21:20.781+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613366/comment/13592795","id":"13592795","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"During Datanode startup it checks if the data dir permissions are 755.

In this case, the logic of {{FsAction#implies}} is sufficient, because we know that this is the only kind of permission model supported by HDFS.  It doesn't support ACLs (at least not yet).\n# In various places that need to interact with local disk.  This includes things like {{NameNode}} and {{DataNode}} initialization, {{ClientDistributedCacheManager}} and {{FSDownload}}.  In these cases, the logic of {{FsAction#implies}} is incomplete, because it doesn't cover all possible permission checks that might be enforced on the local disk by the host OS, such as ACLs.\n\nI believe this is the key distinction: HDFS (full permission model under our control) vs. local disk (permission model partially invisible to our code).  I'm starting to think that instead of {{FsAction#implies}}, we need to write a wrapper API that looks more like {{access}} from unistd.h, and route all local disk interactions through that instead of {{FsAction#implies}}:\n\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/2/access\n\nThis API just says \"tell me if I can read/write/execute this file\".

After migration to Java 7, even Windows won't need to do this.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-06T17:51:17.087+0000","updated":"2013-03-06T17:51:17.087+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613366/comment/13594927","id":"13594927","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. Can we please keep the scope of this jira limited to Windows compatibility for the current logic?\nNot until we clearly understand what the flaw is that we are trying to fix. It this was branch-1 then I would agree. But on trunk we have the flexibility of not making stop-gap changes.\n\nAs far as the permissions is concerned. I think Hadoop really depends on a Unix like rwx permission model on the local disk. This is in theory unrelated to the permission model HFDS itself imposes for its own filesystem and which also happens to be the rwx model. This is the main reason why we wrote the winutil layer that exposes the rwx model on top of Windows ACL's for local disk. Thats why I am trying to understand why we need different checks here because it may imply that our translation layer is not working.\nYour analysis might be correct and I would like an HDFS expert like [~sanjay.radia] to take a look.\n\nThis jira was opened because TestDiskChecker was failing right? Would you be kind enough to change checkDir(File) to use the same logic as checkDir(FS, Path, perm) and check if the test passes? Hopefully the change will be small and wont take much of your time. It will help ascertain if the implies function will work or not.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-06T18:20:00.859+0000","updated":"2013-03-06T18:20:00.859+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613366/comment/13594968","id":"13594968","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I synced offline with Arpit.

Java 7 does not fix the bugs in java.io.File canRead/canWrite/canExecute.  Instead, it adds new methods that are very similar in {{java.nio.file.Files}}, and these new methods are the ones that correctly handle ACLs:\n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html\n\nI'm not sure why they didn't just fix the bugs in {{java.io.File}}, but that's the way it is.  This means that it wouldn't be correct to do if (JDK7) then use File methods.  We have to wait for Hadoop as a whole go to JDK7 (for compile time, not just runtime) and migrate the {{DiskChecker}} code to use the new APIs.  Unfortunately, we can't do anything right now in this patch to prepare for that.\n\nThe old Sun bug report has some relevant discussion:\n\nhttp://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6203387\n\n{quote}\nPlease do open a jira to fix this issue in branch-1-win too.\n{quote}\n\nActually, I was planning on doing this in scope of the current jira.

This means that the test now fails when executed in the admin context (since OS still allows admins to read/write/execute after \"chmod 000\"). \n\nThe reason why the tests succeed on your boxes is most likely because you have User Account Control enabled on the machine (so you are not running as an effective admin).\n\nWould be good to check if the test passes on Unix if executed in the context of the root?\n\n\nIf we go the POSIX route, we will have the expected results (\"chmod 000 admin\" will result in 000 when we \"ls\"). I attached a prototype patch just for demonstration. Let's think a bit more about what is the right longer term solution. I am actually leaning towards what you have in the patch, as that is the absolute truth about whether checkDir succeeded or failed. The downside is that the test now fails if executed with admin context. Would be good to know what is the unix behavior for root for symmetry.\n\n{quote}\nPlease note that I am only merging an existing Shell method from trunk to branch-1-win.

Very interesting find.  I have confirmed that the existing tests fail when running as root on Linux, just like what you're experiencing when running as admin on Windows.  It's unrelated to this patch.  This might explain a few complaints I've seen on the mailing lists from new engineers trying to contribute to Hadoop, but finding some unit tests failing immediately.  I'll try to track down those threads and help them out.\n\nI agree with sticking to the File APIs, because they give us the \"absolute truth\" as you said.  If the user is root/admin, then the disk is usable. \n\nWe're just left with a test issue.

Very interesting find. I have confirmed that the existing tests fail when running as root on Linux, just like what you're experiencing when running as admin on Windows. It's unrelated to this patch. This might explain a few complaints I've seen on the mailing lists from new engineers trying to contribute to Hadoop, but finding some unit tests failing immediately. I'll try to track down those threads and help them out.\n\nI agree with sticking to the File APIs, because they give us the \"absolute truth\" as you said. If the user is root/admin, then the disk is usable. \n{quote}\n\nThanks Chris for checking this out. Given that we have a symmetry with Unix I am +1 on the current patch. Maybe just add a comment to the test saying that it is expected to fail if run as root on Unix or in elevated context on Windows?\n\n{quote}\nWe're just left with a test issue. We could change the tests to detect root/admin at runtime and then either skip the invalid tests with assumeTrue or run different assertions. On Linux, we could check the username against \"root\". On Windows, would it be sufficient to check that user is \"Administrator\", or is it more complex than that?\n{quote}\nFor Windows, it won't be as simple as string compare. Even checking whether a user is a member of the Administrators group is not the right behavior. We have to check whether the process is running elevated or not. This could be done in native code or via a cmd script as described [here|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7985755/how-to-detect-if-cmd-is-running-as-administrator-has-elevated-privileges]. We could expose something like TestUtils#IsRunningElevated and disable/relax the test in that case, but this would be a separate Jira.\n\nbq. What is the issue?\nBikas, the issue is that the test fails when executed in the elevated context on Windows, or as root on Linux.
