Maybe we shouldn't have allowed such side effect in the first place. But I definitely don't want to see more possibilities for such side effects.\n\n> Once we've made that concession that there is a Hadoop-specific idea of a JVM-wide (static) current/login user that \n> is implicitly logged in when you call security-related functions, I'd expect all of these functions to be consistent about \n> falling back to that same behavior.\n\nYes, there is such a concept of system-wide current/login user, but to use it you have to explicitly invoke UGI.getCurrentUser().doAs(). That is what happened in the RPC layer. I think it's safer to explicitly invoke doAs(). Another option could be after login, we put everything inside a loginUser.doAs() block. That way the current Subject is always available and is the user we have logged in, unless we are in nested doAs() blocks. However, we had gone a different path.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kzhang","name":"kzhang","key":"kzhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kan Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-01-06T02:57:58.359+0000","updated":"2011-01-06T02:57:58.359+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12473647/comment/12996882","id":"12996882","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
