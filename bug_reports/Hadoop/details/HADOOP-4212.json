Configuration should assume the semantics of the value Strings are known to the user defining the property. Where the user _instructs_ the Configuration to interpret the value, the semantics are explicit and sanitizing input is reasonable. In addition to resolving class names, it would be reasonable to trim values interpreted in getInt, getLong, etc., though it would still be an incompatible change (IIRC, the default value is returned for invalid input). It's certainly an incompatible change in the general case. I think we should close this issue as \"Won't fix\" and consider broadening the scope of HADOOP-4416.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-10-24T08:45:42.517+0000","updated":"2008-10-24T08:45:42.517+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404703/comment/12642433","id":"12642433","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sreekanth","name":"sreekanth","key":"sreekanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sreekanth Ramakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I think we should have a generic way of reading values than to expect each implementer of new getXXX() method in Configuration or a class which subclasses configuration to remember he has to deal with a leading or a trailing space.\n\nbq.
