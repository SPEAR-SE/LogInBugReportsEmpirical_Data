When an app is done, it should be able to call {{FileSystem.closeAllForUGI}} just like the JT does.  Unfortunately that may pull the rug out from under another app for that user also running on the NM.  It also means that multiple jobs for the same user are erroneously using the first job's conf.  Both are probably latent issues in the JT but go unnoticed or are masked by retries.\n\nIdeally the {{hashCode}} or {{identityHashCode}} would be added to the cache key.  A key/value equivalence test should not be performed because seemingly identical confs (ex. cloned from each other) would initially appear the same but may later change.  One potential issue is cloned confs that really should be the same -- ex. yarn often creates a {{YarnConfiguration(conf)}}.  This won't be a problem if the conversion is done once and stashed.  If it's done on the fly multiple times, then it does present a problem.  Arguably that would be a bug but it would be difficult to fix in a timely manner.\n\nSo an alternative is to add a key to the conf (ex. {{fs.cache-id}}) that can be used in the fs cache key.  This would allow partitioning of the cache, albeit imperfectly, that would account for cloned confs that should be treated the same.  The onus is placed upon the caller to explicitly change the key when needed, but it would be more transparent for existing code.\n\nI'll wait for comments before preceding.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-06-07T15:19:32.486+0000","updated":"2012-06-07T15:19:32.486+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559701/comment/13291087","id":"13291087","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Making conf as part of the  cache key solves number of problems, but may not be ideal by itself. \n\nWe need to think about what are the parts of conf that make sense to be dynamic.

I have heard that most multi-tenet long running systems that use HDFS have to disable the cache and then write their own, i.e. Oozie and Hive.  The JobTracker is the only one I know of that does not do this.  Most client code I have seen really relies on the fact that getting a \"new\" FileSystem is cheap, so completely removing the cache is not a feasible option. Look at the MR/Yarn code. Just uploading aggregated log files to HDFS creates about 5 FileSystems if the cache is disabled.  \n\nIf our users have to disable and work around a \"feature\" that we cannot turn off we should take that as a bad sign and try to provide a better solution for them.  Now if the \"fix\" makes the performance horrible, or there are other problems we may need to rethink things, but I am +1 on trying to fix the cache.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-06-18T15:59:54.831+0000","updated":"2012-06-18T15:59:54.831+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559701/comment/13971987","id":"13971987","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Specific issue that prompted the bug was fixed in the NM long ago.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-16T21:40:35.527+0000","updated":"2014-04-16T21:40:35.527+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-8490/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i07thb:"}}
