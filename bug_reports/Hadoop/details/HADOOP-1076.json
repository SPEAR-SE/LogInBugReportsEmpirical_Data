Otherwise the existing \"edits\" file will be used for checkpointing\nand the primary node will keep accumulating new edits in the \"edits.new\".\nIn order to make it work the primary node should also ignore any rollFSImage() requests when it\nalready started to perform one. Otherwise the new image can become corrupted if two secondary\nnodes request to rollFSImage() at the same time.\n\n2. Also, after the periodic checkpointing patch HADOOP-227 I see pieces of unusable code.\nI noticed one data member SecondaryNameNode.localName and at least 4 methods in FSEditLog\nthat are not used anywhere.
