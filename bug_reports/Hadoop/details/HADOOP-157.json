Killed tasks do not complain when they have non-zero exit codes from their process.\n5. Improved the error message when tasks are killed for not updating their progress.\n6. Dfs' ClientProtocol.addBlock now takes the client name rather than the client machine.\n7. Problems renewing dfs leases are now logged.\n8. More details in the exception messages when DfsClient.create fails.\n9. addBlock now checks to make sure it is the same client that owns the lease who is adding to the file.\n10.
