The advantage is that the sort algorithm (which could be user-code i.e. by extending BasicTypeSorterBase) is blissfully un-aware of the reporting going on under the covers and also it ensures that there is no way even user-supplied comparators (e.g. JobConf.getOutputValueGroupingComparator()) can by-pass this reporting mechanism).\n\nAppreciate review/feedback while I continue testing...

From the architecture point of view, I think it makes sense to have at least the MapReduce kernel part of sort aware of that - i.e., the generic BufferSorter. \nMy major objection to this patch is that we are kind of short circuiting things making the thing look hacky IMO. I would much rather do it the following way:\n1) Add a method to the BufferSorter interface called setReporter(Reporter).\n2) Implementors of the interface, in this case the BasicTypeSorterBase would implement the method, and in this case would just store the reporter object. This is similar to the BufferSorter.setInputBuffer method.\n3) The BasicTypeSorterBase would periodically invoke the reporter.progress() to report progress. The compare method in the BasicTypeSorterBase class is a potential place where reporter.progress can be called.\nThis way, we don't make the sort library (currently the MergeSorter, MergeSort classes) aware of the Reporter object but have everything in the MapReduce kernel. This preserves the boundaries that i originally intended to have between the various layers (HADOOP-331).\n\nFor the reduceTask, we have threads for reporting progress for two phases:\n1) during the shuffle (and here we implicitly do the progress reporting for the ramfs merges too)\n2) during the merge of the on-disk files in the reduce phase\nThe thread for the first case is still there in the current patch. If we are to really remove the issue, we should ideally remove the thread for the shuffle also since the ramfs merge might also get stuck (since user code is involved there). \n\nSimilarly to BufferSorter, we could have an API for merge that takes a Reporter object and calls reporter.progress periodically. ReduceTask as well as the final merge on the MapTask could use that for the merges.

I believe that the sort progress reporting as is done today has been working fine for quite some time (many months actually), and I can't remember what bug got introduced there (sorry). The only reason why sort could get stuck is for reason of bad user code in the Comparator and I am not convinced that we would have handled that issue completely without handling the merge cases also. \nOn a side note, one problem that exists today is that the child Map/Reduce processes sometimes (rarely on linux), for some reason, doesn't exit even after the map/reduce method invocations are over (TaskRunner.run() doesn't exit, and hence tracker.reportTaskFinished(t.getTaskId()) is not called and finally the TaskTracker kills it after the timeout interval in the method markUnresponsiveTasks).\nBut again, I am happy if we agree that we should look at this issue in more detail for 0.14 *smile*","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2007-05-25T17:15:34.289+0000","updated":"2007-05-25T17:15:34.289+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12370225/comment/12499786","id":"12499786","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"As part of a good solution (for 0.14 or later), I think we should separate out reporting of progress by the sort/merge/user code and reporting progress from the Task to the Task Tracker. \n\nFor the former, we make the Reporter object available to the MapReduce kernel code, as Devaraj suggested, and at other appropriate places as discussed in this conversation. Wherever progress is made that we need to report (during sort or merge or whatever), the kernel code or the user's code calls the Reporter project. \n\nSeparately, for the latter, we probably should continue with the Progress thread. This thread looks at the Progress data structures and sends progress info to the TaskTracker via RPC. To avoid the problem that this bug was filed for, we have two likely options: \n1. The thread continuus doing what it is doing is: it sends the progress information at regular intervals and the TaskTracker decides whether the task has really made progress, based on what it got earlier. Or\n2. The thread decides whether progress has really been made and makes an RPC call only if necessary. Even if progress is not made, it may make a call if we eliminate the Ping thread (see issue 1201) to prevent the TaskTracker from killing the task. \n\nThe latter's probably a better option as the logic to decide whether progress has been made may be easier to implement in the thread, rather than in TaskTracker. As discussed earlier in this conversation, we may resume/suspend the thread, or at least make sure we start and stop it at the right places But I'd suggest we separate the issue of reporting progress locally (via the Reporter object) with reporting progress to the TaskTracker (via a thread). The logic for the two issues is diferent and separating the code will make things cleaner and easier to change.

In other places we use the idiom of a 'running' flag that's checked in a thread's loop in conjunction with an interrupt, rather than interrupt+join, and that seems to be reliable. So I think we should switch to that here to.\n\nAlso, in the current patch, I don't see why the thread is held in a field. I worry that someone might add code like 'if (sortProgressThread == null) ...', and that we might somehow not always null this field. If it is kept in a local variable around the call then this is much less of a risk.\n\nSo I think we should convert the createProgressThread method to a nested class whose constructor starts the thread and which has a stop() method that sets a flag. It would also be good if the 'try' block could be shared between 'collect()' and 'flush()'. I think this calls for a new method something like:\n\nprivate void sortWithProgress() {\nProgressThread progress = new ProgressThread();\ntry { sortAndSpillToDisk(); } finally { progress.stop(); }\n}\n{quote}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-06-01T17:45:20.315+0000","updated":"2007-06-01T17:45:20.315+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12370225/comment/12500790","id":"12500790","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Interrupted is just like a standard running flag.
