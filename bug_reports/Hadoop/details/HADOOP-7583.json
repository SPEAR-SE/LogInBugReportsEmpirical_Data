We need to differentiate -Ptar, and -Pdeb. The packaging idea is the same, but the maven plugins called in the profiles are different.  My comment for HADOOP-7496 +1 at 20/Aug/11 16:18 is for -Pdist is good for creating directory layout. -Pdist would be a profile activate by -Ptar or -Pdeb to ensure that jar files in multiple type of packages have the same md5 signature.  In addition, it is better to standardized use of mvn clean package -Ptar.  HBase already use the -Ptar, -Pdeb convention (HBASE-3606), it would be nice to make them consistent across Hadoop projects.  Thank you.
