I did have a patch in progress, so I'll just attach the work I've done so far and ask you if you want to do anything more with this.\n\nAs part of this patch, I also wanted to refactor {{AclEntry#parseAclSpec}} so that the logic of parsing a single entry is in a separate public static method: {{AclEntry#parseAclEntry}}.  That's going to be helpful for the HDFS-5608 WebHDFS patch.  I didn't get the refactoring done yet in this version of the patch.\n\nbq. But my doubt is, whether removing the mask is allowed ?\n\nActually, you are correct.  I was incorrect when I said earlier that you can remove the mask to trigger automatic recalculation.  It is invalid to attempt to remove the mask from an ACL that needs it, however, the error should get reported from the server side instead of a failure to parse the ACL spec.  We already have the code to do this in the NameNode in {{AclTransformation#buildAndValidateAcl}}.  The parsing still needs to be able to parse a mask entry with no permission, because it is valid to remove the mask entry if you're also removing all other extended ACL entries (reducing it from an extended ACL back to a minimal ACL).
