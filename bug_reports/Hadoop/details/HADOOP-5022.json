I don't have a cluster set up with old logs, so couldn't test it live.\n\nSome minor code comments w.r.t logcondense.py:\n - Line +100 : the dictionary related to the newly added option can be indented. It won't give a compilation problem now, but it can be indented nevertheless for better readability\n - The option name can be something in the lines of \"retain-masters-logs\" instead of \"cleanall\". It should be true by default (current scenario). The description string can be something like \"true if the logs of the masters(jobtracker and namenode if dynamicdfs is set) have to be retained, false if everything has to be removed\"\n - Line +191 : ret = 0 not needed\n - Line +135 : spurious blank line to be removed\n\nAnother point to be noted is that the code path covered by this patch could have been much simpler had the job-specific directories(present in hod-logs parent directory) themselves had timestamp in their names.
