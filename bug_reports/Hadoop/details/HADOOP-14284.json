Hence, my intension to exclude META-INF/** is to remove our L&N files and to include L file which is included in original Guava. Precisely, the L file is COPYING file in Guava's repository. The change of excluding META-INF/**, however, was not correct solution as you pointed out - it doesn't work. Thanks for pointing out.

Otherwise mustn't whatever is in hadoop-common be referring to a non-relocated Guava?\n\nRelated to the above, I don't see where the modules that now depend on shaded-third-party are changed to reference the relocated version of Guava. We can do it either in the source code or in the build, but I don't see us doing either ATM.\n\nFor example, [apache avro does this by making a temp jar with non-relocated classes they reference, then doing the relocation for both the classes and their references in the user facing module|https://github.com/apache/avro/commit/f7ec67996b66444f9de2284d1ddfaa66297ba51e]. Apache HBase does the update-the-source approach for their relocated Google Protobuf. (There's not a simple thing to point at for that example, unfortunately. [the README for the module that does the relocation|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/48439e57201ee3be5eb12e6187002501af305a35/hbase-protocol-shaded/README.txt] is the closest, since it at least has pointers to what's going on and the commits involved.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=busbey","name":"busbey","key":"busbey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233"},"displayName":"Sean Busbey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-04-10T12:58:37.311+0000","updated":"2017-04-10T12:58:37.311+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13061919/comment/15962870","id":"15962870","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ozawa","name":"ozawa","key":"ozawa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740"},"displayName":"Tsuyoshi Ozawa","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Sean!

Would you remove shaded guava from hadoop-client-runtime module?\n{quote}\n\nThanks for the suggestion. I could fix it by using shaded Guava in hadoop-shaded-thirdparty, but I rechecked dependencies again before doing so. After rechecking the dependency under hadoop-client-modules, I found that hadoop-client-modules shouldn't use hadoop-shaded-thirdparty. It's because hadoop-shaded-thirdparty exposes Guava's partial classes to use Apache Curator but Apache Curator is only necessary in server side. In hadoop-client-modules, we can shade Guava separately without using  hadoop-shaded-thirdparty. I will upload v10 patch with above approach.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ozawa","name":"ozawa","key":"ozawa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740"},"displayName":"Tsuyoshi

The build time of Hadoop doesn't get increased so much with this approach because of just referring to hadoop-shaded-thirdparty project from hadoop-* projects. However, I found one problem in this approach: shaded artifacts(shaded Guava and Curator) in hadoop-shaded-thirdparty is NOT in classpath, if I understand correctly. To go with this approach, we need to unzip source code and compile it like HBase does in hbase-protocol-shaded. This can make Hadoop build fragile and the build time of Hadoop can increase as Junping Vinod mentioned. \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/7700a7fac1262934fe538a96b040793c6ff171ce/hbase-protocol-shaded/pom.xml#L321\n\nGradle seems to have a feature to do this.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/26244936/how-to-include-only-project-and-relocated-classes-when-using-gradle-shadow-plugi\n\n> Isn't it better to just shade our final artifacts instead of shading individual libraries' jars? \n\nDo you mean that we prepare new project \"hadoop-server-modules\" and shading Guava and Curator inside them like hadoop-client-modules? It sounds better approach to me. By adding skipShade option here, we can overcome build time problem.

IMO, shade dependencies on client jars is an acceptable solution but effort like this to shade particular poor backward compatibility dependency everywhere seems unacceptable in build prospective - even worse case is if other dependencies are following this practice, then it would be nightmare for future maintaining of hadoop.\nConsidering Hadoop ecosystem has large number of downstream projects, we should keep core hadoop as stable as possible - even in a new major release. For poor backward compatibility third-party jar, like Guava, I think we should either get rid of it or keep on a particular version and never change . My proposal above to get rid of Guava seems too aggressive and unrealistic in short term.

Its only charge is providing mainline hbase with relocated popular libs such as guava and netty. The project comprises nought but poms (caveat some hacky patching of protobuf our project requires): https://github.com/apache/hbase-thirdparty The pull and relocation is moved out of the mainline hbase build.\n * We changed mainline hbase to use relocated versions of popular libs. This was mostly a case of changing imports from, for example, com.google.protobuf.Message to org.apache.hadoop.hbase.shaded.com.google.protobuf.Message (an unfortunate decision a while back saddled us w/ the extra-long relocation prefix).\n * As part of the mainline build, we run com.google.code.maven-replacer-plugin to rewrite third-party references in generated code to instead refer to our relocated versions.\n\nUpside is we can update core libs whenever we wish. Should a lib turn problematic, we can add it to the relocated set. Downside is having to be sure we always refer to the relocated versions in code.\n\nWhile the pattern is straight-forward, the above project took a good while to implement mostly because infra is a bit shakey and our test suite has a host of flakies in it; verifying the test was failiing because it a flakey and not because of the relocation took a good while.\n\nIf you want to do similar project in hadoop, I'd be game to help out.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stack","name":"stack","key":"stack","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stack","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-08-14T18:36:14.764+0000","updated":"2017-08-14T18:36:14.764+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13061919/comment/16126259","id":"16126259","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=haibochen","name":"haibochen","key":"haibochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haibo Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks @stack for the insight on HBase's solution.

We've done a bad job evangelizing it up to this but intend to go at it with gusto with our next major release on out. This project should work for those confined to our client API but as with hadoop, hbase has facets other than that of the client API. This is when the story gets messy; i.e. plugins or clients reading/writing hbase files apart from an hbase instance. Shading our internals helps as we avoid the possibility of clashes. On our backend, we also are too-tightly tied to our upstream, a project we are working to undo, but we are not there yet.

We can always come back and shade the rest in the future if we get tired of breaking the build.\n\nA campaign to get HDFS clients to stop using the server JARs is a grand idea, but it doesn't absolve us from shading the server JARs, because there will be hold-outs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=templedf","name":"templedf","key":"templedf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=templedf&avatarId=24879","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=templedf&avatarId=24879","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=templedf&avatarId=24879","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=templedf&avatarId=24879"},"displayName":"Daniel Templeton","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-08-24T16:28:18.136+0000","updated":"2017-08-24T16:28:18.136+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13061919/comment/16140672","id":"16140672","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=haibochen","name":"haibochen","key":"haibochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haibo Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~busbey], the shaded hadoop-client work seems incomplete.
