FYI we are using LDAP for storing the Unix ID and group and the LDAP is integrated with Hadoop cluster.   \n \nPreliminary steps\n1.Created Group say group1 \n2.Created Another Group say group2 \n3.Now created a User say “pocuser” and associated it with group1 and group2 ( now pocuser is associated with group1 and group2)\nuid=13500(pocuser) gid=3500(group1) groups=3500(group1),3600(group2)  \n4 Created HDFS directory named data1 and assigned the ownership to hdfs:group1 with permission 770\n5.Create Another HDFS directory say data2 and assigned the ownership to hdfs:group2 with permission 770\ndrwxrwx---   - hdfs group1          0 2014-06-14 04:14 /data1\ndrwxrwx---   - hdfs group2          0 2014-06-14 04:14 /data2\n \nSteps to create bug\n 1) Now login as “pocuser\" in to the machine where HDFS is mounted and just type command “id\" then you will see that  user “pocuser” is associated with two groups (group1 and group2)\nuid=13500(pocuser) gid=3500(group1) groups=3500(group1),3600(group2)\n \n   2)Execute \"cd /hdfsmount; ls – ltra\" then you will see that permissions are reflecting properly in the mounted file system\ndrwxrwx---.  2 hdfs group1       64 Jun 14 04:14 data1\ndrwxrwx---.  2 hdfs group2       64 Jun 14 04:14 data2\n \n  3) Reconfirmed that user “pocuser” belongs to the two group  by executing command \"groups pocuser\"\n pocuser : group1 group2\n \n4) Now the user “pocuser” can access only data1 and NOT data2 as for some reasons it ignores the secondary group while accessing the mounted file system and throws Permission denied.\n-sh-4.1$ cd data2\n-sh: cd: data2: Permission denied\n-sh-4.1$ cd data1\n-sh-4.1$\n \n5) Now if execute the command  “newgrp group2” then the user can access data2 and not data1 as the the primary group of the user “pocuser” is group2\nnewgrp group2\ncd data1\ncd: data1: Permission denied\ncd data2\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=PKUKILLA","name":"PKUKILLA","key":"pkukilla","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Premchandra Preetham Kukillaya","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2014-06-15T07:54:44.168+0000","updated":"2014-06-15T07:54:44.168+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12721279/comment/14033705","id":"14033705","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

But here are my questions\n\n1) As per the fix you are using the List of GID's sent by NFS Client to NFS Proxy.  But in this approach are disadvantages like 1) max of 16 GID/ UNIX ID 2) Requires integration of Client machine with LDAP and its a big pain. \n\n2) Why the List of GID for each UID is not retrieved from OS/LDAP instead of list of List of GID's sent by NFS Client to NFS Proxy. Doing so it will eliminate the need for Client machines to integrate with LDAP.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=PKUKILLA","name":"PKUKILLA","key":"pkukilla","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Premchandra Preetham Kukillaya","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2014-06-17T17:53:23.899+0000","updated":"2014-06-17T17:53:23.899+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12721279/comment/14034162","id":"14034162","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks for giving it a look - I just reused what was already being stored by the AUTH_SYS.
