The operation succeeded even though we need to refresh the authToken?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-02T05:13:00.365+0000","updated":"2014-10-02T05:13:00.365+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12744612/comment/14156093","id":"14156093","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I also ran apache-rat:check successfully with this patch applied, so not sure what's up with that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-02T05:23:16.905+0000","updated":"2014-10-02T05:23:16.905+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12744612/comment/14156893","id":"14156893","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~andrew.wang], thanks for the followup review\n\nSo, about the volatile authToken, the KMSClientProvider also starts background threads to fill the encryptedKeyCache when it goes below threshold, which is an HTTP call to the server using the authToken, so if in case the authToken gets flushed, I wanted to avoid a situation when the bg thread might use the older token\n\nwrt the new if statement.. \nin kerberos mode, the first time the Client connects,  it initiates a SPNEGO handshake with the server. This involves first sending an {{OPTIONS}} request, to which the Server will respond with {{Set-Cookie:}} containing the correct {{hadoop.auth}} cookie. This cookie string is then *set* in the authToken. All subsequent requests {{GET / POST / DELETE etc.}} from the client would just send the {{hadoop.auth}} cookie. The issue is that the authToken can be *set* only during initialization, i.e. the response to the OPTIONS request (you can blame {{KerberosAuthenticator}} for that). Now, if the authToken is stale, the Server will send a 401 to the client with {{WWW-Authenticate : Negotiate}} Header. This is intercepted by the JDK SPNEGO implementing classes on the client side and it automatically responds (no control is returned to the call method in KMSClientProvider) with an {{Authorize : Negotiate <kerb token>}} header.  This will generally be accepted by the server and along with the 'success' response, the KMS server also sends back a {{Set-Cookie}} with the correct value of {{hadoop.auth}} cookie.. unfortunately, since this is not a response to a connection initialization call, and since the authToken is already *set*, the new {{hadoop.auth}} cookie is simply ignored.. Which mean for every subsequent request after the authToken has gone stale, the client will actually be sending 2 requests.. one with the old stale token which returns 401 and the second which is successful. The only way to know in the {{KMSClientProvider}} that there was an authentication failure and that the authToken needs to be flushed is to see if a SUCCESSFUL response has a {{hadoop.auth}} Set-Cookie. Also since I cannot just 'set' the authToken with the cookie, since the {{set()}} method is package protected.. only option I have is to create a new instance of the authToken.. so that the next request from the client will initialize the SPNEGO handshake and 'set' the authToken correctly.\n\nHope this made sense..\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-02T18:02:35.549+0000","updated":"2014-10-02T18:02:35.549+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12744612/comment/14157516","id":"14157516","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Uploading new patch :\n\n* addressing some of [~andrew.wang]'s suggestions\n* Using {{AuthenticatedURL#extractToken}} to set the authToken on successful response if it contains a *hadoop.auth* cookie.. so subsequent requests need not initiate SPNEGO handshake","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-03T00:39:50.020+0000","updated":"2014-10-03T00:39:50.020+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12744612/comment/14157550","id":"14157550","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updating patch again :\n\n* Modified {{TestKMS#testKMSRestart}} to check case when kerb is both enabled and dissabled(simple auth)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-03T01:19:03.225+0000","updated":"2014-10-03T01:19:03.225+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12744612/comment/14157566","id":"14157566","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
