The main difference is the amount of review time each line gets is higher.\n\nThis is the [hadoop-aws testing policy|\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-tools/hadoop-aws/src/site/markdown/tools/hadoop-aws/testing.md]. no declared test run: no review. No extra tests: either justify the lack of tests or expect no review.\n\nHere I'm not going to worry about it as HADOOP-3257 shows this is a broader problem. This alternative construction trick may work here, but it's only going to delay the problem. For example. it won't do anything for writing data when the destination path has a \":\", in, recursive listFiles(path, recursive=true), calls, or anywhere else where the Path/2 constructors are used to build paths. Which is a lot of places in the code.\n\nI don't think we can/should be trying to fix this in a stack-trace-by-stack trace approach as it will simply break again the moment someone changes the codepath. Path itself is going to need tuning. That's not impossible; if you look at what goes on there to handle windows paths like \"C:/something\" you can see what has gone ahead. It's just a significant body of work, which someone who understands that bit of the code (not me!) needs to do.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve
