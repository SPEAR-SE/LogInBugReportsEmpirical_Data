I would suggest that we use ArrayList in order to reduce the use of memory. Most of the time the set size is 3 because the default replication factor of a file is 3. So in term of speed, there is no benifit using TreeSet. However in term of memory TreeSet is way more expensive than ArrayList. An entry in TreeSet is at least 6 times as expensive as an entry in ArrayList and approximately we have 3*total#_of_blocks of such entries in FSNamesystem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-12-20T22:57:37.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-20T22:57:37.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358081/comment/12460093","id":"12460093","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1\nI was thinking of the same. \nHow much do think the memory difference between a LinkedList entry and ArrayList entry?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-12-20T23:37:10.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-20T23:37:10.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358081/comment/12460102","id":"12460102","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"A LinkedList entry contains a pointer to the previous entry and a pointer to the next entry.

When name nodes starts up, it initially creates all the blocks in Indode while reading the image file.. does not seem easy to share that reference. \n\nEven after a name node starts up, a block in inode does not share the object with blockMap. So a name node contains two Block instantiations per block.\n\nTo reduce the number of block instantiations to 1, I think we can create a TreeSet of blocks which maps a block id to its block object. When a block is intially created, simply add the block to this block set. When later a reference to the block is needed, we can get it from the block set.\n\nWe can furthur remove the blockMap and activeBlock list by adding two non-persistent fields to the Block data structures. One is a reference to all its containing data nodes and one to the inode representing the file that the block belongs to.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-02-03T00:28:00.237+0000","updated":"2007-02-03T00:28:00.237+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12358081/comment/12469924","id":"12469924","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"\n> Even after a name node starts up, a block in inode does not share the object with blockMap.\n> So a name node contains two Block instantiations per block.\n\nIn the patch, when a file is closed, we do use the reference in blockMap (because, datanode that has block would have informed namenode already).\n\nYes, we can get rid of one of blockMap and activeBlocks maps (not both).
