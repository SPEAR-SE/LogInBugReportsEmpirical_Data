The main problem here is pid cycling.  This is caused by starting and stopping a lot of processes.  For things like the NN, RM, etc, this just doesn't happen in production.  It does (very rarely) happen on the worker nodes (DN, NM), but most experienced operations people know exactly how to handle it.  Developers and QA, however, hit this problem a lot.... because they're also always cycling processes.  I really don't want this to turn into the equivalent of the metrics mess we have in Hadoop.  (\"We should expose system metric X in the YARN UI!\".   Who is actually looking at those values?  It isn't ops folks--we've got other tools to tell us those things.)\n\nI think it's important for folks to go look at HADOOP-13225.  It really sort of exemplifies the power that we've given users over the shell scripts in 3.x.  Yes, we could require daemontools' setlock.  But then we look like morons on operating systems that have other tools (SMF, launchd, systemd, etc.).  If we want to get fancy, then we should providing examples of using alternate daemon control tools.  \n\nWe haven't even covered what happens to the process space in containerized systems:\n\n{code}\n    root     1     0   0   Aug 25 ?           0:01 /sbin/init\n    root  1740  1450   0   Aug 25 ?           0:01 /sbin/init -m verbose\n    root  1738  1449   0   Aug 25 ?           0:01 /sbin/init\n{code}\n\nYes, those are separate init processes. Something that shouldn't happen.  Except they are running in different Illumos zones and this is the view from the global zone, which can see (but not touch) all processes from all zones.  I've never tried it, but I wouldn't be too surprised if lxc's (docker, rkt, etc) processes can be seen and touched from the parent since the boundaries are much less defined.\n\n...\n\nThere is a lot of nuance involved in this problem.  Again, I'm going to double down on this is less of an issue for other apps because they don't have our Java-induced startup time.  If we weren't using Java (at least with this massive classpath), we'd just fire the daemon up and let it sort it out on it's own.  But we're not.  So we can't.\n\nThat's why this is exactly the space where vendors who support specific operating systems should be providing value add by making such controls part of their offering.  We should probably add a hadoop-vendor-functions.sh or something to make it easier for vendors to override things.\n\nFWIW, I figure for those not using systemd and the like, we'll likely see user functions that turn off pid handling and simple init scripts that use  [daemon|http://libslack.org/daemon/manpages/daemon.1.html] appear relatively quickly.  There's the potential for a whole ecosystem of home grown mods like this waiting to happen with 3.x.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2017-09-09T19:16:47.963+0000","updated":"2017-09-09T19:17:35.080+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13100883/comment/16175291","id":"16175291","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"FYI JDK 9 includes JEP 102, Process API Updates, will provide a much more sane way for the JDK to find it's pid.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2017-09-21T18:59:41.520+0000","updated":"2017-09-21T18:59:41.520+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13100883/comment/16407109","id":"16407109","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think we should try to lower the chances of doing this.  If a user runs into this issue, they're going to be very confused and won't know how to fix it without looking into our shell scripts (if they even figure out that they should look there).  While it's not 100% perfect, I think we should do something along the lines of what [~aw] suggested in [this earlier comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-14855?focusedCommentId=16159435&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16159435]:\r\n{code}\r\npspid=$(ps -fp \"${pid}\" 2>/dev/null)\r\n\r\nif [[ $? -ne 0]]; then\r\n  if [[ ${pspid} =~ Dproc_${daemonname} ]]; then\r\n{code}\r\nThis should significantly cut down the likelihood of running into this issue and seems pretty easy to do with little cost.
