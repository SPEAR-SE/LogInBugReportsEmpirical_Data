Rolling keys provides containment in the event of keys being leaked.\n\nToward that end, I propose an API that is configured using a list of URLs of KeyProviders. The implementation will look for implementations using the ServiceLoader interface and thus support third party libraries.\n\nTwo providers will be included in this patch. One using the credentials cache in MapReduce jobs and the other using Java KeyStores from either HDFS or local file system.
