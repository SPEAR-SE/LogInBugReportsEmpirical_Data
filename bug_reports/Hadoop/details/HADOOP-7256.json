As a result of this we found the lsof value raising leading to resource leak.\n\nSolution:\n=======\nWhile doing a close operation of any resource catch the RuntimeException also rather than catching the IOException alone.\n\nAdditionally there are places where we try to close a resource in the catch block.\nIf this close fails, we just throw and come out of the current flow.\nIn order to avoid this, we can carry out the close operation in the finally block.\n\nProbable reasons for getting RunTimeExceptions:\n=====================================\nWe may get runtime exception from customised hadoop streams like FSDataOutputStream.close() . So better to handle RunTimeExceptions also.\n\n\n \n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"8h","remainingEstimate":"8h","originalEstimateSeconds":28800,"remainingEstimateSeconds":28800},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12546173","id":"12546173","filename":"HADOOP-7256.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2012-09-22T18:20:06.182+0000","size":4413,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12546173/HADOOP-7256.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12479607","id":"12479607","filename":"HADOOP-7256-patch-1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ram_krish","name":"ram_krish","key":"ram_krish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ramkrishna.s.vasudevan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2011-05-18T15:19:56.661+0000","size":2956,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12479607/HADOOP-7256-patch-1.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12480943","id":"12480943","filename":"HADOOP-7256-patch-2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ram_krish","name":"ram_krish","key":"ram_krish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ramkrishna.s.vasudevan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2011-05-31T15:02:11.203+0000","size":3310,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12480943/HADOOP-7256-patch-2.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":28800,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"46527","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Resource leak during failure scenario of closing of resources.
