Perhaps this is not quite a duplicate, but the JIRAs do seem to have somewhat overlapping aims, this part in particular:\n\nbq. figures out the branch name from the name of the patch and schedules a pre-commit job by passing in the branch info\n\nThe goal of HADOOP-7435 is to allow patches named appropriately to have their pre-commit tests be run against the correct SVN branch. That JIRA goes about this by making test-patch.sh detect the right branch and take the appropriate action. As I understand it, this JIRA would move the branch detection code based on the patch name into the admin job and then pass this info to the test-patch.sh script. Then, HADOOP-9573 aims to amend test-patch.sh to take the branch name as an argument from the admin job and check out the appropriate branches, etc.\n\nIf that understanding is correct, then it would seem to me that this JIRA + HADOOP-9573 supersede the work done in HADOOP-7435, though some of the work already done in that JIRA may be useful here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
