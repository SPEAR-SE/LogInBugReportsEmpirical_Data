If it is called in a doAs() block, then the returned currentUser is associated with the current AccessControlContext. Whereas if it is not called in a doAs() block, loginUser is returned (login is performed if needed) and this loginUser is NOT associated with the current AccessControlContext. This matters when we want to invoke, for example, Java GSS/Kerberos library, since these Java libraries will only check the current AccessControlContext for credentials. A cleaner approach would have been returning null when we're not in a doAs() block, to say that there is no currentUser being associated with current AccessControlContext. And if the caller wants to use the credentials of the loginUser, call loginUser.doAs() explicitly.\n\nIt's not the purpose of this patch to fix the above inconsistency. This patch simply extends the current semantics.
