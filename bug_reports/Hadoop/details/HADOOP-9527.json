These were addressed in HADOOP-9043 by overriding the methods in {{TestLocalFSFileContextSymlink}} and checking for Windows there.  It looks like I missed {{testRenameFileWithDestParentSymlink}} though, so thanks for picking that one up.  Could you please follow the same strategy of overriding it in {{TestLocalFSFileContextSymlink}}?\n\nThe reason for doing it this way is that by overriding it in the base class, we would skip the test even in the case of HDFS on Windows ({{TestFcHdfsSymlink}}).  It's only the combination of Windows and local file system that doesn't support dangling symlinks, so by overriding it in the subclass, we only skip the test in that very specific case.\n\n{code}\n+   * Returns the target of the given symlink. Returns the empty string if\n+   * the given path does not refer to a symlink or there is an error\n+   * acessing the symlink.\n{code}\nMinor nit: misspelling of accessing.\n\n{code}\n    RawLocalFileStatus(File f, long defaultBlockSize, FileSystem fs) {\n      super(\n          RawLocalFileSystem.getFileLength(f),\n          f.isDirectory(),\n          1,\n          defaultBlockSize,\n          f.lastModified(),\n          0,\n          null,\n          null,\n          null,\n          null,\n          new Path(f.getPath()).makeQualified(fs.getUri(),\n            fs.getWorkingDirectory()));\n    }\n{code}\n\nWas this change intended only for formatting, or was it intentional to switch to calling a different superclass constructor?

Sorry for not reviewing this earlier, I was not near my computer for a week.\n\n1. Interestingly, you are going the similar route I initially took in branch-1-win :) (see HADOOP-8872) Unfortunately, I don't think this will work in all cases. See my comments from HADOOP-9061 for the reasons why. Quoting the branch-1-win approach below:\n{quote}\n - If on Java6, do file copy instead of symlink. We've seen many problems with symlinks on files on Java6 and it is simply impossible to make all of them work. Recent examples include apps (like Oozie) built on top of MR that directly access symlinks using the Java File object (not thru RLFS), in which case things just don’t work.\n - If on Java7, symlinks work as expected.\n{quote}\nIt took a few iterations to get symlink behavior to work properly across the Hadoop ecosystem with JDK6 on Windows, hence I’d stick with the approach. \n\nThe downside would be that the readlink functionality would not work with the LFS on JDK6. Not sure if there are legit Hadoop scenarios that rely on this functionality, (I don’t know of any other than in tests). If not, I would be fine with just throwing the NOT_IMPL exception if readLink is invoked on JDK6 on Windows. Things are moving toward JDK7, so I don’t see this a big gap.\n\nI am interested in hearing your thoughts on this direction.\n\n2. FileUtil#readLink: My preference would be to expose a single {{File readLink(File)}} public API instead of FileUtil APIs that accept Paths or Strings. This makes the contract explicit such that the input path must be a valid cross-platform local file system path.\n\n3. RawLocalFs#createSymlink: IMO this method should delegate to FileUtil#symlink(). Currently we have two inconsistent implementation for symlinks in FileUtil and RawLocalFs. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-05-18T03:11:37.753+0000","updated":"2013-05-18T03:11:37.753+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12645492/comment/13664306","id":"13664306","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ivan, thanks for reviewing and posting your feedback.\n\nI think your suggestion is reasonable but I need to understand it better.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-22T17:37:29.182+0000","updated":"2013-05-22T17:37:29.182+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12645492/comment/13675588","id":"13675588","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Also seeing this failure in branch-2 on Windows.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-05T04:21:21.582+0000","updated":"2013-06-05T04:21:21.582+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12645492/comment/13676645","id":"13676645","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"New patch.

I’ll give the latest patch a day before I commit, in case Chris or Chuan have something to add.\n\nComments addressed in v11:\n - We should reconcile FileUtil#getPathWithoutSchemeAndAuthority() with the new Path#getPathWithoutSchemeAndAuthority API recently added\n - RawLocalFileSystem#readLink is not used anymore and should be deleted\n - Let’s not modify TestSymlinkHdfs, instead we can leave the base implementation and just override as needed (otherwise, we’d have to split this in a separate HDFS jira)\n - IMO, it is better to leave TestSymlinkLocalFsFileSystem#testRenameSymlinkToItself to fail on Windows then to add a TODO in code. You have a tracking Jira what will suffice. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-08-05T18:02:53.322+0000","updated":"2013-08-05T18:02:53.322+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12645492/comment/13729775","id":"13729775","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Also thanks to Ivan for code reviews.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-06T21:07:27.728+0000","updated":"2013-08-06T21:07:27.728+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12645492/comment/13731301","id":"13731301","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Thanks Chris for the commit, and indeed, big thanks Arpit for jumping thru all the hoops to get issue fixed!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-08-06T21:31:26.480+0000","updated":"2013-08-06T21:31:26.480+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12645492/comment/13731872","id":"13731872","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #294 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/294/])\nHADOOP-9527.
