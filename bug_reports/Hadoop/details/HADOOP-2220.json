Also, the job will fail when the same reducer exhausts the maximum number of attempts.\n\nThe limit should be a function of number of mappers and/or waves of mappers, and should be more conservative (e.g. no need to let them fail when there are enough slots to start speculatively executed reducers and speculative execution is enabled).
