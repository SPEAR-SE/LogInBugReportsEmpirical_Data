Changing it to use {{FileUtil#canRead}} would solve that.\n\nHowever, the larger issue is that this might be backwards-incompatible.  Prior to the patch, lack of access would return {{null}}.  After the patch, lack of access throws an exception.  Although this matches HDFS semantics, applications often have different expectations of the local file system.  If an application was coded to check for {{null}}, but not handle {{AccessDeniedException}}, then there is a risk of breaking that application.\n\nCc [~stevel@apache.org] for a second opinion from the file system contract perspective.  The current spec for {{listStatus}} does not explicitly require a pre-condition check that lack of access results in {{AccessDeniedException}}.\n\nhttp://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/filesystem.html\n\nIf we revert this, then something will have to be done about YARN-4842, which included tests that depended on the new exception message.

In some cases, the caller is seeking to emulate HDFS semantics, such as mini-cluster based tests.  In other cases, such as {{LocalDirAllocator}}, a caller explicitly calls {{FileSystem#getLocal}} and expects to work with the semantics of the local file system.  For example, I mentioned on HADOOP-9507/HADOOP-13082 that there had been a case in the past of Hive expecting very particular semantics from the local file system.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from full testing of the whole ecosystem, it's hard to know for sure that this change won't break something, because it's going to start throwing an exception that users of the local file system hadn't seen before.  This is why I was inclined to revert, at least within the 2.x line.  I'd appreciate your thoughts on whether or not this makes sense or I'm being overly paranoid.
