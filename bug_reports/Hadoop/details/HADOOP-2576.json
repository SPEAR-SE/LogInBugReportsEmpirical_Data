The cluster seems to be running an old version of the trunk can you get the svn revision? Also Namenode was recently restarted.\n\nLooks like there another linked list attached each datanode. {{metasave}} prints only the \"recent invalidates\". A loop in Namenode moves the invalidated blocks from recent invalidates to the datanode list. So it is possible for the block to exist many more times in this list. This is most probably the reason.\n\nI think it is better to relieve Namenode from throttling the deletion of blocks. In cases like these there seems to quite a bit of penalty on Namenode memory, the most precious resource for HDFS. Namenode could just ask Datanode to delete anything that it want to delete. Datanode could throttle it, I think it would be more scalable. This will also remove code related to management of throttling.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-01-22T21:52:30.133+0000","updated":"2008-01-22T21:52:30.133+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12386023/comment/12561486","id":"12561486","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"But for now, just changing the datanode list to a Set might be good enough.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-01-22T21:54:51.820+0000","updated":"2008-01-22T21:54:51.820+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12386023/comment/12561487","id":"12561487","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> For comparison, our cluster also runs job frequently with new files across 8 nodes, and we haven't experienced this issue with Hadoop 0.15.0.
