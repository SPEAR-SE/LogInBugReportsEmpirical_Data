There are instances where the number of files are in the vicinity of 20 million and in such cases the time taken for namenode startup is prohibitive. Here are some benchmark numbers on the time taken for namenode startup. These times do not include the time to process block reports.\n\nDefault scenario for 20 million files with the max  java heap size set to 14GB : 40 minutes\n\nTuning various java options such as young size, parallel garbage collection, initial java heap size : 14 minutes\n\nAs can be seen, 14 minutes is still a long time for the namenode to recover and code changes are required to bring this time down further. To this end some prototype optimizations were done to reduce this time. Based on some timing analysis saveImage and loadFSImage where the primary methods that were consuming most of the time. Most of the time was being spent on doing object allocations. The goal of the optimizations is to reduce the number of memory allocations as much as possible.\n\nOptimization 1: saveImage() \n======================\nAvoid allocation of the UTF8 object.\n\nOld code\n=======\nnew UTF8(fullName).write(out);\n\nNew Code\n========\nout.writeUTF(fullName)\n\n\nOptimization 2: saveImage()\n======================\nAvoid object allocation of the PermissionStatus Object and the FsPermission object. This is to be done for Directories and for files.\n\nOld code\n=======\nfileINode.getPermissionStatus().write(out)\n\nNew Code\n=========\nout.writeBytes(fileINode.getUserName())\nout.writeBytes(fileINode.getGroupName())\nout.writeShort(fileINode.getFsPermission().toShort())\n\nOptimization 3\n============\nloadImage() could use the same mechanism where we would avoid allocating the PermissionStatus object and the FsPermission object.\n\nOptimization 4\n============\nA hack was tried out to avoid the cost of object allocation from saveImage() where the fullName was being constructed using string concatenation. This optimization also helped improve performance\n\nOverall these optimizations helped bring down the overall startup time down to slightly over 7 minutes. Most of all the remaining time is now spent in loadFSImage() since we allocate the INode and INodeDirectory objects. Any further optimizations will need to focus on loadFSImage()\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12380862","id":"12380862","filename":"fastRestarts.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba

Within loadFSImage() most of the time is being spent in getExistingPathINode. \n\nHere is some data point on that (out of close to 7 minutes)\n\nTime taken in getExistingPathINode : 4 minutes\nTotal number of calls to getExistingPathINode : 19941941\n\nThis was for an image file of size 2.5GB with close to 20 million files.\n\nSince getExistingPathINode() does not have any significant object allocation, most of the optimization work going forward would entail parallelizing the operation in this method and use up all processors on the machine running the namenode. At this point only one processor is utilized and the remaining processors are idle. One other point to mention is that we are not I/O bound in this whole recovery operation and optimizations need to almost entirely be CPU focussed.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=girish","name":"girish","key":"girish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"girish vaitheeswaran","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-21T23:50:31.733+0000","updated":"2008-04-21T23:50:31.733+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12393897/comment/12591501","id":"12591501","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Could you please post here the exact parameters you used for jvm to improve the startup time.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-04-23T01:09:10.612+0000","updated":"2008-04-23T01:09:10.612+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12393897/comment/12591533","id":"12591533","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=girish","name":"girish","key":"girish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"girish vaitheeswaran","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The following configuration options were used for the Namenode to improve the startup time.

PermissionStatus is under fs package.  We definitely should not use INode there.  In OO point of view, the codes in trunk probably is the best.  For performance, we should not do the converting (short-> FsPermission -> short).  Your patch balances both.  I am fine with that.  We could do this further improvement later.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-05-06T00:10:33.875+0000","updated":"2008-05-06T00:11:24.245+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12393897/comment/12594440","id":"12594440","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=girish","name":"girish","key":"girish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"girish vaitheeswaran","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":">> You mentioned there were 20 million files.

Don't recall the memory usage from the Namanode side. The -Xms parameter did help quite a bit in improving startup time and after setting it to different values 14G turned out to be the most performant. As for the number of blocks I am not sure but I beleive it was on an average of slightly less than 2 per file.
