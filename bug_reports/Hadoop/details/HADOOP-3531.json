The check is made soon after the command is launched. On some machines, the time limit between launching the command and its exit with the error code is a few 100s of milliseconds. On such machines, the code determining whether the Hadoop command exited thinks that all is fine, and fails later when it tries to check if the JobTracker's Jetty server is up. In the process it loses about a minute's time.\n\nIf the max-master-failures variable is > 1, a second attempt is made to launch the JobTracker. On similar hardware and configuration, the same timing issue shows up. By the time 2 machines have failed, the HOD client times out waiting for the JobTracker URL and the cluster is deallocated by deleting the Torque job.\n\nThis is a fairly serious issue, because it nullifies the enhancement made in HADOOP-3184, as the JobTracker is not launched on enough machines to give it a chance of coming up on a good machine.\n\nIntroducing a minor delay of just a second in the HodRing code fixed the problem that is described above. It seems fair to wait a bit for the Hadoop command to actually exit (if there are errors) before checking for it's error code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-06-11T16:51:19.809+0000","updated":"2008-06-11T16:51:19.809+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12398053/comment/12604271","id":"12604271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asrabkin","name":"asrabkin","key":"asrabkin","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ari Rabkin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Inserting delays to fix synchro problems is a perilous course.

Inserting delays to fix synchro problems is a perilous course. Can we do something better, like alternate between checking for an error code, and checking if the jetty interface came up?\n\nAri, excellent suggestion. I have done just that in the attached patch. So, what happens now is that even if the command's exit code is missed the first time, I continue to check for exit status while checking for the jetty interface status. Thus, at some point if the command is found to have exited, the code returns immediately with a good error message.\n\nI tested this patch by introducing spurious failures on a test cluster. I was able to validate that the correct code paths were covered. However, some testing in a more controlled environment where we can control the allocated nodes and set them up for failure could help.
