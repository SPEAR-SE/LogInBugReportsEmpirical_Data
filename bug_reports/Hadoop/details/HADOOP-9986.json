We will have to force all users to change their scripts/programs to be able to access federated cluster. \n\nIt would be great if thee was a way to map viewfs scheme to hdfs scheme without exposing it to users. Opening this JIRA to get inputs from people who have thought about this in their clusters.\n\nIn our clusters we ended up created another class HDFSCompatibleViewFileSystem which hijacks both hdfs.fs.impl and viewfs.fs.impl and passes down filesystem calls to ViewFileSystem.
