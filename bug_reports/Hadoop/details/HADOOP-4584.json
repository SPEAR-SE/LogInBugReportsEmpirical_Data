The only good thing is that it does not die.\n# We loose automatic data-node activity throttling with this. \nMeaning that while the data-node is busy it still sends heartbeats and name-node replies with commands, which are piled up in the queue because the DN cannot process them.\nThis can probably be solved with a smart command queue maintenance or by adjusting of heartbeat frequency with respect to the length of the queue, but will require more work and very thorough tuning.\n# Related to previous. Administrators will no longer be able to judge that a data-node is in trouble by just looking at its heartbeat interval.\n\nSo I would argue to keep HB processing in the main offerService loop, but rather separate the block report processing into a separate thread.\nIn general we should keep all heavy-weight operation like delete-blocks away from the offer service loop. They can be done in separate threads.\nDoes that make me a supporter of \"Option 3\"?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-03-04T02:28:37.271+0000","updated":"2009-03-04T02:28:37.271+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407747/comment/12678896","id":"12678896","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> Does that make me a supporter of \"Option 3\"?\nIt looks like. \n\nIt is a good point about loosing \"throttling\" and \"indiating to admin about slow datanodes\". But fundamentally that is not job of a heartbeat. Those are couple of useful things piggy backed on current heartbeats. Strictly, it is better to make HB report some number indicating backlog at the DataNode rather than delaying HB. HB should only only mean \"can this datanode be used or not\". \n\nThat said, I am fine with not having a seperate HB threads, as long as we are going to move hardware dependent expensive operations like deleting blocks out of offerservice/HB thread (here or in a new jira).\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-03-04T20:18:45.000+0000","updated":"2009-03-04T20:18:45.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407747/comment/12680343","id":"12680343","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Based on the discussions so far, here is a proposal:\n# DataBlockScanner will be enhanced to periodically check to see if the blocks on the disk matches blocks in memory.\n# Block list is compiled from disk and in-memory map.

And then for each suspicious block you reconcile it under a lock in order to prevent immediate modifications of the block state.\nTo simplify the algorithm you can completely drop the conditions reflecting the state of the block in the past when it was chosen as suspicious.
