The older splits are deleted to limit the size of the task logs. This means that you can't use their lengths to compute offsets because they aren't there any more. \n\nI'd propose an approach where the index file looks like:\n\nfile|offset\n\ndropping the length, so that the index can be written when the new split is started. This will preserve the current functionality and fix the problem, I believe.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-07-09T16:48:32.092+0000","updated":"2007-07-09T16:48:32.092+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12372276/comment/12511181","id":"12511181","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"{quote}\nI'd propose an approach where the index file looks like:\n\nfile|offset\n{quote}\n\n+1","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-07-09T17:19:41.588+0000","updated":"2007-07-09T17:19:41.588+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12372276/comment/12511182","id":"12511182","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bien","name":"bien","key":"bien","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Bieniosek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"So, why do we need offsets from the beginning of the logs?
