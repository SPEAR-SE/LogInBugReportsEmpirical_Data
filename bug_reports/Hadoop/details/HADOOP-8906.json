FsShell relies on the fact that globStatus will never return null for paths that contain pattern characters, and we could end up creating paths with pattern characters.  I checked trunk, and it turns out this test crashes globStatus internally.  Not crashing is nice, but we shouldn't be reporting null for paths with pattern characters.  Fortunately the fix is pretty easy.  We just need to check if GlobExpander returned more than one result which implies patterns were used and we should convert a result of null into an empty array in that case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-10-10T20:41:53.465+0000","updated":"2012-10-10T20:41:53.465+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12611052/comment/13473568","id":"13473568","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Good catch, Jason.

I'm eager to see the Jenkins results, although it seems the Jenkins build is stuck right now.\n\nAfter a closer look, I'm wondering if there's one more subtle difference between the old and new versions, this time when the user specifies a filter.  I think the old version will return null in the case of an non-globbed path that found a file but it didn't pass the specified filter.  It applies the filter as it searches before it checks for the empty-array-should-return-null case.  In the new version, it applies the specified filter *after* it checks for whether there are matches, and in this scenario there will be a match since the filter hasn't been applied yet.  I'm wondering if we should apply the filter before checking for an empty match array to align with the old behavior.  Granted it's odd to provide a non-globbed path that wouldn't pass the filter, so it's a corner-case.\n\nOtherwise everything looks great, pending Jenkins since it found some things in the last run that we missed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-10-11T03:16:10.326+0000","updated":"2012-10-11T03:16:10.326+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12611052/comment/13473865","id":"13473865","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

When an existing non-glob path is removed by the filter, then arguably maybe it should return empty array since it's not that the path doesn't exist but that the filter had no matches.  In essence, perhaps a user filter means the query is always a glob?

Maybe it would be more consistent to return empty instead of null in that case, but I was erring on the side of caution to maintain compatibility with the previous version's behavior.  It all comes down to what a result of null really means.  If it's being used to check for globs in the path then arguably we should continue to return null because someone could be using/abusing globStatus(path, falseFilter) to check for globs in a path even if the path exists in the filesystem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-10-11T16:05:53.811+0000","updated":"2012-10-11T16:05:53.811+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12611052/comment/13474297","id":"13474297","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
