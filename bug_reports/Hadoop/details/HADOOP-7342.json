Only the problem is NPE are not handled. We have seen in our tests, NPE can have bad impact on certain cases when disks go bad. \n\nIMO, this is the problem with JDK API. Instead of asking user to have these null checks everywhere for these calls, API should have been consistent with the return values.\n\nRegarding asserts, I have not put the messages for assertEquals only because this call will assert saying what is expected and actual values should be if it fails.

Unfortunately, the posix-style File.list() api returns null when it would reasonably be expected to throw IOException, causing NPE on the .length method call, which as a run-time exception isn't typically even looked for.\n\nRather than inject null-checking code with a conditional throw statement into every place like this, Bharath has suggested calling this new FileUtil method.
