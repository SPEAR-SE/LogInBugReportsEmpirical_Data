Contents of new blocks that are appended to a file is visible to clients as soon as the datanode reports the block to the namenode. This means that data is visible to clients even when the block metadata is not yet persisted on disk. This approach lets us avoid a fs-transaction into the edit log for every new block allocation.\n\n2. The block allocation for a file is persisted in the edit log when the file is closed.\n\n3. A new API FSDataOutputStream.sync() allows an application to make data persistent on disk even before the file is closed. The invocation of this API causes a transaction to be logged into the edits log to record the blocks that are currently allocated to the file. An application that is recording data to a log file will periodically invoke this API to ensure that the contents of the log file persist even if the application dies before closing the file.\n\n4. The FsShell utility has a new command that is invoked as \"bin/hadoop dfs -tail [-f] <filename>\". When the \"-f\" option is used, the FsShell utility will periodically poll for changes to the filesize.
