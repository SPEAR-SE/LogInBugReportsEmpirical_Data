It doesn't make sense to have 2 different ACL entries with the same scope + type + name.  We already enforce this on the NameNode side in {{AclTransformation#buildAndValidateAcl}}.  The validation logic rejects duplicate ACL entries, where two entries are considered duplicate if they have the same scope + type + name (even if the permissions are different).  If a user supplies duplicates like this, then we'll return an error.  This is regardless of whether the request comes in through the CLI, another interface, or programmatically through {{FileSystem}} method calls.  The enforcement is centralized on the server side.\n\nbq. So my preference is that we need to check for permissions separately whenever necessary, instead of including in equals() and hashCode().\n\nConsidering that the NameNode is enforcing the required uniqueness on the server side, let's not remove permissions from consideration in {{equals}} and {{hashCode}}.  There are 2 reasons for this:\n\n# As mentioned above, it's a public user-facing class, and most callers will have an intuition that {{equals}} and {{hashCode}} consider all data members.\n# I'm also anticipating that we'll want to include perms when the NameNode starts de-duplicating ACLs via the Global ACL Set as described in the design doc (HDFS-5620).  The implementation of this is likely to be sensitive to {{equals}} and {{hashCode}}, and we wouldn't want it to de-duplicate \"user:bruce:---\" based on seeing that \"user:bruce:rwx\" already exists in the live set.  If we remove perms from the {{AclEntry}} implementation here, then the NameNode is likely going to have to translate everything to some kind of alternative internal class with an {{equals}} and {{hashCode}} that includes perms.  This would require additional awkward data copying code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-15T00:47:43.105+0000","updated":"2014-01-15T00:47:43.105+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12687963/comment/13871616","id":"13871616","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Ok.
