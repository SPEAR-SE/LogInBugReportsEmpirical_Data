Also, another obvious optimization is to check whether the speculative execution flag is true up front.\n\nEven I noticed that few days back. But I thought HADOOP-2141 might fix that.  \n----\nWith HADOOP-2119, the calls to {{hasSpeculative()}} might reduce since we are optimizing the look-ups for finding the higher priority runnable tasks and totally avoiding speculative ones in these look-ups. So the check for speculative tasks will be done only if we have nothing else to run. But +1 to do it better than making all the checks all the time. \nFollowing are the parameters used for deciding {{TaskInProgress.hasSpeculative()}} :\n- activeTasks.size() <= MAX_TASK_EXECS _[seems ok]_\n- runSpeculative _[should be done earlier, but ok]_\n- averageProgress - progress >= SPECULATIVE_GAP _[seems ok]_\n- System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime >= SPECULATIVE_LAG :\n    This could be checked once in {{TaskInProgress.recomputeProgress()}} and a check will only be done in {{hasSpeculative()}} if the earlier check resulted as {{false}}. I guess we can still do better but my guess is that we cant totally avoid {{System.currentTimeMillis()}} in {{TaskInProgress.hasSpeculative()}}, no?\n- completes == 0 _[ok]_\n- !isOnlyCommitPending() :\n    May be a Map for _COMMIT_PENDING_ tasks can be maintained in _TaskInProgress_ and the only check made is {{commitPendingStatuses.size() > 0 && commitPendingStatuses.contains(taskId)}}.
