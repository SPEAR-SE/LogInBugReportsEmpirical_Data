This leads to a whole cascade of failing classes (next in chain is StringUtils).\n\nThe reason is that the release candidate build of Java 9 no longer has \"-ea\" in the version string and the system property \"java.version\" is now simply \"9\". This causes the following line to fail fatally:\n\n{code:java}\n  private static boolean IS_JAVA7_OR_ABOVE =\n      System.getProperty(\"java.version\").substring(0, 3).compareTo(\"1.7\") >=

You might know that with regard to migration to Java 9 I have a very hard standpoint. Sorry for being harsh, but at some point it gets disappointing when a lot of third party libraries use sun.misc.Unsafe everywhere, forget to add AccessController.doPrivileged, or spawn processes and do other stuff like broken checks in static initializers affecting applications and other  libraries that depend on it.\n\nbq. the whole code is outdated and no longer applicable,\n\nIt is already outdated in branch 2.7, because according to [~ajisakaa] the 2.7.x Hadoop release was done with a minimum of Java 7. So when updating your code to Java 7 back at that time, the check should have been replaced from the beginning. I know, sometimes you miss to fix such code when you update your pom.xml to have another minimum Java version! Nevertheless, such type of code is a no-go, and I am still walking around and arguing about such type of code, because it hinders the adoption of Java 9 - and especially the Apache Lucene people are really pushing all our users to move to Java 9 as soon as it is out (for security reasons in Elasticsearch/Solr and also for performance reasons with MappedByteBuffers). Here is my huge problem with this type of code:\n\n- Never ever write code in static analyzers that may break (in this case the hardcoded {{substring(0,2)}}).\n- Don't expect strings that come from the outside to conform to any syntax / string length you expect.\n\nIn that regard (I also see the Shell class and its usage everywhere as a big security risk), you should really fix the code - although in an outdated version. This is a serious issue, especially as hadoop-common-2.7 is still used in many projects. The problem is that any code that touches the Shell class (indirectly just by classloading) breaks! The fix is a one liner (the patch here is much too large). Just replace the whole line by a simple \"true\" and we are done, unrisky and well enough for a bugfix release.\n\nUwe\n\nP.S.: Most of the stuff in the Shell class can be done with java.nio.file APIs (including symlinks, or instead of calling \"df -h\" to get all mount points and their free space), there is no operating system shell needed anymore. This may already be partially fixed in later versions of Hadoop, I just say: I am not the first one complaining about that. I know from several other issues that this is seen very critical from 3rd parties. This would also make it easier for people to install or run tests on platforms like windows. I don't know, why a 3rd party library like hadoop-common should ever spawn child processes without asking security manager or give the user an option to do it without. That's what I am arguing about. -- And if the same class then also fails in its static initializer, causing a cascade of class-loading related problems, because the person who wrote the code did not ever think about an IndexOutOfBoundsException, I keep getting sarcastic, sorry.\n\nP.P.S.: What I write on twitter is unrelated to this issue and is my personal opinion!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","key":"thetaphi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2017-06-26T13:16:07.125+0000","updated":"2017-06-26T13:16:07.125+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13082308/comment/16063323","id":"16063323","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Is this worth fixing in 2.7.x given the general direction that 3.x (or 4.x?) will likely end up being the officially sanctioned \"Java 9\" compatible release?

It does not change any code/logic, it just replaces a function call by a constant value, which is constant anyways.\n\nI agree that the whole issue only affects Hadoop 2.7 and before, so I am sorry for initially arguing that also Hadoop 2.8 or 3.0 has the same problem. I should have checked the code, but I was not aware of any changes. As I am not a Hadoop developer, I did not checkout any code, I just looked at the source code as returned by my IDE fom Maven Central. Sorry for getting aggressive, but I hope you agree that code like we have seen here should have never been in Hadoop!\n\nFinally I just repeat: This is issue is not dircetly related to Java 9, the attached commit just fixes \"buggy code\": It misses to add bounds checks when parsing a string that is not controlled by Hadoop - coming from the outside. This may be fixed in Hadoop 2.8, but 2.7 is still under support and the commit logs show that a lot of stuff is committed to the 2.7 branch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thetaphi","name":"thetaphi","key":"thetaphi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thetaphi&avatarId=18956"},"displayName":"Uwe Schindler","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2017-06-27T11:53:30.532+0000","updated":"2017-06-27T11:54:27.960+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13082308/comment/16065899","id":"16065899","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Cleaned up a bunch of stuff in the description, including lowering the priority since Apache Hadoop 2.7 on JDK9 isn't a configuration that the community has particularly targeted as viable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2017-06-28T04:08:13.224+0000","updated":"2017-06-28T04:08:13.224+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13082308/comment/16066366","id":"16066366","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"[~aw] I know we don't support java 9 in hadoop itself, and will never do so in hadoop 2.7, but using the core libs for client-side operation is something more realistic as an initial deliverable.

We do not install Hadoop anywhere and we do not run Hadoop Clusters inside Apache Solr, we are just users using the client library (and parts of its tests, e.g. the MiniDFSCluster for testing - which works on Java 9). The used client library has a bug that breaks a component that uses it. So - as said before, I'd not backport anything complex, I'd just apply the bugfix simple patch that changes the static constant to \"true\" and all should be happy. There is no risk at all, as Hadoop 2.7 has a minimum requirement of Java 7, so the constant is \"true\".\n\nAs users of the hadoop client library: We just don't want to break our \"Java 9 compatible\" Solr Core that uses the Hadoop libraries for some authentication stuff and allows to store indexes on HDFS. Another problem why we don't necessarily want to upgrade Hadoop in stable Solr (6.x), because how behaves a newer Hadoop client when talking to an older version. So we can't just raise version number.\n\nWe don't tell our users that you can use Solr with Hadoop on Java 9, but Solr on its own should run with Java 9 and dependent libraries should not fail on classloading. So we have two possibilities:\n\n- Remove all of hadoop support from Solr Core (not a good idea)\n- Just fix the \"Shell\" class with a one-liner so it can actually just \"load\" successfully on Java 9 and not break other stuff (like StringUtils, Kerberos Auth,...). One possibility to do this is to fork hadoop-common in github and ship Solr with a patched version. But I don't like to do this!\n\nSo I would really hope that you could apply the simple one-liner patch!
