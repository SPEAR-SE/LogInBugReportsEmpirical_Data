I think it just fell off my radar.\n\nIt would be good to add a unit test for this.  I think the use case is roughly:\n\nConfiguration c1 = new Configuration();\nc1.set(\"foo\", \"bar\");\nConfiguratoin c2 = new Configuration(c1);\nassertEquals(c2.get(\"foo\"), \"bar\");\n\nIs that right?\n\nThe provided patch would fix this, but by setting all the values except \"foo\" twice: once when reloaded from resources and once when reloaded from overrides.  Perhaps it would be better to put all resource-loaded properties in a nested Properties instance that's inherited via 'new Properties(Properties)' and only store values set directly in a top-level Properties instance.  Or perhaps we should just set most of the values twice and not worry about it.
