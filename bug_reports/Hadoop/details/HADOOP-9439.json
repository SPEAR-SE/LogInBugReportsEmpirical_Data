McCabe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks, very thorough review.\n\nI fixed the naming of the parameters to getGroupsForUser and logError.  Although it didn't affect correctness, it certainly was very confusing.\n\nYou're right that {{GetStaticMethodID}} and {{FindClass}} throw exceptions on failure.  There is no need to throw another one (and it is probably actually harmful).  Thanks for finding that.  However, {{NewGlobalRef}} does not throw an exception, but merely returns {{NULL}} when you're out of memory.\n\nI will add a comment clarifying why we ignore exceptions in logError.\n\nI agree that we should probably just use the existing monitor lock from NativeIO.java.  That way, I don't have to modify that code.  I wasn't aware that there were other folks poking the user/group functions in Hadoop.  Right now, it looks like {{NativeIO#getUserName}} is only called from tests calling {{NativeIO#POSIX#getFstat}}, but of course that may change in the future.\n\nInvalid groups are a sore point for {{ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping}}.  If any invalid groups are associated with a user, the \"{{groups}}\" program will fail with a non-zero return code, and no information is returned.  For {{JniBasedUnixGroupsMapping}}, I would prefer to return the groups that were valid, rather than nothing at all.  I suppose this is debatable, though.  I can test creating such invalid groups.\n\nI understand that sometimes it's unnecessary, but I'd rather have {{DeleteLocalRef}} used for all allocations.  For one thing, in libhdfs, it really *is* necessary everywhere (the JNI invocation API never automatically disposes of Java references that are made in the invoking C code).  It confuses people when they copy a piece of code from one part of the source tree to another and it suddenly becomes incorrect.  For another thing, the spec only says that the JVM has to provide at least 16 local references at once, which is not very many at all.  It's only one line of overhead per Java reference, and {{DeleteLocalRef}} already ignores NULLs, so I'd rather just have a consistent style everywhere, than try to be clever.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

I don't see the point of putting all variable declarations on separate lines. Java allows declaration of variables on the same line as well\n\nThe point is that when a lot of people see {{int a, b, c = 0;}} they think that all three variables are getting set to 0, but in fact it's only {{c}} that is set. Putting on separate lines makes it more obvious -- probably not important if you expect mostly veteran C programmers to read the code, but given that a lot of folks in the Hadoop community rarely look at C, I figured it would be more obvious this way.\n\nIn Java, you always get a compile time error for accessing an uninitialized variable, whereas in C it's just a warning, which I'm certain we'll miss in the compile spew of a Hadoop build. So, probably better to explicitly initialize all the variables, whether on one line or multiple.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-06-18T23:54:08.319+0000","updated":"2013-06-18T23:54:08.319+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639219/comment/13687459","id":"13687459","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
