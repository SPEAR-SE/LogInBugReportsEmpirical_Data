Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Fei Hui!\n\nWelcome to the community and thanks for your contribution! I've taken the liberty to edit the JIRA with values for fields that we are used to. (Fix Version is set when the patch is merged. Target Version is set to the next expected release that would contain the fix. Description contains the problem)\n\nhttps://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute is a fairly verbose guide on how to contribute. Instead of making you read it in its entirety, I'd suggest uploading a patch file instead of github pull requests (because what happens to review discussions if Github.com was to fold tomorrow?)\n\nJust FYI, Allen rewrote the shell scripts for trunk (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9902) and he's the reigning expert in that area. I'll defer to his better judgement. Unfortunately those improvements were not backported fully into branch-2 (to explain any discrepancy you may be seeing)\n\nIt seems in trunk the discrepancy of multiple Xmx values is hired much more elegantly with [hadoop_add_param|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop-functions.sh#L830] . However to me your fix makes sense for branch-2. We shouldn't be appending {{-Xmx=512m}} indiscriminately.
