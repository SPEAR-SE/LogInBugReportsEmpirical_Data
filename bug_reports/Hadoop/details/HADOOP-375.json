The namenode puts the port in a (new) field of the DatanodeInfo object that it creates for every datanode. Later on, anyone wishing to contact the jetty on a specific datanode (say, for redirecting the user to a datanode containing a particular data block) can do so by looking at the port number obtained from the DatanodeInfo object (for e.g., LocatedBlock contains an array of DatanodeInfo objects where a given block can be found).

Since the webserver starts in a new thread, we should wait before doing getPort() (to avoid timing issues). Note that 'started' is set to false in the field initialization in StatusHttpServer. 'started' is set to true only when the webserver has successfully started up (towards the end of the 'start' method in StatusHttpServer). Note that if there was an exception while starting the webserver, it would throw an exception and 'started' would not be touched. Only after the exceptions are handled (e.g. a new port is found, etc.) will 'started' be set to true (after it 'breaks' out of the outermost 'while' loop inside 'start' method).\n\nThe wait(1) is can be replaced with Thread.sleep(1). I meant that and no issues with replacing that. The loop seems tight but I expect the webserver to start soon enough that it actually makes this loop not that tight (but in any case it could be replaced by Thread.sleep(100) or something).\n\nMakes sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2006-07-25T08:32:31.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-25T08:32:31.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12346410/comment/12423271","id":"12423271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Some more points:\nI think the timing issue requires to be handled when we allow for port roll-overs.
