Thanks for fixing this. A few comments below:\n\n- When you catch and swallow InterruptedException, you should call {{Thread.currentThread().interrupt()}} afterward, so that the interrupt status isn't lost\n\n----\n{code}\n+  /**\n+   * Watcher for waiting(connectionTimeout in milliseconds) to establish\n+   * connection with the zookeeper server.\n+   */\n{code}\nI don't think you need the parenthetical (\"connectionTimeout in milliseconds\") since you already specify that down below in the relevant javadoc.\n\n----\n- In the case that the ZK connection fails (eg ZK is just not listening) do we now have to wait for the full session timeout? I think the latch should fire on either SyncConnected or Disconnected events, not just on SyncConnected.\n- We probably want some kind of sanity check that we don't get any other kind of events in the ZKConnectionWatcher. Otherwise I'm afraid we might end up swallowing an event inadvertently, which could result in the elector hanging. In that case, we should also make sure that the \"authenticated\" message we get from a SASL-capable ZK is in the list of acceptable events.\n\n----\n- Nit: can you make ZKConnectionWatcher private, and move it to the bottom of the file? Also, I think zkConnectLatch can be made private.\n- Test nit: can you please use the {{GenericTestUtils.assertExceptionContains()}} utility to check the exception? I've found that the JUnit \"expected exception\" trick isn't great, since it catches all sorts of exceptions instead of just the targeted error you want to verify\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-06-01T22:21:21.579+0000","updated":"2012-06-01T22:21:21.579+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12558603/comment/13288499","id":"13288499","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks Todd for the comments.

I'm afraid there might have been a race in the old version -- if multiple events came in to the registration watcher, it might have missed forwarding the second to the main watcher, which could produce an inconsistent state. I changed it around a bit so that the existing watcher wrapper takes care of the latching.\n\nIf you're able to reproduce this in a real cluster, can you give it a try? I've never seen the problem in practice, but my patch passes the unit test you added.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-11-10T01:36:16.850+0000","updated":"2012-11-10T01:36:16.850+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12558603/comment/13494557","id":"13494557","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Yeah, you are absolutely correct. I had missed the case of receiving multiple events in between wait completion and watcher registration. \n\nI also could see a very corner case like: \nRecevived the ZK connection event, immediately before the watcher registration, say ZK got Disconnected the event will be received to the old watcher and will never execute this event. In this case would be still in Synconnected and could go to an inconsistent state. I have tried this scenario in my cluster, but not able to re-produce the same, finally I just tried keeping debug points and has re-produced. Your approach of queuingup the events is fine and this is executing all the events sequentially without missing anything.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2012-11-20T18:30:03.889+0000","updated":"2012-11-20T18:30:03.889+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12558603/comment/13511170","id":"13511170","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=atm","name":"atm","key":"atm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=atm&avatarId=14136"},"displayName":"Aaron T.
