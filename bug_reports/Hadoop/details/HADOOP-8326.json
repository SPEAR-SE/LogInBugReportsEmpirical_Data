This is because when we do a fork/exec through the default container executor most of the time we will also do a setsid on them, so that the session id is different from the original.  This also makes it so that the process group id is different.  We have effectively made these processes daemons.  They even end up having init as their PPID when we are done.\n\nI think the best way to handle this is to be conservative about what we kill off so that we kill off everything in our own process group, and then also any daemon java processes owned by the current user, and that in their arguments they have a reference to the current working directory in some way.  This matches all of the errant processes that I have seen on the build machines.

I don't think we are seeing the test failures we saw before because all of the mini clusters use ephemeral ports now.\n\nI would like to check in this change but I am a bit nervous about doing so because I may be killing off more then I should.  I am killing off everything in the same process group.  So if I run {code}test-patch.sh ... | less{code} less is getting killed too.  I don't really know for sure if this will cause problems for Jenkins or not, it depends on how Jenkins is launching test-patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-05-31T20:02:03.714+0000","updated":"2012-05-31T20:02:03.714+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12553192/comment/13411707","id":"13411707","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I don't really see this happening.
