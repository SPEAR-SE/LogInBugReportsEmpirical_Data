This is used to prevent hadoop-env.sh from being re-read.  This protection makes sense if you have, e.g., FOO_OPT=\"$FOO_OPTS blah\" in this file.  But with the current state of the world, there's quite a few things going wrong here:\n\n1. We don't protect the other *-env.sh files like we do hadoop-env.sh.  i.e., yarn-env.sh will gets re-read multiple times.\n2. This only works correctly because the vars in hadoop-env.sh are also exported.... which is probably the wrong thing to do as well.\n3. Now that there are more than just vars in *-env.sh, the system really does need to re-read *-env.sh to pick those up.\n\nSome potential solutions worth exploring:\n\n* What happens if we no longer export anything in *-env.sh and re-read them at every command run like we do with the other files?  (This brings Hadoop in line with most other OS utilities.)  One side effect: users upgrading to trunk would need to also remove the export lines as part of upgrading.\n* If we protect all the *-env.sh and move user defined functions to a new file?  This has a lot of potential!  One big problem is what to do about YARN_OPTS.
