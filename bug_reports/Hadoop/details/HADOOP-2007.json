When submitting a job as user 'fred', the job.xml file gets created correctly as /tmp/*hadoop-fred*/mapred/system/<job_id>/job.xml, but the JobInProgress constructor appears to use the incorrect path of /tmp/*hadoop-hadoop*/mapred/system/<job_id>/job.xml for the copyToLocalFile operation.  This results in an exception because the job.xml file does not exist under /tmp/hadoop-hadoop.\n\nI think the incorrect path gets created on line 133 in JobInProgress.java right before the call to copyToLocalFile.  If I hardcode the correct path (just to test my theory) of \"/tmp/hadoop-fred/mapred/system\" in place of the call to default_conf.getSystemDir(), the job kicks off and runs to completion as the user 'fred' with hadoop/hdfs running as the user 'hadoop'.\n\nHere's a portion of the output when the job is submitted by user 'fred':\n\n[fred@hdm01 ~]$ hadoop --config /usr/local/hadoop/conf jar /usr/local/hadoop/current/hadoop-0.14.1-examples.jar wordcount mytest/input/data output2\n07/10/07 17:52:14 INFO mapred.FileInputFormat: Total input paths to process : 62\norg.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: java.io.IOException: /tmp/hadoop-hadoop/mapred/system/job_200710071751_0002/job.xml: No such file or directory\n        at org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileUtil.copy(FileUtil.java:138)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.copyToLocalFile(FileSystem.java:803)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.copyToLocalFile(FileSystem.java:784)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobInProgress.<init>(JobInProgress.java:134)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker.submitJob(JobTracker.java:1479)\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"105903","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Jobs use incorrect path to job.xml for different users","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rllynch","name":"rllynch","key":"rllynch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan Lynch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rllynch","name":"rllynch","key":"rllynch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan Lynch","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (Nahant Update 5) - AMD64\nJRE: java full version \"1.6.0_02-b05\"","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12379837/comment/12533020","id":"12533020","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Please configure mapred.system.dir to be a constant and somewhere outside of /tmp.
