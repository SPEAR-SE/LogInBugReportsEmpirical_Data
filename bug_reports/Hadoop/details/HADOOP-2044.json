is different from the global FSNamesystem lock).\nThe bug was that startFileInternal() modified sortedLeases  with the global lock but without the leases lock.\n# completeFile() or getAdditionalBlock() cannot rely on that they always deal with a file under construction, because if client fails to remove the lease, \nthe file is automatically converted into a regular file, and modifications of such files are not allowed.\n\nI have 2 comments, which do not address the correctness of the patch but rather intended to make code more understandable.\n# instead of using the \"instaceof INodeFileUnderConstruction\" operator it is better to define an virtual method INode.isFileUnderConstruction().\n# All modifications of the FSNamesystem.leases member are performed under the global FSNamesystem lock.\nWhile modifications of FSNamesystem.sortedLeases  are done under the lock associated with the FSNamesystem.leases, which\nis correct but unintuitive.
