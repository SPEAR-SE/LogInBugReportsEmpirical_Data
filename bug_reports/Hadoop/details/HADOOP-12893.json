As an example, one could have some third party code bundled in the test sources and produce a binary distribution tarball with no test files in it. Similarly, if the main classes include some third party work but the tests do not, then the main jar and the test jar would be different.

I can certainly understand the reasoning of an incremental approach that starts with getting us out of violating the licenses of third parties and works towards compliance with ASF Policy.\n\nI would be concerned if \"follow-on\" turned into \"next release\" perpetually; having releases blocked provides a kind of motivation that little else can. We need to end up in a place where everything we distribute meets ASF Policy, but folks generally understand that this can take some time.\n\nKeep in mind that release voting is majority, so it might be worth a straw poll of how the PMC would vote if a given release met the requirements for third party licenses but did not yet meet ASF policy on license notifications.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=busbey","name":"busbey","key":"busbey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233"},"displayName":"Sean Busbey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-05-13T23:41:32.407+0000","updated":"2016-05-13T23:41:32.407+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12947416/comment/15284066","id":"15284066","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~busbey].

That will be simple, just wanna make sure before I make the change.\n\nbq. There's also a few copies of the GPL and LGPL still in LICENSES. This content was supposed to be pulled from the Licenses tab on the spreadsheet, apparently not?\nThe script only groups from the dependencies tab, and list the license name currently. After that I went to the links, and copied the license and 80-char-wrapped it. I may have forgotten to remove the GPL part from CDDL+GPL... :(\nI guess one more automation we can do is to paste that into the {{License text}} column and automate.\n\nSo, LGPL will be gone once we get rid of jdiff.\nGPL should be gone since they're all CDDL+GPL w/ CPE.
