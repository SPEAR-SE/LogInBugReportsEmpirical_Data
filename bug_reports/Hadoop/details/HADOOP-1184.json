The indention of the patch seems not the same as the requirement.\n2. In isReplicationInProgress, in addiion to to check if neededReplications contains a block, shall we also check if the pendingReplication queue does not contain the block?\n3. In containingNodeList, the parameter numReplicas works as an output. Is it clearer if we create a static class as the return class contaning both a datanode list and an integer? Also since the variable nonCommisiionedNodeList now contains decommissioning nodes, it would be better to change its name.\n4. In TestDecommission, the test case for decomissioning a node that has the only replica of a block does not 100% guarateen that the decomissioning node contains any block. A more determininstic testcase is better. One solution could be first start a minicluster with one datanode and create a file, then add one more datanode and decomission the old one.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-04-27T20:37:44.951+0000","updated":"2007-04-27T20:37:44.951+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366160/comment/12492741","id":"12492741","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Thanks Hairong for the review comments.  \n\n1. Fixed indentation in a few places.\n2. Yes, I agree with you that we need to check the pendingReplication queue too. I added this change. This was a good catch! Thanks.\n3. I changed the variable name from nonCommisiionedNodeList to nodeList. I did not create a static class (yet) for the return values. If you feel strongly about it, then I can do it. Please let me know.\n4. I agree that the test should pick the a node that has some blocks to be decommissioned. Without changing MiniCluster, one way to go about it is to make getFileHints() return the hostname and the port of the datanode on which the block resides. The test can decommission only that node on which a block resides. Currently, getFileHints() returns only the hostname of the datanode. As part of hadoop-1296, we can make the getFileHints() return the port number. And then I can modify the test to decommission a node only if it has blocks on it. I will add this comment to hadoop-1296.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2007-04-30T18:25:43.107+0000","updated":"2007-04-30T18:25:43.107+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12366160/comment/12492970","id":"12492970","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"The previous patch did not apply cleanly to trunk anymore because FSNamesystem has been split into multiple files.
