I committed it with the following changes:\n\n1. TaskStatus is not a public class, so a public method in another public class should not return it.  For now, I just made the method package-private, since the jsp pages are compiled in the same package.  Longer-term we should probably copy this information into the TaskReport, the public version of a TaskStatus, or something.  This information should be available to other applications through a public API, and through an RPC in the JobSubmissionProtocol.\n\n2. I renamed JobTracker.getallTaskStatus to be getTaskStatuses, like the JobInProgress method, and also using correct camel-case.\n\n3. Rather than add a new TaskStatus contructor, leaving an old one that is no longer called, I removed the old one.  We don't need dead code around.  This is package-private, so we can be sure that no code outside of this package uses the old constructor.\n\n4. The patch removed some inter-method whitespace.
