Here there are events from the tracker which was lost upon restart. When the task-tracker (re)connects it re-sizes its own _task-completion-event_ list. Hence the tracker retains the missing map's events. After some time the jobtracker finds out that the tracker is lost and kills all the maps that were run on the lost tracker and re-executes them. The tracker will have the _task-completion-event_ list like \n{code}\n1. SUC m1-t1\n2. SUC m2-t2\n3. SUC m3-t1\n4. SUC m4-t2\n5. KIL m1-t1\n6. KIL m3-t1\n7. SUC m1-t2\n8. SUC m3-t2\n{code}\nThe reducer takes _m1-t1_ and starts pulling map output from _t1_. Note that when the reducer fails on _m1_ it checks that _m1_ is _OBSOLETE_ and then ignores it. The test case times out because it takes fair amount of time (~3mins) to fail once. So this doesnt look like a bug but a limitation. The reason this issue is not commonly seen  is because the reducer actually starts late and hence the tracker has the latest updates which prevents the reducer to take up maps from the lost tracker. I could easily reproduce this problem when the reducer was scheduled early. \n----\nOne thing that can be done here is to make _num-reducers=0_ as the test case doesnt actually require reducers. But actually its better to have reducers as it makes the testcase strict and hence better. So if we decide to keep reducers then there should be some way to control the timeout (~3min --> ~5 secs).

Upon restart (HADOOP-3245), the reducer doesn't clear this list. The problem arises (on a very small cluster e.g. test cases) when a map completes and this completion event is not flushed to the history file (in buffer)  and the tracker on which it ran gets lost. In such a case the (new) JobTracker has no idea about the map and since the reducer's list is stale, it takes some time to figure out that the map location is bad and use the other (re-executed by the _new_ JobTracker) one.  Note than on a large cluster, this should not be an issue as, upon failure, new maps from different host will be tried and after sometime the new location for such (dangling) maps will be passed by the JobTracker. We have 2 choices\n- stale data : This can help in cases where a tracker has not yet joined but the data (map's output) is still valid/available. The drawback being the case where a tracker is lost and data becomes unavailable. In such a case the location will be retried again and again until the (newly re-executed) map's output is pulled from some other tracker. Here the time will be wasted in pulling map output from a lost tracker/node and waiting for the (dangling) maps (from that node) to be re-executed.\n- fresh data : This can help in cases where few trackers go down. The drawback being that trackers that are up and ready to serve the map output will be ignored since they are yet to join.
