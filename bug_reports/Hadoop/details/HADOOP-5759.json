The number ofsplits remain the same before, but the possibility of scheduling them on the rack where they reside is slightly reduced because we look only at those hosts where this block belongs.

It is possible to enhance this patch to create a new data strcture called rackToNodes at the very beginning. It can be populated by iterating through all the blocks at the very beginning.\n\nAgreed. However, Amareshwari and I discussed this offline and we are not sure if we want to build this rackToNodes  before getMoreSplits method as it would mean calling getBlockLocations for all the blocks twice -- once to build the rackToNodes and once in getMoreSplits to build the blockInfo maps. Could we incrementally build this map in getMoreSplits. This would have the disadvantage of having incomplete information for the first few splits.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-05-25T10:34:57.712+0000","updated":"2009-05-25T10:34:57.712+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424269/comment/12712948","id":"12712948","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Patch adding rackToNodes map incrementally.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-05-26T10:38:50.531+0000","updated":"2009-05-26T10:38:50.531+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424269/comment/12712949","id":"12712949","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"test-patch result:\n{noformat}\n     [exec]\n     [exec] +1 overall.\n     [exec]\n     [exec]     +1 @author.
