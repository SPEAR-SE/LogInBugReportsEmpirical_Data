The logging was added back in the .20 days (by me) because it can be exceedingly hard to debug security issues.  On a number of occasions, we had no idea kerberos/authentication/etc errors were occurring because something was gobbling the exceptions and/or going into a retry loop and appeared hung.  Not logging IOExceptions effectively renders the logging useless because everything interesting (security related) is an IOException.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-10-03T21:44:49.631+0000","updated":"2013-10-03T21:44:49.631+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672191/comment/13786670","id":"13786670","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~daryn],\n\nI should have explained it more clearly.\n\nDuring in-house testing, we (hortonworks) have observed a lot of these warnings when doing distcp in secure clusters.

Like code that loops w/o logging the exception that triggered a retry, code that swallows an exception, code that catches and throws a generic \"something failed\" exception, etc.\n\nIf it's a debug level, then the logging becomes worthless - it's not possible to retroactively enable debug logging to analyze race conditions or transient errors.  Debug is too voluminous to enable for catching problems in production.\n\nPerhaps a middle of the road solution is to create a new logger instance for doas, named with a \".doAs\" suffix to the ugi class.
