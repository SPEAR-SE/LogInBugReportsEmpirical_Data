This turned out to be because the linker is removing the dependencies on libz and libsnappy at link-time because the libraries in question are not used in the simple probe code generated by the AC_COMPUTE_NEEDED_DSO m4 macro.\n\nSo my fix is modify the AC_COMPUTE_NEEDED_DSO to take another parameter that copies the given argument's text into the C program. Then, in the call to AC_COMPUTE_NEEDED_DSO, we can use this additional parameter, to include, in the generated C code, an actual library function call for each library. This prevents the linker from removing the linkage to the desired libraries.\n\nMy gcc and ldd version information are given below:\n\n{code}\neugene@latitude:~/hadoop-common$ gcc --version\ngcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu3) 4.6.3\nCopyright (C) 2011 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.
