Sure, they mention it, but in all the simple (no separator) examples, they don't seem to take into account that streaming may inconsistently decide whether the whole line is the key, or just up to the first tab, should one occur. This means that some records might be sorted differently as compared to others based on whether or not there's a tab?\n\nHere's a very simple pair of examples, that to the naive, should produce the same output, but do not:\n\n> [hod] (marco) >> run dfs -fs local -cat str-tabs\n> a       1\n> b       3\n> a       4\n> \n> [hod] (marco) >> run dfs -put str-tabs str-tabs\n> \n> [hod] (marco) >> run jar hadoop-streaming.jar -input str-tabs -output str-tabs.out -mapper /bin/cat -reducer /bin/cat     \n> [blah blah blah]\n> \n> [hod] (marco) >> run dfs -cat str-tabs.out/part-00000\n> a       4\n> a       1\n> b       3\n\nCompare to this negative-test:\n> [hod] (marco) >> run dfs -fs local -cat str-notabs\n> a 1\n> b 3\n> a 4\n> \n> [hod] (marco) >> run dfs -put str-notabs str-notabs\n> \n> [hod] (marco) >> run jar hadoop-streaming.jar -input str-notabs -output str-notabs.out -mapper /bin/cat -reducer /bin/cat\n> [blah blah blah]\n> \n> [hod] (marco) >> run dfs -cat str-notabs.out/part-00000\n> a 1\n> a 4\n> b 3\n> \n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12377872","id":"12377872","filename":"patch-2806.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-03-14T05:12:37.810+0000","size":3203,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12377872/patch-2806.txt"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"105532","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Streaming has no way to force entire record (or null) as key","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=menicosia","name":"menicosia","key":"menicosia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marco Nicosia","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=menicosia","name":"menicosia","key":"menicosia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marco Nicosia","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12388289/comment/12578613","id":"12578613","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"If there is no tab in the line, entire line is read as key and value is null. \nThis behavior should be fine if document that.
