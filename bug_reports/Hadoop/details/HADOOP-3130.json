This frequency of polling for map completion events is same as the heartbeat-interval (which depends on the cluster size). For e.g., if cluster size is of 500 nodes it is going to be 10 seconds. Now the reason for the order of minutes delay in getting map completion events could be that the map is not complete yet (it's still in COMMIT_PENDING or RUNNING), or, the JobTracker is busy and is discarding RPCs. To ascertain the latter, you should take a look at the reducer's host tasktracker logs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-03-30T08:36:20.701+0000","updated":"2008-03-30T08:36:20.701+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392616/comment/12583455","id":"12583455","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=runping","name":"runping","key":"runping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Runping Qi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\nIn this particular case, all the maps had finished for sure since lots of other reducers had finished.\nThere was no map task failure.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=runping","name":"runping","key":"runping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Runping Qi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-03-30T16:02:56.147+0000","updated":"2008-03-30T16:02:56.147+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392616/comment/12583519","id":"12583519","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"What is the configuration (number of nodes, number of maps/reducers,  number of jobs running simultaneously etc).

This should be augmented with your suggestion on accounting for the shuffle progress.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-04-01T16:55:43.111+0000","updated":"2008-04-01T16:55:43.111+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392616/comment/12585502","id":"12585502","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Runping, could you please try things out with this patch?

A minor point. Since UNIT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT is private final, the following code segment seems redudant: ...\nThe reason for doing the check is that  _unit-connect-timeout_ = 0 and _total-timeout_ > 0 will result into infinite loop. Since users can change unit-connect-timeout (and recompile), I think its safe to guard against such cases and fail early.\nbq. Also, you need to test whether the ioe is due to connection timeout. ...\nWhat should be the right behaviour in case of non connection-timeout exceptions? Surely retrying (w/o any penalty) is not a good option since that will lead to longer waits (may be infinite). \n- One way would be to decrement the total-time left (so that the loop termination is guaranteed) and LOG the type of exception encountered. That is treat it like a connection-timeout exception.\n- A bit more complex way would be to discriminate the penalty incurred in each case. For example, decrement _unit-connect-timeout/2_ in case of non connect-timeout exceptions and decrement _unit-connect-timeout_ otherwise.\n- Another more complex way would be to tolerate some failures (w/o penalty) for the non-connect-timeout exceptions. \n----\nFor now I think its okay to keep it simple.  Note that the reducer will not get killed if one meta-connect attempt fails, it requires a bunch of them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-15T04:46:37.809+0000","updated":"2008-04-15T04:46:37.809+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392616/comment/12588908","id":"12588908","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=runping","name":"runping","key":"runping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Runping Qi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bg Since users can change unit-connect-timeout (and recompile), \n\nHow can you possibly prevent the problem caused by user changing code and recompile?\n\n In case of exception that is not connection timeout, I think the right behavior is to re-throw the exception.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=runping","name":"runping","key":"runping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Runping Qi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-15T05:27:26.355+0000","updated":"2008-04-15T05:27:26.355+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392616/comment/12588987","id":"12588987","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Removed the check.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-15T09:14:24.196+0000","updated":"2008-04-15T09:14:24.196+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392616/comment/12588990","id":"12588990","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bq.
