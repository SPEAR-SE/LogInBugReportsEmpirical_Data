However, even if the \n> {{TokenCache}} isn't going to erroneously call the method anymore, I feel \n> there is still value in having {{buildDTServiceAuthority}} throw on invalid \n> input instead of returning an invalid value.  Otherwise, an invalid return \n> value will only cause an error to crop up someplace else.\nWhat you are stating above definitely makes sense in trunk - but in a sustaining release it seems better to make minimal changes to fix bugs?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnvijoe","name":"johnvijoe","key":"johnvijoe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John George","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-01T21:40:09.767+0000","updated":"2011-09-01T21:40:09.767+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12521082/comment/13095654","id":"13095654","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"The method {{build(D)elegation(T)okenServiceAuthority}} is specifically meant for use by tokens.

The point is that the methods buildDTService and buildDTAuthority in SecurityUtil are public utility methods but are not handling the invalid input well. In some cases they do return empty string host, but not consistently. I think better approach is to make that behavior consistent. In most common case when these methods are called with an invalid input, the caller code doesn't really care about what they return. For example, calling buildDTService for har file system.

The token methods are called in many other places that cannot tolerate an empty string.  Allowing an empty string to be returned for invalid input in _any_ other context will result in onerous exceptions like those being fixed, unusable tokens, or silent token renewal failures.\n\nThe root issue is that {{TokenCache.obtainTokensForNamenodes}} calls {{getCanonicalServiceName}} to use as the key for the credentials map.  {{getCanonicalServiceName}} is expected to return the \"ip:port\" authority.  The {{HarFileSystem}} has no or an invalid authority, because it has no tokens, so it relied on the low-level token methods to return an empty string on bad input.  It should never have gotten that far, so John made it return an empty string immediately instead of relying on bad behavior in the low-level token methods.\n\nIn effect, har now behaves exactly the same way as it does in 204 w/o relying on bugs.

If that failed, just return the unresolved host.\n\nNathan and I discussed, and here's our recommendation:\n\nThe real problem is that a filesystem has no means of signifying that it does not have tokens.  Logically, a filesystem with no tokens should not have a service name for its non-existent token.  Perhaps getCanonicalServiceName should return null if the filesystem does not support tokens.  The TokenCache can skip that filesystem while getting tokens.  Null avoids a conflict with any valid credentials key, including empty string.\n\nThe solution will be similar to John's earlier patch.  Instead of har returning an empty string service, it will return null.  The token cache will skip filesystems that return a null service.  The filesystem base class will return null if the uri has no authority.  I think this covers all use cases with <10 LOC.\n\nThe NPE in the token method will be changed into a more reasonable exception in the ip->host change.  However, these exceptions won't be a problem if har returns a null service, instead of calling the methods with bad input that triggers the exception.\n\nThoughts? If this is not acceptable, what are the sticking points?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-14T00:58:40.761+0000","updated":"2011-09-14T00:58:40.761+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12521082/comment/13104480","id":"13104480","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Yes.

But as it is, this method is not returning anything useful for HARFileSystem. Therefore it is not a big risk to return null for this method.\n\nSummary of a discussion with Nathan:\n  SecurityUtil APIs should be fixed. Throwing a checked exception might cause backward compatibility issues and returning an empty string may have an issue that some user code may be parsing the service assuming it is ip:port. Although the API doesn't gaurantee a specific service format but in hadoop it has been assumed to be \"ip:port\"\n So we have two options:\n  1) A very conservative option to return \":0\", which is the current behavior in certain cases of invalid input.\n  2) Throw IllegalArgumentException which is better than NPE and is semantically clearer.\n\n  \n  ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jnp","name":"jnp","key":"jnp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jitendra Nath Pandey","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-09-14T23:53:25.163+0000","updated":"2011-09-14T23:53:25.163+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12521082/comment/13105050","id":"13105050","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"+1 for current patch.\n\nAs far as the two options, I'd prefer throwing the IllegalArgumentException instead of tripping the NPE. This seems cleaner than an NPE and allows us to catch errors during the setup of the service rather than limping along with a bogus service name.\nThe current patch doesn't do this but I'm ok with doing that in a separate jira since it's not required to fix the problem with HAR. \n\nI think it would be a good idea to file an additional jira to take another look at the visibility of the security utils and things like getCanonicalService. Doesn't seem like these should be fully public. Seems like a good activity for trunk.\n\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-15T01:36:32.965+0000","updated":"2011-09-15T01:36:32.965+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12521082/comment/13105096","id":"13105096","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnvijoe","name":"johnvijoe","key":"johnvijoe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John George","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HADOOP-7638 filed.
