If it's a directory, then s3n always returns 0 for mtime.  This is also true of s3a.  I don't believe there are currently any plans in progress to change this behavior.\n\nThe expected atomicity semantics of implementing directory mtime are more challenging to implement against a blob store compared to a traditional file system or HDFS.  If a new file or sub-directory gets created under a directory, then users have an expectation that the corresponding update to mtime at the parent folder is atomic with respect to the file/directory creation operation.  On HDFS, we can take a central lock at the NameNode to do all of the metadata manipulations as a transaction.  For a blob store, this is multiple HTTP operations on different blob keys, and those multiple operations do not execute as an atomic transaction.\n\nThe Azure file system does provide mtime on directories, but it does not provide atomicity of the mtime updates.  (I just mention this to demonstrate that the behavior is not always consistent across different file system implementations.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-02-24T17:52:17.321+0000","updated":"2016-02-24T17:52:17.321+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12942887/comment/15166797","id":"15166797","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jagdishk","name":"jagdishk","key":"jagdishk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jagdish Kewat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks [~cnauroth] for sharing the details.

However in case of frequently updating directory contents that won't work. \nFor that case one needs to dig deeper in the directory / sub-directories and determine mtime of each file and finally return the max value as mtime of the directory, however, that would be an expensive operation, particularly in case of huge directories / subdirectories.\n\nFor now the workaround seems to be working for me.
