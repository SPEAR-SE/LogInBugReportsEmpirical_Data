The client used to time out, but, when servers got slow and clients retried, it led to server meltdown.  Think of this another way, if the call were local, not remote, should it time out?  At the RPC layer, nothing exceptional has happened: both ends are still up, responding to pings, etc.  So I don't see the current behavior as obviously wrong.  If the service hangs, and clients depend on that service, then clients will hang too.\n\nThat said, there may be a case, with non-singleton services, where a service could get hung and the client might reasonably retry a different service.  That doesn't currently apply much to Hadoop.  I can find only two protocols where clients talk to peers rather than superiors (InterDatanodeProtocol and ClientDatanodeProtocol).  In these cases, if the remote end were to hang indefinitely, its not clear what the client should do.  It would probably be bad, so perhaps we should add a way to time things out in these specific cases.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-07-31T18:12:43.813+0000","updated":"2008-07-31T18:12:43.813+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401427/comment/12618956","id":"12618956","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_l","name":"steve_l","key":"steve_l","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Yes, retries in this situation would not be ideal.

Shall I close this issue as INVALID?\n\nIf retry load is an issue then the whole client retry operations in TaskTracker and DataNode need to be looked at. There's a sleep, with the sleep time hard coded in the source. Which means that if the whole datacentre is synchronzied -as you get if the power gets toggled and they all boot up at the same time, there's a risk that all the nodes in the datacentre will hit the tracker/namenode simultaneously. Even exponential backoff doesnt work if the clocks are fully synchronized. it helps, but a bit of jitter is needed too just to round things off.
