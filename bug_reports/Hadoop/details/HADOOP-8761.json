True, it's incompatible yet correct behavior. I guess our options are codify the bad behavior forever, or fix it now.\n\nSince this is client-side code, we could do something like\n# in 2.1.0, add %s and leave %b giving bytes, with a stderr message that %b will change in a future release.\n# in 2.2.0, change %b to give blocks and remove the stderr message.\n\nbq. True, it's incompatible yet correct behavior.\n\nI'm a little skeptical that \"correct\" with respect to POSIX stat(2) is significant here. The \"blocks\" used in {{struct stat}} are very different from the \"blocks\" in HDFS; POSIX blocks are fixed size, atomically written [1], and the block size is a legacy feature (hardcoded to 512 bytes which is not the underlying size of anything anymore). By contrast HDFS blocks are variable size, nonatomic, and are much larger than POSIX blocks.\n\nI agree that exposing the blocksize (and the blockcount) is a pretty valuable feature, but there's a lot of caveats.  Just off the top of my head: a single file can have multiple blocksizes.\n\n[1] blocks aren't guaranteed to be atomic by the POSIX spec AFAIK, but as a practical matter modern implementations are atomic at some blocksize between 512 and 4096 bytes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-09-04T22:05:43.156+0000","updated":"2012-09-04T22:05:43.156+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606085/comment/14525352","id":"14525352","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This patch has been rebased and renamed for test-patch process for the bug bash.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2015-05-02T16:59:51.672+0000","updated":"2015-05-02T16:59:51.672+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606085/comment/14525460","id":"14525460","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\\\\\n\\\\\n| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | pre-patch |  14m 46s | Pre-patch trunk compilation is healthy. |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | @author |   0m  0s | The patch does not contain any @author tags. |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | tests included |   0m  0s | The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
