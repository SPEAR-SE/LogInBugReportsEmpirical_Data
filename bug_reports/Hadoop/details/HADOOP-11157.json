This will be kind of scatter-brained, sorry:\n\n1) related to shutdown\n- a) the ExpiredToken is shut down after the ZKDelegationTokenSecretManager's curator, which causes an exception to be thrown and the process to exit.  This can be addressed by shutting down the ExpiredToken thread before the curator.\n- b) even with a), the ExpiredTokenThread is interrupted by AbstractDelegationTokenSecretManager.closeThreads...if the ExpiredTokenThread is currently rolling the master key or expiring tokens in ZK, the interruption will cause the process to exit.  It seems like this can be addressed by holding the noInterruptsLock while the ExpiredTokenThread is not sleeping (should be waiting), but I'm not sure if we want to go that route.  Perhaps alternatively we could deal with the interruption by checking if its expected (i.e. if running is false).  One issue is that approach is that the ZKDelegationTokenSecretManager functions called from the ExpiredTokenThread don't throw or keep the interrupt flag, they just catch the exceptions and possibly throw them as a runtime exception.  I'm not sure if we can just swallow the InterruptedException -- presumably we need the ZK state to be in some reasonable state in case the process restarts?  Of course we have no tests of that...\n2) not related to shutdown\n- a) if you run TestZKDelegationTokenSecretManager#testCancelTokenSingleManager in a loop it will fail eventually.  It looks like the issue is how we deal with asynchronous ZK updates.\nConsider the following code:\n{code}\ntoken = createToken\ncancelToken(token)\nverifyToken(token){code}\ncancelToken will delete it from the local cache and delete the znode.  But the curator client will get the create child message (in the listener thread) and add the token back.  If that happens after cancelToken, the token will be added back until the listener thread gets the cancel message again.  (It also just occurred to me that this is happening in two different threads but some of the structures, like the currentToken, aren't thread safe).  The usual way to prevent this is to assign versions to the znodes so you can track whether you are getting an update for an old version.  I don't know how to deal with it in this case where deletes are a possibility and there doesn't appear to be a master that is responsible for writing (i.e. what is preventing some other SecretManager from recreating the token just after delete -- how would versions help with that?).  This may affect the keyCache as well as the tokenCache.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gchanan","name":"gchanan","key":"gchanan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gregory Chanan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-10-28T22:07:07.934+0000","updated":"2014-10-28T22:07:07.934+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745115/comment/14187594","id":"14187594","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gchanan","name":"gchanan","key":"gchanan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gregory Chanan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Here's another issue I think could happen, but have no test for:\n1) set up two SecretManagers sharing zk\n2) get a delegation token from one\n3) use on both\n4) renew on one around token expiration time\n\nThen, both SecretManagers will run the token expiration code and possibly expire the newly renewed token.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gchanan","name":"gchanan","key":"gchanan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gregory Chanan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-10-28T22:20:21.044+0000","updated":"2014-10-28T22:20:21.044+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745115/comment/14189205","id":"14189205","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Uploading new patch.\n\nSummary of changes :\n* Changed the listener threadpool to a SingleThreadedExecutor so that ZK watch updates are always processed in the order it is received.\n* add/update/delete of a token used to updated the localCache first and then make changes in ZK.
