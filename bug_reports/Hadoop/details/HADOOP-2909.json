In jira, I'd like to propose the following changes to IPC idle management:\n1. Add data structures to the IPC server that keep track of outstanding requests.\n2. IPC server does not close a connection that has outstanding requests/replies even when it has no IO activities for a while.\n3. The default client-side max idle time should be in several minutes not 1 second. \n4. The server-side max idle time should be greater than the client-side max idle time, for example, twice of the client-side max idle time.
