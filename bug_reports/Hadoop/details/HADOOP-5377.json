On our jobtrackers, even with a 45 day purge cycle, we see hundreds of thousands of files in logs/hadoop/history.  The following is an example:\n\npchdm01.ypost.re1: logs/hadoop/history - 1,176,927 files!\n\nThis is the time(1) output of the `ls | wc -l`\n\nreal    0m56.042s\nuser    0m28.702s\nsys     0m1.794s\n\nNote that this was the second time I ran this filecount. The first run took more than 4 minutes of real time.\n\n===========================================\n\nMy recommended solution is that the Hadoop team store these files in the following structure:\n    history/2008/08/19\n    history/2008/08/20\n    history/2008/08/21\n\nUsing this structure gives us 2 important things: consistently good performance and the ability to easily delete or archive old files.  \n\nIf we expect a Hadoop cluster to process hundreds of thousands of jobs per day, then we may want to break it down by\nhour like this:\n    history/2008/08/19/00\n    history/2008/08/19/01\n     ...\n    history/2008/08/19/22\n    history/2008/08/19/23\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"103739","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Inefficient jobtracker history file layout","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nick.rettinghouse","name":"nick.rettinghouse","key":"nick.rettinghouse","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nick Rettinghouse","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nick.rettinghouse","name":"nick.rettinghouse","key":"nick.rettinghouse","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nick Rettinghouse","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"This is at least a problem on 0.15.","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12415941/comment/12678229","id":"12678229","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Nick, HADOOP-4670 is opened to address the same.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-03-03T04:02:16.828+0000","updated":"2009-03-03T04:02:16.828+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-5377/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0i3zb:"}}
