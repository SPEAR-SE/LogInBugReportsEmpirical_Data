It doesn't feel right to have a config file that is specific for map/reduce, but I think there should be some kind of default config file that the user can override in the job but that is editted by the site.\n\nThings that probably belong there:\n  fs.default.name\n  mapred.job.tracker\n  mapred.map.tasks\n
