On my Mac, there are four user accounts, each with its own \"home\" directory, one of which, /Users/test, has a .Trash directory with access permissions set so it is not readable by me.  When it tries to list the .Trash subdirectories with FileSystem.listStatus(), it logs the following:\n\n11/05/23 14:34:54 WARN fs.Trash: RuntimeException during Trash.Emptier.run() java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.listStatus(FileSystem.java:1114)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.listStatus(FileSystem.java:1137)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.ChecksumFileSystem.listStatus(ChecksumFileSystem.java:494)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.Trash.expunge(Trash.java:215)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.Trash$Emptier.run(Trash.java:313)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:680)\n\nThe second example is from Daryn, and was partly described in HADOOP-7345.
