Thanks for reviewing the patch.\n\nThe reason that we need to create {{canonicalizeUri}} and allow implementations to override it is that we have canonicalize the URI parameter in {{checkPath}}. Since we don't have a FileSystem instance corresponding to the URI parameter, we have to add this method which takes a URI for this to work out.\n\nCertainly most systems can now use the default implementation of {{getCanonicalUri}} (which just calls {{canonicalizeUri(getUri())}}, but making it final seemed a little bit dictatorial.

I was merely asking a question to understand the change and not suggesting a change, in my previous comment.\n\nbq. The reason that we need to create canonicalizeUri and allow implementations to override it is that we have canonicalize the URI parameter in checkPath. Since we don't have a FileSystem instance corresponding to the URI parameter, we have to add this method which takes a URI for this to work out.\nNow I understand the issue better.\n\nSome obesvations/comments:\n# With this patch, default FileSystem#getCanonicalUri() implementation changes. The host is no longer canonicalized for file systems that do not override the method. This is a change in behavior. However it is taking the behavior prior to changes from HADOOP-7510. So that should be okay.\n# Making getCanonicalUri() final is an API incompatible change for the file system implementations. While in my pervious comment I asked you about making getCanonicalUri() final, thinking a bit more, it is not worth making incompatible change. There are two ways now in FileSystem to override the behavior. getCanoicalUri() and canonicalizeUri(). It is not clean, but may be worth doing to keep the API compatibility. Also adding a comment to getCanonicalUri() to say, most file system need to only override canonicalizeUri() and not this method, should add more clarity.\n# It is worth making this change in branch-1, since some new implementations of file systems could start with that branch.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-24T18:40:29.695+0000","updated":"2013-01-24T18:40:29.695+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12624326/comment/13614676","id":"13614676","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Attached patch goes back to making the call not be declared {{final}}, for compatibility.\n\nOtherwise it's the same as the prior patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-03-26T23:33:25.194+0000","updated":"2013-03-26T23:33:25.194+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12624326/comment/13614897","id":"13614897","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
