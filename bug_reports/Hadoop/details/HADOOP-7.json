They used to\ncontain a 1D array, one map task for each map-split of the data.\n\n  This 2D business is less than perfect, so let me explain...\n\n  Each Reduce task needs to know when its map task predecessors have completed.\nIn the old days, this was easy.  There was one map id for each split of the data, so for\nk splits, there were k map ids to know about.\n\n  But in a world with speculative execution and early-start of reduce tasks, there could\nbe multiple possible map tasks that work on the same split of data.  So for each of the\nk splits, there could be up to M tasks working on it.  Thus, the reduce task knows about\nk * M map ids.  When any one of the M for each split has completed, the reduce task knows\nit can move on.\n\n   But this is a little silly.  The JobTracker has a \"TaskInProgress\" abstraction that represents\nthe idea of a \"split's worth of work\".  A single TIP contains M map task ids.  Instead of the\nreduce task looking all over for map task ids, it should just deal with TIP ids.  That way,\nwe're back to a 1D array, and the reduce task code is easier to understand.\n\n  Anyway, it will still work as is.  I'll improve the code in a future patch.
