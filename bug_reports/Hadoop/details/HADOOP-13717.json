Is it reasonable to also skip these checks in this situation?\n\nIn the general daemon case we definitely need to leave the hadoop_verify_logdir in place.  This will get followed up with verifying the pid dir as well.  This is needed because many folks run the daemon commands \"interactively\" from a shell code perspective but do their own daemonization from init.  There's also the docker case where individual daemons are in their own containers.   etc, etc. We're almost always better checking for the existence of this dirs rather than letting Java go haywire.\n\nBut balancer (and mover and probably a handful of others) are, in many ways, special.\n\nWe effectively have a problem of history. sbin/start-balancer.sh was added way back when as a convenience  to background the balancer.  When the rewrite happened, balancer was added to the commands that could be daemonized as a result.   \n\nThere might also be a privilege problem here too.  I don't think balancer can be run as by a non-privileged user, usually making the log and pid dir verification (usually) safe and somewhat required if we want all of our daemons to function in the same way (consistency!).  The pid check at the UNIX level definitely helps prevent multiple instances running on the same host way faster (and somewhat more reliably!) than the Java checks. \n\nTo me, the questions become:\n\na) should balancer stay as a daemon? what about the other not-really-daemons-but-can-run-in-daemon-mode subcommands?\nb) should instead there be logic to say that failing logdir and piddir are optionally fatal?\nc) should a local override be used instead? (e.g., define a shell profile that replaces the hdfs balancer command)\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2016-10-13T17:22:55.703+0000","updated":"2016-10-13T17:22:55.703+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13011817/comment/15573587","id":"15573587","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Besides the Mover, I'd also include the new intra-DN balancer in the collection of special commands.

Bigtop and CDH don't have balancer init scripts for instance.\n\nSorry, I think I may have miscommunicated this point.  start-balancer is geared towards manual usage but running it in the background and catching it's IO as it can run for very long times on large and/or extremely misbalanced clusters.  It's not a daemon in the traditional sense.   It really is a convience script so that those that aren't familiar with bash don't have to remember how to catch stdout/stderr, or use disown or whatever.   I'd be very surprised if there actually was an init script.\n\nIt's fun to note that the start-balancer script only appears to be documented in the Balancer javadoc and the only place that Javadoc is really exposed is on Cloudera's website. ;)\n\nbq.

Man, the balancer is a can of worms. Not a daemon, but runs awkwardly longer than other normal commands. This is the root of potential differences in expectations.\n\nYup. Completely agree. :)\n\nbq. What do you propose we do? Minimally, we should make sure all the members of the balancer family have the same daemonization behavior, which is currently untrue.\n\nYes, we probably should make sure they are treated the same in the hdfs script if they aren't.  We should definitely avoid adding more sbin scripts.  My hope is that in 4.x we can wipe out most of sbin and reduce our code footprint.\n\nbq. If part of the answer is that the balancer family are daemons and need a HADOOP_LOG_DIR and a log4j.properties, that's fine with me. Not a hard change on our side.\n\nI was thinking about what kind of interfaces/guarantees we provide 3rd parties. We make no promises about the content of log4j that I could find, so that's an easy one. But if a non-ASF jar gets added to the classpath via shellprofile what would the expectations on HADOOP_LOG_DIR and -Dhadoop.log.dir be?  The key might be hadoop-env.sh:\n\n{code}\n# Where (primarily) daemon log files are stored.\n# ${HADOOP_HOME}/logs by default.\n# Java property: hadoop.log.dir\n# export HADOOP_LOG_DIR=${HADOOP_HOME}/logs\n{code}\n\nIt's pretty clear that HADOOP_LOG_DIR is expected to point somewhere valid when we run as a daemon. HADOOP_LOG_DIR needs to work then on daemons. That leads me to we basically have three choices:\n\n1. If there is a general agreement amongst the community that balancer and friends should run with HADOOP_SUBCMD_SUPPORTDAEMONIZATION=true, then HADOOP_LOG_DIR should be set to something writable (e.g., /tmp) when it is being executed.\n\n2. If balancer should be run with HADOOP_SUBCMD_SUPPORTDAEMONIZATION=false, it now becomes a normal client command and sbin/start-balancer goes away.  HADOOP_LOG_DIR, etc, now become irrelevant.\n\n3. Some third state needs to get introduced and all of the accompanying support code added so that we can support it in all of the user-executable scripts.\n\nAt this point, yes, I think the easiest path forward really is #1: HADOOP_LOG_DIR must point somewhere writable.  All of the other options have a lot more pain involved, for us and/or the end users.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2016-10-14T23:03:03.283+0000","updated":"2016-10-14T23:03:03.283+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13011817/comment/15583594","id":"15583594","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sounds good.
