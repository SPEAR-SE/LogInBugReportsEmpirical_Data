The InMemoryFileSystem instance is closed prematurely if the merge of the files in the InMemoryFileSystem throws an exception. When close() is invoked on the instance of the InMemoryFileSystem, it will esentially clear out the mapping of the corresponding URI from the FileSystem's CACHE map, thereby invalidating the reference to the object. However, some of the copier threads might still be active and they might get NPEs if they try to invoke InMemoryFileSystem operations on that invalid object.\nIn essence, although the code could be tweaked to handle this exception, it is harmless, if there was some other fatal error before (like in-memory merge throwing an exception) this exception is thrown since the task is anyway going to die.
