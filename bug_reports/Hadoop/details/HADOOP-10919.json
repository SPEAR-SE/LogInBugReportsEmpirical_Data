Right now it's transparent in that distcp will decrypt when it reads from the normal path. This is what all existing distcp scripts will be doing, copying to and from normal paths. It's less efficient since it involves decryption, and results in different bytes-on-disk on the destination (either because it's unencrypted, or it's given a different EDEK), but it's a reasonable and sometimes desirable behavior. Using the /.reserved/raw paths is a way of doing a direct byte-to-byte identical copy, which is also a sometimes desirable behavior.\n\nIt sounds like you want the direct byte-to-byte copy to be the default, but remember that it's an API with sharp edges, many of which are laid out in the doc. /.r/r is also superuser only, since it lets you muck directly with the raw xattrs. This means we can't transparently add the /.r/r prefix if the distcp runs as a normal user. Because of all this, we decided to implement the current, safer behavior.\n\nDoes this sound reasonable?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-08-12T18:53:46.729+0000","updated":"2014-08-12T18:53:46.729+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12731195/comment/14094640","id":"14094640","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. Right now it's transparent in that distcp will decrypt when it reads from the normal path. This is what all existing distcp scripts will be doing, copying to and from normal paths. ... but it's a reasonable and sometimes desirable behavior.\nAt the meeting and in the jira we  concluded that the above behavior is not desirable: the user running the distcp may not have permission to decrypt (e.g. an Admin at NSA). Second, the data is being transmitted in the clear. Third the efficiency argument. You are saying \"but it's a reasonable and sometimes desirable behavior.\" - I thought we have established it is not and hence we are doing the /.r/.r and that distcp will take advantage of it. I hope you still want to do /.r/.r? Maybe you are asserting that /.r/.r was unnecessary but you are willing to do it to please a few in the community. That okay - we can agree to disagree here.\n\nI would have thought that if distcp prefixes all paths by /.r/.r then it would just work. Your comments says that \"/.r/r is also superuser only\" -- not sure what you mean - only superuer can access /.r/.r? Surely that is not the case?

Possible outcomes\n...\n      2. files copied as encrypted and a matching EZ is created automatically. Can an admin do this operation since he does not have access to the keys?\n{quote}\n\nI don't think that distcp can, or should, create a matching EZ automatically. It is too hard for it to know what the intent of the copy is. Should the new ez have the same ez-key as the src ez or a different one? Sure, we could have an option to let the user specify that, but for the first crack I wanted to keep it fairly simple. So, the theory is that the admin creates the empty EZ before performing the distcp. The admin can either set up the EZ with the same ez-key as the src ez (call this \"(a)\" below, or the dest can have a different ez-key than the src (call this \"(b)\" below. After the ez is created, then distcp will try to maintain the files as encrypted. In either of those scenarios, there are a couple of cases:\n\ndistcp with /.r/r: (a) works ok because the EDEKs for each file are copied from src to dst. (b) does not work because when the files are opened in the dest hierarchy, the EDEKs will be decrypted with the new ez-key(dst) and that won't work. This could be made to work by having the KMS decrypt the EDEKs and re-encrypt them with the new ez-key(dst), but it would assume that the distcp invoker had proper credentials with the KMS for the keys. So in general this scenario is only useful when the src-ez and the dst-ez have been setup with the same ez-key. There are other issues with this that are discussed under HDFS-6134, such as different key lengths, etc.\n\ndistcp with no /.r/r: Both of (a) and (b) work ok as long as the invoker has access to the files that are being copied. distcp decrypts the files on read and they get re-encrypted on write. This is pretty much the same as today.\n\n{quote}\n3.    src subtree has EZ but dest does not. Possible outcomes\n...\n      3. throw an error which can be overidden by a flag in which case the files are decryoted and copied to in dest are left decrypted . This only works if the user has permissions for decryption; admin cannot do this.\n{quote}\n\n/.r/r: The files aren't decrypted so this scenario is perfectly acceptable.\n\n!/.r/r: As you say, the admin can't do this because they presumably don't have access to the files on the src (and probably not on the target either). So this scenario is about some random user doing a distcp of some subset of the tree on their own. I think that what you're suggesting is a way of trying to keep the user from shooting themselves in the foot by ensuring that they don't leave unencrypted data hanging around in the dest. I can see this both ways. On the one hand, someone has given the user access to the files and keys. They are expected to \"do the right thing\" with the decrypted file contents, including not putting it somewhere \"unsafe\". It is \"transparent encryption\" after all. And they might actually want to leave it hanging around in unencrypted form because (e.g.) maybe dst is on a cluster inside a SCIF and it's ok to leave the files unencrypted.\n\nBut I think I like your suggestion that we throw an exception in this case (user not using /.r/r, any of the source paths are in an ez, dest is not in an ez) unless a flag is set.\n\n{quote}\n4.    both src and dest have EZ at exactly the same part of the subtree. Possible outcomes\n      1. If user has permission to decrypt and encrypt, then the data is copied and encryption is redone with new keys,\n      2. If user does not have permission then ?? Fail or copy as raw?\n{quote}\n\nI think we should just treat this the same as current behavior. We just attempt it and if it works great, and if not, we throw the exception. So I don't think there's anything unusual here.\n\n{quote}\n5.    both src and dest have EZ at different parts of the subtree. This should reduce to 2 or 3.\n{quote}\n\nAgreed.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clamb","name":"clamb","key":"clamb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Charles Lamb","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-08-13T20:11:11.811+0000","updated":"2014-08-13T20:11:11.811+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12731195/comment/14096353","id":"14096353","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanjay.radia","name":"sanjay.radia","key":"sanjay.radia","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sanjay Radia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Q. when you say \"distcp  /r/r/src  /r/r/dest\" are the  keys  read from src and preserved in the dest?
