All the fields are invalid when using the default constructor, by the same logic we should also set a default owner, group etc instead of using null and converting to \"\". The path is not special (other parts of the system are not happy with \"\" users). While objects like this are less user friendly (they violate the rule that a constructor leaves an object in a valid state) they prevent you from allocating a bunch of objects that you're just going to overwrite.  The default constructor for most of the other objects that implement writable (eg FsPermission) leave their fields as null as well. Its a trade off between performance and user friendlyness, the code currently sacrifies user friendlyness for performance.  If we didn't do that you can see someone doing some profiling and following a jira that notices \"we create a lot of objects in the default constructors that we immediately overwrite, let's avoid that\".  Not vetoing your patch, just pointing out that there's a reason the code works the way it does.
