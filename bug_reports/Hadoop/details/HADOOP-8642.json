The git commit hash is f9f6143876a1ff6e8eb1266917f4992f642aaea7.  The property was named {{hadoop.native.lib}} then.  This was a point in the project's history when the only native code in Hadoop was native compression codecs.  The current codebase of course has a lot more native code that's important for a lot of different things beyond the compression codecs.  I'm concerned about possible backwards incompatibility.  Existing deployments might be using this property to disable the native compression codecs, but are still dependent on the rest of the native code for other functionality.  If we were to push this change to those existing clusters, then they'd suddenly lose the rest of that important native code.\n\nAnother concern is the instantiation of yet another {{Configuration}} and all of the parsing that entails.  I don't think there would be any way around that, because this is all driven from static initialization.\n\nAll things considered, I have to vote -1 on changing the behavior of this property, at least within the 2.x line where we need to maintain backwards compatibility.  I would be +1 for a patch that updates the description in core-default.xml to clarify that it really only controls the native bz2 and zlib compression codecs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-14T00:00:19.332+0000","updated":"2015-02-14T00:00:19.332+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12601247/comment/14321077","id":"14321077","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ajisakaa","name":"ajisakaa","key":"ajisakaa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238"},"displayName":"Akira Ajisaka","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"body":"bq.

As you said, there are alternative workarounds.\n\n+1 for reducing the build permutations on trunk too.  I personally have no use case for building native without bz2 and zlib, and it can only cause confusion if builds pass but then fail in system test due to lack of those symbols linked into libhadoop.so/hadoop.dll.  I also have no use case for building without Snappy, though I imagine removing the options for that one could be a little more controversial.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-18T17:02:24.884+0000","updated":"2015-02-18T17:02:24.884+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12601247/comment/14327967","id":"14327967","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HADOOP-10409 and HADOOP-10452 are further evidence that all of the native build variants can cause confusion.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-19T19:11:02.709+0000","updated":"2015-02-19T19:11:02.709+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12601247/comment/14329310","id":"14329310","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
