The Jira is about '\\' character being used as an escape character for metachars, and replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\") in Path breaks this. Your current fix in 0.23 addresses the problem in Unix by not doing this \"problematic\" replace, but leaves Windows with the problem. Please correct me if I'm mistaken, as it's a long discussion.\n\n> After a long discussion in HADOOP-8139, it was decided that only RFC standard URIs will be supported by hadoop. Paths using \"\\\" are not going to be supported.\n@Daryn: I would prefer to move the discussion in a direction of how to support \"\\\" by Hadoop on Windows, and work with the community on the acceptable solution. Aksing users to enter input paths in form \"c:/some/path\" does not seem like the right thing to do. Please let me know if you agree with me here. I would prefer if we address HADOOP-8139 in a separate change, as this change moves us forward with Windows support, and does not break Unix behavior.\n\nfile:/// should not allow authority or port - it is for local file systems.\n@Sanjay: I was just trying to illustrate the problem, sorry for the confusion.\n\nThere's no reason you have to, you can always use new Path(String).\n@Daryn: Actually, this does not work for paths that are symlinks. For example, new Path(\"/some/path#symlink\") will encode the \"#\" character internally, so we lose the symlink behavior. This is why I believe this is a good change.

In the meantime, would you please elaborate on how uri fragments are related to supporting symlinks?\nSure. Symlinks/fragments are used for [Distributed Cache|http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/filecache/DistributedCache.html]. For example, to add files to Distributed Cache, you would do something like this in code:\n{code}\nDistributedCache.addCacheArchive(new URI(\"s3://bucket/path/to/archive.zip#directory\"), job);\n{code}\nand this works fine. However, if you try to do something like this:\n{code}\nDistributedCache.addCacheArchive(new Path(\"s3://bucket/path/to/archive.zip#directory\").toUri(), job);\n{code}\nthis will fail because Path object does not support fragments. In this case, ‘#’ sign will be encoded into the URI path: {{s3://bucket/path/to/archive.zip%23directory}} \n\nI run into this while fixing TestGenericOptionsParser that was failing on Windows.  However, I found some [forum posts|https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=152538] where people actually used the incorrect pattern. This might be a good change orthogonally to what we do for paths.  If you agree, maybe split fragment support into a new Jira?\n\nbq. Please also look at the issues raised in HADOOP-8139 and the reasons why we did not support windows paths on HDFS. \nThanks Suresh, I am aware of the issues raised here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2012-06-01T17:55:25.062+0000","updated":"2012-06-01T17:55:25.062+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12556367/comment/13287634","id":"13287634","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Ah, I see.
