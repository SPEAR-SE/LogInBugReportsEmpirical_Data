In both analyses, I still see some duplicate jars. I think most or all of the duplicates in source are coming from the HDFS Proxy ivy file. I don't know if this is reason why the libraries in the build/lib are ultimately repeating.\n\nFor e.g. here's a list of the jars in the ivy properties that have different versions:\ncommons-logging-api, commons-logging, ivy, jets3t, junit, mockito-all, slf4j-api, slf4j-log4j12\n\nThere are quite a few repetitions in the lib folders of the three packages:\nant,avro ,commons-http-client,commons-lang,ivy,jackson-core-asl,jackson-mapper-asl,jetty,jetty-util,junit,paranamer,paranamer-ant,paranamer-generator,qdox,servlet-api,slf4j-api,slf4j-log4j12\n\nI am attaching two text files that are the dumps of the ivy library declarations and the build/lib folder contents for your review.\n\nPlease note that I did not run the cluster with these packages - so things are possibly fine with these duplications as well.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-06-26T10:25:55.200+0000","updated":"2010-06-26T10:25:55.200+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12466007/comment/12882831","id":"12882831","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"One more point is that some of the subprojects in mapred seem to be using hadoop-common-*-SNAPSHOT as the dependency and som hadoop-common-*-dev-SNAPSHOT as the dependency.
