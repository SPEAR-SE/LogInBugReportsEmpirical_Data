So real cpu benefit of just around write is much much higher.\n* Given the work done on RPC server and client is same (10 seconds each), \n    ** With out the patch : write() adds 20-30 seconds\n    ** with the patch : negligible.\n\nIt is bit shocking to see that it takes 20 seconds to fetch 10MB even with the patch. I don't think it can be expained by extra copies (as mentioned in HADOOP-4813). It is mostly a problem in object writable. I will try out a fix for that.

Only difference is that this one returns (a Writable) ByteArray instead of naked a 'byte []' to avoid ObjectWritable from handling the array. CPU for 100 calls : \n\n  * With out the patch ~ 7000\n  * With the patch ~ 1050 \n  * RPC server takes 6-7 times less CPU to serve 10MB buffer.\n\nI hope 6-7 times less is pretty good for a side benefit. \n\nIn the he previous version of the benchmark, client reads much slower, so 10MB mostly requires more write() calls. The extra CPU penalty in trunk is directly proportional to number write() calls required to write the full buffer.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu
