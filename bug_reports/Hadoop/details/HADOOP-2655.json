This directory is used to do temporary copy-on-write for data blocks that are part of a snapshot.\n\n When a client writes a block that is linked to a snapshot, it does the following:\n\n1. Create a copy of the original file into a file in the detachDir.\n2. Rename the newly created file in detachDir into the original file. This breaks the hardlink and creates two copies of the block atomically.\n\nPoint 2 works perfectly on Linux platform. The following are some caveats on Windows platform.\n\nOn Windows platform,  the rename fails because the target file already exists. Thus, the code issues a delete followed by a rename. This means that there is a window of opportunity (on Windows) when the block does not exist in the right place. If a read request for the block occurs precisely in that window, then the client will get an exception and will try to read that block from an alternate location. (When a datanode restarts, it recovers blocks that are exist in detachDir but do not exist in the original data directory.)
