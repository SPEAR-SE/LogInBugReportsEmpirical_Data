(a) has some of its private static final modifiers in the wrong order\n\nAccording to the [language spec|http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/classes.html#8.3.1], it is \"customary, though not required\" that they appear in some order, but there's no semantic relevance; this \"custom\" is violated in the very next example in the spec, so enforcing it in test code scarcely seems worth it.\n\nbq. (b) in an assertEquals, has the static and dynamic values wrong, so the error message won't be correct\n\nThis might be worth fixing- one almost always needs to examine the assertion in the test to know how the test failed, and there the context is unambiguous- but surely there are other examples in the unit tests of this. An omnibus bug (an omnibug?) fixing many instances of \"backwards\" asserts might be helpful, but this particular fix strikes me as unnecessary. There are at least four other examples of this in TestNetworkTopology alone that remain inverted.\n\nI'm opening HADOOP-3679 to track (b) more generally and closing this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-07-01T22:14:02.895+0000","updated":"2008-07-01T22:14:02.895+0000"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-3611/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0ib1b:"}}
