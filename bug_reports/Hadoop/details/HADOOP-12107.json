Is there a good way to write any unit test for this?\nI was relying on existing unit tests on {{FileSystem.Statistics}} (there are several). I'm still hoping that is good enough for this, but let me know if you want me to look into creating more unit tests around this.\n\nRegarding the number of threads for the cleaner, yes, it definitely occurred to me that this might create an issue in terms of potentially a large number of additional threads. The only reason I shied away from a global cleaner thread initially is I wasn't entirely sure whether it would be completely safe and perform well in terms of locking (note that the cleaner needs to acquire a lock for each {{Statistics}} instance). Let me explore that still.\n\nbq. The null check isn't needed any more since you changed allData to be initialized in the constructor.\nThanks for pointing that out. I remembered it at one point, but forgot to include that change in the patch.\n\nOne other point of discussion: I'm removing the {{StatisticsData}} constructor that takes a Thread as the argument (along with the {{owner}} member variable) as it no longer needs the thread inside {{StatisticsData}}. But since {{StatisticsData}} is technically a public class, it could be considered an API incompatible change. Thoughts on this? No one outside {{FileSystem}} is using the constructor or the member variable, and I cannot think of why anyone would. But if we need to absolutely maintain the API compatibility, I cannot remove them.

I'll be grateful if somebody can guide me through this.\n\nD'oh.  You're absolutely right... there is only one thread per FileSystem class.  Forget what I said earlier.\n\nbq. One other point of discussion: I'm removing the StatisticsData constructor that takes a Thread as the argument (along with the owner member variable) as it no longer needs the thread inside StatisticsData. But since StatisticsData is technically a public class, it could be considered an API incompatible change. Thoughts on this? No one outside FileSystem is using the constructor or the member variable, and I cannot think of why anyone would. But if we need to absolutely maintain the API compatibility, I cannot remove them. Let me know what you think.\n\nStatisticsData is a public class, but its constructor is not public.  So there is no possible API breakage here.  (As a side note, even if StatisticsData were public, it doesn't have an interface annotation specifying that it is safe to use outside of Hadoop, so we're doubly safe here.)\n\n{code}\n2921              /**\n2922\t       * This constructor is deprecated and is no longer used.

While the {{StatisticsData}} class itself is public, the {{StatisticsData}} constructor is not.  It is \"package-private\" (the access class which things get in Java if there is no public, private, or protected keyword on them.)  This means that a {{StatisticsData}} object can only be created by code in the {{org.apache.hadoop.fs}} package.  You can try this for yourself-- write a program external to hadoop that tries to create a {{StatisticsData}} object via this constructor.  It will not compile.

If they do, things are not going to work-- there are going to be naming conflicts, class resolution issues, etc. etc.  There is no possible way we can support users doing this and no reason to support it.  If we tried, we would have to essentially freeze the API of every single class in Hadoop-- we would have to re-have this discussion each time we changed some package-private variable or function.

My answer is yes if you have some org.apache.hadoop.fs.Foo calling the constructor even though the user absolutely should not do it. \n\nYou could make the same argument to stop development on almost any patch.  Almost every patch changes things which are private or package-private inside Hadoop.

Maybe one day we'll have a compatibility test suite based on that doc.\n\nbq.
