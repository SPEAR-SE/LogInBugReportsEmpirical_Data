timeout well. Currently it simply assumes that\nthe timeouted move is failed but does not take the effort to make sure the move is interrupted and the resources the\nmove takes is released. The next phase of scheduling may schedule more blocks to move from the same DataNode thus using\nmore and more resources.\n\n(2) Resource control for the balancing purpose at DataNodes should use a fair Semaphore. Currently\nit uses an unfair Semaphore that makes no guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. A\nthread invoking acquire() can be allocated a permit ahead of a thread that has been waiting. Therefore, if a dfs\ncluster has many DataNodes that has a long queue of block move requests, it is very likely to enter the\nfollowing state: A thread in DataNode A holding a permit and asks DataNode B to receive a block, while DataNode B has a\nthread holding a Semaphore and asking DataNode A to receive a block. Although the block move from B to A was scheduled\nmuch later than the move from A to B, they may be executed simultaneously. Both block receives are blocks on acquiring\na permit assuming only one permit can be issued. Therefore, a deadlock occurs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hairong","name":"hairong","key":"hairong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hairong Kuang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-09-12T18:28:09.613+0000","updated":"2008-09-12T18:28:09.613+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403911/comment/12630652","id":"12630652","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rangadi","name":"rangadi","key":"rangadi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu Angadi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the detailed analysis Hairong.

Remove the use of Semaphor at DataNodes. Instead a DataNode uses a counter to manages the number of concurrent block moves. On receiving a block move request while maximum block moves are in progress, reject the request immediately.\n2. Let the receiver initiate the block move; The sender rejects the request when the maximum number has already reached. As a result when either the sender or the receiver does not have resource to handle block move, the block content will not get transfered across network.\n3. The balancer does not set a timeout on a socket. Instead, it sets the option KeepAlive on the socket. So a block move does not timeout no matter how slow it goes and next phrase of scheduling does not get started when there is a pending block move.
