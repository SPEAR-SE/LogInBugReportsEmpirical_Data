Doesn't it make sense for createForWrite to get the same treatment\n\nWell, the reason for this JIRA is that checking permissions is super-expensive, since it shells out to {{ls -ld}}. But, for {{createForWrite}}, we only have to check {{f.exists()}} which is only a syscall, and not too expensive.\n\nSo, I think we may as well keep the behavior we have for createForWrite.\n\n\nbq.
