You're certainly right that HADOOP-11403 regressed this on Windows.\n\nI think the patch here is not quite right.  The code for UNIX uses a function defined in {{exception.h}}, {{terror}}.  That is why the {{#include}} was added.  Due to an obscure quirk in pre-standardization C / C++ that got grandfathered into the ANSI standard, you can call a function without actually defining what types it takes, and the compiler will \"guess\" about what types it takes (I think it defaults to assuming that it returns an int?)  While this may compile (with a warning), it is not correct.  It may lead to incorrect code being generated if the size of the return type is different than the size of an {{int}}... I think there are some issues with the arguments as well.\n\nI think it's better to do like we do in {{libhdfs/exception.h}}, and simply have a macro that stubs out these declarations for Windows.\n\nthanks","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
