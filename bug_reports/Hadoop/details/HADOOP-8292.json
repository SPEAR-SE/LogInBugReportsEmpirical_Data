It's intended to replace ScriptBasedMapping for cases where the latter was just a complicated way of looking up the rack in a file.\n\nThough there was discussion of it on the JIRA, the TableMapping implementation is not 'refreshable'.  i.e., if you want to add a host to your cluster, and that host wasn't in the topology file to begin with, it will never be added.\n\nTableMapping should refresh, either based on a command that can be executed, or, perhaps, if the file on disk changes.\n\nI'll also point out that TableMapping extends CachedDNSToSwitchMapping, but, since it does no refreshing, I don't see what the caching gets you: I think the cache ends up being a second copy of the underlying map, always.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12526177","id":"12526177","filename":"HADOOP-8292.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro

Well behaved systems won't do that, but I think it's better for us to be resilient to it than for us to end up loading an empty topology mapping.\n- clearCache() is called from resolve() without the lock held. That might cause multiple threads to call clear() on a map at once, which might result in an exception or something.\n\nHow does this interact with the HDFS topology code which needs to check when a cluster changes from single-rack to multi-rack?
