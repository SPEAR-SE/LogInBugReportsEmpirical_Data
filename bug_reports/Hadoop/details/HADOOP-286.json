Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"It looks like the following scenario leads to this exception.\nLEASE_PERIOD = 60 sec is a global constants defining for how long a lease is issued.\nDFSClient.LeaseChecker renews this client leases every 30 sec = LEASE_PERIOD/2.\nIf the renewLease() fails then the client retries to renew every second.\nOne of the most popular reasons the renewLease() fails is because it timeouts SocketTimeoutException.\nThis happens when the namenode is busy, which is not unusual since we lock it for each operation.\nThe socket timeout is defined by the config parameter \"ipc.client.timeout\", which is set to 60 sec in\nhadoop-default.xml That means that the renewLease() can last up to 60 seconds and the lease will\nexpire the next time the client tries to renew it, which could be up to 90 seconds after the lease was\ncreated or renewed last time.\nSo there are 2 simple solutions to the problem:\n1) to increase LEASE_PERIOD\n2) to decrease ipc.client.timeout\n\nA related problem is that DFSClient sends lease renew requests no matter what every 30 seconds \nor less. It looks like the DFSClient has enough information to send renew messages only if it really \nholds a lease. A simple solution would be avoid calling  renewLease() when \nDFSClient.pendingCreates is empty.\nThis could substantially decrease overall net traffic for map/reduce.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2006-07-19T01:21:16.000+0000","updated":"2006-07-19T01:21:16.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12344080/comment/12422507","id":"12422507","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This is a very simple patch that renews leases only when pendingCreates is not empty.\nThis prevents the client from sending lease renewal messages when the client\nis not writing into dfs, say just reading or doing local stuff.\nThis should make the name node less busy.\n\nI tried to change the ipc.client.timeout from 60 secs to 20 secs.\nOn my 3 node cluster everything worked fine.\nOn a large cluster the timeout was changed only for the DFSClient.\nThe LeaseExpiredException does not appear anymore.\nBut we need more statistics on that, especially with slower networks.\nThe ipc timeout is global for all ipc connections, so if we make it\nsmaller there is a risk that long lasting operations like block transfers\nwill start to timeout.
