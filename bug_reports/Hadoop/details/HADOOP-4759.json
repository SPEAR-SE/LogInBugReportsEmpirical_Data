This will make sure that the cleanup will happen if the failure is because of Exception/Error, this will cover a majority of cases.\n* Any other type of fail or kill of the attempt makes it FAILED_UNCLEAN or KILLED_UNCLEAN. JobTracker will launch a separate cleanup task for  FAILED_UNCLEAN and KILLED_UNCLEAN attempts. The cleanup task will take the attempt to FAILED or KILLED\n* JT stops launching cleanup tasks for attempts once job succeeds/fails. As Devaraj told, this also means that the job level cleanup task (OutputCommitted.cleanupJob) has run, with the assumption that the job level cleanup has cleaned all garbage up.\n\nTwo approches here:\n1. We can use the same attempt for launching the cleanup. Here, the same attempt will launched with starting state as \\*_UNCLEAN, instead of UNASSIGNED. When the cleanup is successful, it will go to FAILED or KILLED. If it fails,  it will be left in *_UNCLEAN state. \nWe would need additional logic for scheduler to handle retries, if needed. \n\n2. Have a separate tip for doing the cleanup. Associate the cleanup tip with failed/killed attempt, by passing the attempt_id through configuration.\nOnce the tip succeeds ( after four retry attempts, by default), it will move the corresponding attempt to FAILED or KILLED. If the tip fails, it will leave the attempt in \\*_UNCLEAN state. \n\nThoughts?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-12-10T11:58:53.284+0000","updated":"2008-12-10T11:58:53.284+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409723/comment/12655488","id":"12655488","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'd vote for #1, assuming that you mean KILLED_UNCLEAN and FAILED_UNCLEAN.
