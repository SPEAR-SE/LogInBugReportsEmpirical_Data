Fang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This is a Hadoop bug related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-4374. On Windows when setting up environment variable for child tasks, we add quotes to the environment variable values to avoid escaping special characters. In Cmd shell, the quotation marks are set as part of the environment variable value. So when we receive the environment variables in Hadoop code, we should remove the surrounding quotes. We already have code in several places to do so. I am thinking this could be something we missed in previous patch.\n\nIt is involved to debug this issue because we need to pass debug opts to oozie, hadoop and child tasks, which are difficult. I tried a different approach, searching for \"System.getenv()\" across oozie and hadoop projects, and found two suspicious places:\nIn DistCp.java\n{code}\n  private static JobConf createJobConf(Configuration conf) {\n    ...\n    String tokenFile = System.getenv(\"HADOOP_TOKEN_FILE_LOCATION\");\n    if (tokenFile != null) {\n      LOG\n        .info(\"Setting env property for mapreduce.job.credentials.binary to: \"\n          + tokenFile);\n      jobconf.set(\"mapreduce.job.credentials.binary\", tokenFile);\n    }\n{code} \n\nand in UserGroupInfomration.java\n{code}\nstatic UserGroupInformation getLoginUser() throws IOException {\n  ...\n        String fileLocation = System.getenv(HADOOP_TOKEN_FILE_LOCATION);\n        if (fileLocation != null && isSecurityEnabled()) {\n          // load the token storage file and put all of the tokens into the\n          // user.\n          Credentials cred = Credentials.readTokenStorageFile(\n              new Path(\"file:///\" + fileLocation), conf);\n{code}\n\nThe first one is very likely to be the root cause of this oozie test failure (see JobClient.readTokensFromFiles() \n{code}\nString binaryTokenFilename =\n      conf.get(\"mapreduce.job.credentials.binary\");\n    if (binaryTokenFilename != null) {\n      Credentials binary = \n        Credentials.readTokenStorageFile(new Path(\"file:///\" +  \n                                                  binaryTokenFilename), conf);\n      credentials.addAll(binary);\n    }\n{code}\n). \n\nThe second one looks like a potential bug we may run into.
