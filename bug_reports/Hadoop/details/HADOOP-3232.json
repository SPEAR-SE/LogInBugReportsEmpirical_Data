This is an order of magnitude larger than our datanodes have here at Yahoo.\n- The above log message says it too 6.5 min for block report. Most of this time I would think is for listing the files in the local directory.\n- Such a large number of blocks should cause similar problem with 0.15 also. Anything you think is different?\n\nThough DataNode should be able to handle larger number of blocks better, I don't think this is a blocker for 0.16.3 release (unless iostat shows something else). Do you agree?\n\nBtw, are you planning to have large number of small blocks?

[ ... ]\n\nI think this was because Johan wanted to make DF implement Runnable, and there was a conflict, since Shell already has a method named 'run'.  But this changes public APIs incompatibly, and is thus not a good approach.\n\nJohan, perhaps instead we could define a nested class in DF.java that extends Thread and overrides run() there, or implements Runnable, if you prefer.\n\nAlso the default interval is dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec, which seems rather long.  It should really be related to the heartbeat interval, no?  Moreover, we shouldn't use a DFS parameter in a generic FS class.  So default interval should be something safe, perhaps hardwired to 10 minutes or somesuch, and DFS should override that when it constructs a DF, if it needs.  Does that make sense?\n\nAnd perhaps the thread should run 'df' first, then sleep, so that values are available to clients sooner?\n\nFinally, and most imporant, what evidence do you have that DU is in fact causing problems?  It is run very infrequently, not strictly synchronized with block reports but rather triggered by heartbeats.  A slow DU would thus result in a delayed heartbeat.  None of the stack traces above indicate that DU is blocking other activities of the datanode.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-05-09T16:37:20.914+0000","updated":"2008-05-09T16:37:20.914+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12393665/comment/12595664","id":"12595664","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johanoskarsson","name":"johanoskarsson","key":"johanoskarsson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johan Oskarsson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Cleaned up the patch a bit, now only changes DU.java + the test","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johanoskarsson","name":"johanoskarsson","key":"johanoskarsson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johan Oskarsson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-05-09T16:37:50.302+0000","updated":"2008-05-09T16:37:50.302+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12393665/comment/12595669","id":"12595669","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johanoskarsson","name":"johanoskarsson","key":"johanoskarsson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johan Oskarsson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Doug: You're right about the Runnable/run() bit, just as you wrote that I adapted the patch as you suggested.\n\nI agree about the interval, I'll change it.\nThis patch is for DU, the DF returns so quickly that it shouldn't cause an issue.\n\nIn the DU constructor the command is run once so that we get values straight away, I thought this would be better since then we know for sure there's correct values in there once the object is created.\n\nI'll try to recreate the situation to produce good evidence, but off the top of my head DU is used to decide what volume to write to in writeToBlock in FSDataset, so it causes problems with writing blocks if it takes too long.

So we could start a thread inside getUsed() (and possibly in other accessor methods if interval has passed) and make the thread exit after running du. This is no less accurate than current implementation. Or you could schedule a periodic thread using Java 'Executor'. Even if you do keep the persistent thread, could you add comment  if you agree that it need not be persistent.. we might implement that later.\n\nRegd the patch: \n# 'lock' is not required. You can synchronize on DU.this. \n# Also DURefreshThread should either be static class or not keep a ref to du.
