This is used to track fetches and to take of the problem where we receive a new map output location for a given mapId while we are fetching (and will probably fail) the output for that same mapId from some other location.\n2) An entry for a mapId is made in the fetchInProgress map as soon as we receive a map output location from the JobTracker if the neededOutputs has the mapId. The entry for the mapId is not deleted until we have successfully copied the output. \n3) During the time the output is copied, it might so happen that the TT is lost and we come to know about it after a while (after connect times out, etc.). In the meanwhile, if another execution of the lost task happened somewhere, we get the event for that and schedule that fetch as well. The output of first successful copier is considered as valid and the other becomes obsolete. In the existing code, this second event would be lost since we depended only on the neededOutputs list (from where entries are removed as soon as the fetches are scheduled). Now an additional check is done to see whether the mapId exists in fetchesInProgress.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2007-03-07T14:52:42.539+0000","updated":"2007-03-07T14:52:42.539+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364325/comment/12478836","id":"12478836","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dbowen","name":"dbowen","key":"dbowen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Bowen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"It is nice to see a patch with such good comments!\n\nAt the risk of being a coding-style bore, here are a couple of very minor suggestions: (1) long synchronized blocks are a bit hard to read given the two-space indentation style - it may be preferable to break them out into separate methods; (2) some may disagree, but I see no need to write method arguments like \"new Integer(loc.getMapId())\" when you can now write just \"loc.getMapId()\" and the compiler will automatically do the conversion.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dbowen","name":"dbowen","key":"dbowen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Bowen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-03-07T18:25:59.853+0000","updated":"2007-03-07T18:25:59.853+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364325/comment/12478941","id":"12478941","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching Devaraj's patch since he is asleep by now... :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-03-07T22:47:09.955+0000","updated":"2007-03-07T22:47:09.955+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12364325/comment/12478959","id":"12478959","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this.
