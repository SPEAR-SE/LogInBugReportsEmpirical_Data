These bugs are frequently exposed by running systems and the circumstances in which they occur can be hard to reproduce in a testbed. If you lost a block on your HDFS installation, you would want to know why, that answer can be obtained with much less pain if there is a trail to follow.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sameerp","name":"sameerp","key":"sameerp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"},"displayName":"Sameer Paranjpye","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-03T20:46:23.134+0000","updated":"2007-05-03T20:46:23.134+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12365507/comment/12493520","id":"12493520","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bien","name":"bien","key":"bien","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Bieniosek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I don't have a problem losing blocks on my HDFS installation (possibly because I have a much smaller installation).

I switched on logging when a block is allocated, when the namenode receives a block-confirmation from the datanode for a block. The log size at the end of a 8 hour random-writer run was about 6.5GB.
