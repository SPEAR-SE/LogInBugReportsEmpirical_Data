So it now tries to fire up hadoop-config.sh and hadoop-functions.sh which fail.\n\nThere are a couple of different ways to solve this:\n\n* Look to see if HADOOP_COMMON_HOME is defined and look for hadoop-config.sh/hadoop-functions.sh is there as well.\n* Throw caution to the wind and see if this stuff is in our current path.\n* Recalculate HADOOP_LIBEXEC_DIR in hadoop-config.sh might work too, since clearly hdfs found it.\n* Do the full gamut of checks for HADOOP_HDFS_HOME, etc, for hdfs-config.sh + some of the stuff above.\n\nOne sticking point is what happens if hadoop-layout.sh redefines the directory structure?

Figure out where HADOOP_PREFIX is at. Is HADOOP_PREFIX defined? If not, then let's assume it's \"what's called us/..\".\n2. Does HADOOP_PREFIX/conf/hadoop-env.sh exist? OK, then that must be HADOOP_CONF_DIR\n3. No? OK, then HADOOP_CONF_DIR must be HADOOP_PREFIX/etc/hadoop.\n\nWhat's fun about this and what you're doing is that HADOOP_CONF_DIR will get defined differently depending upon which bin dir you are using. :D\n\nFine, you say!  Let's just treat all _HOME/etc/hadoop and _HOME/conf as potentially valid.  Now we have a very interesting problem:  how do you define HADOOP_CONF_DIR?  Other stuff past Hadoop depends upon this being one directory.  We could pick the first one and then just shove the rest in the classpath and none would be the wiser!\n\nAha! But they would.  Which one takes precedence? What happens if there are conflicts? etc, etc. It gets messy very very fast. So... ABORT! ABORT!\n\n(BTW, this is pretty much the same logic from branch-2. It could be argued that there should be a check to see if etc/hadoop is 'real' too and abort on it.  Here's the fun part: the shell code works perfectly fine if -env.sh is empty now... the NN will still crash though.  That said, if HADOOP-10879 gets finished, this will almost certainly need to get revisited.  Probably better to look for core-site.xml, honestly, since all of the sub-projects all depend upon that.  In other words, we could run through all of the _HOME, HADOOP_PREFIX, etc, and use the first core-site.xml we find as the 'real' HADOOP_CONF_DIR.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2014-08-27T03:27:24.169+0000","updated":"2014-08-27T03:32:56.703+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12735965/comment/14111783","id":"14111783","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Thanks!
