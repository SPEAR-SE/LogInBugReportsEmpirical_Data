It'll create 2 64 MB files and try to rename them both at once with multi-part uploads. It can't complete.\n\nOne can work around this problem by increasing the number of threads (Amazon recommends an unbounded executor). I would suggest that perhaps a better approach is to implement the executor with 2 separate thread pools and task queues: one for \"control tasks\" and one for \"sub tasks\". This could make configuring maximum threads, etc. a little tricky, but without just removing all limits, this will at least allow real work to progress even when the pool / queue for control tasks is saturated. Unfortunately it looks like we'd have to rely on classes internal to the S3 SDK to do this, so I'm going to open an issue with them to see if they can provide a more explicitly supported way to achieve something like this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mackrorysd","name":"mackrorysd","key":"mackrorysd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559"},"displayName":"Sean Mackrory","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2016-11-21T20:21:49.398+0000","updated":"2016-11-21T20:21:49.398+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022295/comment/15685183","id":"15685183","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mackrorysd","name":"mackrorysd","key":"mackrorysd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559"},"displayName":"Sean Mackrory","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"body":"Attaching a proof-of-concept of my proposed solution. It still needs some polish and has the major drawback of depending on classes in com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.internal. It also has the major drawback of not working. It can work with more concurrent renames, but it would appear there isn't a simple division between 'control tasks' and 'sub tasks'. I had the control task pool fill up while the subtask pool was still empty, and it deadlocked. Things considered a control task can spawn other control tasks.

As I increased the number of parallel renames, I start hitting deadlocks again. I had a threadpool dedicated entirely to ControlMonitor tasks, and once that filled up it was deadlock. I guess this is because my executor gets wrapped by other executors that have a single queue, and if the next item is a ControlMonitor task and the ControlMonitor task pool is filled, then we're back to square one. Rather than getting wrapped in 2 other types of executors (to add the listening and blocking behavior, respectively) I think to make this work we would have to bring that logic inside my S3TransferExecutor class so that all tasks were immediately segregated by type as soon as they were handed off from the AWS SDK.\n\nI'll hold off until actually implementing that until there's more consensus on if that's even the right approach. My approach definitely increased the number of parallel operations you could get away with before hitting a deadlock, but until the entire executor chain does this it can't fix the core issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mackrorysd","name":"mackrorysd","key":"mackrorysd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559"},"displayName":"Sean Mackrory","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2016-11-23T17:05:41.951+0000","updated":"2016-11-23T17:05:41.951+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022295/comment/15690816","id":"15690816","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"I think we should accept an unbounded one for the TM, but track it via metrics, to keep an eye on what's happening, though this will have implications for the max #of http connections set in {{fs.s3a.connection.maximum}}, won't it?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-11-23T17:32:33.471+0000","updated":"2016-11-23T17:32:33.471+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022295/comment/15691219","id":"15691219","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Thomas+Demoor","name":"Thomas Demoor","key":"thomas demoor","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Demoor","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Yes, that is set on the AmazonS3Client, which we use both for the TM as for our block uploads.

From my reading of the code, both threadpools cannot be doing large object PUTs at the same time (an instance of s3a uses the block-based uploads or the regular S3AOutputstream, never both at the same time). What is possible, is that during a large block-based upload, which is saturating the bounded executor, another client thread might {{rename}} a directory, invoking a lot of parallel copies, hence saturating the TransferManager. But copies are are not data-intensive (see below) so I assume this is manageable.\n\nI like [~stevel@apache.org]'s ideas for further separating out the different types of operations, but have one remark: for me COPY is not similar to PUT. COPY is completely server-side and is thus generally much less resource-intensive and much quicker than PUT (the smaller your bandwidth to S3, the bigger the difference becomes).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Thomas+Demoor","name":"Thomas Demoor","key":"thomas demoor","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Demoor","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-12-12T22:51:25.008+0000","updated":"2016-12-12T22:51:25.008+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022295/comment/15743481","id":"15743481","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mackrorysd","name":"mackrorysd","key":"mackrorysd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559"},"displayName":"Sean Mackrory","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"body":"[~Thomas Demoor] Thanks.

But the unbounded pool you suggested fixed that problem - but wanting to avoid unbounded pools is my main concern with the .003 patch anyway.\n\nIt's also still a bit kludgy trying to separate tasks based on internal Amazon APIs (which I griped about this morning: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/939) and to a lesser extent when S3AFastOutputStream still causes tasks to be submitted to the executor wrapped in other types of Callable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mackrorysd","name":"mackrorysd","key":"mackrorysd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mackrorysd&avatarId=18559"},"displayName":"Sean Mackrory","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2016-12-12T23:18:47.733+0000","updated":"2016-12-12T23:18:47.733+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022295/comment/15744762","id":"15744762","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Ok, I've sat down for a review. Like I said before, the test needs some work. BTW, {{S3AFastOutputStream}} is gone. Are you referring to {{S3ABlockOutputStream}}?\n\nh2. {{S3AFileSystem}} \n\nAren't there limits on the size of the AWS httpclient pool, or is there something I'm missing?\n\n\nh2. {{ITestConcurrentOps}} \n\nThis must be a subclass of {{AbstractS3ATestBase}}, so only run when {{-Dscale}} is set. This will automatically give it extended test timeout, and allow that timeout to be overridden in the config or on the maven command line.\n* Must use {{path(subpath)}} to get a unique path which works in parallel execution, rather than {{new Path(\"/ITestS3AManyFiles\");}}\n* {{getRestrictedFileSystem}} can just go \"5M\" and \"10M\" when setting sizes\n* {{teardown()}} must check auxFS for being null, just in case something went wrong in setup.\n* Note you can use {{ContractTestUtils.dataset()}} to create a 1MB file; it writes in a range of values so it's easier to detect problems on reads. Not really needed here, but you should get into the habit of using those methods where possible.\n* {{testParallelRename}} must give the threads useful names. \n* {{testParallelRename}} should use Callables, so any exceptions raised in threads can be raised by test runner. We don't want tests to go wrong and us not to notice.\n* If {{testParallelRename}} logs exceptions, it must use {{LOG.error()}}\n* {{testParallelRename}} must check that the dest files exist, and that the source ones don't. Otherwise, it's not actually verifying that the rename worked,\nonly that a parallel series of operations completed.\n\n-{{{setup()}} should actually create the test files by uploading one and then (sequentially) copying it. Why? Gives you the S3 copy bandwidth, not the upload B/W, and parallelises better.- . We can't do that unless we expose an explicit COPY method in S3A FS. Something to consider for testing, maybe also the commit logic, though I don't see a need for that (I do want a rename-no-overwrite there tho')\n\nIdeally, I'd like that upload/copy to be  in the test itself, as the test runner will include its execution time in the test timings. It'd also be interesting to use {{ContractTestUtils.NanoTimer}} to time the copy operations, so we can get more stats on overall copy times. That's the setup copy calls, as well as the parallel ones.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-12-13T10:13:06.308+0000","updated":"2016-12-13T10:27:30.025+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022295/comment/15744772","id":"15744772","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Also, we may want to think about allowing for progress callbacks on a copy, if they come in, and, in the tests, log@debug every MB.
