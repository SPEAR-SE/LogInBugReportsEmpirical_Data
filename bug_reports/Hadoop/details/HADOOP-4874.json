If so, it can be bit faster on decompression, and a lot faster on compression.\nNumbers I saw (this is just initial testing) indicated up to twice as fast compression, and maybe 30% faster decompress.\nCompression ratio is not as good; whereas gzip would give raties of 81/93/97% (for content size of 2k/20k/200k), LZF would give 66/72/72% (ie. compresses down to 34/28/28% of original). Which is still pretty good of course.\nThese with JSON data.\n\nLZF is block-based algorithm just like all others, including gzip, and is about as easy to wrap in input/output streams.\n\nI hope to find time to actually wrap existing code into bit better packaging (wrt buffer reuse and other optimizations). If so, it could be a reusable component. That may take some time, but in the meantime, source link above allows others to try out code as well if they want to.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cowtowncoder","name":"cowtowncoder","key":"cowtowncoder","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tatu Saloranta","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-11-24T07:35:52.922+0000","updated":"2009-11-24T07:35:52.922+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410749/comment/12781811","id":"12781811","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Tatu, we'd really appreciate if you could open a jira for LZF and contribute a patch... thanks!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-24T07:50:09.176+0000","updated":"2009-11-24T07:50:09.176+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410749/comment/12782211","id":"12782211","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cowtowncoder","name":"cowtowncoder","key":"cowtowncoder","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tatu Saloranta","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Ok, I created [HADOOP-6389] specifically for LZF.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cowtowncoder","name":"cowtowncoder","key":"cowtowncoder","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tatu Saloranta","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-11-24T22:31:20.258+0000","updated":"2009-11-24T22:31:20.258+0000"}],"maxResults":15,"total":15,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-4874/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0i5wn:"}}
