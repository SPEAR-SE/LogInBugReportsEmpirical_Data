Here's the summary of a correct (I believe) fix:\n\n- To avoid deadlock we need a lock ordering\n- We'll order instance locks before class locks (ie you must never lock an instance when holding a class lock)\n\nThe issue is that addDefaultResource is currently static synchronized and locks a class instance by calling conf.reloadConfiguration (synchronized non-static)\n\nAttaching a patch which breaks this synchronization by holding the lock only long enough to make a defensive copy of the shared list. I don't think this is a performance issue since addDefaultResource is called very rarely.\n\nTests pass. Will test on the application that keeps turning up this bug here.

It is iterated over more number of times - typically every time a configuration instance is loaded in the application.
