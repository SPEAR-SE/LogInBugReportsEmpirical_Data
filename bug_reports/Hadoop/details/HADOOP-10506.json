When changing a LimitedPrivate API, we should aware that the depended components, which may sit outside core, should still work with the change.  In some cases, we may also make change to the depended components.  LimitedPrivate does not imply backwards compatibility since the LimitedPrivate APIs could be Unstable.

Or Public APIs are not allowed using LimitedPrivate.  (Then, it is a bug as you mentioned but it does not mean LimitedPrivate annotation not useful.)\n\nAnyway, I do agree that we do not define LimitedPrivate very carefully so that there are confusions in these special cases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-15T20:08:32.398+0000","updated":"2014-04-15T20:08:32.398+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708587/comment/13970028","id":"13970028","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"bq.

The problem is if we ignore backwards compatibility when changing classes marked LimitedPrivate used by downstream components then we are creating a knife-switch type of upgrade, where upgrading the Hadoop core requires a simultaneous corresponding update of hive/pig/hbase/pick-your-favorite-LimitedPrivate-user.\n\nNote that {{LimitedPrivate}} is a workaround of the lack of a strong concept of  symbol visibility in Java. It is a contract that is enforced voluntarily, but not by the compiler. What it means is that classes with this annotation are not supposed to be visible to the dependent projects. This is a contract between hadoop-core and dependent projects.\n\nPlease consider the following scenarios:\n\n# My code uses Java reflection to get an instance of {{BlockReaderLocal}}, which is a class only visible in the same package. The Java compiler will check for that.\n# My code uses {{RemoteBlockReader2}}, which is annotated with {{InterfaceAudience.Private}}. The compiler won't check whether the code violates the contract of visibility.\n\nNote that in both cases they break the exact same contract of visibility. The only difference is that whether the Java compiler can check for it. If you agree that I probably should fix for (1), because \"I'm doing it with my own risks\", how come I can dodge the responsibility of fixing for (2), which is almost identical to the scenario described in this jira?\n\nI understand that hadoop-core might not have the cleanest separation of public / private APIs, and it is important to be compatible. Having the options of being incompatible, however, is critical to move forward in projects like hadoop-core. I think a more reasonable approach is to drive some of the APIs to be public and to clarify the contracts of compatibility between hadoop-core and dependent projects, but not removing the contract and losing the option of being incompatible in minor releases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-15T22:22:41.753+0000","updated":"2014-04-15T22:22:41.753+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708587/comment/13970243","id":"13970243","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Also to clarify,  I do understand that the limitedprivate was probably added for historical reasons (the api's weren't properly categorized before) so components used them.  We have made great improvements to get them categorized for the official 2.2 release and we couldn't get everything fixed up due to timing.\n\nSo perhaps the title of the jira isn't correct and should be updated.  Personally I think the following should be done:\n\n1) clarify documentation what limitedPrivate is. This means us internally agreeing on what it really means. \n2) No new classes/interfaces should use this tag. They should be properly classified as either public or private. If there was a bug and class not properly tagged its fine to use there.\n3) All existing classes with this tag should be eventually be deprecated and we should work towards that.  I realize this isn't going to happen immediately as everyone has to balance this with features and other bug fixes.\n\nIf one component is using the interface more then likely its useful for other components and more then likely other components are already using it.   Thus in my opinion the documentation of listing the component its private to isn't very useful. \n\nThe longer we wait with this the more applications (in the case of yarn) and components will use these api's and it will be harder to change them.  Yes we can say it was marked a certain way and the other components shouldn't have used it but when its ambiguous like this and we don't provide an equivalent Public api I don't see how we can defend that.  Also as more and more components are created it gets harder and harder to upgrade/deploy them all at once.  Hence why all the push for HA and rolling upgrades. Customers don't want downtime.\n\nI do agree we need to have the option for moving forward.  But I think this can be done with a proper set of Public apis.\n\nThe reason I ran into this was because I am writing an application to run on yarn and also another one to just read HDFS files.

If there was a bug and class not properly tagged its fine to use there.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-05-20T14:07:21.075+0000","updated":"2014-05-20T14:07:21.075+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708587/comment/14607168","id":"14607168","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-06-30T04:44:52.996+0000","updated":"2015-06-30T04:44:52.996+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-10506/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1unhr:"}}
