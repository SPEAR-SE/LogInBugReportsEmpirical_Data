The issues on DataNode and Client are similar but similar fix can not work, because on DataNode the responder needs properly write its state upstream and Client needs to properly read all the remaining data on the socket from first datanode.\n\nThe main issue is that BlockReceiver thread (and DataStreamer in the case of DFSClient) {{interrupt()}} the 'responder' thread. But interrupting is a pretty coarse control. We don't know what state the responder is in and interrupting has different effects depending on responder state.
