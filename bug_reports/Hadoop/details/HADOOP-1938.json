Block placement needs to traverse the network topology to find good candidates. When a cluster is almost full, it needs to traverse much more number of datanodes before it declares failure. So it fails very slowly and wastes a lot of CPU time. \n\nWhat can be done is to remove a datanode from the network topology when it becomes full and then add it back to the network topology when it has some space available. So when a cluster becomes almost full, the network topology has much less number of datanodes.
