This makes it very predictable (as to which JVM will run which task) \n2) The above makes the TaskTracker.getTask simple. We just need to look up the mapping created earlier as opposed to iterating over the set of INITIALIZED tasks.\n3) Due to the above, the task state, INITIALIZED, is now redundant and has been removed.\n4) Tweaked the logic for the JVM sleep when there is nothing to execute a bit. Now the JVM goes to a longer sleep (1500 millisec) if it doesn't get a task to run even after 5 consecutive calls to getTask (at 500 millisec interval each). This strategy helps a lot when there are small tasks and the JVM just misses a task because it isn't initialized yet, and goes to a long sleep..\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-09-29T14:17:48.893+0000","updated":"2008-09-29T14:17:48.893+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404783/comment/12635486","id":"12635486","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Passing through hudson","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-09-29T18:48:59.671+0000","updated":"2008-09-29T18:48:59.671+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12404783/comment/12635678","id":"12635678","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 with minor caveats:\n\n1.
