The name is /mapredsystem/hostname. JobTracker creates this at startup time, but doesn't delete it when killed. However, when another jobtracker starts on the same hostname, it seems to be trying to clean it up in some way, and the current permissions set by JobTracker code prevent a read from happening, which is why there's a failure.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n1. The directory is world-readable. In HADOOP-1873, Doug commented that this should not be world-readable, so I guess this is not an option, for some reason.\n2. JobTracker can delete the directory when it is shutdown. This seems, IMO, the best solution. Whoever creates, deletes.\n3. HOD can create a directory that's specific to the user, something like mapredsystem/user-name.clusterid, where clusterid could be like a torque jobid. This may create a huge number of directories in HDFS, don't know if that's an issue. Otherwise, this is probably the *easiest* solution to implement\n4. HOD can delete the mapredsystem directory at deallocation. This seems wrong, because it doesn't create it, and further, given our current design, this is very hard to implement.\n5. JobTracker can avoid cleaning up the directory at startup. This may not be safe, in case there's a crash or something.\n\nComments ?

If done in addition to 2, this might actually remove the doubt I asked, about number of DFS directories created. In current configuration of torque, the situation of a clash will not arise, because we don't allow nodes to be allocated for more than one cluster. But its definitely better not to assume this.\n\nJust in case 2 is not done for some reason, this problem would be addressed, except for my doubt. Can someone shed some light on that ? Is it preferable to not have too many directories created in dfs ? (Note these will be empty once the cluster is deallocated - so no files).\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-02-28T04:52:00.938+0000","updated":"2008-02-28T04:52:00.938+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12389602/comment/12574441","id":"12574441","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I think there is consensus that Hadoop JobTracker should delete the mapred system directory, and that HOD should name directories to avoid clashes.

Logically, the mapred system directory is something that the admin would set up in a static job tracker case. In that case, he would be responsible for  managing this. In the HOD world, HOD is playing this role and generating the mapred system directory. Hence, it feels like it should set up and clean it. However, in the current design of HOD, this is not very easy to do in a short time. Therefore, I am moving this to be fixed in Hadoop 0.17 in HOD. In the meantime, we can write a simple utility to clean up these directories periodically. The impact of not doing it immediately is reduced with such a utility / script.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-03-06T10:52:05.897+0000","updated":"2008-03-06T10:52:05.897+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12389602/comment/12580460","id":"12580460","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Attached patch adds code to the hodcleanup process to delete the mapred system directory. \n- The hodring process passes arguments required for the deletion (process id of the job tracker, namenode url, path to the hadoop command, and the name of the mapred system directory) to the hodcleanup process. \n- The hodcleaup process first waits until the jobtracker is down. It waits by checking for the job tracker process to end.\n- Then it issues a hadoop dfs -fs namenode-url -rmr mapredsystemdir\n\nAnother change made in this patch is the way the namenode url is specified while copying logs to the dfs as part of the hod cleanup process.\n\nAdded a few tests.
