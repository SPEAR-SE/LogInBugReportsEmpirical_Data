It is the following:\n\nreal service listening at host1:10000 with principal foo/host1 crashes.\nfake service starts listening at host1:10000 with principal bar/host1, and it advertises its principal is bar/host1.\n\ngranted this requires a bar/host1 keytab.\n\nI have not looked at the patch, so I don't know what safeguards it has. Can you confirm the behavior in the following 2 scenarios?\n\n1. Does the client accept an arbitrary principal without a service host name? the server advertising 'bar' as principal, no hostname.\n\nI think the client should not accept this alternate.\n\n2. Does the client accept an alternate advertised with the a different shortname than one used originally by the client? using example above: original server principal submitted by the client foo/host1, advertised server principal bar/host1.\n\nI think we should reject that scenario, as it would cover the case when keytabs for foo/* principals are not compromised. So an alternate o foo/host1a would be ok but a bar/host1 would not.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-08-16T04:03:31.526+0000","updated":"2013-08-16T04:03:31.526+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663425/comment/13742086","id":"13742086","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #303 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/303/])\nHADOOP-9868.
