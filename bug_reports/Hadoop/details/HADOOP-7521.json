But in any case, I will make it explicit by suggesting a \"workaround\" for *inconsiderate packaging* (whatever that means :-).\n\nEvery project should untar into <project-name>-<version-number> directory. (Since tar is a short form of \"tape archive\", and tapes historically had a write-once-read-many property, a tar has exactly the same layout when expanded. So, if a tar is named xyz.tar, it has the same bits as any other xyz.tar, irrespective of the media it was stored on. If the name is the same, I feel comfortable expanding it again and again, because I am sure of that untarring is idempotent.)\n\nUser (in this case, untarrer) sets an environment variable \"PROJECTNAME_HOME=/full/path/to/<project-name>-<version-number>\". For example, HADOOP_COMMON_HOME=/opt/local/hadoop-common-0.22.0, and PIG_HOME=/opt/local/pig-0.9, etc. Then, as long as the binaries are found in $XYZ_HOME/bin, and jars are found in $XYZ_HOME/libexec, and dependencies are found in $XYZ_HOME/lib, and configs are found in $XYZ_HOME/config, one can write scripts that check for the presence of $XYZ_HOME and adjust locations accordingly.\n\nIf $XYZ_HOME is not set, path is checked for the presence of the primary executable, such as \"hadoop\" for HADOOP, HDFS, and MAPREDUCE, and \"pig\" for PIG. If it is symlinked, the origin is discovered, and $XYZ_HOME is discovered based on that. For example, if the shell script \"hadoop\" is in /opt/local/bin, which is in path, and it is a symlink from /opt/hstack/hadoop-0.22.0/bin/hadoop, then /opt/hstack/hadoop-0.22.0 is taken to be $HADOOP_HOME, and rest of the links are resolved accordingly.\n\nThe point is, for the last 40 years, people are accustomed to certain conventions. So let's not try to trash those conventions, unless we have to, and this case does not demand trashing conventions.\n\nRight ?\n\n(I think I have spent more time on this than it deserves. So this is my last comment on this issue.)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=milindb","name":"milindb","key":"milindb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Milind Bhandarkar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-08-08T03:18:39.636+0000","updated":"2011-08-08T03:18:39.636+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518051/comment/13080751","id":"13080751","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Milind, your recommendation described 80% of Hadoop 0.21 structure with few modification.  Unfortunately, this is not scalable when deploying several dozen of software.  Managing 10-30 environment variables for all users across thousands of machines.  This approach becomes non trivial and unlikely to survive long term upgrades.  This is the reason that we are creating the new layout which aligns with rpm/deb package layout.  My intention is not to force the new layout on existing system, rather, this package layout is used for constructing rpm/deb packages.  You should be more interested in HADOOP-7498 if you want to preserve $*_HOME in the release tarball rather than binary tarball.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-08-08T05:05:20.967+0000","updated":"2011-08-08T05:05:20.967+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518051/comment/13081100","id":"13081100","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Closing this as \"not a problem\".
