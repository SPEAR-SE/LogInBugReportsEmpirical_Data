Now that HADOOP-12555 has introduced the ability to protect the access keys for wasb we suddenly need access to wasb to get the database keys which initiates the attempt to get the access keys from wasb - since there is a provider path configured for sqoop.\n\nFor such integrations, those in which it doesn't make sense to protect the access keys inside the thing that we need the keys to access, we need a solution to avoid this recursion - other than dictating what filesystems can be used by other components.\n\nThis patch proposes the ability to scrub the configured provider path of any provider types that would be incompatible with the integration point. In other words, before calling Configuration.getPassword for the access keys to wasb, we can remove any configured providers that require access to wasb.\n\nThis will require some regex expressions

This will require some regex expressions that can be used to identify the configuration of such provider uri's within the provider path parameter.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think regex matching alone would solve the problem completely.  The challenge is that our configuration magic allows different deployments to use different scheme names in file system URIs to refer to the same {{FileSystem}} implementation.\n\nIn the example you gave, the \"wasb\" scheme maps to {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure.NativeAzureFileSystem}}.  This is the default scheme as defined within the code of {{NativeAzureFileSystem}}.  However, it's also possible that someone has used custom configuration to map a different scheme name to the same class.  For example:\n\n{code}\n<property>\n  <name>fs.customfs.impl</name>\n  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure.NativeAzureFileSystem</value>\n</property>\n{code}\n\nWith that configuration in place, a credential provider URI with \"jceks://customfs/...\" would hit the same problem, but a regex match against \"wasb\" wouldn't exclude it.\n\nI think a complete solution would somehow have to figure out the real mapping of scheme to file system class from configuration, and then do the exclusion based on class instead of scheme.  The method {{FileSystem#getFileSystemClass(String, Configuration)}} might be helpful here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-02-26T20:35:11.136+0000","updated":"2016-02-26T20:35:11.136+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12944968/comment/15169821","id":"15169821","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"[~cnauroth] - if someone does map a custom scheme name - does the default one not work at all?\nI wondering whether we could - at least in the near term - just say that provider URIs need to use the default scheme names.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2016-02-26T21:11:33.019+0000","updated":"2016-02-26T21:11:33.019+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12944968/comment/15169925","id":"15169925","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~lmccay], the default scheme (the one returned by however the {{FileSystem}} chooses to override the {{getScheme}} method) continues to work even in the presence of additional custom mappings.

This looks great overall!  I have a few small comments.\n\n{code}\n  public static Configuration excludeIncompatibleCredentialProviders(\n      Configuration config, Class fileSystemClass) throws IOException {\n    ...\n        Class<?> clazz = null;\n        try {\n          String scheme = path.toUri().getScheme();\n          clazz = FileSystem.getFileSystemClass(scheme, config);\n    ...\n{code}\n\nI think we can improve type safety in the above code by changing the type of {{fileSystemClass}} and {{clazz}} to {{Class<? extends FileSystem>}}.  The call to {{FileSystem#getFileSystemClass}} always returns {{Class<? extends FileSystem>}}.  It would never be valid to call this method and pass a {{Class}} that doesn't satisfy that type constraint.  With the suggested change, that would be enforced at compile time.\n\n{code}\n            LOG.warn(\"Filesystem based provider\" +\n                \" excluded from provider path due to recursive dependency: \"\n                + provider);\n{code}\n\nI'd like to suggest logging this at debug level instead of warn.  In some deployments, this might not be an unusual condition.  If something like Sqoop uses a credential provider for a database password, then logging this at warn could potentially display it to the console on every Sqoop invocation, which wouldn't be a good user experience.\n\n{code}\n      } catch (URISyntaxException e) {\n        LOG.warn(\"Credential Provider URI is invalid.\" + provider);\n      }\n{code}\n\nIs logging a warning and trying to proceed the right thing to do here, or should a bad URI cause an abort by throwing an exception?\n\nDo you want to update S3A to use the new {{ProviderUtils}} method too?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-02-27T22:06:36.643+0000","updated":"2016-02-27T22:06:36.643+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12944968/comment/15170738","id":"15170738","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Hey [~cnauroth] - thanks for the review.\n\nI was letting the bad URI go through and get caught by the credential provider factory rather than stop things here.\nI also intended to follow up with a separate patch for s3a - I can add it in here instead if you think that is better.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2016-02-27T22:12:06.968+0000","updated":"2016-02-27T22:12:06.968+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12944968/comment/15170739","id":"15170739","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
