My thoughts are:\n# This is a minor code cleanup, so lets not break the API compatibility. Lets deprecate this method and add a comment about using the other method instead of this. Remove this method in a later release.\n# In 2.x release, we are striving for API stabilization. Given that applications need to recompile anyway against 2.x, lets make this change. Given compatibility issue is flagged during compile time, it should be easy for applications to change.\n\nI am leaning towards (2) and hence going ahead with this Java API incompatibility.

To ensure compatibility and adhere to our deprecation rules, we deprecate 'a' and add 'b', as long as the method can be overloaded with both the signatures 'a' and 'b'. This usually works fine when the signature changes are in parameters. However, when the signature changes are in adding/removing Exceptions or the return type itself, it can't be overloaded - so we can't have two versions 'a' and 'b' of the method at the same time.\n\nbranch-1 and branch-2 have the following API:\n{code}  \n  public static int chmod(String filename, String perm\n                          ) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\n    return chmod(filename, perm, false);\n  }\n{code}\n\nIdeally, we would like to do the following, but can't.\n{code}  \n  @Deprecated\n  public static int chmod(String filename, String perm\n                          ) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\n    return chmod(filename, perm, false);\n  }\n\n  public static int chmod(String filename, String perm\n                          ) throws IOException {\n    return chmod(filename, perm, false);\n  }\n{code}\n\nMy proposal is to allow such API source incompatible changes in a major release, without the need for deprecation.
