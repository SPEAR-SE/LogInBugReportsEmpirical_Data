The original idea was to store the block generation stamp inside the meta file of each block. One major disadvantage of this approach is that generation of a block report requires that each meta file be opened and the generation stamp read from it. With about 50K blocks per datanode and a seek time of 10 ms, this might require 300 seconds. This means that the time to restart a cluster cannot be lesser than this 300 seconds.\n\nA few other alternatives:\n1. Encode the generation stamp into the name of the metafile. Each metafile will look like blkxxxxxx.genstamp.meta. The block file will remain the same.\n\n2. Encode the generation stamp into the name of the block file. Each block file will be of the form blkxxxxxx.genstamp. The metafile will remain the same.\n\n3. Encode the generation stamp into the name of a new zero-size file named blkxxxxx.genstamp. The block file and the metadata file will remain the same.\n\n4. A completely separate file (one per datanode) that records the metadata of all blocks in the datanode.\n\nI propose that we implement option 1.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2008-03-08T00:18:44.165+0000","updated":"2008-03-08T00:18:44.165+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12386626/comment/12587626","id":"12587626","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This patch does the following:\n\n1.

The only problem here is with prehistoric (according to Dhruba, HADOOP-1700, HADOOP-146,  HADOOP-158) blocks. \n\nReminder: a block is *prehistoric* if it is reported to the system after its id was reassigned to another physical block.\nThis happens when a data-node is down for a rather long period of time during which 2 things happen: \n# a block that it owns is removed and then\n# a new block is created with the same block id.\n\nThis leads to data corruption, but this can be avoided if *block ids are generated sequentially* rather than randomly.\nAFAIR, the only reason for not converting to sequential ids was that we were afraid of getting into a rather massive (distributed) upgrade that renames all blocks in the system. This patch leads exactly to such an upgrade, and I think it is the right time to adopt the right id generation practice.\nThe advantage here is that we will be able to store a (smaller) generation stamp (if any) per file rather than per block.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-04-18T18:30:07.457+0000","updated":"2008-04-18T18:30:07.457+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12386626/comment/12591056","id":"12591056","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Incorporates most of Konstantin's comments.

Run random writer, sort, and then sort validation. Then shutdown cluster. Install version 0.18 build on the cluster. Start cluster with the -upgrade option.\n     Expected behavior: The Namenode should trigger an upgrade on all Datanodes. Then the Namenode should exit safe mode automatically. Run sort validation again to verify that data is intact.\n\nT2 Start a DFS Upgrade and restart Namenode during the upgrade.\n    Expected Behaviour:  Upgrade should proceed normally with appropriate messages in Namenode log \n\nT3 Start a DFS upgrade and restart some of the Datanodes while the upgrade is occurring. \n     Expected behaviour: Upgrade should proceed normally with appropriate messages in Datenode logs.\n\n T4 Start an upgrade and stop two Datanodes. \n      Expected Behavior: Upgrade should complete successfully because at least one replica of every block should still be available.\n\nT4 Start an upgrade and stop half of the Datanodes. \n      Expected Behavior: Upgrade should stall because at least one replica of every block would not be available. Verify that useful message is displayed in the Namenode logs.\n\nT5 Start a DFS upgrade and let it complete successfully. Then issue the admin command to finalize the upgrade.\n     Excepted Behavior: The Namenode should be able to finalize the cluster.\n\nT5 Same as T4. Once the upgrade completes successfully, bring up the two Datanodes that were shut down earlier.\n      Expected behavior: These two Datanodes should start their own upgrades. Note that the Namenode could have already replicated these blocks.\n\nT6 Same at T1 but with more aggressive periodic block scanner by setting dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours to 1. \n      Expected Behavior: Upgrade should succeed. Look at the Datanode log file to verify that no bad blocks were found by the periodic block scanner.\n\nT7 Same as T1.
