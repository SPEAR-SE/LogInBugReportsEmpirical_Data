I propose to generalize this so that you can specify the name and a subset of the tags - saving the client code the burden of having to remember all the tag/values that it has used.  This doesn't change any API signatures, but it changes the meaning of MetricsRecord.remove().\n\n[2] Also, as a convenience, I propose to add a method MetricsRecord.removeTag(String tagName).  This method would be added to the MetricsRecordImpl class in the spi package also.  This enables the use pattern:\n\n   On module initialization:\n       create a metrics record named foo\n       set long-lived tag (e.g. job id)\n\n   Then repeatedly:\n       set short-lived tags (e.g. counter name)\n       set metric values\n       call MetricsRecord.update\n\n   And finally, on cleanup:\n       remove the short-lived tags\n       call MetricsRecord.remove to clean up all the metric data created\n\nBoth of these should be binary compatible changes for people using the public package o.a.h.metrics.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dbowen","name":"dbowen","key":"dbowen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David
