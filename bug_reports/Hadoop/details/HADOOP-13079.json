In Linux, {{/bin/ls}} will not print control characters by default.  you must pass the {{--show-control-characters}} option in order to see them.  From the man page:\n\n{code}\n       --show-control-chars\n              show non graphic characters as-is (default unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)\n{code}\n\n{{ls}} blasting raw control characters into an interactive terminal is a very bad idea.  It leads to some very serious security vulnerabilities because commonly used software like {{xterm}}, {{GNU screen}}, {{tmux}} and so forth interpret control characters.  Using control characters, you can convince these pieces of software to execute arbitrary code.  See http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=104612710031920&q=p3 and https://www.proteansec.com/linux/blast-past-executing-code-terminal-emulators-via-escape-sequences/  There are even CVEs for some of these issues.\n\nWe should make the default opt-in for printing control characters in our next compatibility-breaking release (Hadoop 3.x).\n\nbq. In C, isatty(STDOUT_FILENO) is used to find out whether the output is a terminal. Since Java doesn't have isatty, I will use JNI to call C isatty() because the closest test System.console() == null does not work in some cases.\n\nIt would really be nice if we could determine this without using JNI, because it's often not available.  Under what conditions does the {{System.console() == null}} check not work?  The only case I was able to find in a quick Google search was inside an eclipse console.  That seems like a case where the security issues would not be a concern, because it's a debugging environment.  Are there other cases where the non-JNI check would fail?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

Dumping control characters out on an interactive terminal is a security vulnerability\n\nIt is, but changing ls' behavior isn't going to fix that vulnerability.  There's a reason why all of those links up there you quoted talk about terminals and terminal emulation and what is actually vulnerable without identifying specific vulnerabilities in specific commands.\n\nbq.  I can't think of a single reason why we would want this to be the default.\n\nYup, I can't think of why -q should be the default either... but more importantly, neither could POSIX to the point that it demanded the standard have -q be the default.

Yup, I can't think of why -q should be the default either... but more importantly, neither could POSIX to the point that it demanded the standard have -q be the default.\n\nPlease do not misquote what I said.  I was arguing that echoing control characters to the terminal should not be the default behavior.  You are arguing the opposite.\n\nbq. ... until such a point that they print the filename to the screen to show what files are being processed. At which point this change has accomplished absolutely nothing. Changing ls is security theater.\n\nThere are a lot of scripts that interact with HDFS via FsShell.  These scripts will never \"print the filename to the screen\" or if they do, it will be a filename that they got from {{ls}} itself which does not contain control characters.\n\nI could come up with examples of how this is helpful all day if needed.  Here's another one: Some sysadmin logs in and does an {{hadoop fs -ls}} of a directory created by {{\\$BADGUY}}. Should the filename be able use control characters to hijack the admin's GNU screen session and execute arbitrary code?  I would say no, what do you say?\n\nbq. Are we going to change cat too?\n\nMost system administrators will not {{cat}} a file without checking what type it is.  It is well-known that catting an unknown file could mess up the terminal.  On the other hand, most system administrators do not think that running {{ls}} on a directory could be a security risk.  Linux and other well known operating systems also do not protect users from this, so there are no pre-existing expectations of protection.\n\nbq. Then stop bringing up (traditional) UNIX if you feel it isn't relevant and especially when you've used the term incorrectly.\n\nThere are a huge number of sysadmins who grew up with the GNU tools, which do have the behavior we're describing here.  It's a powerful argument for implementing that behavior.  When you add the fact that it fixes security vulnerabilities, it's an extremely compelling argument.\n\nI think it's clear that this change does have a big positive effect in many scenarios, does fix real-world security flaws, and does accord with the expectations of most system administrators.  That's three powerful reasons to do it.  I can find no valid counter-argument for any of these reasons anywhere in these comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.

After all, wc, find, du, ... tons of other UNIX commands will happily print out terminal escape sequences with no option to turn them off. It is, however, problematic for traditional ftpd implementations since it's a great way to inject buffer overflows and then get root on a remote server.\n\nThis behavior is exploitable.  That makes it a security bug, even if lots of traditional UNIX commands have it.\n\nJust because a behavior is traditional doesn't mean it's right.  There was a time when UNIX programs used {{gets()}} everywhere.  When the world became a less trusting place, they had to be fixed not to do that.  We should understand the motivations behind historical decisions before blindly copying them.\n\nbq. ... and my answer is the same as it was almost a decade ago, in some HDFS JIRA somewhere, where a related topic came up before: HDFS would be better served by having a limit on what consists of a legal file and directory name. With an unlimited namespace, it's impossible to test against and impossible to protect every scenario in which oddball characters show up. What's legal in one locale may not be legal in another.\n\nThat's a very good suggestion.  I think we should tackle that for Hadoop 3.\n\nbq. Also, are you prepared to file a CVE for every single time Hadoop prints out a directory or file name to the screen? There are probably hundreds if not thousands of places, obvious ones like 'fs -count' and less obvious ones like 'yarn logs'. This is a 'tilting at windmills' problem. It is MUCH better to have ls blow up than be taken by surprise by something else later on.\n\nThe problem is, {{ls}} isn't necessarily going to \"blow up,\" just display something odd, or even cause your xterm to run arbitrary code by abusing escape sequences.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
