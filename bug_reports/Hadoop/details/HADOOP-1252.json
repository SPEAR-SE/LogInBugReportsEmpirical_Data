before trying to copy a map output on the reduces since we know the length of the map output file apriori.

If multiple entities are using the disk for writing (maps and reduces), then we might hit the problem of insufficient disk space a while down the line (we don't know apriori what the size of map output would be).

When we are given a path to \"read\" we check each disk to locate the path. New APIs have been added in FileUtil called getLocalPathForWrite and getLocalPathForRead. The write API takes an optional size argument. If the disk that a Map task is currently using happens to run out of disk space (for e.g., if two tasks are using the same disk) then the Map task fails as usual. In the case of Reduce tasks a particular instance of a fetch may fail but the task itself won't fail unless it doesn't find any available disk. However, for merges, the reduce task would fail if while spilling the data to the returned disk, the disk runs out of space (similar to the map tasks case).\nAlso added APIs in MapOutputFile for creating map/shuffle files and equivalent APIs for reading those. Also replaced calls to Configuration.getLocalPath to use the new MapOutputFile APIs wherever possible and in some cases to use the new FileUtil APIs.\n\nComments?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2007-04-25T13:22:00.218+0000","updated":"2007-04-25T13:22:00.218+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12367055/comment/12492345","id":"12492345","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Changed the patch to have the disk logic in Configuration.java.

So now Configuration.java has a new class called DiskAllocator that exposes public methods getLocalPathToRead(path), getLocalPathForWrite(path, size), getLocalPathForWrite(path). I haven't touched the part of the code that does caching and downloads jar files from the dfs, etc. This patch is meant to handle the disk failures better for the map outputs, shuffle, merge, and final reduce inputs. Making changes to the caching part to tolerate disk failures can probably be a separate jira issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2007-04-27T17:30:19.154+0000","updated":"2007-04-27T17:30:19.154+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12367055/comment/12492351","id":"12492351","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1\n\nhttp://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12356420/1252.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r533013.\n\nTest results:   http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/91/testReport/\nConsole output: http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/91/console","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-04-27T17:50:35.983+0000","updated":"2007-04-27T17:50:35.983+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12367055/comment/12492920","id":"12492920","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This looks good, but DirAllocator should not be nested in Configuration.java.
