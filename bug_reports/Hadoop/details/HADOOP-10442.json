The man page doesn't describe any negative return codes other than -1.\n\n{code}\nRETURN VALUE\n       If the number of groups of which user is a member is less than or equal to *ngroups, then the value *ngroups is returned.\n\n       If the user is a member of more than *ngroups groups, then getgrouplist() returns -1.  In this case the value returned in *ngroups can  be  used  to\n       resize the buffer passed to a further call getgrouplist().\n{code}\n\nWhat negative return code did you see besides -1?  I guess what you're seeing is undocumented, and possibly a bug in nslcd (or the man page?)\n\nAlso, looking at this more closely, I believe we mishandle the case where the user is a member of no groups.  This would be a pretty odd configuration (I wonder if it's possible?).

All other cases might be considered as errors.  I saw cases of an admin user getting permission refused for certain operations. It was fixed after the refresh command was issued.  It must have hit the no-group error when building the acl and the result was negatively cached. If it didn't do negative caching, user-level retries would have worked.\n\nSo, the solution might be letting the native code return 0 even on error conditions as you suggested, but making netgroup modules not do negative caching.
