In FileSystemTestHelper, does the final keyword need to be removed?\nWe need this because we want to be able to override the value by tests ({{TestFSMainOperationsWebHdfs}} is one example). This path is not always used in the context of the local path, and this causes problems on Windows, as paths like {{c:/some/path/build/test/data}} are not valid DFS paths (because of the colon).\n\nbq. In TestFSMainOperationsLocalFileSystem, are any changes actually needed? Ie. why override just to call super?\nI think I saw this test failing on Windows because the super {{tearDown()}} was not called, causing subsequent tests to fail (could it be related to junit version?). Will try to repro the problem and report back.\n\nbq. In all of test class changes, please default to build/test/data. Hardcoding /tmp may cause multiple test runs to collide.\nThis is actually the test fix. Similar comment to #1, {{build.test.data}} is a local path and given that it is used in HDFS tests, it fails the valid DFS path check. IOW, these tests should not write to the local file system, and if I understood your worry correctly, should not collide with other tests. We also have the test name embedded in the path, so it should be easy to spot such cases if they exists.
