This is because both modes (with and without UGI) are still valid and hence it would be more convenient and fewer changes to code if we can create the overloaded API.\n- Can you please correct the comment on checkAccess, to remove references to ownerAllowed, as it is no longer used. This is not introduced in this patch, but since you are modifying the comment, it may make sense to correct this as well.\n- In the test cases, why is dfs.permissions set to false ? Is it because the credentials of the new job (with invalid ACLs) is being submitted as a different user and hence there will be problems to write to dfs ? Does this happen, even though you are not using the MiniDFSCluster ?\n- A general question is about whether any cleanup is required for the job which fails ACLs. For instance, should we delete the job folder in the system directory, delete the history files etc ? I am not sure if it is required.

In a majority of the cases, this action alone will prevent the problem from happening in the first place. However, this is only in addition to the changes in the patch as they are still needed to take care of cases where the job tracker could be restarted before the clean up thread has had a chance to delete the system directory completely.\n\nRegarding cleanup, there seem to be two different cases here:\n\n- The job was never submitted in the first place\n- The job was running in the first place, and after restart it can no longer run because the ACLs were changed. \n\nI think the patch is cleanly handling the first case (with the comments incorporated). In the second case, ideally the job should be killed by the JobTracker so that all parts related to the job (system directory, running tasks, cleanup task, etc) are cleaned up properly. I am thinking handling the second case (which ideally should be rare) should be a separate jira.

Few comments:\n\n- I think we should not do the cleanup from the system directory in the job tracker restart case. Like I wrote earlier on, I think this should follow the same path as a job being killed. In that case, the system directory may be cleaned up as part of the job completion, and may be needed until then.\n- Can we rename getJobDirectory to getSystemJobDir() or something similar ?\n- I think we need a test case in TestQueueManager which will check that the system directory is being cleaned up upon unsuccessful job submission due to ACLs. The check for the system directory being deleted in TestRecoveryManager will not be needed.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-03-11T10:11:55.259+0000","updated":"2009-03-11T10:11:55.259+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12415580/comment/12681160","id":"12681160","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching a patch incorporating Hemanth's comments.
