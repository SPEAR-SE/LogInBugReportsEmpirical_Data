It turns out that both the Linux implementation and the Windows implementation headed for branch-trunk-win have this problem.\n\nPasting my comments from HADOOP-9232:\n\nIs the following code not thread-safe?\n\n{code}\n...\nstatic jobjectArray emptyGroups = NULL;\n...\n  if (emptyGroups == NULL) {\n    jobjectArray lEmptyGroups = (jobjectArray)(*env)->NewObjectArray(env, 0,\n            (*env)->FindClass(env, \"java/lang/String\"), NULL);\n    if (lEmptyGroups == NULL) {\n      goto cleanup;\n    }\n    emptyGroups = (*env)->NewGlobalRef(env, lEmptyGroups);\n    if (emptyGroups == NULL) {\n      goto cleanup;\n    }\n  }\n{code}\n\nFor example, assume 2 threads concurrently call getGroupForUser. Thread 1 executes the NULL check, enters the if body, and then gets suspended by the OS. Thread 2 executes and emptyGroups is still NULL, so it initializes it. Then, the OS resumes thread 1, which proceeds inside the if body and calls NewObjectArray again. Since emptyGroups never gets freed, I believe the net effect would be a small memory leak.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-16T00:33:40.097+0000","updated":"2013-02-16T00:33:40.097+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12632678/comment/13593827","id":"13593827","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree it is not thread safe.\n\nThe problem is mitigated a bit because \"getGroups()\" and \"emptyGroups\" are both instance members not class members.\n\nDo we require this class to be thread safe from its use pattern?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-05T19:47:48.290+0000","updated":"2013-03-05T19:47:48.290+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12632678/comment/13616394","id":"13616394","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"We expect the patch submitted on HADOOP-9439 to fix this memory leak for the Unix version of the code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-28T16:21:53.583+0000","updated":"2013-03-28T16:21:53.583+0000"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HADOOP-9312/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1i1lz:"}}
