If it's negotiate, then it means you don't have kerberos credentials.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-03-12T23:05:02.532+0000","updated":"2014-03-12T23:05:02.532+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12699843/comment/13934048","id":"13934048","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> If you get a 200 OK, that always means you are authenticated. ...\n\nOkay, then it seems that bug is in the server side but not in KerberosAuthenticator.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-13T21:01:49.175+0000","updated":"2014-03-13T21:01:49.175+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12699843/comment/13934079","id":"13934079","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"[~szetszwo], could you get the HTTP traffic both ways of the interactions?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2014-03-13T21:15:59.683+0000","updated":"2014-03-13T21:15:59.683+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12699843/comment/13934085","id":"13934085","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Alejandro, [~bowenzhangusa] is working on it.

They should not do that.\n\nbq.  like Robert Kanter mentioned above, \"oozie.service.AuthorizationService.security.enabled\" and \"oozie.authentication.simple.anonymous.allowed\" are not mutually exclusive from oozie product point of view. When we allow anonymous request and enable authorization at the same time, we are merely saying anonymous users can view the web console or other job info, it's just we enforce only the owner and admin can kill/modify a job. The \"anonymous\" config has more to do with viewing oozie webconsole and the \"authorization\" config has more to do with who can modify a job,\n\nAre we dealing here with the special authentication handling based on user-agent?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2014-03-21T05:54:27.763+0000","updated":"2014-03-21T05:54:27.763+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12699843/comment/13943219","id":"13943219","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bowenzhangusa","name":"bowenzhangusa","key":"bowenzhangusa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bowen Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~tucu00], when we disable anonymous request, the code works since\n{code}\nif (conn.getResponseCode() == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK)\n{code}\nevaluates to false because we get 401 back.
