But, ultimately, if you look at the DistributedFileSystem implementation of listPaths, it clearly creates fully qualified paths using the DfsPath(DFSFileInfo,FileSystem) constructor. In the case of the s3 implementation, the listPaths, as I mentioned, returns sub-paths without the scheme or the bucket name (authorization). If the default file system is not s3, then the hadoop library returns improper results by trying to resolve the returned sub-path against the default FileSystem ( since the scheme is missing from the path object).\n\nI am working on enabling map-reduce functionality for scenarios where either both, or at least one file specification (map input, and reduce output)  in a map reduce spec points to the s3 file system. The above mentioned bug breaks the code in a couple of different places. When I implement keytoPath in Jet3FileSystemStore as follows, everything works. \n\nprivate Path keyToPath(String key) {\n    return new Path(\"s3://\"+bucket.getName()+key);\n  }\n\nSuffice it to say, there are other (performance related) issues that I am also looking at in order to enable satisfactory use of s3 as a potential input/output for a mapreduce job. But, by far, this bug is the most critically broken issue. \n\nSorry about the lack of stack traces. I just need to recreate a proper test environment to get you these, and hopefully I will be able to submit something to you next week. \n\nThanks,\n\nAhad.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahadr","name":"ahadr","key":"ahadr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahad Rana","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-09-01T00:17:32.749+0000","updated":"2007-09-01T00:17:32.749+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12376866/comment/12524239","id":"12524239","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahadr","name":"ahadr","key":"ahadr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahad Rana","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"On a broader note, I believe it would be a good thing to make it a rule that all FileSystem implementations return fully qualified (scheme and host specified) paths in all cases.
