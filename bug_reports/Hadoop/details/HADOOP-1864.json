We've tried both -file option and -cacheArchive option. It seems the tasktracker node cannot unjar jar files bigger than 2G. We are considering split our binaries into multiple jars, but with -file, it seems we cannot do it. Also, we would prefer -cacheArchive option for performance issue, but it seems -cacheArchive does not allow more than appearance in the streaming options. Even if -cacheArchive support multiple jars, we still need a way to put the jars into a single directory tree, instead of using multiple symbolic links. \n\nSo, in general, we need a feasible and efficient way to update large size (>2G) binaries for Hadoop streaming.
