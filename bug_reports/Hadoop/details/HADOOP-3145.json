I propose we just pick what's in the path, and let the user set it up correctly. In some setups, admins set up the path for the users, so the above example would just work. If a tarball is being used, the user has to untar the tarball somewhere and set the path correctly.\n\nAlternatively, she can always define: \n\nhod script -d cluster-dir -n nodes --hod.cmd \"/foo/bar/hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar wordcount input output\"\n\nMore generically - we don't interpret anything inside hod.cmd, but pass it as such to the shell. \n\nAnother thing to note is the quotes around the hadoop command. I can't think of any better way than this to specify a sub-command, without keeping from getting into positional arguments . So, in the above example, one could also say:\n\nhod script --hod.cmd \"/foo/bar/hadoop...\" -d cluster-dir -n nodes\n\nAgain, alternate suggestions welcome.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-04-07T17:22:46.519+0000","updated":"2008-04-07T17:22:46.519+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12392799/comment/12586650","id":"12586650","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"   - Interface: The second interface ( hod cmd -d cluster-dir -n nodes --hod.cmd \"hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar wordcount input output\" ) looks clearer, piggybacking it into script sub-command doesn't look natural(to me atleast).\n   - Hadoop Home: +1 for the suggestion to pick it from path if relative, and use it directly if it is an absolute path. Even while using a simple allocate command, user has to untar his/her tarball and set the path accordingly to run hadoop commands, so this is inline with regular usage.\n   - Putting the command in quotes is the way it used to be hod 0.3(internal version) : hod -m 3 -a 'run jar ...' .
