I'm trying to see if my understanding is correct.\n\nPer my understanding, the main concern here is that, some secure random implementation opens file descriptor /dev/urandom (e.g. {{OsSecureRandom}}).\n\nFor each call to {{CryptoCodec#getInstance}}, a new {{CryptoCodec}} object is created. If that happens to be {{OpensslAesCtrCryptoCodec}}, then at its {{setConf}} method, {{Random}} object is created. If this happens to be {{OsSecureRandom}}, then we open a fd. With too many of those calls we would end up with too many open fd's.\n\nHADOOP-11891 fixes this in some sense by lazily filling the Reservoir. This jira would also alleviate the problem by adding caches to the {{CryptoCodec}} object, which in turn caches the {{Random}} object.\n\nIf any of this happens again, we should check from jstack to see exactly how/where the fd's are opened.\n\nDo I understand this correctly?

And you can also use lsof /dev/urandom to list open fds.\nHowever, I have a different opinion on the fix. When we typically see problems with too many open fds to /dev/urandom, it's not the cost of instantiating a new instance of {{CryptoCodec}} that is expensive; it is generating random numbers that is expensive. The problem is when available entropy is depleted, reading from /dev/urandom could block, and what happens is you would end up seeing many open fds, because they are all waiting to read from /dev/urandom.\n\nIMO, fixing this isn't really useful.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojochuang","name":"jojochuang","key":"jojochuang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jojochuang&avatarId=25508"},"displayName":"Wei-Chiu Chuang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-13T00:15:54.465+0000","updated":"2016-04-13T00:15:54.465+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12826041/comment/15238316","id":"15238316","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"As a correction, /dev/urandom doesn't block.
