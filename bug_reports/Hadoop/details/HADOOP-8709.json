Currently a path without a glob pattern returns null if nothing matches, while a path with a glob a pattern that doesn't match anything throws FNFE.  Seems like either we should match the old behavior or at least throw FNFE in both cases, depending upon which way we want to go.\n\nPersonally I'd rather not break compatibility unless there's a very compelling reason to do so.  The directory listing case was a clear reason to do so, and I can see HADOOP-6201's thinking that we should match that new behavior and also Java's convention.  But I'm on the fence if that's enough reason to break compatibility here as well.  I'm not aware of a Java convention for file globbing behavior.  Globbing is like pattern matching, and I don't believe pattern matchers normally throw when they fail to match.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-08-17T16:09:56.101+0000","updated":"2012-08-17T16:09:56.101+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603877/comment/13436831","id":"13436831","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Small patch to restore the original behavior, if we choose that route.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-08-17T16:21:29.538+0000","updated":"2012-08-17T16:21:29.538+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603877/comment/13436991","id":"13436991","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Basically it boils down to breaking the path into directory-level components and for each component:\n\n* if the component doesn't contain patterns, treat it like listStatus and throw FNFE if it doesn't exist\n* if the component contains patterns, treat it like a pattern match and return an empty array if it doesn't exist\n\nSo for example, if the pattern is /a/b/* but /a/b/ doesn't exist, then it will throw FNFE.  However if the pattern is /a/b*/* for the same situation, then it will return an empty array even though /a/b* doesn't exist.  It does match my expectation that matching shouldn't throw but at a directory component level rather than the top-level.\n\nThe new behavior seems a bit cumbersome, since callers now have to check for both an empty array *and* catch FNFE to handle the case of nothing found.  However it does provide the ability to distinguish between a non-existent expected directory level vs. a pattern matching nothing for some cases.

It especially bugs me because it is on something that is marked public stable and is commonly used.  If I had my wish the behavior would match that of 1.0, just because the exception may not be exceptional, but is somewhat rare.  I fear it will catch users off guard when it does show up, and their code will not be able to handle it.  Additionally most globbing libraries I have seen never throw an exception or return an error, most globbing is in c, unless something is seriously wrong.\n\nHowever, a lot of this is selfishness on my part because most of my users are on the 1.0 line, and would expect that behavior.  I realize that making another change to the APIs behavior is risky so I am fine with whatever we do so long as the documentation and the API's behavior match.\n\nNow putting on my release manager hat I really would like to do a release of 0.23.3 soon, but this is one JIRA that I consider somewhat of a blocker because of the mismatch.  However we fix it I would like a fix soon.\n\nI am a +1 on the patch as is. I reviewed it and the code looks fine to me. but Jakob, I am not going to check it in right away.  If you don't want this to happen feel free to give it a -1 or even a -0, and I will look into posting a patch that updates the documentation instead.

Hence apps have tended to not rely on parent dirs always being pre-created\nas part of configuration/setup. (We changed this default behavior in FileContext.) Hence it is not completely unreasonable for glob Status applications to view missing parent dirs as normal rather than error.

Backwards compatibility is a concrete goal, and the correct semantics are not clear with the current API anyway.\n\nThe {{globStatus}} signature is unfortunate. It mixes URIs and regular expressions. It would be much clearer if the caller provided a base URI and a regexp to match descendants:\n\n{code}\npublic RemoteIterator<FileStatus> glob(Path base, String regexp)\n  throws IOException, FileNotFoundException, InterruptedException;\n{code}\n\nThis can throw FNF if the base URI doesn't exist and return an empty iterator when the regexp doesn't match anything. At the time, the change to globStatus seemed to model this reasonably well (pre-glob char specify a base resource, segments after the first glob are part of the regexp), but I agree with the above: it's not worth the break in compatibility.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-23T05:32:32.117+0000","updated":"2012-08-23T05:32:32.117+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603877/comment/13440396","id":"13440396","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"If we do want different behavior we should add in a new API and deprecate the old one.  This is how most projects evolve while still maintaining backwards compatibility.  I like Chris's idea for the new API, and I would actually go a step further and create an Glob class, that holds the base Path and the regexp/pattern.  That way other methods that may take a glob, like in Shell or Util, it is obvious when something will be interpreted as a Glob and when it will be interpreted as a Path. But all of that can and should be done in a separate JIRA.  I agree with Sanjay also.  This new API should remove the null return values. It will through a FNFE when the base path is not found, and will return an empty iterator when the pattern does not match anything.\n\nI think this solution would address all concerns.
