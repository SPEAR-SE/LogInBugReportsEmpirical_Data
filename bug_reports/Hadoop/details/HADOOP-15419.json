For the cluster, it is not easy to know which namenodes a certain job would access. I think the mechanism could be more flexible and obtaining tokens from all namenodes seems to be too crude.\r\n1, We can have a option maybe {{fs.viewfs.use.specific.filesystem}}, only when this option is true, the following logic works.\r\n2, When submit a mr/spark job, if the input/output path is a viewfs path, instead of obtaining token from all namenode, we would visit and fetch token from only a SET of filesystem.\r\n3, The raw filesystem of the input/output path should be in the SET\r\n4, We may have a global option like {{fs.viewfs.global.filesystem}} which defines filesystems that all jobs may visit(Eg. the filesystem of tmp dir, scratch dir), and it should be added into the SET\r\n5, Job-level option like {{fs.viewfs.additional.filesystem}} which defiles extra filesystem that the certain job need.\r\nSince obtaining delegation tokens happens on the client side, the effect of the modification would be controllable.  \r\nAny thought?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Tao+Jie","name":"Tao Jie","key":"tao jie","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tao Jie","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-04-27T06:47:10.752+0000","updated":"2018-04-27T06:47:10.752+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13155584/comment/16456916","id":"16456916","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xkrogen","name":"xkrogen","key":"xkrogen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xkrogen&avatarId=34526"},"displayName":"Erik Krogen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~Tao Jie], I echo [~hexiaoqiao]'s concerns.
