The question is whether an exception should be thrown, or the offending paths should silently be left out of the glob.\n\nUsers are allowed to know that the inaccessible directory exists, because it exists in a directory which they do have list access to.\n\nFor example if you had\n\n{code}\n/           with permission 0755\n/secret     with permission 0700\n/mundane    with permission 0777\n{code}\n\nThe question is whether /* by an unprivileged user should throw an exception, or simply return \"/mundane\".
