See below.  Suppose there is a file at foo\\bar\\hello.txt, and you want to create a symlink to it named hello.txt in the current directory.  Running \"winutils symlink hello.txt foo\\bar\\hello.txt\" (using back slashes) works correctly.  However, running \"winutils symlink hello.txt foo/bar/hello.txt\" (using forward slashes) appears to succeed, but then the file isn't really accessible through the symlink.\n\nThis is a minor winutils bug.  The Java codebase is supposed to take care of calling winutils with the correct path separator.  This does make it more challenging to troubleshoot problems, because the failure doesn't occur at the source of the problem (symlink creation).  Instead, the failure occurs later when a process tries to access a file through the symlink.\n\nThis shows that winutils generally rejects attempts to create dangling symlinks.\n\n{code}\nC:\\test2>\\dep\\hadoop-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT\\bin\\winutils.exe symlink baz doesNotExist\nDirectoryCheck error (2): The system cannot find the file specified.\n\nC:\\test2>\\dep\\hadoop-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT\\bin\\winutils.exe symlink baz subdir\\doesNotExist\nDirectoryCheck error (3): The system cannot find the path specified.\n{code}\n\nThis shows that passing forward slashes can create a bad symlink.\n\n{code}\nC:\\test2>dir\n Volume in drive C has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 9898-B272\n\n Directory of C:\\test2\n\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <DIR>          .\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <DIR>          ..\n               0 File(s)              0 bytes\n               2 Dir(s)   5,014,097,920 bytes free\n\nC:\\test2>mkdir foo\\bar\n\nC:\\test2>echo hello > foo\\bar\\hello.txt\n\nC:\\test2>\\dep\\hadoop-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT\\bin\\winutils.exe symlink hello.txt foo\\bar\\h\nello.txt\n\nC:\\test2>dir\n Volume in drive C has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 9898-B272\n\n Directory of C:\\test2\n\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <DIR>          .\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <DIR>          ..\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <DIR>          foo\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <SYMLINK>      hello.txt [foo\\bar\\hello.txt]\n               1 File(s)              0 bytes\n               3 Dir(s)   5,014,097,920 bytes free\n\nC:\\test2>type hello.txt\nhello\n\nC:\\test2>del hello.txt\n\nC:\\test2>\\dep\\hadoop-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT\\bin\\winutils.exe symlink hello.txt foo/bar/h\nello.txt\n\nC:\\test2>dir\n Volume in drive C has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 9898-B272\n\n Directory of C:\\test2\n\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <DIR>          .\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <DIR>          ..\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <DIR>          foo\n11/14/2012  12:24 PM    <SYMLINK>      hello.txt [foo/bar/hello.txt]\n               1 File(s)              0 bytes\n               3 Dir(s)   5,014,097,920 bytes free\n\nC:\\test2>type hello.txt\nThe system cannot find the file specified.\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-15T07:16:37.332+0000","updated":"2012-11-15T07:16:37.332+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616192/comment/13582713","id":"13582713","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch to replace all occurrences of '/' with '\\\\'.

When I filed it, I didn't realize that Windows requires slightly different API calls for creating a symlink that targets a directory vs. a file.  Therefore, winutils really does need to call {{DirectoryCheck}} to determine the type of target.  As a consequence, winutils differs from Unix ln in that it cannot create a dangling symlink.  (It has no way of knowing whether the caller is trying to create a \"dangling file symlink\" or a \"dangling directory symlink\".)  I believe that both the Java code and the C code are doing the right thing for us now, without further changes.\n\nThe remaining issue is the failure of {{TestLocalFSFileContextSymlink}} on Windows, which is what prompted me to file this jira initially.  We now know that this is an inevitable platform difference, so let's use {{Assert.assumeTrue(!Shell.WINDOWS)}} to skip the tests that can't possibly pass on Windows.  If needed, we could also add more tests to cover Windows behavior, guarded with {{Assert.assumeTrue(Shell.WINDOWS)}}.  AFAIK, Hadoop product code does not actually require the ability to create a dangling symlink, and the test suite is just trying to cover ln functionality exhaustively.\n\nI propose that we close this jira as invalid and create a new one to fix the tests.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-21T16:39:24.018+0000","updated":"2013-02-21T16:39:24.018+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616192/comment/13583384","id":"13583384","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitagarwal","name":"arpitagarwal","key":"arpitagarwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Ivan, Chris, \n\nI think the behavior of winutils is orthogonal to what the Java code invoking it does.

I discovered a new problem.  The trunk code still has a Unix command dependency on the readlink command for determining the target of a symlink.  (See {{RawLocalFs#readLink}}.)  This is the source of some of the test failures.\n\nI propose the addition of a new \"winutils readlink\" command.  The logic of this command would be:\n\n# Call {{CreateFile}} with {{OPEN_EXISTING}} and {{FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT}}.\n** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363858(v=vs.85).aspx\n# Call {{GetFileInformationByHandle}}.\n** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364952(v=vs.85).aspx\n# Check the {{BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION}} for the presence of {{FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT}}.\n** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363788(v=vs.85).aspx\n** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/gg258117(v=vs.85).aspx\n# If not a reparse point, exit with code 1 and print nothing to stdout.

(This is what Unix readlink does.)\n\nCould someone with more Windows expertise review this and comment on whether or not the logic looks correct?  There are a few edge cases that I'm not sure how to handle.  What should we do if the reparse point is not a symlink (i.e. junction point)?  MSDN also mentions that some reparse points may have a different data structure associated with them, a {{REPARSE_GUID_DATA_BUFFER}}, and I'm not sure what special handling is required around that.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-12T19:12:37.892+0000","updated":"2013-04-12T19:12:37.892+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616192/comment/13630526","id":"13630526","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm attaching a new trunk patch that gets us a little closer to the end goal.

The approach overall looks good. I have a few comments that should help with further progress:\n1. There is no need to support junction points. Let's only focus on symlinks. We've seen problems with junction points on Windows for paths longer than 126 chars (IIRC) and finally decided to stay out of supporting them. \n2. In winutils we already have SymbolicLinkCheck function which checks if the given path is a symlink. See if you can reconcile this with the new code.\n3. DeviceIoControl is one way to retrieve the symlink target path. GetFinalPathNameByHandle provides the similar functionality and might be easier to use. See which one suits you better. (it is fine to assume that we’re running on Vista or later Windows OS).\n\n\nAlso a few comments on the latest patch:\n1. RawLocalFs: An incremental improvement would be to have getPathWithoutSchemeAndAuthority return a File instead of a string.\n2. Would you mind adding a unittest to TestWinUtils that targets the scenario where input paths have forward slashes (for both the target and the link).\n3.
