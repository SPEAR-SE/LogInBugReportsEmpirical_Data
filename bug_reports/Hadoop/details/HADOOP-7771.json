So previously when we checked for \n{code}\nif (!stat.isDirectory())\n{code}\nall we were trying to do was to ensure that the destination is a directory. The issue is that {{stat}} could be null and so all that the check {{exist}} does is to ensure that {{stat}} is not null before we even check if it is directory or not! Hence, I believe the check {{if (exists && !stat.isDirectory())}} is the right check.\n\n\n{code}\n// if the destination is a directory, make target a child path,\n// else use the destination as-is\n-    if (dst.exists && dst.stat.isDirectory()) {\n{code}\nHere, (previously) the check for destination succeeded only if the 'dst' already existed. With the new code, it ensures that we detect that the destination is a directory even in cases where the destination does not exist. The logic does not change at all. Am I missing something obvious?\n\nDaryn,\nCan you elaborate on what you mean by \"The use of isDstDir appears wrong and is duplication of most of the prior logic. \"? I would definitely like to reuse the logic if it already exists.

The patch auto-creates the destination as a directory, thus shorting out the check in the parent class.  Ex. \"fs -cp f1 f2 f3 dir\" should fail if dir doesn't exist, the patch changed it to succeed.\n# If the source is a directory, and the destination doesn't exist, then the source is effectively supposed to be renamed as the destination.  The auto-creates the destination as a directory and copies the source into the destination.  Ex. \"fs -get dir does-not-exist\" should create \"does-not-exist\" with the contents of \"dir\".  This patch creates \"does-not-exist/dir\".\n# If a directory is copied to a file, the exception thrown is not using the PathData string.\n\nIn effect, we are adding bugs, and trading a NPE with copying to the wrong destination, so it's a wash as far as testing is concerned.\n\nFWIW, early this year, I ported all this copy/move code as part of the FsShell redesign.  I realized I introduced bugs way back in June or July and prepared a patch.  I thought I lost the patch, so John started working this jira, but I dug it up the patch this weekend.

Maybe it would make sense to mimic what it does?\n\nIt's true that users could read the partial files, but I question if users would expect a partial file in the vast majority of use cases.  Let's say a copy failed, the user didn't check the exit code possibly because 20x exit codes were unreliable, and then attempted to run a job.  The job might \"succeed\" to process the partial data but produce erroneous results.  Users might be baffled that re-running the job produces different results.  A dev may go on a wild goose chase and resolve as \"works for me\" when they can't reproduce.\n\nIf the client is interrupted by a signal, then it often used to leave a temp file because the signal wasn't breaking out correctly and affecting the shutdown hooks.  I recently fixed that.  I've been meaning to investigation/reproduce/fix a few user reports that temp files are still sometimes left around.  If you do a hard kill (-9), then of course there's nothing that can be done unless the NN has a notion of this \"this file should be deleted unless I explicitly close it\".\n\nWhat are your
