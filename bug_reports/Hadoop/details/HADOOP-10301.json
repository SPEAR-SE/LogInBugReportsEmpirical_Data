The existing behavior:\n# 2.x catches and ignores AuthenticationException while validating auth cookies - expired, wrong secret, wrong type, etc.  A valid 401 + negotiate header is sent to trigger spnego.  No problem here.\n# 0.23 does *not* catch AuthenticationException while validating auth cookies.

The change is going to affect all downstream projects in secure set ups. Given the fact that 2.4 is coming up pretty soon, I wonder, is it a good idea to put it in at the last minute? It seems to me that there is insufficient time to test it in the 2.4 timeframe, which might break downstream projects like Oozie unexpectedly.\n\nSince we have move it as a blocker from 2.3 to 2.4, is it okay to move it to 2.5? More precisely, we can continue to make progress on this patch, but commit it only to branch-2 for now. That way this change will be extensively tested in the 2.5 timeframe, and leave the downstream projects enough time to fix any bugs if they occur.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-23T04:35:07.459+0000","updated":"2014-03-23T04:35:07.459+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12691838/comment/13945571","id":"13945571","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree that it is not a good idea to have this and HDFS-4564 as the last minutes changes to 2.4.

I was looking into something related, and saw that when using Kerberos and an expired auth token, Oozie Client wasn't getting a new token.  \n\nI didn't notice this problem until I really dug into the code because the Oozie client commands would still succeed, it would always just log a warning in the Oozie Server from hadoop-auth about the token, and use Kerberos.\n\nAfter a lot of debugging, I figured out the cause.  Currently, Oozie does this in {{AuthOozieClient}} to determine if a token has expired:\n{code:java}\n        if (currentToken.isSet()) {\n            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n            conn.setRequestMethod(\"OPTIONS\");\n            AuthenticatedURL.injectToken(conn, currentToken);\n            if (conn.getResponseCode() == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED) {\n                AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_FILE.delete();\n                currentToken = new AuthenticatedURL.Token();\n            }\n        }\n{code}\nPreviously, the response code would be 401 when the token expired.  Oozie Client would clear out {{currentToken}} and some later code would get a new one after using the {{KerberosAuthenticator}}.  However, it's now 200 here and returns a new token (in the header) after successfully doing SPNEGO without (Oozie explicitly) calling the {{KerberosAuthenticator}} at all.  To fix this, Oozie has to modify the above to do this:\n{code:java}\n        if (currentToken.isSet()) {\n            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n            conn.setRequestMethod(\"OPTIONS\");\n            AuthenticatedURL.injectToken(conn, currentToken);\n            if (conn.getResponseCode() == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED) {\n                AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_FILE.delete();\n                currentToken = new AuthenticatedURL.Token();\n            } else {\n                try {\n                    AuthenticatedURL.extractToken(conn, currentToken);\n                } catch (AuthenticationException ex) {\n                    AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_FILE.delete();\n                    currentToken = new AuthenticatedURL.Token();\n                }\n        }\n{code}\nHere it will try to extract the new token if one was given using {{AuthenticatedURL.extractToken}}, which will update {{currentToken}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-03-09T21:42:07.567+0000","updated":"2016-03-09T21:42:07.567+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12691838/comment/15188101","id":"15188101","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Given that the previous behavior wasn't following the spec, I guess we have to keep this though, and update Oozie to handle this.
