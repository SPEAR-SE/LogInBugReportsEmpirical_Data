It's generally preferred now to group them into a subshell and then redirect the shell.  But I think the message should really be directed to the patch author in the footer table via an add_footer_table call.\n\nb) I think it'd be worthwhile to do quite a bit more hacking on the checkstyle module.  When I looked at checkstyle, I was clearly asleep. There are actually quite a few things we can do to make this much more usable:\n\n* Switch from the aggregate report to a per module report.  (This should also reduce the run time and it makes the other things we should do easier.)\n\n* Rip out the python code.  We aren't going to need it anymore.\n\n* Add -Dcheckstyle.output.file=blah and -Dcheckstyle.output.format=plain to both mvn command lines, where blah is the file we want for that module for that part of the run.  Strip a large chunk of the leading pathname (${BASEDIR} at a minimum, but probably all of ${BASEDIR} and modulename, since the file is already broken up by module).\n\n* Now we can perform diffs and such like we do for some of the other tests (see shellcheck, for example).

Unfortunately, this uses GNU diff extensions. :(  \n* whitespace now prints the name and line of the source file that has the whitespace\n* fixed _all_ of the shellcheck errors.  newer versions of shellcheck now understand line continuations!
