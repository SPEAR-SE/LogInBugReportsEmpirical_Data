Also, we should continue to use the map output key comparator for iterating through the key/value records from the (possibly merged) map outputs; we should use the value-grouping comparator to only decide whether the current key we are looking at is \"equal\" to the last key that was looked at, while the user's reducer method is iterating through the values for a key.
