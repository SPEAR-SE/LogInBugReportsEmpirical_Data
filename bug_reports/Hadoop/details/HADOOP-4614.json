The above exception suggests that probably Hadoop puts the intermediate data into many files.  But the question is that \"exactly how many open files are required in the worst case for any data size and cluster size?\"  Currently it looks as if Hadoop needs more number of open files as the size of input or the cluster size (in terms of nodes, mapper, reducers) increases.  This is not plausible as far as scalability is concerned.  A user needs to write some number in the /etc/security/limits.conf file that how many open files are allowed by hadoop node.  The question is what that \"magical number\" should be?\n\nSo probably the best solution to this problem is to change Hadoop such a way that it can work with some moderate number of allowed open files (e.g. 4 K) or any other number should be suggested as an upper limit such that a user is sure that for any data size and cluster size, hadoop will not run into this \"too many open files\" issue.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12394699","id":"12394699","filename":"4614-trunk.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris

Another question: should this go into 0.18 or just 0.19 and trunk is enough?\nI realize you're probably not asking me, but my humble opinion is: this is should go in as soon as possible, because this kind of bugs force people to set ulimit -n to hundreds of thousands (as some mentioned on the mailing list).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yurip","name":"yurip","key":"yurip","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yuri Pradkin","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-22T00:12:50.581+0000","updated":"2008-11-22T00:12:50.581+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407993/comment/12649873","id":"12649873","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Just a few nits:\n* To avoid maintenance hiccups, it would be helpful if the old constructor called the new one:\n{code}\nthis(conf, fs, file, 0, fs.getFileStatus(file).getLen(), codec, preserve);\n{code}\n* The position typically precedes the length in argument lists; it would be easier to read and less likely to confuse if segmentOffset preceded segmentLength in the Segment cstr\n* The new comment describes the fix, not the code.
