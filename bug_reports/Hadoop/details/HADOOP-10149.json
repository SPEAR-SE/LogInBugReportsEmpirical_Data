If this needs to be discussed both HADOOP-9331 and HDFS-5143 are still open to discussion, let’s do it on one of these JIRAs.\nIt is good to see there is more and more interest in adopting the work we at Intel have contributed to Apache.

We need key management with versioning and third party support. No patches had those properties and so I started there with HADOOP-10141. The ByteBuffer API for ciphers is a good idea, but it had substantial issues in HDFS-5143 that needed to be addressed. Doing it in a mega-jira is really difficult, so I cut it out so that we could start a much more focused discussion.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-08T16:26:18.409+0000","updated":"2013-12-08T16:26:18.409+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12683236/comment/13843351","id":"13843351","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Afterr looking at the javax.security.Cipher API more deeply, it does have both byte[] and ByteBuffer methods.\n\nUnfortunately the methods in Cipher are declared final and the actual implementation is done by a nested implementation class.
