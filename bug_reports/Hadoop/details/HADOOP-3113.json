However, this data goes to the tmp file on the datanode(s). When the block is closed, the tmp files is renamed to be the real block file. If the datanode(s) dies before the block is compete, then entire block is lost. This behaviour wil be fixed in HADOOP-1700.\n\nHowever, in the short term, a configuration paramater can be used to allow datanodes to write to the real block file directly, thereby avoiding writing to the tmp file. This means that data that is flushed successfully by a client does not get lost even if the datanode(s) or client dies.\n\nThe Namenode already has code to pick the largest replica (if multiple datanodes have different sizes of this block). Also, the namenode has code to not trigger replication request if the file is still being written to.\n\nThe only caveat that I can think of is that the block report periodicity should be much much smaller that the lease timeout period. A block report adds the being-written-to blocks to the blocksMap thereby avoiding any cleanup that a lease expiry processing might have otherwise done.\n\nNot all requirements specified by HADOOP-1700 are supported by this approach, but it could still be helpful (in the short term) for a wide range of

The reason being that datanodes do not know much about the name of the HDFS file that a block belongs to. To make this configurable \"per file\" would need lots of protocol change.\n\nThe default for block report is 1 hour and the default for lease timeout is 1 hour too. This needs to be changed so that block reports are sent evenry 30 minutes.\n\nIf a client dies while writing to the last block of that file, that block is not yet part of the blocksmap in the namenode. (A block gets inserted in the blocksmap when a complete block is received by the datanode and it sends a blockReceived message to the namenode). If the lease for this file on the namenode expires before the block report from the datanode arrives, then the namenode will erroneously think that no datanodes have a copy of that block. As part of lease recovery, the namenode will delete the last block of the file because it has no entry in the blocksMap.
