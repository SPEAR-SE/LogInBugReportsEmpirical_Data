What's the problem with just installing the bzip2 development files?\n\nedit:  I guess I should go into more detail about the reasons why I wouldn't like to do this:\n* Consistency.  For all the other stuff we {{dlopen}}, we search for both the libraries and the headers.  Why should bzip2 behave differently than everything else?\n* \"Least surprise\" to developers.  By searching for the library, we ensure that developers who successfully create a hadoop build with bzip2 can almost certainly run it on that same machine.\n* Lack of a use-case.  Linux distributions usually supply two kinds of packages: development packges with both the header and the libraries, or production packages with just the library.  As far as I know, nobody supplies packages with just header files.\n\nlet me know if I missed anything or if there's a use-case I forgot!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cmccabe","name":"cmccabe","key":"cmccabe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cmccabe&avatarId=29060"},"displayName":"Colin P.
