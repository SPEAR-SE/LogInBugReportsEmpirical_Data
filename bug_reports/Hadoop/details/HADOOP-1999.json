The removal is done in a separate thread, but if there is a lot of blocks, \nthen data-nodes are likely to be blocked on IOs, that is data transmission will be slow. This is what you observed here. \nA solution would be to remove the links lazily, e.g. remove 100 files per second or so. Then finalizing will go slower, but \nthe data-nodes will be able to proceed with normal activities.\n\nThe jstack you attached: I do not see that data-node is doing any file deletes. Are you sure this thread dump was done \nduring finalize? I see that one of the threads is doing DU though. Could the slowdown be related to HADOOP-1946?\nBefore this was fixed I've seen drastic slowdown of data-nodes, some of them would become dead even with insignificant load. \nFinalize would make things even worse.\n\nMissing blocks: I suspect that you get these because many io operation were not complete. Some blocks were not replicated,\nsome files were not closed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shv","name":"shv","key":"shv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Konstantin Shvachko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-10-08T21:05:05.859+0000","updated":"2007-10-08T21:05:05.859+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12379779/comment/12533578","id":"12533578","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ckunz","name":"ckunz","key":"ckunz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christian Kunz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Konstantin, I got he jstack much later after the -finalizeUpgrade, and the datanode was declared a dead node by the nameserver a long time before.\nBut the issue might be fixed by HADOOP-1946.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ckunz","name":"ckunz","key":"ckunz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christian Kunz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-10-10T03:04:13.701+0000","updated":"2007-10-10T03:04:13.701+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12379779/comment/12534120","id":"12534120","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ckunz","name":"ckunz","key":"ckunz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christian Kunz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I will retest this issue using a more recent release.
