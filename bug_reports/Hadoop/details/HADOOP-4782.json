I think we need two patches.\n\n1 for trunk, where we revert the umask patch and leave it at that.\nThe second one is for the 18 branch alone where we turn on permissions for the history file. For this one, I can use hadoop-4782v1.txt attachment. It looks good.\n\nPlease upload a patch for trunk reverting the umask fix alone. Note, that should not have any other changes.
