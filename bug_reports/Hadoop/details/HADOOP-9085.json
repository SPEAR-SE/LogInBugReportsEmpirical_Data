We can't rely on deleting the pid file on a successful shutdown either, as all forms of killing are \"successful\" -even server reboot.\n\nI don't think the proposed patch would work as it's still looking for a file {{$pid}}, even though it's no longer needed, and that file is also used in the error text. Better to skip the -f check and use {{$curpid}} in the error. Even after tha, it's pretty brittle against unintentional command matches.\n\nWhat we need to do is move away from pid-file-liveness tests altogether.\n\nThere is a far more robust alternative, the service started up should create an exclusive write lock on a well-known file. When the process dies, the OS automatically releases this lock.
