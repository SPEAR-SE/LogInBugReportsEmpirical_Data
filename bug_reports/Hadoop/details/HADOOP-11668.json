IMO, best way to solve this is by making hostnames delimited by (,)\n\nNope, definitely not.\n\nThe start of the problems are definitely here:\n\n{code}\nargv=(${HADOOP_USER_PARAMS[@]/start})\n{code}\n\nThis construction has two key issues:\n\nWithout quotes, the array of HADOOP_USER_PARAMS will always have its metachars expanded.  This means that an array of 4 elements will now become 4+n elements, depending upon what else is in there. So if a user passes:\n\n{code}\n--config \"my cool dir\" \n{code}\n\nelements 2 3 4 just got expanded into my, cool, and dir rather than just the single \"my cool dir\".\n\nSo if we change the construction to\n\n{code}\nargv=(\"${HADOOP_USER_PARAMS[@]/start}\")\n{code}\n\nThat element expansion no longer happens.  But now we've introduced a new problem.  We're doing a substitution, but turning those elements empty!  This is where the empty parameter problem comes in, because this means that if we had:\n\n{code}\nhadoop-daemons.sh --hostnames \"1 2\" start namenode\n{code}\n\nWe'd end up with:\n\nargv[0]=--hostnames\nargv[1]=\"1 2\"\nargv[2]=\"\"\nargv[3]=\"namenode\"\n\nafter the substitution.\n\nThen when we get to\n\n{code}\n\"${argv[@]}\" \n{code}\n\non the exec line, it turns into:\n\nhdfs --slaves --daemon \"start\" --hostnames \"1 2\" \"\" namenode\n\nThus we also need to filter out this empty element array.\n\nSo why don't we just switch to using commas here?  Because as evidenced by the above, it doesn't actually fix all the problems with metachar expansion.  If any other parameter has them, it's going to blow up in our face.  The other problem we've got is backward compatibility.  A lot of people use hadoop/yarn-daemons.sh in scripts, and changing this to use commas would be a pretty hefty tax especially when we know we can fix it another way.\n\nOne of the goals I had in mind with this code was to avoid a loop.  But there's still another problem here:\n\nif a hostname has start, stop, or status, it's going to get removed.  Since we already have the loop now to deal with the empty element, we might as well fix that bug too by using a loop rather than cheating.  We still have a problem if some other param is specifically start/stop/status (e.g., --config start), but there's not much we can do about that without building a pretty complex test for what mode we're in.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2015-03-05T15:19:55.798+0000","updated":"2015-03-05T15:21:44.399+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12779320/comment/14349007","id":"14349007","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
