Further, in the current code, this parameter is job configurable ...\n\nSigh. I didn't notice this. In that case, I am not comfortable with this patch. Configuring a value at two places is inconvenient, but does not violate correctness. However, a per job value being overridden by a cluster wide configuration just in the case of LinuxTaskController does not seem right. Further, with the kind of plans mentioned in the comment above (though I saw nothing in HADOOP-5614 - having the thoughts recorded there will help), I think we should relook at how this part is designed.\n\nFor the short term, it is probably still OK to not have code corrresponding to the SIGKILL code at all in the task-controller.

Some comments:\n - The patch needs sync-up with the latest patch on HADOOP-5771\n - Overall, I think the terms terminate and kill are better than the current usage of kill and destroy.\n\nTaskController.java\n - killTask, destroyTask can better be terminateTask, killTask. And accordingly javadoc should be more explicit.\n - killTaskJVM: Null check of context.task belongs to LinuxTaskController, need it to be moved there.\n\nDefaultTaskController.java\n - For WINDOWS process.destroy() is again not needed in destroyTask()\n\nLinuxTaskController.java\n - We completely bring down the TT if we fail to write the pidFile to any one of the disks. This should change. We should fail only if we cannot write to any of the disks.\n - javadoc of setup() is incomplete. It should also quote the additional steps of writing TT pid-file.\n - Log message at +384 can be better: LOG.info(\"Written :: \" + pid + \"  to file \" + ttPidFile);\n - TT's pidfile should not be made world writable (changeDirectoryPermissions does this). In fact, it can be set 000 permissions right-away. This would still work as we run as root to read it.\n - killHelper can better be something like finishTask()\n - What should we do when the commands for SIGTERM/SIGKILL fail?\n - buildTaskControllerExecutor() : For taskControllerCmd, you can instead use an Array\n                                                            Why the usage of command.ordinal() in this method?\n - I think it would be clear to have a separate buildKillTaskArgs(). It would definitely help to also 'javadoc' the task-controller's command-line syntax for buildLaunchTaskArgs and this new buildKillTaskArgs(). With this you can completely remove the killHelper method()\n\nProcessTree.java\n - killProcessGroup() can be renamed to terminateProcessGroup(), killProcess() to terminateProcess(), sigKillProcessGroup to killProcessGroup() and sigKillProcess to killProcess().\n - Also, I think, with these semantics, we need a ProcessTree.isProcessGroupAlive(pgrpid) along with the current ProcessTree.isAlive(pid)\n\nmain.c\n - The argc length check should be command specific.\n - job_pid var can better be task_pid\n - You have a printf statement in the case DESTROY_TASK_JVM. This can be removed or redirected to log if needed.\n - Return values of verify_parent like UNABLE_TO_READ_TT_PID_FILE, OUT_OF_MEMORY are lost, as we are only returning INVALID_PROCESS_LAUNCHING_TASKCONTROLLER in error scenarios. Can't we do something here?\n\ntaskcontroller.c\n - Documentation of kill_user_task() should be fixed. Currently, it only refers to SIGTERM.\n - The get_pid_path() function can be removed. Also references to it from code documentation of run_task_as_user, kill_user_task can be removed too along with the TT_SYS_DIR var from taskcontroller.h\n - +343 \"//Don't continue if the process is not alive anymore.\" should instead be \"  // Don't continue if the process-group is not alive anymore.\"\n\nTestKillSubProcessesWithTaskController\n - Rename to TestKillSubProcessesWithLinuxTaskController\n - Remove unused imports\n - Add Apache license header and add javadoc similar to other tests with LinuxTaskController\n - Just like in HADOOP-5771, we may want to verify job-ownership in this test too.\n - The test ran successfully, but it is running the jobs as the same user as the user running the cluster. Need to fix this.\n - Also, I see a lot of messages like this : \"WARN  mapred.LinuxTaskController (LinuxTaskController.java:destroyTask(454)) - Exception thrown while sending destroy to the Task VM org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell$ExitCodeException:\". Need to debug the cause for these.\n\nWe also need a test to verify cleanup of tasks that ignore SIGTERM.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-08T05:35:26.394+0000","updated":"2009-05-08T05:35:26.394+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416282/comment/12707247","id":"12707247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Also, the test leaves a lot of files created by the different user.

This issue is marked as Fixed. Open a new JIRA with a description about the issue and attach the patch.\n\nRajiv, the reason why there is no new jira is because this is a bug that occurs only on the Yahoo! distribution and not on trunk.\n\nTo give an explanation, the patch HADOOP-5420-v20.patch introduced some code to make sure the pid files written by the task-controller were owned by the tasktracker process, as a security check. Inadvertently, in this patch, we removed some code that changed the ownership of the pid file (which was written as root) to be owned by the TT user. As a result, pid files were created as root, but the new check introduced in the patch failed during kill because it found the PID files were not owned by the TT user and hence treated them as suspect. Hence tasks failed to be killed causing runaway processes on the cluster.\n\nThe attached patch re-introduces the code that changes ownership of the pid file to the TT user so that during killing the security check would pass and processes would be killed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-07-15T16:51:50.121+0000","updated":"2009-07-15T16:51:50.121+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416282/comment/12736026","id":"12736026","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sreekanth","name":"sreekanth","key":"sreekanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sreekanth Ramakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Patch to be used for Yahoo distribution","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sreekanth","name":"sreekanth","key":"sreekanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sreekanth Ramakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-07-28T10:37:06.595+0000","updated":"2009-07-28T10:37:06.595+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416282/comment/12753957","id":"12753957","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch which fixes an infinite loop in task_controller.check_tt_root and MAPREDUCE-970 for yahoo hadoop.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-09-11T02:54:21.927+0000","updated":"2009-09-11T02:54:21.927+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416282/comment/12754007","id":"12754007","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sreekanth","name":"sreekanth","key":"sreekanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sreekanth Ramakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"There is a double free expection thrown randomly when we try to mapred_local_dir  is being freed when it is null.
