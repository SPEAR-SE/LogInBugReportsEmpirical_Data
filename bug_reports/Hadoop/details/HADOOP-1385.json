I basically wanted to check the non-existence of the current bug. In the new hash function the hash codes are different. In the old code the hash codes are the same.\n\n> Also, this looks like a 0.14.0 fix since the existing code isn't broken, just inefficient in some cases.\n\nIt is really badly broken if you have more than 256 reduces. You'll basically have extremely heavy loading on 256 of the reduces (depending on the precise number of reduces). If you run with 2000 reduces, you'll have the majority of your workload done by a 1/8 of your cluster. Certainly for my cluster, I'll fix this for 13. If the majority of people feel like this can push to 14, that is fine.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-18T16:02:05.605+0000","updated":"2007-05-18T16:02:05.605+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12369619/comment/12496927","id":"12496927","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"I would keep that test (it's good to test for regressions!), but also add the one I describe.\n\n> It is really badly broken if you have more than 256 reduces.\n\nOK - I'm convinced.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2007-05-18T16:15:28.183+0000","updated":"2007-05-18T16:15:28.183+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12369619/comment/12497041","id":"12497041","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think it wouldn't be a good test case to make sure the collision happens if the fifth bytes are different.
