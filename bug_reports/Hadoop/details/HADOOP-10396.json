If not, you should be able to create a tarball from the source.'\n\nWhat it should do it put a like to hadoop download release link. let alone all that confusing test in section 3 'Setting up the environment' which did no explaination on what does all that do.\n\nLots of documents in release are ridden problems like this. Review is needed for those document or at least a warning about it may be outdated.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"378356","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"The 2.X official document is in sorry state.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doomleika","name":"doomleika","key":"doomleika","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"doomleika","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=doomleika","name":"doomleika","key":"doomleika","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"doomleika","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12699717/comment/13925382","id":"13925382","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ajisakaa","name":"ajisakaa","key":"ajisakaa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ajisakaa&avatarId=17238"},"displayName":"Akira Ajisaka","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Tokyo"},"body":"Hi, the Single Cluster Setup document is updated by HADOOP-10139 and the new document will be released in 2.4.
