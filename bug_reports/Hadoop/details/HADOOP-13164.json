I fear removing it would do bad things.\n\nBut if it is called after every file is written, it will be expensive, especially as there is {{getStatus()}} in there (2 x {{getObjectMetadata()}} + 1 x {{listObjects()}}) , plus the {{deleteObjects()}} call. As this goes up the tree, the cost will be O(depth)\n\nGiven that after a file has just been written, it is known that there is a child of any directory (i.e. it is non-empty), then you don't need to check so much. You look for the existence of a path, and if there: delete. \n\nMore deviously, you could say \"delete the path without checking to see if it exists\". If it's not there, a failed delete is harmless. That'd still be O(depth), but one S3 call, rather than 3 or 4.\n\nAnd, once you go down that path, you could say \"queue up a delete for all parent paths and fire them off in one go\", going from O(depth) to O(1). \n\nEven better, you could maybe even do that asynchronously. I'd worry a bit there about race conditions between the current thread and process, but given this is just a cleanup, it might be safe —and I don't see it being any worse race-wise than what exists today, except now it may be more visible to a single thread.\n\nThat would need very, very, careful testing. The one thing nobody wants is an over-zealous delete operation to lose data.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-05-23T10:17:00.705+0000","updated":"2016-05-23T10:17:00.705+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12970273/comment/15306506","id":"15306506","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajesh.balamohan","name":"rajesh.balamohan","key":"rajesh.balamohan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rajesh Balamohan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~steve_l].  When a file is written to a location, that folder along with its parents become non-empty folders as per the FS contract.

Even in rename, iteration can stop once a non-empty folder is encountered in its path.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajesh.balamohan","name":"rajesh.balamohan","key":"rajesh.balamohan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rajesh Balamohan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-05-30T10:44:16.404+0000","updated":"2016-05-30T10:44:16.404+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12970273/comment/15307600","id":"15307600","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"As Rajesh and I discussed offline: \n\n# this can be done asynchronously\n# once HADOOP-13221 guarantees that there are no parent entries of a file which are themselves files, the delete operation can omit the check for parent paths existing or being directories.

Bear in mind that removeKey(nonexistentpath) will fail at the AWS SDK layer; your code will need to handle that. The code you cut did that by swallowing the exceptions. I'd expect that to continue.\n\nI've been thinking we can more than just delete with an async thread; you can do parent dir creation on a delete operation, validation in a create() call that there is no parent directory that is actually a file (this could be launched in the create(), the result awaited on/checked in the close()/first PUT. That argues for having an executor that takes a queue of actions pushed down, of which dir deletion is only one.\n\nWe'd need queue length another metric; actually a count of #of fake directory delete calls made and actual deletes executed. That'd be something that the tests can use. \n\nI'd like to see a way to test this. Especially the shutdown process.\n\nI'm also wondering whether we can create new sequences of operations which could lose data. Something like\n{code}\n touch(\"/path/1/2/3/4/5/6\")\n delete(\"/path/1/2/3/4/5/6\")\n echo(\"/path\", 'important text\")\n{code}\n\nIf that recursive delete hasn't completed before that echo operation happens, data gets lost. \n\nThinking about this some more, I really worry about the async behaviour. Maybe we should try to optimise the sync one as a single removeKeys on all the parents, Again, we could do a scale test to play with the options here, to measure what made the lowest #of calls, and the time it took","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-07-25T17:12:03.727+0000","updated":"2016-07-25T17:12:03.727+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12970273/comment/15393498","id":"15393498","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajesh.balamohan","name":"rajesh.balamohan","key":"rajesh.balamohan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rajesh Balamohan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks for the inputs Steve.

be a {{while(!isRootPath(f))}}\n# moved check for an empty list into {{removeKeys()}}, so it is everywhere.\n# cut test out of {{ITestS3AContractRename}}. This test is *only* for testing compliance with the FS spec, and were it not for consistency problems surfacing, should have no test cases at all, just a materialized subclass of {{AbstractContractRenameTest}}\n# moved this test in {{ITestS3AFileOperationCost.testFakeDirectoryDeletion then added assertions about metric state during all the operations.\n# cut test case from {{ITestS3ADirectoryPerformance}} as it didn't contain a single assertion. This is not a test; it is a demo.\n\nI really want to call out the test changes. A key benefit of adding all those metrics is that it lets us make assertions about the no of requests made of S3, *independent of execution time*. The tests in patch 004 don't really check *anything*. They log stuff, but that's for humans to read, not anything which can be automated in a jenkins build.\n\n* the initial purpose of tests is to demonstrate that the code not only behaves as expected, but doesn't break when you try to break it\n* the secondary purpose of the test is to catch regressions: to make sure your work holds even in the presence of changes by others (including your future self).\n* all tests need to be fully automated: the results must be verifiable in Jenkins, rather than reviewed in the logs.\n\nThis is [the style guide|https://github.com/steveloughran/formality/blob/master/styleguide/styleguide.md] I try to follow when coding tests, and what I like to see in reviews. Yes, it usually makes writing the tests harder than the actual production code. Which is good: production code is ideally simple and reliable. Tests are are designed to break that code and use assertions to show that they have broken it. This takes effort —but is necessary to keep and improve code quality.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-09-28T11:38:15.099+0000","updated":"2016-09-28T11:38:15.099+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12970273/comment/15529359","id":"15529359","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"One more thing.
