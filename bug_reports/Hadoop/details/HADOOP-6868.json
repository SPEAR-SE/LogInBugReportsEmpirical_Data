Then drop in a a second String that sets the byte array length to 500.  Since, the new length is greater than the previous length; the byte array length is reset to the longer length.  Now, if you drop in a third String that would set the byte array length to 350; the Text object does not replace the byte array with a new length of 350; it utilizes the greater length of 500 and sets an extra variable to track the \"real\" length.\n\nSo: Text.getBytes().length != Text.getLength()\n\nThis does 2 things:\n\n1. Passes around more data than what is needed\n2. Makes the Text object confusing to work with\n\nText.getBytes().length == Text.getLength() - should be the correct behavior.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ted_yu","name":"ted_yu","key":"ted_yu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ted Yu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-07-20T16:48:50.503+0000","updated":"2010-07-20T16:48:50.503+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469718/comment/12890374","id":"12890374","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=scott_carey","name":"scott_carey","key":"scott_carey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Carey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"\nI don't think that is a bug.  Passing around byte arrays larger than the valid data is common practice in Java for performance reasons.  Hence, the common method signature containing  (byte[] bytes, int len, int offset) and similar.   Creating a new byte array for each resize defeats the purpose of re-using the byte array and the Text object -- lower memory allocation and improved CPU cache locality.
