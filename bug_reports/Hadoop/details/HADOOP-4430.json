Essentially balancer gets all the datanodes used % to with in (the Cluster average +/- threshold).\n\nInconsistencies due to the change in 2816\nWhen MapReduce jobs are run, temporary files are generated. This eats away a lot of space from Present Capacity. The difference between the Total Capacity and the Present Capacity can be huge. Currently balancer computes Used Percentage based (Used Capacity)/(Total Capacity). The Used % the balancer uses could be significantly different from Used % displayed on the Namenode Web UI.

from (DFS Used)/(Present Capacity) to (DFS Used)/(Configured Capacity)\n- \"Present Capacity\" introduced in 2816 should be same as \"Configured Capacity\", if the MapReduce generated temporary files do not take more than the reserved space. When the temporary files use more than the reserved space, \"Present Capacity\" reduces proportionally. With this change, \"Present Capacity\" data is removed. Instead, the extra space exceeding reserved space used by temporary files, is reported as \"Non DFS Used\" space.\n- New \"DFS Remaining %\" will be added to explicitly to indicate remaining % space for DFS used.\n- Currently a percentage factor, as defined by \"dfs.datanode.du.pct\", is used to reduce the actual remaining space to calculate the DFS Remaining. This does not serve any purpose (see the comments in 2816). This will be removed.\n\nHere are the definition of data reported on the Web UI:\nConfigured Capacity: Disk space corresponding to all the data directories - Reserved space as defined by dfs.datanode.du.reserved\nDFS Used: Space used by DFS\nNon DFS Used: 0 if the temporary files do not exceed reserved space. Otherwise this is the size by which temporary files exceed the reserved space and encroach into the DFS configured space.\nDFS Remaining: (Configured Capacity - DFS Used - Non DFS Used)\nDFS Used %: (DFS Used / Configured Capacity) * 100\nDFS Remaining % = (DFS Remaining / Configured Capacity) * 100\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-10-16T18:40:29.225+0000","updated":"2008-10-16T18:40:29.225+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12406618/comment/12640260","id":"12640260","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chansler","name":"chansler","key":"chansler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Chansler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"We really want this in 0.19 to avoid operational confusion.
