[uploading a patch to fix the problem. Its just a one liner where long is interpreted as 2GBl and not just 2GB (which causes an overflow). It was an oversight while i uploaded the real patch. I am not attaching tests to this since it requires creation of input data that is > 2GB., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
