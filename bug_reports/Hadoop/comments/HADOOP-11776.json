[Rather than working ot update the jdiff interfaces, you could switch to using the Java API Compliance Checker. That's what HBase uses, and they were kind enough to add support for API definitions via class annotations. So now we check compatibility via InterfaceAudience definitions directly. (see [our test script|https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/master/dev-support/check_compatibility.sh] for info or HBASE-12808) , Hi [~busbey], thanks for the pointer! Will definitely look into that. , Worked on this issue on top of [~ozawa]'s HADOOP-11377 patch. That patch addressed the Null.java problem for me. In this patch I'm doing the following things:
# Applied a quick fix for the jdiff compatibility param settings to eliminate the package "" error. I'd appreciate if there's background information about this setting, so that we can decide the correct long term fix. 
# Run the maven script against branch-2.6.0 to generate two sample API files, one for hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common and one for hadoo-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs
# Fix the SAXParser not found exception when running jdiff. 

After this fix, hadoop hdfs can have API diff report after {{mvn package -Pdocs -DskipTests}} in its target/site/jdiff/xml folder. Hadoop common still has some problem with jdiff: jdiff is complainging the following:

  [javadoc] Error: duplicate comment id: org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.MetricsSystem.register_changed(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, T)

Since this is the only error we got in all components (we're also exploring YARN-3426 for yarn-api, yarn-client, yarn-common, and yarn-server-common), after briefly checking the original code of jdiff I highly suspect the error is triggered by a bug of jdiff. However, I'm not sure if jdiff is still maintained, so for long term fix we may want to find some alternative tools. 

So far the script would generate a diff report for hdfs. I'm extending the YARN part in YARN-3426.

This message is automatically generated., Tested the 3 failed tests locally, could reproduce none of them. The failed UTs appears to be irrelevant to the changes here. , This looks good to me. +1.

There is more work to be done, but the current patch should unblock the basic reporting. Checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7. Thanks Li!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7512 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7512/])

, Thanks [~vinodkv] for the review and commit. Yes we do have more things to do for tools to check API compatibility. Given the current status our long term goal may be replacing it with some other tool. , I believe it creates a lot of noises on the HDFS side. It does not differentiate between public and private APIs.]
