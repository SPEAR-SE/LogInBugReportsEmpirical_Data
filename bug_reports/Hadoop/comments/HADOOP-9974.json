[Moved to Hadoop since it appears to be a general build issue. I can reproduce it when building trunk with '-Pdist -Dtar'. The only workaround is to use protobuf 2.4 and pass -Dprotobuf.version=2.4.1., sounds unrelated. Try increasing your heap size for maven"
{code}
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx512m -Djava.awt.headless=true"
{code, Hi Arpit, 
In my environment(OS X), I could compile HttpFs correctly with trunk. Before compiling after upgrading your protobuf, please issue mvn clean. If not, the jar binaries which is compiled with protobuf 2.4.1 and 2.5.0 mixes, and it can causes some regression., SteveL's workaround solved it for me.

Tsuyoshi - 'mvn compile' would work but building a distribution with '-Pdist -Dtar' would fail consistently and only with protobuf 2.5.0.

Thanks!

, Resolving, please re-open if Steve's fix is insufficient. FWIW, I have not hit this in my Ubuntu dev environment., Edited a few fields to make it easier to find in case someone else hits the same issue., Patched BUILDING.TXT in branch-trunk, 2.1 and 2.1-beta to discuss this issue and provide the example env (I dropped the -headless flag to avoid distractions, though it is useful in OS/X to stop surefire bringing up windows), SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4441 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4441/])
