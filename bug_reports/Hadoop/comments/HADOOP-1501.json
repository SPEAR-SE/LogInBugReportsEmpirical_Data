[1. The first block report goes out as soon as the datanode starts.
2. The second block report goes out within a random time [ 0 .. dfs.blockReportInterval]
3. The succeeding block reports are generated once every dfs.blockreport.Interval time period., Does this mean we could get rid of {{blockReportIntervalBasis}} calculation? Currently it sets the interval to random value between 90-100% of configured interval. It is not necessary anymore.

+1 for current patch., Thanks for the review. I have not yet changed the 90-100% variablity of the periodicity of the block reports. I would like to keep that variability because it provides us with another randomization factor so that all block reports do not arrive at the namenode at around the same time. , +1
