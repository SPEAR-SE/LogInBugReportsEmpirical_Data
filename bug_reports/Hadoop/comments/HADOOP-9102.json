[This patch ports a similar change applied to branch-trunk-win for YARN-233 to branch-1-win., Looks like I had written it this way to differentiate between task being alive/dead vs an error in executing the command. This change means any error in execution that results in a non-zero exist code would mean the task is assumed to be dead. Not sure if thats correct but lets leave that for now since the same thing could happen for Linux and the Java code is written with that expectation too. This also makes the isAlive parsing redundant in Hadoop code.
+1, +1.

I committed the patch. Thank you Chris.]
