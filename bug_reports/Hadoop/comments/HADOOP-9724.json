[It's not an FsShell problem, but a HarFileSystem problem.

{{HarFileSystem#archivePath}} looks for the _last_ component that ends with ".har".  I'd expect it to use the first component ending with ".har" which would allow you to "see" the inner har.  However you won't be able to directly access files in the inner har w/o some wizardry.]
