This message is automatically generated., - looks like there are some hard tabs, please configure your editor to use spaces per our coding guidelines
- in the newly added LOG.debug line, please include some text. eg LOG.debug("Ignoring error closing socket", ignored);
- in the test case, please add a fail("Didn't throw") line after the IOUtils.copyBytes call. That will make sure that the exception is properly propagated and not swallowed.
- Probably better to separate the test in two -- one for the case where the inputstream throws, and another for the case when the output stream throws., - How is this an incompatible change?
- Please don't click the "reviewed" checkbox until a committer has reviewed., Hi Todd,

, Hi [~jojochuang] and [~qwertymaniac], can we backport this to branch-2? I think this fix is valuable and compatible because IOUtils.java is {{@Evolving}}., I'll backport this to branch-2 tomorrow if there are not any objections., Backported to branch-2.]
