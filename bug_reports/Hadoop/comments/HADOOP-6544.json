[the attached patch is for previous version of HADOOP. Not for commit in trunk., With patch contrib compiles and tests run. +1., This is just a symptom of HADOOP-6503, right? Can you try the patch there and see if it solves the issue? These one-off fixes seem to just be bandaids whereas that patch should solve it all around., Yes, looks like 6503's patch is more generic.]
