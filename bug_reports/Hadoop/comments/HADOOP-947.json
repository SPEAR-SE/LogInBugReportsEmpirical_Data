[This patch fixes the logic that determines whether a decommission is finished or not., The logic looks fine, but the new name, hasReachedReplicationFactor, implies the opposite of what the comment says and what the code does.  I think keeping the old name or switching true and false would work better.    , Incorporated review comments., This patch should remove make TestDecommission more deterministic., Hi wendy,

Thanks for the review. I made the change you requested. Can you pl give a
"+1" to the JIRA issue so that Nigel picks it up for the patch testing
process?

Thanks,

, +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12351377/isReplicationInProgress2.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r508345., +1, looks good, I just committed this.  Thanks, Dhruba.]
