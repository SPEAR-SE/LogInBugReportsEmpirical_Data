[Possibly there is no test case that completes a job without actually running it, which is why this issue was never found. So, I would recommend introducing a test that kills a queued job, and makes sure it is not there in the list. , Attaching patch that fixes the issue. Result of _test-patch_ on my box

This message is automatically generated., HADOOP-4513 fixes this issue for hadoop-0.20. The attached patch fixes the bug in hadoop-0.19 and also provides a testcase. HADOOP-4513 has removed {{JobQueuesManager.getWaitingJobQueue()}} api and hence a new test case needs to be submitted for hadoop-0.20., Tested the patch with hadoop-0.19.

Running _ant-test_ now., _ant-test_ passed on my local box., I just committed this to the Hadoop 0.19 branch. Thanks, Amar.

As noted above, this fix is required only for the Hadoop 0.19 branch. In Hadoop 0.20, other changes to the code which are committed (HADOOP-4513 specifically) make this issue non-existent.]
