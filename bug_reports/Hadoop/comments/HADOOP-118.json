[This patch 
  1. registers DFS Clients onto a list to be close when the jvm exits. 
  2. makes closing a DFSClient call abandonFileCreate on each file that was not finished.
  3. it throws an exception if the client is used after it is closed.
  4. removes the close done by the JobClient
  5. adds the lease holder to the abandonFileInProgress message. This allows  the host's lease to be cleaned up as well as detecting attempts to abandon other clients files., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
