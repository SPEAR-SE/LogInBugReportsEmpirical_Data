This message was automatically generated., [~djp] Thanks for reporting this issue.. we also got internally same issue. 

In these two class also we can avoid printing secure info.

In SaslRpcClient.java sasl message

{code}      
      if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
        LOG.debug("Received SASL message "+saslMessage);
      }
{code}

and in UserGroupInformation.java ticket info.

{code}
        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
          LOG.debug("Found tgt " + ticket);
        }
{code}, bq. In these two class also we can avoid printing secure info.
Nice catch, [~surendrasingh]! Removing debug info in these two places in v2 patch., \\
