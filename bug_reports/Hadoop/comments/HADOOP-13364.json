[The variable has been quoted in  hadoop-3.0.0-alpha1, but there still exists fatal error if the root directory contains space character, such as:
[hadoop@hadoop hadoop base]$ hadoop-3/bin/hadoop version
Error: Could not find or load main class base.hadoop-3.lib.native
In this case, the name of root direcotry is "hadoop base", when I exec "hadoop-3/bin/hadoop version", I don't receive the error message you described, but another error. So I haved submited a new bug HADOOP-13741, and this bug could be closed., The variables  described here haved been quoted in hadoop-3.0.0-alpha1, For the record, spaces in paths can't be fixed without HADOOP-13365.  There is way way way too much dependence on using space as a parameter delimiter.
