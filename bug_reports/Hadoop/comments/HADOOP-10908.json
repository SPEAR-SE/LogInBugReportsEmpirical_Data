[Quick list of things:
* Remove reference to YARN_xyz where there is a HADOOP_xyz equivalent
* Remove the 'appender' env vars examples
* Remove HADOOP_SECURE_PID_DIR since hadoop-env.sh mentions it specifically.  Plus that should be in the security documentation, not someone's first intro to hadoop.
* Mention that hadoop-env.sh can be used for all services and that yarn-env.sh and mapred-env.sh don't have to be used
* If HADOOP-10950 gets committed, mention that heapsizes can be in m, g, etc. units.  Also no more HADOOP_HEAPSIZE, but use _MAX and _MIN
* Mention -D params for setting logging options too.
* Remove sbin commands for single-node start/stop. Use --daemon equivalents instead. (e.g., hadoop-daemon.sh start namenode => hdfs --daemon start namenode ), -00:

We can remove the second 'first'.

That last sentence is confusing. It should probably provide an example of a daemon-specific HEAPSIZE variable

We should define what trusted access means. I assume you meant password-less SSH.

This looks like a copy/paste error. It should say "YARN processes can be stopped" and "[yarn]$ $HADOOP_PREFIX/sbin/stop-yarn.sh".



, -01:
* Fix [~fwiffo]'s list of issues (I think) in various ways
* Fix some style issues
* Change HADOOP_HEAPSIZE to HADOOP_HEAPSIZE_MAX and mention unit support
* Fix some links
* Mention HADOOP_PREFIX as a global and using /etc/profile.d in an example
* Add pdsh as a package to add in place of rsync, since that's actually supported and useful
