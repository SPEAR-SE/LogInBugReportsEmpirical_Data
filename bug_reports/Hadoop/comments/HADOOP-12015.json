[test-patch.sh looks at the last file to determine what it should do.  This is pretty much by design., Got it.

Do you think it's worthwhile to use "file" to identify the file as "diff output text"?  Otherwise, I'm fine with closing this up and re-submitting the patch on my JIRA., BTW, ignoring the last file if it is a non-patch is going to result in a lot of churn:

* multiple downloads to find a file since people name things weird
* lots of excess patch precommit checking for patches that have already been processed bz the image/doc/whatever came after the patch precommit ran (extremely common in the cases where there is more than just a patch present)

IMO, this is pretty much a won't fix.  Just upload the patch last and it all works., bq. Do you think it's worthwhile to use "file" to identify the file as "diff output text"?

:D, Closing as won't fix for the reasons above.]
