[I'm thinking hdfs-dev@hadoop.apache.org is the right place to report because this issue is not related to Apache Hadoop source code.

I'll update the wiki to edit the link to https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=hadoop.git;a=tree;f=hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-native-client/src/main/native/libhdfs-tests shortly.

Thanks [~jgoldfar] for reporting this., FYI: If you want to edit Hadoop wiki, create your wiki account and mail to common-dev@hadoop.apache.org.
