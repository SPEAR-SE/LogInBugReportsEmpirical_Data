[Due to the way the IPC Client does SASL negotiation, once a connection is established, an immediately following connection reset is handled by {{handleSaslConnectionFailure()}}.  This will throw an {{IOException}}, which {{FailoverOnNetworkExceptionRetry.shouldRetry}} prescribes {{RetryAction.FAILOVER_AND_RETRY}} for, without any delay. The client can burn though retries rather quickly and have a permanent failure., Sure would be nice to have HADOOP-10940 integrated so I don't have to make a different patch..., 2.7.3 is under release process, changing target-version to 2.7.4., Moving target version to 2.7.5 due to 2.7.4 release., Moving target version to 2.7.6 due to 2.7.5 release.]
