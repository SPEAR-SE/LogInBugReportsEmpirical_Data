[Based on the discussion in HADOOP-10255 and HBASE-10336, here is the proposed fix for the compatibility issues for HBase:

# Fork {{HttpServer2}} from {{HttpServer}} in trunk. HDFS and YARN will only use {{HttpServer2}}. Hadoop will continue to maintain {{HttpServer2}}. {{HttpServer}} does not exist in trunk.
# Bring {{HttpServer}} directly into branch-2 from branch-2.2. This allows HBase to work seamlessly between Hadoop 2.x and future releases that based on branch-2. The class can be tailored to make sure that HBase works with Hadoop 2.x releases. Once HBASE-10336 is resolved, the class can be removed from branch-2., [~stack], can you please quickly verify that HADOOP-10255 and HADOOP-10292 solve the compatibility issue for HBase? Thanks., [~wheat9] I am on it now.
, Thanks [~stack] for the help. Once you confirm that it is working, I will commit the change. , Putting in place a hadoop-common jar made from the tip of branch-2.3 with these HADOOP-10255 and HADOOP-10292 applied works for me.  I am cluster-challenged at the moment so this was standalone test only (I tried a hadoop-common jar w/o the patches and got ClassNotFound for HttpServer... as expected).  I'd be +1 on commit of this and hadoop-10255 (Let me know if you want me commit them).  I will try and cluster test more this evening if I get my cluster back to see if that alters anything but do not expect it too. Thanks.

, +1 for the patch.

I am going to commit these changes soon. [~stack], if you do any more tests or find issues, please comment on this jira. We can have a separate follow up., I have committed this change to branch-2. Thank you [~wheat9]. Thank you [~stack] for testing and review.

HttpServer needs to be removed in branch-2 once HBase stops using it from Hadoop Common., FYI with the reswizzle of branch-2.3, I think this was missed. I just merged it to the new branch-2.3.]
