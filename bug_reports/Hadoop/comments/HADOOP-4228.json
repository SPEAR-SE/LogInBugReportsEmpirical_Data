This message is automatically generated., The failed test has no relationship to this patch.  There is probably something else committed to trunk which caused Balancer test failure., The SimulatedDataNodeMetrics seems quite dummy, which is introduced for only the testing purpose.

A side note: DataNodeStatics and DataNodeStaticsMBean collect bytesRead but not bytesWritten. They should collect metrics bytesWritten as well., This patch has the following changes:
1. DataNode's metrics bytesRead & bytesWritten are changed to be long;
2. Add getBytesWritten method to DataNodesStaticsticsMBean;
3. Add a unit test to see if DataNodeMetrics can handle long number of bytes written., +1, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This is a patch for branch 18., This is a patch for the trunk. It removes the change to DFSTestUtil that caused the failed tests., Changing the type to Long breaks Ganglia metrics reporting (there's a static mapping of Java type -> Ganglia type; there's no current Long type, meaning the map returns null and causes a NPE).

Ganglia has no Long type - perhaps a solution would be to map Longs in Ganglia to a float?

Short of supporting the Long data type, this seems like a reasonable thing to do. 

Brian, would you mind coming up with the patch for the Ganglia context?, Thank Brian for submitting a patch to HADOOP-4137 for handling Long type in Ganglia context. I am resubmitting my patch to hudson., +1 for Hairong's patch.  The patch provides real test cases., Resubmit the patch since the hudson patch process is back., +1 overall.
