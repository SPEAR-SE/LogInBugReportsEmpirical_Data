[IFile.Writer.close() closes the rawOut?

HADOOP-3514 changed this..., Yes, that needs to be fixed. The reason for that is because of IFileOutputStream.close just does the checksum calculation, but does not call close of the underlying output stream. 
This possibly should be fixed by treating  it the same way as compressed output stream -- have the functionality of checksum calculation in finish() and have close call finish and the underlying stream's close.

{code}

public void finish() {
  (if finished) {
    return;
  }
  else {
    finished = true;
    // calcualte checksum and write to
    // underlying stream
  }
}

 public void close() throws IOException {
    finish();
    out.close();
  }
{code}, Created a new Jira HADOOP-4706 to address the IFileOutputStream.close issue, This is no longer an issue]
