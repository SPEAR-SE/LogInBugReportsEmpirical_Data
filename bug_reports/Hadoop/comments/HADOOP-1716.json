[Hmm, the problem is that the input file is being converted to a string and is picking up the schema now. So instead of trying to open "/foo/part1" it is trying to open "file:/foo/part1" is nIn particular, I get in the stderr file:

Hadoop Pipes Exception: failed to open file:/home/oom/work/eclipse/hadoop/build/test/data/pipes/input/part1 at /home/oom/work/eclipse/hadoop/src/examples/pipes/impl/wordcount-nopipe.cc:49 in WordCountReader::WordCountReader(HadoopPipes::MapContext&)

The fix is going to be in the wordcount nopipe example., This patch fixes the wordcount-nonpipe example and the TestPipes code to deal with the fact that the input and output paths now include schemas. Clearly they need to be removed before they are passed to the C++ file utils. *smile*, I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
