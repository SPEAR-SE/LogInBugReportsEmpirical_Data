[This failure only repros for me when the native code is loaded.  The problem is this assertion:
{code}
  public void testGzipLongOverflow() throws IOException {
    LOG.info("testGzipLongOverflow");

    // Don't use native libs for this test.
    Configuration conf = new Configuration();
    conf.setBoolean("io.native.lib.available", false);
    assertFalse("ZlibFactory is using native libs against request",
        ZlibFactory.isNativeZlibLoaded(conf));
{code}
The test is trying to disable native library loading by setting configuration, but the code in {{ZlibFactory}} isn't inspecting the correct configuration property:
{code}
  public static boolean isNativeZlibLoaded(Configuration conf) {
    return nativeZlibLoaded && conf.getBoolean("hadoop.native.lib", true); 
  }
{code}
The trunk version of the code doesn't have this problem., For anyone who is interested, here's a patch that fixes the test.]
