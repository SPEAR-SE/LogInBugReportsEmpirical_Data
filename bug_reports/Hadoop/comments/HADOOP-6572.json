This message is automatically generated., It's not easy to write a unit test since the bug depends on a race condition among RPC handler threads. But we have run the same manual tests with the patch and the errors disappeared., +1, I just committed this. Thanks, Kan!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #177 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/177/])
    . Makes sure that SASL encryption and push to responder queue for the RPC response happens atomically. Contributed by Kan Zhang.
