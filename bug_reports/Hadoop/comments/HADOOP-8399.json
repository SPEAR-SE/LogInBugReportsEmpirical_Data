[That seems to do the job.
The patch includes changes both for test-patch.sh and the build.xml file, I am not sure if this is possible to test with usual patch validation process because it affects test-patch.sh.

However, it works in my local run of {{ant -Dforrest.home=$FORREST_HOME docs}}, A strong +1 -- would be really nice to get rid of this ancient dependency., BTW, until this fix goes in, you may be interested to know there's a work-around:
I don't actually use Java 5.  As long as you're using Forrest version 0.9 or higher, you can just create a symlink to Java 6 and name it Java 5, and all works well., We have two competing versions of this patch, the one here in HADOOP-8399, and a pair of patches in HADOOP-8166.  I have compared them and found this one to be superior in terms of match to current branch-1.1.

HADOOP-8399 patches files: build.xml, forrest.properties, test-patch.sh
hadoop-8166 patches files: build.xml, do-release-build, forrest.properties, test-patch.sh
The changes to build.xml and forrest.properties are equivalent.
The file cloudera/do-release-build does not exist in Apache code.
The changes to test-patch.sh differ in several ways, but seem to match the branch-1.1 code better in HADOOP-8399.

In particular, HADOOP-8399 applies smoothly to test-patch.sh, while HADOOP-8166 fails 3 of 9 chunks.  Furthermore, after applying HADOOP-8399, all instances of 'java5' are gone, which makes all the substantive differences between the two patches irrelevant.

+1 on this patch.  Committing to branch-1.1 and branch-1.  Marking HADOOP-8166 as duplicate.

, Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.1.0.]
