[The problem is that the RPC server first checks if a metrics is registered; if no, it then register the metrics. However, check/register is not synchronized. So although the first check reports the metrics is not registered, the metrics may be registered by another thread before this thread registers it.

I propose that IPC server catches the exception and fetches the metrics handle again., Here is a patch that fixes the problem., +1 patch looks good., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
