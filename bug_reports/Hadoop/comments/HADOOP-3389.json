[Debugged this on hudson.zones solaris box and found out the actual reason for failure.

When i run /bin/sh -c "sleep 10", the processes that are spawned are (two?!)
bq. 28998  /bin/sh /bin/sh /bin/sh (??!)
and 
bq. 28999  sleep 10

While on RHEL, in spawns only one process which is the process we wish to run.
bq. 29015 sleep 10

And, we use /bin/sh -c "command" to run any external command from inside hod  - src.contrib.hod.Common.threads.simpleCommand class. The pid returned by this class is that of the direct child(which would be the one with pid 28998 and which doesn't return till 300 secs in this test-case) and this explains the issue. The issue has gone away when I made simpleCommand to use /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh to run the given command.

So, a possible fix for this could be changing the implementation of simpleCommand to use /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh. Hadoop is using /bin/bash all over the places, so this shouldn't be a problem.

Side Notes:
1) The first process(pid 28998) is odd in any case. Is this how solaris's /bin/sh behaves and why?
2) Nigel observed that /bin/sh is a link to /sbin/sh on this machine (ok/weird?), If it is true that Hadoop itself uses /bin/bash everywhere, including for working on Solaris, the fix seems reasonable atleast for now. Can we double check this, and proceed to change simpleCommand ? I think it should be OK, because in my case /bin/sh links to /bin/bash and so it is working fine. In that manner we can say it is well tested., Hemanth, any update on this?, hod contrib was removed]
