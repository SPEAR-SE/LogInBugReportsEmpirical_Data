[This looks like a stale issue. It should not matter whether you specify slaves by names or ip addresses as long as your shell recognizes where to ssh. Don't have Ubuntu to try this but it seams to work in my environment with current trunk.
I am closing it but please feel free to reopen and describe the problem in more details if it persists.]
