[Hi Todd,

By looking the trace, I think the problem exist here.

{code}
// need a static method for the ctor above
  private static FileStatus getStat(FileSystem fs, Path path)
  throws IOException {  
    FileStatus status = null;
    try {
      status = fs.getFileStatus(path);
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {} // ignore FNF
    return status;
  }
{code}

In PathData, it is just ignoring the FileNotFoundException and returning null.



Thanks
Uma
, It's actually a bit more than that.  The recursion is handled incorrectly in some cases.  I've got a really old patch for this that I can put once 205 work is complete., Thanks Daryn!, same issue]
