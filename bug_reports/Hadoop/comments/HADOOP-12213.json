This message was automatically generated., Thanks for the patch [~kshukla]. I will review it shortly., Should this be a hadoop common issue? Looks like all the changes are in hadoop common project., Overall patch Looks good. Few minor nits.
* There should be a space between () and { here
{{public static final ExecutorService getClientExecutor(){}}
* In testStandAloneClient(), we need spaces near the brackets. Change {{}finally{}} to {{} finally {}}
* In testConnectionIdleTimeouts(), we need space near the brackets. Change {{}finally{}} to {{} finally {}}
* testInterrupted needs to be indented.
* In doErrorTest, testRTEDuringConnectionSetup stopping the client before the server makes more sense. Swap the stop calls in finally block
* In testSocketFactoryException,testIpcConnectTimeout {{client.stop()}} should be within finally block
* Is there a need to move {{Client client = new Client(LongWritable.class, conf, spyFactory);}} in testRTEDuringConnectionSetup?, Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.1 into 2.7.2., Changes to TestIPC and Client with correct indentation and formatting., \\
