[I'm running with r709534 so HADOOP-4499 is in place but I still see the above exceptions., The line number in the stacktrace does not match the latest 0.19 branch.. could you verify if you have HADOOP-4499? Thanks., Thanks. I confirmed that the debug message no longer shows (My bad, HBase was using DFSClient out of RC0 when I made above stacktraces).  Resolving as fixed by HADOOP-4499.]
