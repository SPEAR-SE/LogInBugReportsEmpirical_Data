, Nicholas, I see that this issue is marked fixed for 0.20.1, but doesn't seem to have been committed for branch 0.20 (verified from the subversion commits). I found the problem when merging CHANGES.txt between trunk and the 0.20 branch. Can you please verify ?, Hemanth, thanks for checking this.  I've just committed this to 0.20.]
