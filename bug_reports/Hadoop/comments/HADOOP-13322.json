[If it's happening in the Java layer, there's not much we can do in Hadoop —though we can write a test, see what happens. And we can document it as a known issue

Which Java version are you using? can you paste in the output of {{java --version}}, java version "1.8.0_66"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_66-b17)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.66-b17, mixed mode)

I will try to check this withing Kerberos source(just to make sure that semicolumn should be parsed) and report to Java devs.

EDIT: I have investigated the issue, seems like there might be a problem in security package (with the parser). I have reported an issue to Java devs, let's see what they will tell us. As soon as they accept/reject I will update the info., So the issue is confirmed Java bug: http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8160518 (my report got accepted), Thanks for chasing this up; I've updated the environment field to reflect the version, though presumably it'll be in previous versions. At least now we'll be able to track if/when it gets fixed, This is fixed in Java  JDK 8u112, for which [an early access buld is available|http://java.net/].

from the [list of changes|http://www.java.net/download/java/jdk8u112/changes/jdk8u112-b03.html] , "JDK-8160518 : Semicolumn is not recognized as comment starting character (Kerberos)"

http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8160518

why not grab this release and verify that it works? If so, we can close this JIRA

(fast turnaround from Oracle if you only filed it last month —given how they've let other ones languish for years, they must care about Kerberos again)]
