[I think we should consider renaming {{TestGlobPaths#fs}} to {{TestGlobPaths#privFs}}, and renaming {{TestGlobPaths#unprivilegedFs}} to {{TestGlobPaths#unprivFs}} to make it less unwieldy to type.  (And similar for FC, and all the other wrappers, etc.) This will also make it clear which one we're using., I rolled this fix into HADOOP-10957 at Daryn's request.]
