[Setting the phase of the hadoop-maven-plugins plugin execution to compile., +1 for the patch

This patch also applies cleanly to trunk and branch-trunk-win, so I've added those in the target versions.  I tested the builds on both of those branches, and they looked good.  Thank you!

, we should bind the version-info plugin to the prepare-resources phase instead of compile., I committed the patch to trunk and branch-trunk-win.

Thank you Karthik!, bq. we should bind the version-info plugin to the prepare-resources phase instead of compile.

, Note that this change broke web service tests in YARN.  See YARN-361.  I'm guessing this is related to the issue Alejandro brought up earlier about the version-info plugin?  Was there any followup?, Filed HADOOP-9246 - I believe it is ready to reviewed/committed. Thanks Jason., I beleive im still seeing this issue. 

To reproduce: 

1) Clone hadoop-common 
2) run mvn clean package 

And you'll get something like this:

Are we sure this patch fixes it in all cases?, apologies, ... (i cant reproduce the above error on  afresh clone of hadoop-common)... so i guess this bug is fixed :)., Just as an FYI for those hitting this same issue.  I think you still need to do: 

{noformat}
cd hadoop-maven-plugins
mvn install;
cd hadoop-common-project;
mvn eclipse:eclipse
{noformat}

In order to build hadoop-common-project. 

However, I cant say if this is really still a bug or not.]
