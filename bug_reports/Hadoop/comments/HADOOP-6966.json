[Relevant portion of bzip2 1.0.6 patch for CVE-2010-0405, and untested (not even compiled) port of it to Hadoop trunk.

I've also added a credit that I suspect should have been added long ago (but in any case is relevant to this patch) and marked three of the missing bounds-check locations without actually attempting to fix them.  (They're all trivial, I think, just tedious; and I don't have time at the moment to finish this off.)]
