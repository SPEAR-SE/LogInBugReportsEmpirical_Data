[we should change the default mapred user to 'mapred' instead of 'mr' in these scripts. Also did you run these scripts as user root? 

The various setup scripts need to be executed by user root., yes - all was run as root : .sh scripts and the dpk -i install, can you also add the permissions errors you saw. Will help in debugging where the issue is., bump - I have some time to work on this if the current .deb project owner would contact me., Is this going to be resolved fast or should we use the tar.gz files and configure hadoop "by hand" ?, Issue is still there in 1.0.3.

This issue is unassigned, does it mean no-one is looking into it?

Seems that we can still install using  --mapreduce-user=mapred option but I have not tried yet.

I might give it a try later today. But reverting the installation when it fails is long., Closing as won't fix.  We no longer ship packaged versions.]
