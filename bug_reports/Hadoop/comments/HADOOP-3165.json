This message is automatically generated., I tested it changes by executing the command and it work. I tried few things to get a testcase but couldnt find an easy implementation. I tried to construct hadoop dfs -put - dfsfile < localfile. But executing this using Shell required more than just getting java and -classpath. , It does not seem simple to test this. We need to find a way to test stdin and stdout (HADOOP-3175)., I just committed this. Thanks Lohit., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #451 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/451/])]
