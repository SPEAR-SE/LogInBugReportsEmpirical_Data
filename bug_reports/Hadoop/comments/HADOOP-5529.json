[New status object is replaced in map. This quick patch copies over diagnostic message seen earlier to new status object so that it is carried forward and hence make it to history file. Tested this manually by killing jobs at random and see message being copied and logged into history file., This is fixed as part of HADOOP-4759. Fixed in 0.19.1 and 0.20.]
