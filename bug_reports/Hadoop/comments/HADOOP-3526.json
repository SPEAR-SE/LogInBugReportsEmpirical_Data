[The issue is related to HADOOP-3522. The patch just clones the objects returned from the ValueIterator and forces the user-provided classes to implement a clone() method as well., 
Since applications using this package break with 0.17,
I think this is a blocker for 0.17.1
, Spyros-

This looks like the right idea; a couple suggestions:
* It would break less existing code if this used WritableUtils::clone instead of adding an abstract method
* The tag at DataJoinReducerBase::107 doesn't need to be cloned, -1 as the patch should have a unit test., Chris, 
The tag needs cloning, because it's stored as a key in the SortedMap. Otherwise, the Text.equals() method always returns true (see HADOOP-3522).
As for the WritableUtils.clone() suggestion, I upload a new version of the patch which incorporates it.

Nigel,
Unfortunately there is no existing JUnit test covering the contributed data_join code and I don't know how to change the build.xml file to run the new tests. Also, building a JUnit testing framework for generic map-reduce jobs like data_join is much more difficult than targeting specific functions, as done in the core. I would be happy to create a test if you can point me to some code that tests a generic map/reduce job that I can tweak. , Spyros, Chris has agreed to write some unit tests for Hadoop 0.18.

Sorry, I mean it doesn't need to be cloned there, for the lookup. Since the record needs to be cloned anyway and it includes the tag, it should be sufficient to clone the record and use the tag for the map key., I just committed this.
