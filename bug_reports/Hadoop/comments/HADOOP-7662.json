This message is automatically generated., Manual testing done.  This was done in conjunction with MAPREDUCE-2999, which when specifying a auth filter via hadoop.http.filter.initializers caused the /logs servlet to stop working for yarn webapps. 

- load up a yarn web page (do for all resource manager, node manager, app master, and job history).  Verify that going to host:port/logs loads up the logs servlet and calls the AdminAuthorizedServlet class and you can see the log directory.  verify the other default servlets still work (/stacks,/logLevel,/metrics,/conf,/jmx,/static).

- also test dfshealth.jsp and verify /logs and other default servlets work (/stacks,/logLevel,/metrics,/conf,/jmx,/static)., +1, lgtm., I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23.
