[Patch adds commons-io to hadoop-core-pom-template.xml, I'm sorry I didn't know anything about the XMLs in the ivy directory. 

Thanks for the patch Zhihong! Looks good!

Could you please add a comment in ivy.xml to update the XMLs in the ivy directory just to reduce the chances of this happening again?

, Just saw Ravi's comment.

Patch v2 attached., +1 patch is good.
Will commit it shortly., Committed to branch-1.1. Thank you Zhihong., Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.1.0.]
