[To fix this we're going to enforce a pathname limit in the Path class constructor. .  (8K in length and 1K in depth.)   The constructor will throw an exception which will be passed back to the client. , We've changed our plan.  Instead of enforcing the length in the Path constructor, we are going to enforce it in mkdirs, addFile, and renameTo.  The reason for this is that the limitation is not actually in Path, but in the filesystem, so we should not enforce it in Path.  An exception will still be passed back to the client. 

If you object to this plan or prefer the original, please comment. 


, I just wanted to mention that there are file systems out there without path restrictions.
