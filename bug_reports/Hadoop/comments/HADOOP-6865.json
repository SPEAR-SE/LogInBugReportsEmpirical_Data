[There is a method to slove this problem. When ant built the project, ivy-2.0.0-rc2.jar would be rewritten. If network was not connected, this jar would have some error that cannot be repaired automatically. But you can use a original ivy-2.0.0-rc2.jar to replace it, then ant building will be ok., Looks like you have a broken Icy zip file. Try to remove it., Yep, it is possible that ivy-2.0.0-rc2.jar is the broken lcy zip file. I remove it and put a original ivy-2.0.0-rc2.jar and ant works well. But how to revise ant build to do it automatically and how about building without network supporting. By the way, I am just a new user of ant, looking for a solution., Fixes for this
 -store the ivy file in the source tree and use it that way
 -store the SHA1 checksum of the ivy file, and verify that the doenloaded artifact in the ivy cache dir matches it. That's a good security check anyway., mavenization makes this stale. closing.]
