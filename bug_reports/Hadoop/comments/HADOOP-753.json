[There seems to be a problem with the patch for Hadoop-723. The sort benchmark throws up lots of errors (of the form mentioned in Hadoop-750) with this patch and the errors disappear when this patch is reversed., Note that if you use HADOOP (all-caps) in bug ids then will Jira create links to the relevant issues, HADOOP-723 and HADOOP-750 in this case., Thanks for identifying the 723 patch as the source of the problem. It looks like it is 723 adding the timeouts to the getFile connection that causes more failures and therefore makes the race condition more likely to occur. That said, I'm still investigating., This was fixed by HADOOP-750.]
