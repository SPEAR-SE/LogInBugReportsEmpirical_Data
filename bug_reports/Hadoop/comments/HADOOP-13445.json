[[~jzhuge] I think general_lists.html is deprecated, and now we use mailing_lists.html to track contact list.   
How about getting a hadoop committer involved to decide whether we should fix it, then we move on?, Thanks [~yuanbo] for the info. Maybe we should either redirect {{general_lists.html}} to {{mailing_lists.html}} or remove it?]
