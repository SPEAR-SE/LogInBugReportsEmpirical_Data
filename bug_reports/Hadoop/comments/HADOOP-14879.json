[I'm seeing this too: the build is broken for a basic "mvn clean install"

# What changed? It needs to be rolled back unless it can be fixed immediately.
# How did the breakage not get picked up on? Did yetus miss it, and if so, what can we do for yetus and/or our process to address it, It's  after HADOOP-14771, all the precommits having this issue., fixed by reverting HADOOP-14771, Steve Loughran and Brahma Reddy Battula, thanks for the information and reverting it.]
