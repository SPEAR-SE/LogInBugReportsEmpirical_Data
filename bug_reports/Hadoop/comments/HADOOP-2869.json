This message is automatically generated., Yes! I could improve this patch my not introducing new imports for the javadocs... *smile*, I'm also planning on using this issue to fix backward compat broken by HADOOP-1851 where calling the setType or setCompressClass do not set the boolean to 'true' and users need to explicitly call it..., All necessary fixes to ensure bc..., -1 overall.
