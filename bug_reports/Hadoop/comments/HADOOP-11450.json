, [~varun_saxena] Thanks for the patch. How about using try-with-resources statement for SequenceFile.Reader? The code paths get more readable. 

{code}
    try (SequenceFile.Reader in = new SequenceFile.Reader(jobconf, Reader.file(sorted));) {
        ...
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
       LOG.warn(StringUtils.stringifyException(ioe));
    }
{code}

This message is automatically generated., [~varun_saxena], thank you for the updating patch. We are almost there.

Minor nits: TraditionalBinaryPrefix and long2String should be same line for the coding style:
{code}
      return b + " bytes (" + TraditionalBinaryPrefix.
          long2String(b, "", 1) + ")";
{code}

One suggestion is to fix it like this:
{code}
      return b + " bytes (" +
          TraditionalBinaryPrefix.long2String(b, "", 1) + ")";
{code}, [~ozawa], updated a new patch with change as per your suggestion, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
