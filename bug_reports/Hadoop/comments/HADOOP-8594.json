[We currently use this version of findbugs-maven-plugin across hadoop trunk: http://mojo.codehaus.org/findbugs-maven-plugin-2.3.2/

Latest is 2.5.1 that uses 2.0.0 findbugs, at http://mojo.codehaus.org/findbugs-maven-plugin/

Making some changes to see if merely switching over works., Here's a findbugs converted to HTML report over HDFS generated with the 2.5.1 version. Reports 53 new warnings., Here's the patch that bumps the version. Had to do it in two places., Here's a list of all findbug reports across the hadoop project, in HTML and preserved in their own dirs, archived., How should we address these individual projects though? Via sub-tasks or one global patch? I can do most of them, and compile a list we'd have to discuss about., Thanks Harsh, let's have a jira per project to switch over to the new plugin version and address the warnings in the patch that bumps the version., I agree with Eli on this.  Switching to a new findbugs is a great thing, but I don't want to break the pre-commit builds in the process.  If we do that new findbugs issues will get past it simply because 54 looks a lot like 53 and it is simpler to say I didn't break it then to look at all 54 of the errors to see what the new ones might be. , Filed HDFS-4014 for HDFS., Can you pls file one jira rather than tonnes to fix this? Thanks., Attaching the 10 findbugs reports for common and the various hadoop-tools projects and hadoop-auth. Common has 100 or so warnings and there's a couple dozen spread out around the others. Probably makes sense to do these like HDFS-4014, sensitive changes get their own patch and the general new classes of warning can be handled in bulk in a small set of patches., Closing this issue as all sub-tasks has been closed.
Now hadoop use findbugs 3.0.0 and we are fixing new warnings in HADOOP-10477.]
