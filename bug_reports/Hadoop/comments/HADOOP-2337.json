[I realized I cannot continue with streaming edits HADOOP-4539 without fixing this becasue the standby node is not supposed to run trash.
So this is the patch, which
- does not start Trash thread if trash is disabled
- closes FileSystem when Trash.Emptier exits
- also cleanded up warnings in TestTrash., +1, Only one unit test failure with this patch. TestMapReduceLocal fails as in HADOOP-4907., I just committed this.]
