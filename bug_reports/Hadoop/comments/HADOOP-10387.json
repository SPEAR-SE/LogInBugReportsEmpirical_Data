[+1, I applied the patch locally and confirmed all of the misspellings 'threshhold' were fixed., Hi [~kj-ki], now hadoop-azure and hadoop-nfs projects have typo 'threshhold', so would you please update the patch to fix them?, Attached an updated patch for hadoop-azure and hadoop-nfs.
Thanks for reviewing and comments, [~ajisakaa]!, +1 (non-binding), pending Jenkins., This patch will never get tested by Jenkins as it touches way too many subsystems and gets killed before test-patch.sh completes.  To move forward, it must get broken up into (minimally) each subproject., Cancelling patch to prevent test-patch.sh from triggering., [~ajisakaa] Attached patch for Hadoop common..Kindly Review..Thanks, [~ajisakaa] Same needs to be fixed in hadoop-azure and hadoop-aws ( did not file seperate jira for these two projects), thought of including HADOOP-11922 ,Please let me know your opinion.., I'm thinking splitting into two patch is fine. HADOOP-10387 for hadoop-common-project (including hadoop-nfs) and HADOOP-11922 for hadoop-tools (including hadoop-azure and hadoop-aws)., Ok.. I updated as per your comment..Kindly Review., Thanks [~brahmareddy] for updating the patch. LGTM, +1 pending jenkins., \\
