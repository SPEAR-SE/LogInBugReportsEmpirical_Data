I have committed this.  Thanks, Ravi!, I think the above patch should not be applied to branch 20 as bin/hdfs is supported only after the project split. Hence opened HADOOP:5990., Ramya, you are right.  0.20 needs a different message.  Thanks for looking at this.  I will revert the patch committed to 0.20.

Ravi, could you post a new patch for 0.20?, Thanks for correction Ramya ,  Nicholas please consider this patch for Hadoop 20 . , Manually tested this patch on command line.
