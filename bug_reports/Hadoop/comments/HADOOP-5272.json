[Attaching a patch that does 2 things
# Maintain the first attempt seen by the TIP. This provides 2 functions
 ## Any random attempt should not classify as the first attempt (possible in trunk)
 ## Only the first seen/processed attempt is marked as first and hence across restart, joining tasks (attemptid > 0) can also act as the first attempt.

# In JIP.addRunningTaskToTIP(), add the attempt to the tip before anything else. This solves 2 problems
 ## Helps in computing (1)
 ## speculation counts are now computed in JIP.addRunningTaskToTIP() assuming that the attempt is already added.

HADOOP-4191 should test this patch., I tested this patch with TestJobHistory(of HADOOP-4191) and I see that with this patch, TIP start is added properly.
