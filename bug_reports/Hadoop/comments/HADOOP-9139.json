This message is automatically generated., Can you look at the test failure please? , Hi, Thomas, 
the test org.apache.hadoop.ha.TestZKFailoverController seems to be falky, it fails from time to time. 
I suppose, in pre-commit verification jobs the killKdc.sh skript affected by the patch is not even ever invoked because the profile -PstartKdc is not specified.
So, I suppose this failure is not anyhow related to the patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
