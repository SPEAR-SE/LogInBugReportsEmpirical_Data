[I believe it does, see ./dev-support/test-patch.sh. Perhaps it's running and the errors are getting ignored., It looks like test-patch.sh is running maven with -fn (fail-never), because otherwise maven stops running as soon as the first test fails.  This could lead to not getting a full list of test failures.

I wonder if it would be possible to use -fae, (fail-at-end).  The documentation says "Only fail the build afterwards; allow all non-impacted builds to continue."

Manually grepping for failure strings seems very brittle-- I would like to avoid it if at all possible and let maven itself tell us what is wrong., Sorry if my comment was confusingly worded (too many negatives?).  I meant "we use -fn to make sure we run all tests if possible", +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
