[At first look, failmon build creates
     src/contrib/failmon/lib (under the src dir!)
but the clean target doesn't clean it up., It is possible that HADOOP-3964 actually solves this problem., I think we still have javadoc warnings on trunk.  I will check this., I ran "ant test-patch" with an empty patch file.  There are 6 new javadoc warnings.  All of them are different from the ones in HADOOP-3964., Fixed by HADOOP-3964.
