[Amareshwari was so kind to check out the situation and found that some TaskTracker was still running 0.16.0. This TaskTracker was on a node which was down during upgrade and got revived afterwards.

Would it make sense for JobTracker to refuse connections from TaskTrackers running an incompatible version?, Yes Christian, please file a bug.  TaskTrackers should, like DataNodes, be refused connection to an incompatible JT., It was filed as HADOOP-236.]
