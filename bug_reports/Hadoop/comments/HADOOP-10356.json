This message was automatically generated., Reviewed and verified patch.
{{case NULL:}} is not correct.  It is {{void *}} pointer. 
VC++ compiler is allowing this somehow. This is usually not allowed in gcc. 
So changing this to {{NULL Termination '\0'}}  is correct fix.

Existing patch applies on both trunk and branch-2. No new patch needed.
Compiled and tested this patch on windows. Its working fine.
No new compilation warnings found.

This can be committed.
, +1 for the patch. Thanks for fixing this [~René Nyffenegger] and thanks for the review and verification [~kiranmr].
