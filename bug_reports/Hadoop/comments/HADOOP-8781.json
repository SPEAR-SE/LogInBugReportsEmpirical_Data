[tested in pseudo cluster, patches for trunk/branch-2 and branch-1., Looks good to me. One small nit -- I'd add this line to an already existing if statement that tests for non-emptiness of JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH a few lines down., with Roman's corrections, -1 overall.

, thanks for fixing this, tucu.  Unfortunately the patch has a bug if your {{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}} has spaces in it.

It should be
{code}
+  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH"
{code}

rather than
{code}
+  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH
{code}

, Be aware that this change will likely have side-effects for non-Java code., (and yes, I'd -1 this if anyone outside your hallway was given a chance to review stuff before it got committed.), bq. Be aware that this change will likely have side-effects for non-Java code.

Maybe you can elaborate what the negative side effects would be?]
