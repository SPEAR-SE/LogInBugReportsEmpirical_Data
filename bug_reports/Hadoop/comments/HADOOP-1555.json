[Looks good for me.
Also, I didn't try, but you can fix 'BC_VACUOUS_INSTANCEOF' as below:

  if ((FileSystem) localFs instanceof ChecksumFileSystem) {
    ....
, Running:
{code}
ant findbugs -Dfindbugs.home=/path/to/findbugs
{code}

Tells me that there does not seem to be any findbugs on common trunk. Marking as cannot reproduce (now).

This was opened back in '07. A new JIRA can be filed for current findbugs.]
