[Here's a simple patch., I've found more issues with command parsing so I'll resubmit this patch when it fixes those additional issues., Fixes the NPE, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when no parameters passed to --provider (and others) args, cleaned up the text, added a toString to KMSClientProvider., a few comments on the patch:

* KeyProvider.java, has a false change.
* KeyShell.java #init(String[] args) method is all manual parsing, given that you are fixing this, wouldnâ€™t make sense to change this to use common-cli?
* KMSClientProvider.java, toString() should be {{"KMSClientProvider[" + kmsUrl + "]"}}, so it is clear that we are toStringing the provider.

This message is automatically generated., remove a few unused imports, unused vars, and close some writers in try/finally blocks., Adds more changes suggested by Alejandro. Does not address comment about using common-cli., Forgot to fix the unit test failures in the .4 version.
