This message is automatically generated., Hi Tsuyoshi, thank for the patch. Grep though the code, looks like checkHadoopHome is only used in windows env right now, I am not sure windows is change to HADOOP_PREFIX from HADOOP_HOME right now, at least the .cmd files are still have plenty of HADOOP_HOME vars. Maybe somebody familiar with hadoop windows version can have a look? Or have it tested on windows? , Closing as "not a problem"... This is a much larger issue since Windows is using HADOOP_HOME instead of HADOOP_PREFIX like the rest of the code.  (It'd be preferable to use HADOOP_HOME in the Unix shell code as well, but alas that was broken back in 0.21 by a misguided attempt to centralize different projects under the same structure. )]
