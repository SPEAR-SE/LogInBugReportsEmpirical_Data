This message is automatically generated., You are right, HTTP 401 UNAUTHORIZED is for authentication failed.

Do we need to change following to UNAUTHORIZED?
{code}
} else if (throwable instanceof AuthenticationException) {
      status = Response.Status.FORBIDDEN;
{code}, [~hitliuyi], the {{KMSExceptionsProvider}} only kicks when {{KMS}} processing throws an exception. {{KMS}} processing kicks in only if the HTTP request has been properly authenticated. The only reason you could get an {{AuthenticatioException}} here is because the backend used by KMS throws that exception. If that happens,KMS triggering a login request won't help, thus the FORBIDDEN., +1, the patch looks good to me. I also agree with Tucu's answer to Yi's question.
