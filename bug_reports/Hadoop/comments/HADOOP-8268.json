This message is automatically generated., I didnt get why this patch didnt apply. it works fine here against trunk. It might be CR/LF issue?, It doesn't apply because test-patch doesn't work on files that are under hadoop-project-dist.

You should probably just say what testing you did in a comment here. A reviewer should probably apply it themself before committing it., I did testing with:

mvn package -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests, I really need to get this committed. This change is trivial (just XML markup) and it prevents me from using company build infrastructure for my contributions to hadoop., re-uploaded patch to see if new hadoop builds checking system will kick in, -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The change looks fine. Before we commit it in though, did you run a build on Windows+Cygwin as well, since those are what you're changing the commands for?

Also, why do you see a failure only on hadoop-project-dist, when the same issue exists in so many other pom.xml files?

{code}

{code}

Wouldn't you like them all fixed?

bq. -1 javadoc. The javadoc tool appears to have generated 2 warning messages.

This is cause of HADOOP-8359.

, (There may be other > usage as well, I just searched for "2>" there above.), bq. The change looks fine. Before we commit it in though, did you run a build on Windows+Cygwin as well, since those are what you're changing the commands for.

Nevermind this comment. I manually verified we don't break anything:

{code}
➜  hadoop-project-dist git:(trunk) ✗ cat ./target/dist-copynativelibs.sh
which cygpath 2> /dev/null
{code}, I have not tested this on cygwin because i do not have it installed.

If some thing is in other POM files then it needs to be fixed as well, i just submitted patch for first POM on which our project validation system aborted build., Commit all pom files with "2>" you have discovered. If there will be more problems then i will open new ticket., I believe this patch fixes all pom.xml occurrences of "2>" to {{2&gt;}}.

Running a grep against all pom.xml files for " >" to pick up stdout redirector issues turned up no results. Hence I'm thinking that this patch suffices to fix the redirectors-caused validation issues properly at least.

Patch was tested by running Radim's command and inspecting the generated files, to ensure they carried ">" and not {{&gt;}} directly.

Please review.

@Radim - Would still be good if you can post us a list of all bad xml instances and we fix all that in this JIRA. I have none setup with me right now, but lemme know if I need to do that by self., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Lets take another approach. Standard unix command for validating POMs is part of libxml2 package:

find . -name \*.xml -exec xmllint --valid --noout {} \;

to make xmllint validation work, you need to add proper schema to every pom which is good practice anyway.

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

hadoop has 43 pom.xml files., command was wrong. libxml2 does not work well with XSD schemas. C version of xerces 3 parser works fine:

find . -name *.xml -exec PParse -n -s -f -v=always {} \;, added xml schema to maven POMs, guys, seriously commit this already. It takes you months to commit such trivial change like this., +1 pending jenkins. Sorry for the delay Radim., Re-upping on Radim's behalf to trigger QA Bot., merged trunk, Reupload patch. JIRA was down, QA bot was unable to post results., Patch had a few issues: New lines were Windows-style (trailing CRs in it), and wasn't -p0 applicable (although not an issue these days with test-patch, as it tries upto three levels).

Here's a more compatible svn patch. Lets hit QA Bot with this.

Locally mvn 3.x passes an install run (without tests) for me. So am +1. Will commit this in by monday regardless of QA (would be good to have it run though) unless someone else objects. The same kinda lines is already used in HBase, and thats another basis for my +1 here.

Thanks Radim.

(Here it goes…), Fixed filename of patch., reupload for bot, Here is bot output. It will most likely fail to post results to JIRA.

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/1040/, Thanks Radim!

+1 based on a local {{mvn clean install -Dtest=FooBar}} as well. Committing to branch-2 and trunk shortly., - Committed revision 1343272 to trunk.
- svn merge -c 1343272 to branch-2 committed as revision 1343275.
