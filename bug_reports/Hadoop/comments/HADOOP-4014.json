[This is a patch recommendation for this issue.
If the hard link command is 'fsutil', the arguments of command will be opposite order to 'ln' command.
, I'd rather introduce a static member {{OSType osType;}} and use it to verify in which order the arguments should be set in the command line.
{{osType}} should replace {{osName}} with the latter becoming a local variable of {{getOSType()}}.
You effectively do the same by comparing command name is "fsutil". Checking osType seems to be cleaner.
"XpP" - is a good catch. 
Did you really try it on Vista?
, The quoted OS in in a JVM comes from the JRE; different JVMs detect different values, and tend to lag OS releases. OpenJDK even reports different things from a closed JDK. Which makes it very hard to do OS family detection reliably. Its probalby only java6+ that detects Vista, for example. 

The most broadly tested code for this in apache is Ant's OS condition

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/ant/core/trunk/src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/condition/Os.java?view=markup

This 
-lowercases in the US locale the jvm properties
-assumes the presence of "windows" in the OS => windows, assumes further than only a few limited versions are win9x; the rest is NT-based
-looks for various strings for macos
-guesses that systems with / and : as seperators are unix-like
-looks for various obscure operating systems
-or bails out

I'd recommend taking this code and adapting it; strip out netware and OS/360 support if need be. This routine is the first one to get bugreps when a new OS or JDK  ships, so is maintained. , Nomura,

How did you notice this error? because of the "XpP" typo, Hadoop ends up using cygwin's 'ln' and it  works. Thats why the unit tests have been passing.
, TestDFSUpgradeFromImage fails on XP about 60-80% of the time with following trace. This might be because of some flakiness with Cygwin's 'ln'. This patch seems to fix it. Can we mark this a blocker for 0.19? Konstantin,  do you have an improved patch?

, Updating the patch.
I ran TestDFSUpgradeFromImage several times - no failures.
I also fixed 4 warnings in FileUtil.
, The patch looks fine.

I found this issue in Windows 2003 Server first.
And the 'XP' typo was found when I review the source code.

-    if (srcFS.isDirectory(src)) {
+    if (srcFS.getFileStatus(src).isDir()) {
{code}
It seems to me that isDirectory(src) cannot be replaced by getFileStatus(src).isDir() since FileNotFoundException may be thrown., Yes, FileNotFoundException is thrown instead of the custom IOException, which changes the description returned. E.g.
{code}
08/10/03 22:32:17 INFO cli.TestCLI:             Expected output:   [copyFromLocal: /user/wrongdata: No such file or directory]
08/10/03 22:32:17 INFO cli.TestCLI:               Actual output:   [copyFromLocal: File /user/wrongdata does not exist.
{code}
It is really a bad idea to verify correctness based on an exception description.
So now the question is whether these descriptions are a part of the CLI api and it is going to be an incompatible change if I modify the "Expected output"?, About other tests:
- TestFileCreation and TestDatanodeDeath are not failing on my Win machine. But I see different tests fail sporadically. I believe this is related to some not cleaning up issues which should be investigated separately.
- TestLeaseRecovery2 seem to be related to HADOOP-4257
- TestMiniMRMapRedDebugScript is reported among other test in HADOOP-4172.

I'll create a new patch fixing TestCLI by changing the "Expected output"., I modified the "Expected output" in testConf.xml to the new values., How about rename OSType.OS_TYPE_WINXP to OSType.OS_TYPE_WINDOWS since it represents not only WinXP but also Win2003 and Vista?

Otherwise, the patch looks good., I think we should keep OS_TYPE_WINXP, which indicates the earliest version of windows which supports that.
WinNT and Win98 do not have fsutil. OS_TYPE_WINDOWS will be too general., The term "earliest version of windows" may be ill-defined.  Win2003 probably was released after WinXP but Win2003 is not a updated version/replacement of WinXP.  They are for different customers., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Nicholas, I don't care about windows customers. I care about fsutil. WinXP and all later versions support fsutil, while earlier versions do not. Without fsutil there is no way to create hard links in Windows. And this is why the name contain XP in it. Probably more correct name would be OS_TYPE_WIN_SUPPOTING_FSUTIL, but it is confusing.

TestJobQueueInformation fails because of HADOOP-4378., I just committed this., Thank you NOMURA Yoshihide for reporting the issue and the initial patch., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #634 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/634/])
