[I haven't played much with the trash policy stuff, but I have a few suspicions/hints.  This was a fresh HDFS with a very minimal config.  

# This was the first delete on the file system.
# Trash is not configured at all in *-site.xml.

Is this an edge case?
, Attached an initial patch . ( Logs on trash configuration will be printed on namenode logs and not at client side)

Please review., \\
