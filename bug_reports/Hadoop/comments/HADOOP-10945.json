2014-08-07 16:10:27,811 WARN  [main] permission.FsPermission (FsPermission.java:getUMask(260)) - Unable to parse configuration fs.permissions.umask-mode with value 0022 as octal or symbolic umask.
-ls: Unable to parse configuration fs.permissions.umask-mode with value 0022 as octal or symbolic umask.

{noformat}

The pattern match for a valid octal pattern in UmaskParser probably needs to look a little more like the one from ChmodParser.  I realize that the umask can't specify the sticky bit, but we shouldn't preclude an equivalent number to a valid umask., \\

{code}
-    Pattern.compile("^\\s*[+]?()([0-7]{3})\\s*$"); // no leading 1 for sticky bit
+    Pattern.compile("^\\s*[+]?([0]*)([0-7]{3})\\s*$"); // no leading 1 for sticky bit
{code}
{{\[0\]*}} can pass an argument which is more than 4-digit (ex. 00022 or 000022). Would you use {{0?}} instead?, [~ajisakaa] thanks for review. I think even umask 00022 or 000022 should not fail the parser and it will be nice for parser to translate them into a valid umask. [~jlowe] could you comment on this?, The umask is taking an octal number, and IMHO it should accept any legal octal number that fits in the expected range of values.  I do not understand at all why the parsing code isn't just calling Integer.parseInt to parse the octal number and extract each three-bit value from that.  The regexp seems like a very heavy-handed and error-prone way to do it, but I don't know if we need to rewrite the parsing from the ground up just to fix this particular error.

Patch looks OK overall.  Could you add some tests for invalid permissions as well?  e.g.: 1222 and 01222 are not supposed to be valid., [~jlowe] thanks for review! added tests for invalid umask., \\
