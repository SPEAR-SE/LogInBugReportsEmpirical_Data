[Attaching a patch that fixes those warnings., Instead of modifying EchoMap and EchoReduce, can they be removed in favor of o.a.h.mapred.lib.IdentityMapper and o.a.h.mapred.lib.IdentityReducer?, Chris, could you plz post your patch here. Yes it makes sense to remove them and have one modified EchoMap/Reduce, +1. I think the while loop has nothing to do with this is more readable. So I would prefer it as it is., Since I had worked on HADOOP-2802 (a duplicated issue), I came up a patch using Chris' idea., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
