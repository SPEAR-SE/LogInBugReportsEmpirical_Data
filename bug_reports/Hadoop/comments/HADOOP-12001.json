[Initial attempt at a fix for this.
Shouldn't break anything that currently uses this, but enables people with weird(?) schemas to use it., \\

This message was automatically generated., Bumping this to be a blocker for 2.7.1 given Elliot Clark's comment on the mailing lists
bq. HADOOP-12001 should probably be added to the blocker list since it's a
regression that can keep ldap from working.

Assigning this to Patrick White who put up a patch.

Given HADOOP-9477 was only in 2.8, the only breaking change in 2.7 is HADOOP-10626?, Those two patches on their own don't break anything, but the combination will break posixGroups implementation as it stands.
My patch corrects that.

I'm new to patches in Hadoop, what additional work is required on the patch?

For testing, I've run it on a cluster and verified I see the right thing when configured in posixGroups mode with the 'groups' command. I'm not 100% sure how to modify the unit tests to fit this case, but haven't looked very deeply yet., bq. I'm new to patches in Hadoop, what additional work is required on the patch?

I looked at the patch. Seems compatible, that part looks good. Can you see TestLdapGroupsMapping and TestLdapGroupsMappingWithPosixGroup and look if you can add a test there?, same patch with updated unit tests, \\

This message was automatically generated., +1 (non-binding) from me. Everything looks good here., Looks good to me too. Checking this in.., bq. Given HADOOP-9477 was only in 2.8, the only breaking change in 2.7 is HADOOP-10626?
Given the above, I only put this in 2.8.

, Now that HADOOP-9477 is in 2.7.6, will need to backport this to 2.7 as well. Would have been easier, if it was properly linked., I just committed this to branch-2.7. Updating Fix Versions.]
