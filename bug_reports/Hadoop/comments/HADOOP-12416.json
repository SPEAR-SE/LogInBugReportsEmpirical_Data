[I'm +1 for this issue. We faced the problem that trash messages are logged to hive shell even in silent mode. I'll check the patch will fix it., I verified the patch fixes the problem. +1 pending Jenkins., Thank [~ajisakaa] for your insights and review., \\

This message was automatically generated., We need to decide what branches to commit.
* This patch will change the output of CLI command, so I'm thinking this is an incompatible change.
* In hadoop-1, rm command does not print messages to System.out, but it does print it to System.out in branch-2. Therefore,   there is a long-term regression in hive silent mode as I mentioned before.

Now I'm thinking it's better to commit the patch to trunk and branch-2 to fix the bug.
Any thoughts?
, From Hive's perspective, its super useful to commit this to branch-2, because we are not moving to trunk any time soon., Why this is an incompatible change?, Thanks [~ashutoshc] and [~wheat9] for the comments.
bq. Why this is an incompatible change?
??Changing the path of a command, removing or renaming command line options, the order of arguments, or the command return code and output break compatibility and may adversely affect users.?? (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.1/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Compatibility.html#Command_Line_Interface_CLI)
I'm thinking this message may be treated as 'output' (not log) since it is delivered on System.out., I'll commit this to trunk and branch-2 in Sep. 16 if there are no additional comments., Moved to Hadoop common as the change is in hadoop-common module., Committed to this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks [~liuml07] for the contribution., s/to this/this/g, Thank you [~ajisakaa] for reviewing and committing this patch., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8462 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8462/])
