[OpenJDK will get the same feature: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-2794, FYI, [~lmccay@apache.org]

This is due to  [CVE-2018-2794|http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-2794]; looks like the JVM was deserializing any class. So if you had, say, Groovy < 2.4 on the CP, you could serialize a script and then have it exec'd on the deser. Get some service to read your jceks file and you can run code as that entity. 

This is only a risk for hadoop if there are cases where services are deserializing JCECKs files from users with lower rights, services which wouldn't otherwise be running arbitrary code from the user. Hive might be the weakness, if its services are only executing locked down (UDF-less) SQL., Hi [~ehiggs], looks like [~gabor.bota]'s got a patch ready for review for the same issue. ]
