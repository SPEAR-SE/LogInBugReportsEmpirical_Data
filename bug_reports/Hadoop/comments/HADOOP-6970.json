[Actually SecurityAuth.audit is a log file and should be generated under logs directory.
Current problem is with the configuration, which by default creates the file in the current directory.

Attached patch should fix that. If one is running test - no SecurityAuth.audit will be created at all. But if you start namenode - then the file will be created in the logs directory., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
