[different cause I suspect. The stack trace you've got means that whatever was looking for Xerces on the CP hit a problem. It's not the stream/resource passed in which triggering the failure. More: something else on the CP went away and the service loader hit it.

Looking at the code, what may actually be good is for the DocumentBuilderFactory to be instantiated once (static constructor? or lazy-create of a static field?). Because the same builder options are used; there's no need to scan the classpath. Would that help? Maybe, but having things go off the CP is still pretty risky

, I encounter the same problem. Maybe it's jdk's bug. DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance() is in the stack and the function needs no params, so i think it is related to jdk., It looks related to one open Hive JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11681.

See the analysis: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11681?focusedCommentId=14736752&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14736752, we are seeing it happening once in several days on hdp 2.5.3, jdk1.7.0_67, inside of hiveserver2 log. , I believe hive-11681 and this one all related to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6947916, which hasn't been released.

I am able to recreate it with oracle jdk 1.8.0_131., Any progress on this bug?
We met the same problem, with OpenJDK 1.7.0_79 and CDH 5.13, Configuration XML parsing has been completely redone for 2.0+, moving from a DOM to streaming parser. This is probably going to be a "Cannot Reproduce".

w.r.t CDH, you'll have to talk them I'm afraid, It seems like a JDK bug.  
We upgrade OpenJDK and put a "jaxp.properties" file under JAVA_HOME/libï¼š

{code}
// jaxp.properties
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl
{code}

then the exception disappear.]
