[Perhaps we ought to close this as Won't Fix instead of doing anything to encourage running the tests as root.  I'm curious to get feedback from others., See HADOOP-8973 for further details on the issue in {{TestDiskChecker}}., +1 on won't fix., I am planning on closing this as Won't Fix on Friday, 3/15, unless I hear feedback otherwise., There has been no additional feedback, so I'm resolving this as won't fix.]
