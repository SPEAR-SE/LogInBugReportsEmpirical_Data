[    * SnappyCompressor: fix a case where we were passing in a pointer to a
    4-byte value rather than a pointer to a (usually) 8-byte value.
    
    * fix LZ4_compress prototype.
    
    * don't put junk on the line after an #endif -- it triggers a compiler warning.
    
    * NativeIO: #define _GNU_SOURCE so that sync_file_range is not an
    implicitly declared function on Linux.
    
    * Java_org_apache_hadoop_io_compress_snappy_SnappyCompressor_initIDs:
    don't leak memory on error.
    
    * NativeIO: throw_ioe: we were using strerror_r, but assuming that it
    returned an int.  However, it returns a char* in GNU glibc.
    (Yes, there was an #ifdef that was supposed to prevent this, but it was
    busted.)  Instead, just use sys_errlist directly if we have an errno
    that is in range; otherwise come up with our own message.  This should
    work on all platforms.
    
    * move a few declarations to the tops of functions.  This was done so
    that error handling using goto didn't cause those variables to be used
    with undefined values.  (This would happen if you used goto from a
    position before a C99-style variable declaration.)

+void validate_size_t_is_bigger_than_jint(void) {
+  /* 
+   * size_t is between 2 bytes and 8 bytes, depending on platform.
+   * jint is always 4 bytes.
+   *
+   * If sizeof(size_t) is smaller than sizeof(jint), this declaration will
+   * attempt to create a negative array, which would be a compiler error.
+   * Effectively, this asserts at compile time that sizeof(size_t) is bigger than

+  unsigned char can_convert_jint_to_sizet[sizeof(size_t) - sizeof(jint)];
+  memset(&can_convert_jint_to_sizet, 0, sizeof(can_convert_jint_to_sizet));
+}
{code}
While it's true there exist architectures where size_t is 2 bytes, none of them are likely to run Hadoop. I think this should just be a documentation comment at most, and write the code under the assumption that size_t is at least 32 bits.

{code}
-  snappy_status ret = dlsym_snappy_compress(uncompressed_bytes, uncompressed_direct_buf_len, compressed_bytes, &compressed_direct_buf_len);
+  buf_len = (size_t)compressed_direct_buf_len; /* see validate_size_t_is_bigger_than_jint */
+  snappy_status ret = dlsym_snappy_compress(uncompressed_bytes,
+        uncompressed_direct_buf_len, compressed_bytes, &buf_len);
{code}
This is fixing a stack smash via the third argument to snappy_compress.  This is a Must Fix bug.
{code}
+  if ((buf_len > 0x7fffffffLLU) || (buf_len < 0)) {
{code}
Most gccs warn if you write {{unsigned < 0}}, so I suspect this is adding a warning since size_t is unsigned 64 bit on amd64?

I think we'd be better off with {{if (buf_len > INT_MAX)}} or something along those lines.  Either using the {{<limits.h>}} define or defining our own {{JINT_MAX}} would be good.

{code}
 static void throw_ioe(JNIEnv* env, int errnum)
 {
...
+  if (errnum < 0) {
+    errnum = -errnum;
+  }
{code}
This "handle -errno" fixup does not belong in a common helper like throw_ioe.  The helper should either take an errno value or the negation of an errno value, it shouldn't conflate them like this. It's the caller's responsibility (together with ensuring that the library as a whole has a consistent error description model) to ensure that the argument is consistently in the correct range.

Also please add a documentation comment to describe the calling conventions for throw_ioe.

{code}
-    message = "Unknown error";
+    snprintf(message, sizeof(message), "unknown error %d", errnum);
{code}
I wouldn't mention it if this were the only issue, but since we need to fix the above: please make the format start with a capital, "Unknown error %d".
