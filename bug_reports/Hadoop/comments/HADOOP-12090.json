[This is caused by fragmented TCP packets for the kerberos authentication request.

In the problem situation, the kerberos authentication request sent by the client gets fragmented into 2 packets although the size is tiny (e.g. 584 bytes). It gets split into one packet with 570 bytes of data and another with 14 bytes in this case. Tcpdump output:

It turns out there is a bug with apacheds (on which minikdc is based) where the kerberos message decoding fails with a NPE if the kerberos message is not contained in a single TCP packet (DIRSERVER-2071).

Furthermore, the TCP fragmentation itself has something to do with apacheds as well. Mina, the underlying I/O framework for apacheds, sets a pretty small receive/send buffer size by default (1 KB). This has an affect of reducing the TCP window size significantly as it is evidenced by the tcp dump above. This is causing the fragmentation., Both of these issues need to be fixed by apacheds. This may entail upgrading apacheds from 2.0.0-M15 to a future version (2.0.0-M21). There are some API incompatible changes between those versions, so some work would be required.

I propose a workaround on our minikdc code to configure the receive/send buffer size to be larger than the default; e.g. 32 KB or 64 KB. I have confirmed that that patch makes all the failed unit tests succeed again. So until we upgrade apacheds to pick up the fix, it'd be good to have this workaround.

I'll come up with a patch that does that soon., Patch v.1 posted., \\

This message was automatically generated., Due to the nature of the change, I'm not sure if there is a useful unit test that can test this, other than the fact that the patch makes a number of unit tests pass on some platforms.

Committers, could you kindly review the patch and let me know your feedback? Thanks!, Ping? Any feedback on this patch? Thanks in advance., Ping?, Thanks for the work. I'll take a look later today., Thanks!, I think it might make more sense to upgrade apacheds to the latest version to resolve the issue. There is no backward compatibility concerns as apacheds is only used by minikdc.

Tweaking the buffer size might work most of the time, but it does not seem to guarantee the packet will not be fragmented due to timing issues., Thanks for the comments [~wheat9]. FWIW, it's not clear when this fixed version of apacheds will be released (2.0.0-M21). For those of us who cannot wait for that would need this patch internally to work around the issue.

Also, regarding the packet fragmentation, it's correct that packets can be fragmented for other reasons as well. That said, it is mitigated by 2 facts: (1) typical kerberos authentication request messages are much smaller (~ 500 bytes) than the proposed window size (64 KB), and (2) mini-kdc is basically loopback connections thus there is little risk of fragmentation unless software (e.g. apacheds) sets the window size arbitrarily small., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Just made a proposal to suggest updating the related codes to rebase on Apache Kerby as Apache Directory project has shifted the Kerberos related effort to the sub-project., [~sjlee0] On which platforms do you see this problem? We are seeing the issue 10% of the time with a source tree based on 2.6.

Since the patch 002 increased the socket buffer size for minikdc, does it mean a certain socker buffer size can reliably reproduce the problem on some platforms? What is that size? 1140 bytes?, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, bq. Sangjin Lee On which platforms do you see this problem? We are seeing the issue 10% of the time with a source tree based on 2.6.

I think I saw this on Centos 6.

bq. Since the patch 002 increased the socket buffer size for minikdc, does it mean a certain socker buffer size can reliably reproduce the problem on some platforms? What is that size? 1140 bytes?

The default would reproduce this (at least in my problem environment). The default is 1 KB if I'm not mistaken. To some extent, this is OS sensitive because it has something to do with the TCP window management. For example, I was not able to reproduce this on mac., I'm wondering if this could be reproduced upon the trunk, with the updated MiniKDC., I reproduced {{TestKMS}} failures with CDH (2.6.0 based) on Ubuntu 12.02 and 14.04, but not on Mac and Centos 6.6., Thanks John. I suppose you meant it on trunk. Did you see the similar errors or logs as described by the issue? Owing to being familiar with the MiniKDC/Kerby implementation, I somehow believe it shouldn't be caused by the same reason, i.g. TCP packet fragmentation., Just tried trunk, {{TestKMS, TestSaslDataTransfer, TestTimelineAuthenticationFilter}} were fine., [~drankye], Sorry I didn't mention "CDH (2.6.0 based)" in my last comment. Corrected.

So the MiniKDC in trunk seems fine.

Will test the commit before HADOOP-12911. Upgrade Hadoop MiniKDC with Kerby., Thanks [~jzhuge] for the clarifying and verifying tests. The results sound reasonable to me., Sync'd my trunk to "f71eb51 HADOOP-10134 [JDK8] Fix Javadoc errors caused by incorrect or illegal tags in doc  comments.", {{TestKMS}} still passed. Maybe not the changes in minikdc itself but rather updated dependencies fixed the issue?, Did you {{mvn clean package install}} when you sync'd to that revision? Maybe the test can only fail in random?, Did clean install. However, the test is flaky, so it doesn't necessarily fail each time. I will repeat the test 10 times., By default Linux automatically adjust the socket buffer size starting from the default value, see [tcp(7)|http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/tcp.7.html]. The 3 values from {{tcp_rmem}} or {{tcp_wmem}} are: min, default, max.
{noformat}
[jzhuge@jzhuge-ubuntu hadoop2]((8fca972...))$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
4096    87380   6291456
[jzhuge@jzhuge-ubuntu hadoop2]((8fca972...))$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem
4096    16384   4194304
[jzhuge@jzhuge-ubuntu hadoop2]((8fca972...))$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_moderate_rcvbuf 
1
{noformat}
Setting {{SO_SNDBUF}} and {{SO_RCVBUF}} will turn off auto adjustment. The max for {{SO_RCVBUF}} or {{SO_SNDBUF}} is limited by {{/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max}} or {{/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max}}., Just to be clear, this issue is caused because Mina (the networking stack on which ApacheDS depends) does set the send and receive buffer size to 1 KB (see DIRSERVER-2074 for more detail). If we move away from that behavior by using different libraries or else, the problem may go away., Thanks [~sjlee0] for the clarification. Increasing socket buffer size to 64K does fix my issues!

BTW, what is the purpose of change to {{hadoop-minikdc/pom.xml}} in patch 002?, The patch adds references to {{SocketAcceptor}} and {{SocketSessionConfig}} which are classes in Mina. Since these are new direct references, I added the explicit dependency., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
