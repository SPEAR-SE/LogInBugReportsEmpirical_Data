[In this patch I added one more check to RetryUpToMaximumTimeWithFixedSleep's shouldRetry method. With this design, a RetryUpToMaximumTimeWithFixedSleep only launches retries before the time window with size maxTime ends. I also added two more unit tests to verify this: one to make sure if the underlying retry process is delayed, we no longer launch new retries outside the allowed time window and one to make sure if the time window size is sufficient, a RetryUpToMaximumTimeWithFixedSleep can finish successfully. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The three findbugs warnings are not introduced by this Jira. There are on-going work to fix them in separate Jiras. , Thanks for working on this Li! The current patch will change the retry policy from stateless to stateful, and may not guarantee the correctness in a multi-thread scenario. Maybe a better way to fix is to add the time-based retry support to our current RetryPolicy., Hi [~jingzhao], thanks for the review. I agree that we should not make the retry policies stateful, thanks for pointing this out. We may want to address the timing problems as a new feature, rather than this quick fix. , Cancelling patch until multithread issue is addressed., I hit the same issue and updated the patch to make the class stateless. Would you take a look?, \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~ajisakaa], there is one issue with your current fix: we need to decide the timeLimit on the time the first retry happens, but not on the object creation. Say a retry object is created at t1 with maximum time delta_t, an actual retry happens at t2. We want the retry to stop at t2+delta_t, but not t1+delta_t. Actually there may be a quite significant gap between t1 and t2, so setting timeLimit to t1+delta_t may not be right. I'm not sure if in all of our use cases we can safely assume or enforce t1=t2. , Thanks [~gtCarrera9] for the comment.
bq. We want the retry to stop at t2+delta_t, but not t1+delta_t.
I'm thinking t2+delta_t is the best. I also think t1+delta_t is better than the current behavior.

bq. I'm not sure if in all of our use cases we can safely assume or enforce t1=t2.
We cannot assume t1=t2 because t2 becomes larger than t1 when there are underlying retries., bq. We cannot assume t1=t2 because t2 becomes larger than t1 when there are underlying retries.
If this is the case, then only allowing retries to t1+delta_t is wrong because we may accidentally but completely disable retry when t1 and t2 are significantly different. What we want is to "retry for time t after an error occurred" but not to "retry for time t after the retry object is initialized". , Attaching a patch to fail after t2+delta_t., Hi [~ajisakaa], I think your 003 patch changes retry policy from stateless to stateful again. Am I missing anything here? , BTW, [~ajisakaa], since I've already given some thought on the original patch (and the whole issue), I think a little bit more discussion would definitely save a lot of repeated work here. If there's an appropriate fix for this issue I can certainly make the change and finish it. , \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. I think your 003 patch changes retry policy from stateless to stateful again. Am I missing anything here?
Yes, the patch makes the policy stateful, however, it becomes thread-safe by synchronizing shouldRetry method., bq. the patch makes the policy stateful
I believe, as [~jingzhao] have raised, that making the policy stateful is the main problem for the original fix. , | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
