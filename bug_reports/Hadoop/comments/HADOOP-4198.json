[4198_20080917.patch: get rid of ClientDatanodeProtocol, You still have the implementation of ClientDatanodeProtocol.recoverBlock in the DataNode class.
I think it makes sense to remove and move the logic (which is just print a log massage) to the other DataNode.recoverBlock() method.
This should make things simpler., 4198_20080917b.patch: moved Datanode recoverBlock implementation to DataXceiver., {noformat}

No new tests added since there are already a lot of tests for lease recovery and file creation., 0.18.1 is being released.  Moving this to 0.18.2., +1 Looks good., 4198_20080917b_0.18.patch: patch for 0.18.

Note that *DATA_TRANSFER_VERSION* in trunk is changed from 13 to 14 but the one in 0.18 is changed from 11 to 12.  Or should it change DATA_TRANSFER_VERSION from 11 to 14?, We can set DATA_TRANSFER_VERSION to 14 in 0.18 and  to 15 in 0.19. So they will be always incompatible as desired., 4198_20080918.patch: changed DATA_TRANSFER_VERSION from 13 to 15, 4198_20080918_0.18.patch: changed DATA_TRANSFER_VERSION from 11 to 14
, No longer seems to serve a useful purpose., Can somebody please explain why we do not need this patch anymore?]
