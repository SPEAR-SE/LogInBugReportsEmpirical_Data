    HADOOP-14954. MetricsSystemImpl#init should increment refCount when already initialized. Contributed by John Zhuge.
{code}, Reverted HADOOP-14954. Sorry about the breakage. Should have triggered YARN tests in pre-commit., HADOOP-14954 never made it to a release. And there's no other patch for this JIRA in the 3.1.0 release. Reopening and closing this instead as a dup.]
