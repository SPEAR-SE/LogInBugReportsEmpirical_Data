[just a one line change that fixes the problem. The problem was happening because I had been inconsistent about using conf.getLocalPath()., Do folks think this should force a 0.7.2 release?, +1

I also filed HADOOP-609 to write a unit test that tests this case., Good plan. I'll roll 0.7.2 once we have a unit test (HADOOP-609)., I just committed this.  Thanks, Mahadev.]
