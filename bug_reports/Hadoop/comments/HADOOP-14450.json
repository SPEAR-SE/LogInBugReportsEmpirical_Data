[[~ASikaria], could you please take a look?, sounds like an impala bug, not Hadoop, I'd suggest a simple unit test to reproduce the bug (if any), or commands in FSShell. Ad hoc pythons clients wrapping ADLFileSystem may have it's own bug., Following up with the developers of the Python SDK. My understanding is that this is a bug in the SDK, but following up for more.

, The python tool with fix is released now. Run this to upgrade the command-line python tool:
run pip install azure-datalake-store --upgrade
