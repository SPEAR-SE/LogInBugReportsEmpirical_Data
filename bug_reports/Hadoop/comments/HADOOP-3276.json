[This particular problem occurs because of improper setup of Mapred system directory in DFS. But, this can be hit in general when either user submits jobs or HOD continues running script commands, even while JT is still in the state of initialization due to various reasons. HOD currently puts in its best effort to avoid this - ping Mapred Jetty if it is alive - the last thing that can be done to check JT status by HOD from outside without any support in Hadoop. And as the above situation makes it clear, we definitely need support from Hadoop to know when JT can really accepts jobs. Filed a Jira (HADOOP-3289) to address this., Leaving this issue as is, to track any changes to be done in HOD, if and after HADOOP-3289 is resolved., hod contrib was removed]
