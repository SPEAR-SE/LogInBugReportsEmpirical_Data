[Because of this issue when webhdfs is turned on, the kerberos login fails. The user has to specify the actual host name in the principal.

We should see if we can use the _HOST like we do for other keytabs specified in hadoop, Hey Arpit, what exactly are you referring to when you say "{{kerberos.principal}}" ?, The attached patch fixes the issue by passing the principal and keytab as parameters in the filter initialization. 
AuthFilter is modified not to load the configuration, rather it relies completely on FilterConfigs., > what exactly are you referring to when you say "kerberos.principal" ?
Changed the title to refer to dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.principal. That's where this issue showed up., Hey Jitendra, thanks a lot for updating the issue summary and posting a patch. Does this change not also need to be made on trunk?

Also, per the discussion on common-dev@ and the [how to contribute wiki|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute], please format your patch file names as "<issue number>-<full branch name>.patch", without patch version numbers., Yes, this change is needed for trunk too. 
Changed the patch file name format. , Incorporating the change for HDFS-2405 because that fix was needed too to test any webhdfs operation, in secure mode., +1 patch looks good., Updated patch to fix a test failure., +1 the new patch looks good., Bug is still open for trunk fix., The hdfs part of the patch is tracked in HDFS-2409., The common part of the patch is attached. It is very minor. The HDFS patch is in HDFS-2409., The last two comments refer to patches for trunk., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
