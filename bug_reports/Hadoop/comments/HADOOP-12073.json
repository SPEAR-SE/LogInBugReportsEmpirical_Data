[Attaching the patch.
I enabled additional FileSystem contract tests from Hadoop-common on page blobs to increase test coverage of these code paths. This caught another minor bug in PageBlobOutputStream where closing the stream multiple times does not succeed, so I fixed this as well., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~ivanmi].  The patch looks good.  I just have one question.  Since the patch adds the {{closed}} flag to implement idempotence of {{PageBlobOutputStream#close}}, do we also need to mark that method {{synchronized}} for thread-safety?, Attaching updated patch to address Chris' comments., bq. Since the patch adds the closed flag to implement idempotence of PageBlobOutputStream#close, do we also need to mark that method synchronized for thread-safety?
Good catch, thanks Chris. Fixed in the updated patch. , \\

, Is this serious enough that we should apply to 2.7.2? As it does sound it, I'm applying the 2.7.2-candidate label to get this on the radar for inclusion in the 2.7.2 release, as Steve suggested.]
