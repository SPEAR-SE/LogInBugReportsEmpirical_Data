This message is automatically generated., Hey Plamen,

Your previous patch was fine, given that it is for 0.22 and the Hadoop QA bot isn't that intelligent (yet) to run patches off the right branch. So, fret not.

+1 to patch HADOOP-7568.patch 12/Sep/11 17:19 for branch 0.22

As a secondary request (sorry), can you also provide a patch for trunk/0.23 (should be the same). Am gonna fix my last nits (post review by Todd) on HADOOP-1381 and I'm gonna remove away this change which was added as part of it. I think it makes sense if it goes via this JIRA. Let me know if you'd like me to up that one liner instead!

Thanks!, Thanks Harsh. :) Yeah I was wondering that was going on there. I will provide a patch for 0.23; no need to up it, you can leave it here and I will attach a patch for 0.23 asap., Thank you Plamen! I will remove it from HADOOP-1381, and sorry for all confusions (this one had come in after its patch, which led me to my first response way up above - in retrospect, I made a mistake doing that fork request)., Patch for 0.23 SequenceFile.java, -1 overall.

, I just committed this. Thank you Plamen.
Please generate proper patches next time., Plamen,

P.s. Just to let you in on little secrets of us ;-) here's what most of us do:

$ git checkout <branch/tag>
$ vim <file> # Or eclipse, etc. Editing++
$ ant/maven/tests etc.
$ git diff --no-prefix > PATCH.file

Or if on svn:

$ svn diff > PATCH.file # From project's root directory.

This is also covered in the HowToContribute document, and should help you avoid creating bad prefixed patches in future!
