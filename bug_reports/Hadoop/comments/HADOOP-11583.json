[* fixed syntax error
* quoted permissions strings, Let's drop the YARN_LOG_DIR line since that's been deprecated. , Actually, never mind.  That's a separate problem that needs a bigger doc change. (i.e., how to set HADOOP_LOG_DIR now that YARN_LOG_DIR is dead.)

+1 I'll commit to trunk here in a sec.
