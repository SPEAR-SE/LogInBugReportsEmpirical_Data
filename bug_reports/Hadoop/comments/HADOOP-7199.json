[If I understand the description correctly, I cannot reporduce the failure.

Would it be some hardware problems?, The issue was due to the checksum file on the local filessytem. Deleting .status-test.txt.crc resolved the issue. I still think it is something that should not crash copyFromLocalFile.

It should be possible to reproduce the error by creating a mismatching checksum file, but I have not done that., In case my previous comment was unclear. I believe the following caused the error:
1. I did a copyFromLocalFile that crashed after creating the checksum file, but before deleting the file
2. The content of stats-test.txt was changed such that the new checksum does not match the checksum in the old non-deleted checksum file.
3. Subsequent copyFromLocalFile uses the old checksum file

Something related happens if the checksum file is invalid, as in:

, Lars, I see what is going on.  We use {{.*.crc}} files for storing CRCs in {{LocalFileSystem}}.  Thus, if such file exists, it will be used for verifying CRCs.

BTW, could you update the title and the description of the issue with you latest findings?  I will move this to COMMON since it is nothing to do with HDFS., Title and description have been updated.]
