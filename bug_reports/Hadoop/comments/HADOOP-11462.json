This message is automatically generated., This patch is in no way associated with TestZKFailoverControllerStress test. The failure may be due local system config/setup., Hi [~Ayappan].  I have just one minor nitpick.  This import line is not needed:

{code}
import org.apache.hadoop.io.nativeio.NativeIO.POSIX.CacheManipulator;
{code}

+1 after that's removed.  Thanks!, Hi Chris, I removed the line and attached the updated patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Above build failure is not due to this patch since the failure happens in mapreduce related testcase whereas this patch is for TestSocketIOWithTimeout ( hadoop-common module ). Check out https://www.mail-archive.com/mapreduce-dev@hadoop.apache.org/msg12794.html]
