[This patch fixes the issue. I tested manually by setting up a secure HA cluster and running  haadmin with {{-failover}}, {{-checkHealth}}, {{-transitionToActive}}, {{-transitionToStandby}}, and {{-getServiceState}} subcommands.

These manual tests are covered by the HA test plan.

Unfortunately there are no automated tests for security here. I tried to get the new ApacheDS-based security test infrastructure to work, but it doesn't work correctly in my environment. Please see my comment here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-3016?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=13242722#comment-13242722, I should note I also ran TestDFSHAAdmin and TestDFSHAAdminMiniCluster against this common patch, and they both passed., -1 overall.
