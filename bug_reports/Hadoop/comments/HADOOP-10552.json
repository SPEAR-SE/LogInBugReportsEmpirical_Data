This message is automatically generated., This is not really correct. The "hadoop fs" command is the right way to consume the FS Shell utilities. The "hdfs dfs" just aliases to it anyway and isn't to be replacing 'hadoop fs'.

See also HDFS-557., Thanks for comment, [~qwertymaniac].
My purpose is equalize style of usage and example, not to replacing hadoop fs. In FileSystemShell.apt.vm, all other commands are described using hdfs dfs.
In addtion, I have a basic question about "hadoop fs" and "hdfs dfs". In CommandsManual.apt.vm, hadoop fs section says
{noformat}
Usage: <<<hadoop fs [GENERIC_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]>>>
Deprecated, use <<<hdfs dfs>>> instead.
{noformat}
Is this incorrect? Should we revise "Deprecated, use <<<hdfs dfs>>> instead." to "You can also use <<hdfs dfs>> equally."?
, hadoop fs is definitely not deprecated.  So that's an error as well.

But that's a JIRA of a different sort.  As for this one, +1, lgtm.  I'll commit to branch-2 and trunk.
