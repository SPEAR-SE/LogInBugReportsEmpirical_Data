[Forgot to mention:

Thanks to Alejandro and his team for pointing this one..., Patch for review while I continue testing, this one has passed preliminary tests., A new patch with some more changes: 
a) {{TaskTracker.TaskInProgress.jobHasFinished}} wouldn't *cleanup* right behind non-running tasks (calls {{TaskTracker.TaskInProgress.cleanup}} only for non-running tasks; I'm guessing there was some code removed from {{TaskTracker.TaskInProgress.killAndCleanup}} - which I've renamed as {{TaskTracker.TaskInProgress.kill}}). This led to some very arcane, timing-related bugs...
b) Removed some dead-wood code in {{TaskTracker.TaskInProgress.jobHasFinished}} which, in the olden times, cleaned up on the PhasedFileSystem., +1 (patch looks good), +0, new Findbugs warnings
