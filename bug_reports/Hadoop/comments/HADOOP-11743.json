[I cleaned up some of this as part of HADOOP-11553., [~aw], my patch deletes untracked files when only "mvn clean -Preleasedocs" is called.
Your part in HADOOP-11553 cleans the untracked files in hadoop-common project without "releasedocs" profile just "mvn clean".
Please let me know your thoughts., Pretty much all files should be cleaned as part of mvn clean *except* for the release directory that the releasedocs profile generates.  Those should only be cleaned as part of the releasedocs profile since recreating them requires network activity., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
