[Here is the stack trace for job tracker which didn't respond to shutdown request,           When the disk becomes full, name node file system (fsimage, edits) is getting corrupted and also name node is getting shutdown. When we try to restart, name node is not starting because the name node file system is corrupted. 

This can be avoid this way,

        We can implement a daemon to monitor the disk usage for periodically and if the disk usage reaches the threshold value, put the name node into Safe mode so that no modification to file system will occur. Once the disk usage reaches below the threshold, name node will be put out of the safe mode. 


 Please suggest if any body has any other opinions/suggestions.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Devaraj. This patch seems to introduce lots of whitespace changes and also doesn't apply to trunk. Could you reformat it without the spurious changes and rebase on trunk?, I see you opened HDFS-1594 - this one should be closed, right, since this is a HDFS patch not Common?, Yes Todd. This issue belongs to hdfs that's why patch could not apply. This can be closed.

HDFS-1594 can be processed further., Closed as a dup of HDFS-1594]
