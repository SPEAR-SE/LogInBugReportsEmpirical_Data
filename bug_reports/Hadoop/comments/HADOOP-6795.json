@Brian, you can do svn check out of the 0.20 versions code and prepare the patch.
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-0.20-security-202/, Hi Brian,

Thanks for contributing! Checkout http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute on how to generate a patch. In short, please generate a patch against trunk.

To get this change in a future Hadoop 1.x release also generate a patch against branch-1:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-1

Thanks,
Eli, Thanks for the guidance everyone. I've attached hadoop-6795-branch-1.patch which is a fix for branch-1.

The trunk does not have the same issue, it looks like the issue was resolved during this refactoring:

, Hey Brian,

Your patch looks great. Mind adding a test case in TestDFSShell?

Thanks,
Eli, Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2., Hi, this issue seems to be resolved on 1.2.0.

{code}
# Create a sequence file and copy it to local.
$ hadoop jar hadoop-examples-1.2.0.jar randomwrite -Dtest.randomwrite.total_bytes=100 out
$ hadoop fs -get out/part-00000 /home/hadoop/

# fs -text works on LocalFS.
$ hadoop fs -text file:///home/hadoop/part-00000
de f2 56 62 6d 8c ...
{code}

Should I add a test case for this issue?]
