[Please give me some workaround, so i can finish my task., This sounds like a bug in your code, or a misunderstanding, rather than a bug in MR. Please feel free to contact the mapreduce-user list for help., Hadoop is converting my string to Unicode. Those where not spaces, but Hadoop doesn't put the encoding in the file, so I didn't know what where exactly. Today I have used a Hex Viewer and there i saw that every character was converted to Unicode. I don't think it's ok., It doesn't allow me to send mail to mapreduce-user@hadoop.apache.org., http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/mailing_lists.html has instructions on how to subscribe to the lists]
