[I believe the transforms should be:
  1. & -> &amp;amp;
  2. < -> &amp;lt;
  3. > -> &amp;gt;
  4. ' -> &amp;apos;
  5. "-> &amp;quot;

As long as we do those transforms, any html that the user includes in their data will just be treated as literal text rather than html commands., This patch introduces an input filter for all of the servlets and jsp pages that quotes all of the html active characters in the parameters. This means that all of the cross site scripting attacks based on bad urls should be fixed.

* The unit test should use JUnit4 test annotations instead of JUnit3 TestCase
* HttpServer::printRequest looks useful for debugging, but should probably be left out
* The static \*Bytes fields should be final
* The @return docs for "needsQuoting" could be more explicit, Messed up the JavaDoc. Now fixed., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
