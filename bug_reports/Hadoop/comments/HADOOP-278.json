[This patch adds a method for InputFormat that checks to see if a list of input paths is valid. InputFormatBase implements the simple check to make sure that each path represents a directory. JobClient checks the validity of each path and stops the job submission with a message to the user if any directories are invalid., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
