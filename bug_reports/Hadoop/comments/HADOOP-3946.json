[Patch fixing the problem (MapFiles not being handled correctly by SequenceFileInputFormat)., Linked this to HADOOP-3950.  We could close HADOOP-3950 if this issue also fixes TestMiniMRDFSSort., I committed the patch, because it looks right. I then ran the test and it still failed for me, so I reverted it. I guess I'll plow into what is broken., Strange. With the patch TestMapRed passes for me., I recommitted this. The problem was two fold:
  * HADOOP-3958 was failing, but it was unrelated to this patch. It also was not being reported to junit.
  * Mac OS java 6 is running out of memory on several of these tests. They run fine under java 5., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
