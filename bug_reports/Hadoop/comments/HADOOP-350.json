[What JVM are you using locally?  1.4?  The cli jar (unfortunately) seems to be a version that requires 1.5.  Could that be the issue?, Thanks for the tip Doug. JVM 1.4 is the issue. 

Alas, I need to stay on Java 1.4 for my hadoop install, so I tried to recomplile the commons-cli jar. Not sure if I am using the right source code (/branches/commons-configuration-integration/), and I had to patch some classes because of the .withArgPattern in /nutch/trunk/hadoop/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/ToolBase.java (see http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLI-12).

Maybe Hairong can provide more details...

Best,
Renaud, commons cli jar using http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/commons/proper/cli/branches/commons-configuration-integration, patched with CLI-12, compiled with Java 1.4, Hi Renaud,

I recompiled commons-cli using java 1.4. Here is the new jar.  Also I included the source. I did not check if it is the same as yours. But Millind helped me test it and it works. Thanks for your effort on solving this problem. 

Hairong, Thank you Hairong for the fast answer!

I think it would be useful if this jar would be commited to nutch-trunk and hadoop-trunk, WDOT?

Best, Renaud, I just committed this.  Thanks all!]
