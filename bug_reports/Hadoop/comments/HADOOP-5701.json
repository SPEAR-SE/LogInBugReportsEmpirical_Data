[Consider that a cluster have 2000 map slots and jobs submitted in the following sequence:

|1:00pm|JobA|1500 maps, each map runs 24 hours|
|1:30pm|JobB|1000 maps, each map runs 2 hours|
|1:40pm|JobC|3000 maps, each map runs 10 minutes|

Then, all 1500 maps in JobA got scheduled and only 500 map slots remained in the cluster at 1pm.  30 minutes later, JobB came and only 500 maps slots got scheduled.  At 1:40pm, JobC came but no maps got scheduled until some maps in JobB finished 2 hours later.

In this cases, JobA always has 75% of the capacity, JobB and JobC never able to obtain 1/N of the capacity.  If JobA has 2000 maps, other jobs have to wait for maps in JobA to finish and have no progress in 24 hours., In other words, fair share scheduler cannot really allocate fair shares without preemption. , HADOOP-4665 will prevent this from happening. Do you want any additional features on top of that?, Matei, thank you for fixing the problem.  We should close this as duplicated., HADOOP-4665 is not committed yet, but when it is, it should solve the problem.]
