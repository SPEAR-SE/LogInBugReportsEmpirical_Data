[Attaching a sample patch for unix., Hi Akira,

Thanks for looking at this!

My concern with the first patch is that you are now spawning two external processes instead of one.  It seems like this could regress performance somewhat.  There can be a large overhead to spawning an external process from the JVM due to the need to copy page tables during fork().

I think maybe we should consider executing a shell, which then executes both "id -gn" and "id -Gn".  Perhaps something like 'sh -c id -gn ; id -Gn', I suggest && instead of ; for separating commands.  We wouldn't want to mask a failure in the first command if the second command is successful.  (That kind of failure should be a really really rare thing of course, but let's try to catch it just in case.), Thanks for the comments, Colin, Chris. I'll update the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
