[I'm fairly certain this is a regression as well, but I can't verify that at the moment., this should be easily fixed setting additivity to false in configuration of the security classifier in the log4j conf., Sure, but we should do the correct thing out of the box., Hi,
faced the same issue and solved by adding
{code}
log4j.additivity.org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSNamesystem.audit = false
log4j.additivity.org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.common.HadoopAuditLogger.audit = false
{code}

can this be added in default log4j file ? ]
