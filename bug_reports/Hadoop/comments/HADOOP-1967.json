[since hdfs:/// is an invalid uri... all the methods return an error saying that port out of range.. is that ok? or should we throw out invalid uri?

, It would be good to throw readable error message. Invalid URI / missing host, port looks good, > since hdfs:/// is an invalid uri [...]

It's not invalid, it just doesn't specify a host and port.  It should get its host and port from the default filesystem, if the default is hdfs, and otherwise throw an exception since the host & port are required in hdfs.

In general, all paths are resolved against the default FileSystem URI.

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/URI.html#resolve(java.net.URI)

Thus if the default filesystem is HDFS, "hdfs:///foo" will resolve to the default filesystem's host and port, and if the default filesystem is not HDFS, then it will resolve to "hdfs:///foo", which should generate an exception, since HDFS requires a host and port.

We could probably generate a better exception for this, in DistributedFileSystem#initialize().
, this patch allows hdfs:/// uri and uses the default filesystem for this., Here's a more general patch, that fixes this for all filesystems, rather than just HDFS.  Now, whenever a Path is used with the same scheme as the default FileSystem but with no authority specified, the default FileSystem's authority will be used, if any.

Also:
-  added warnings for old-format FileSystem names, so that we can eventually remove their use, which have long been deprecated.
- added accessor methods so that applications need no longer directly set or get "fs.default.name".
- added an explicit check for host & port in HDFS
, +1 for a general patch.

the patch you uploaded doug has a line 

 System.out.println(org.apache.hadoop.util.StringUtils.stringifyException(new Exception("foo")));

I guess it was for debugging purposes. Could you remove this line in the patch? everything else is fine.
