Also I get some gratuitous complaints that setsuid didn't get used but still failed
{code}

, Hi, Steve.  Is this the same as HADOOP-9422?  (Thanks for adding that it impacts YARN clients too though.), downgrade messages to debug; the setsid log() even checks for a null ref before use, chris -this is related; this patch just downgrades the messages from ERROR, WARN and INFO to DEBUG., this is a small patch, but I think the UX will be better. I've seen this twice in programs, and I'm used to grabbing the first stack trace as the root cause -this is diverting me from doing that. We will be seeing a lot of JIRAs containing this stack if we don't fix it, The annoying setsid message is also tracked by HADOOP-9546., +1 for the patch.  Thanks, Steve.  Downgrading to debug level sounds like a helpful first step.

{code}
+        LOG.debug("setsid exited with exit code "
+                  + (shexec != null ? shexec.getExitCode() : "(null executor"));
{code}

Really minor nitpick: did you intend to have a closing paren inside the string literal for "(null executor" ?

This message is automatically generated., now goes (null executor), +1 for the new patch.  Thanks for correcting that, Steve.

I'd say it's not necessary.  We're pretty close to merging HADOOP-8562 from trunk to branch-2, and I expect your trunk patch will apply cleanly after that., HADOOP-8562 has been merged into branch-2., Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #219 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/219/])
