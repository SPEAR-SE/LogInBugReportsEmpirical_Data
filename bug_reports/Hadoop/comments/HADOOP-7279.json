[changing /static would break many downstream dependencies that use common HttpServer. Why can't hdfs and mr use /static for common resources and /hdfs/static and mr/static for their respective resources? Of course separate servlets (DefaultServlet would suffice) need to be registered with HttpServer to serve the latter., What are the downstream dependencies that depend on it? /static is only the hadoop.css file - do we have a lot of stuff depending on that being at the particular URL?, I'm not talking about hadoop.css per se, rather, the default HttpServer serves /static from resource base webapps/static. I _think_ you can achieve what you want without changing the user facing URL (/static)., Linking as related because currently, src/webapps/static/hadoop.css is missing from hadoop-hdfs. ]
