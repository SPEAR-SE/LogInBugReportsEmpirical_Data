[HDFS javadoc is not generated by "ant javadoc".  Not sure it is related to this., Giri, can you take a look at these 2 issues?, > HDFS javadoc is not generated by "ant javadoc". Not sure it is related to this. 

The reason is that hdfs is not included in the "javadoc" target.  I guess it was done intentionally.  We could generate hdfs javadoc by "ant javadoc-dev"., I tried reproducing this issue..., 
Executing ant api-report didnt show up any error.
executing ant api-report for the second time without doing a ant clean showed up the error.


, unable to reproduce this issues; 
This happens only when we run api-report target twice

, Giri, the patch build does an 'svn update' and an 'ant clean'.  Is it possible that 'clean' isn't cleaning up all the artifacts created by 'api-report'?, {quote}

It seems to me that the bug is in the test-patch.sh script. Checked the latest [build #3846|http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/3846/console]. Hudson can reproduce this problem. It may be the case that test-patch.sh somehow runs the api target twice., As I commented before api-repot is getting called twice.. 

releaseaudit target which has depenency on api-report calls it once 
and tar which also has transient dependency on api-report calls it for the second time; which is when the sax error appears.

Jira [HADOOP-5279|http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5279] is filed to skip calling tar target as part of test-core which indirectly fixes this issue aswell.
