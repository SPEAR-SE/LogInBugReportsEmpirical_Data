[* Added a break statement to break out of the loop if we get get an IOException Error

* Replaced shutdown0 with shutdown so that we can mock the function to throw the IOException Error. With native calls it is not possible to intercept with Mockito, \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks for looking at this, [~anu].  The patch is not correct because right now it unconditionally breaks out of the loop without waiting for the socket reference count to drop to 0.  This is very dangerous because it means that we may call close on a file descriptor while another thread is still using it.  If this happens, a third thread may open another file, which will get the same file descriptor number as the one which was just closed.  And then the second thread is doing some arbitrary operation on the wrong file descriptor.

To be honest, I do not see any way of handling this better than we currently do.  If {{shutdown}} fails, we simply have to block until the socket is no longer in use.  There is no possible shortcut that I can see.

Did you encounter this problem in production?  If so, what was the {{shutdown}} error?, bq. Thanks for looking at this, Anu Engineer.

And then the second thread is doing some arbitrary operation on the wrong file descriptor.

if we got a socket error, then waiting for the count to go to zero will put you on an infinite loop. What would you like to do ? Fail fast or wait forever ? 

I was seeing calls to shutdown0(native) would fail, in this specific case shutdown0 failed with socket not connected error.  if you look at the change that I proposed(the test failed) -- was to try to call shutdown with the counter getting decremented, instead of the current call where we call into shutdown0. I have not investigated why the specific test case failed. 

bq. To be honest, I do not see any way of handling this better than we currently do. If shutdown fails, we simply have to block until the socket is no longer in use. 

if the shutdown fails, we should bail since current call is to the OS native call layer, then the assumption that failure happened due to someone else is using socket - AFAIK is not correct. We should be able to shutdown a socket even if someone is using it , that user will get an error is a different problem. 

bq. There is no possible shortcut that I can see.

we are in a bad situation when this happens, in the specific case I was seeing  ENOTCONN. You would be absolutely right, if the error was due to calling socket-Shutdown in java code in DomainSocket.java, but this call it is to  OS layer and if the OS says it is an invalid socket, no one else can use it either. That is having a reference count is not going to help anyway.


bq. Did you encounter this problem in production? If so, what was the shutdown error?

Production - No, I don't own any clusters unfortunately. During bug bash I was trying to shepherd one of the bugs from [~cnauroth] , where he had fixed an issue to get the native code compiling on mac HDFS-3296. But did not get complete it because socket calls were failing. We found 3 separate bugs in that path. I will file those JIRAs ASAP. 

* On Mac - Domain Sockets Path cannot be more then 103 bytes and for some reason getting /tmp + date time stamp will make the path longer , because /tmp is a symbolic link. - I have a simple fix for this.

* On Mac - This failure happens in a specific test , where OS returns socket is not connected error and we get stuck, we will eventually come out since the test will time out. - This is the one that I was fixing, In fact I will create a simple wrapper around shutdown0(so I can use mockito to inject errors) and then call into the same call as you have proposed. But would like to break out if we get an error like ENOTCONN - Socket not connected. At that point no one can be using that socket anyway. From looking at the man pages - http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shutdown.2.html - I get a feeling that if a socket shutdown has failed, that socket will not be in use by anyone. They would be getting errors while communicating is my feeling. Do you agree ? if so, then breaking out seems to be the right thing to do.

* On Mac - There is another bug, where we ask the native layer to accept a connection with timeout and that call also fails, I looked at the code and did not see anything really wrong. I need to put it under a debugger. Hopefully once we fix these three bugs, we can run native library on Mac
, bq. This is very dangerous because it means that we may call close on a file descriptor while another thread is still using it. If this happens, a third thread may open another file, which will get the same file descriptor number as the one which was just closed. And then the second thread is doing some arbitrary operation on the wrong file descriptor

Sorry I did not specifically answer this concern. In our current code path, we have already called shutdown -- so from our point of view we are ready to lose that file handle. It is *not* the java code, it is OS code path - Linux , BSD or Mac OS as the case may be. So we are more than willing to close the file handle, and OS says sorry this is not a valid socket or there is no connection. In that scenario, I don't see the danger of second thread doing something arbitrary on a wrong handle since we decided to call shutdown and throw away the handle anyway. if what you are saying is possible , then we have some other locking bugs higher up in the stack which really cannot be solved at this layer.
, bq. if we got a socket error, then waiting for the count to go to zero will put you on an infinite loop. What would you like to do ? Fail fast or wait forever ?

It isn't an infinite loop.  The loop terminates when nobody else is using the socket (the reference count goes to 0).  If the reference count is not going to 0 even though there are no other users, there is a bug somewhere else where we are incorrectly forgetting to decrement the reference count.

bq. we are in a bad situation when this happens, in the specific case I was seeing ENOTCONN. You would be absolutely right, if the error was due to calling socket-Shutdown in java code in DomainSocket.java, but this call it is to OS layer and if the OS says it is an invalid socket, no one else can use it either. That is having a reference count is not going to help anyway.

The reference count isn't to protect the socket, it's to protect the socket number.  As long as the reference count is nonzero, it is not safe to close the socket, since someone might be in the process of making a call to that socket number.  Calling close will allow that socket number to be reused by the operating system.

bq. On Mac - This failure happens in a specific test , where OS returns socket is not connected error and we get stuck, we will eventually come out since the test will time out. - This is the one that I was fixing, In fact I will create a simple wrapper around shutdown0(so I can use mockito to inject errors) and then call into the same call as you have proposed. But would like to break out if we get an error like ENOTCONN - Socket not connected. At that point no one can be using that socket anyway. From looking at the man pages - http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shutdown.2.html - I get a feeling that if a socket shutdown has failed, that socket will not be in use by anyone. They would be getting errors while communicating is my feeling. Do you agree ? if so, then breaking out seems to be the right thing to do.

If {{DomainSocket#connect}} fails, we should never get a DomainSocket object in the first place.

{code}
  public static DomainSocket connect(String path) throws IOException {
    if (loadingFailureReason != null) {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException(loadingFailureReason);
    }
    int fd = connect0(path);
    return new DomainSocket(path, fd);
  }
{code}

I don't understand how you are having problems with an unconnected socket in {{DomainSocket#close}}, since you can't even create a {{DomainSocket}} object until {{connect0}} succeeds.  It sounds like we need to dig deeper into this issue, which may be a reference count problem somewhere.  In any case, we most certainly should not modify {{DomainSocket#close}}., bq .  It sounds like we need to dig deeper into this issue, which may be a reference count problem somewhere. In any case, we most certainly should not modify DomainSocket#close.

I agree, I will dig deeper to find out why this happens instead of masking the issue here. As I said this only happens on Domain sockets with Mac OS X
