[Note that as per RFC4120 the fix is to make the confPrincipal lowercase:

{code}
6.2.1.  Name of Server Principals

                                                           ... Where the name of the host 
   is not case sensitive (for example, with Internet domain names) the
   name of the host MUST be lowercase....
{code} , ok, the issue comes from config. the principals in *-site.zml must be properly cased (lowercase hostnames). SecurityUtil.replacePatternt would do the right thing, had it have a chance.]
