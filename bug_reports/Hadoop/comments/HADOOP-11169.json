[As reported by [~andrew.wang] :

We're hitting an issue when trying to do "hdfs fetchdt", or really any KMS DT operation. It looks very much like the truststore is not being picked up. However, "hadoop key" operations do work.

Exception is:

This message is automatically generated., LGTM, nice work tracking this one down Arun. IIUC the issue is that the passed authenticator is null, we get the default authenticator, but then do not set the right connConfigurator on the authenticator.

+1 will commit shortly., Committed down through branch-2.6, thanks again Arun., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6209 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6209/])
