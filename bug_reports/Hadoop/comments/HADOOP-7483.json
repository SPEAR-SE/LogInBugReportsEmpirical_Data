[See HADOOP-6605. In summary: IMO Hadoop should auto-detect/prefer the Sun JDK 1.6 over others because it is required, however people veto'd that and would rather require users explicitly set JAVA_HOME (or remove the other versions of java installed on the host)., Well, as allen said on HADOOP-6605, "My technical objection is that there is a high likelihood of getting this wrong."

There's a serious risk of the JAVA_HOME autodetector becoming a major maintenance mess. This is the beginning., I don't see how this is the beginning. JAVA_HOME auto-detection is orthogonal to a java package dependency. Regardless of whether we auto-detect JAVA_HOME we need to deal with multiple javas installed on a host - even if we create a package dependency there may be others installed as well.

CDH has had JAVA_HOME detection for years and it hasn't been a major maintenance mess, but that's a separate discussion., Should we move this issue to Apache Bigtop (TLP now)? I have not heard of such a problem existing in it currently, in its java-home-detector. So I'd rather close it out since Bigtop has, I think, superceded this upstream packaging effort overall., bq. CDH has had JAVA_HOME detection for years and it hasn't been a major maintenance mess, but that's a separate discussion.

Things are always easier when you only run on a tiny set of platforms. :)

Anyway, closing as stale.]
