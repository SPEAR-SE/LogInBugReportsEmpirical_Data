[We had reported a similar issue before in HADOOP-11780.  It looks like the patch hasn't been posted. [~daryn] says he will post it soon., Thanks [~kihwal]. Linking the issue for now. I think in these 2 issues {{Reader}} died for different reasons, but maybe the solution is similar. I don't have a patch either., Patch is posted on linked jira.  I think it's dangerous to attempt handling unexpected runtime exceptions because the thread may be left in an inconsistent state.  I chose to make it fatal per suggestion in description.]
