[The problem is cause by the fact that current FI system uses AspectJ version specified at two different places. HADOOP-6395 has replaced one of the and brought the build to an out-of-synch state, This fixes the problem, +1 patch looks good., Thanks for the review Nichilas. 
I've just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #93 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/93/])
    . Build is broken after HADOOP-6395 patch has been applied. Contributed by Konstantin Boudnik
, Fix for 0.21 branch, This needs to be fixed in 0.21 and made consistent with map/reduce. Just changing trunk is not sufficient., Which apparently has been done already according to http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?view=rev&rev=885555, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk #174 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk/174/])
