, Failures seem unrelated. [~jlowe],  please add this to your review queue!, [~jira.shegalov], thanks for the patch. It looks good to me. One minor nit: it might be good to enclose the last condition (the one that checks for the nested class) in parentheses for clarity:

{code}
              ||    (canonicalName.length() > c.length()            // nested
                 && canonicalName.charAt(c.length()) == '$')) {
{code}, Thanks, [~sjlee0], for review! 

Clarity is a subjective matter. I find redundant parentheses distracting especially when indentation has already been used to emphasize the grouping of operators as in this case. I leave it to committers if they have a strong preference one way or another., +1 lgtm.  Committing this., Thanks to Gera for the contribution and to Sangjin for additional review!
