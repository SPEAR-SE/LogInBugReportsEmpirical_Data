[Does it make sense to use JobTracker history mechanism ( HADOOP-239) to include this information as well ? I think it does. , This was fixed by HADOOP-492, which implemented per-task and per-job counters. The default counters include bytes and records input and output. They are printed on the console when the job completes. They are available as the job runs via the http server. The times are available from the time stamps on the progress messages and are available on the web/ui.]
