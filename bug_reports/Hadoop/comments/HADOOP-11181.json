This message is automatically generated., I checked findbugs and release audit warnings, which seemed not to be related to this patch., Patch looks good to me., I wonder, why this generality is required? In general the extensions should be done in the custom blob, not in {{DelegationTokenIdentifier}}.

Can you also explain why it blocks YARN-2656?, It is required because DelegationTokenAuthenticationFilter has the assumption that the delegation token it is dealing with is *.web.DelegationTokenIdentifier, which is not always true given it allows to hook external secretManager. In RM (YARN-2656) and timeline server (YARN-2676), we're going to hook the YARN's secretManager, and process the delegation token extended from YARNDelegationTokenIdentifier, which unfortunately doesn't extend *.web.DelegationTokenIdentifier, but their common ancestor, AbstractDelegationTokenIdentifier. That's why I need to generalized the common code, such that we can pass in our sub-type delegation token.

Importantly, our delegation token created by YARN's secretManager is serialized in YARN's customized method, but DelegationTokenSecretyManager is using *.web.DelegationTokenIdentifier's method to deserialize it, hence resulting error., In general if we allow setting external secretManager (which is added by HADOOP-10771 recently), I think it is reasonable to allow using AbstractDelegationTokenIdentifier instead of web.DelegationTokenIdentifier only. For the current patch, some comments:
# I guess we do not need to add "rawtypes", which is used by Eclipse Helios, to suppress warnings.
# The logic of the following code may have some issue. With this change in the future if an token's identifier cannot be decoded based on the serviceloader mechanism, we would assume it is web.DelegationTokenIdentifier. However, since the user can set his/her own identifier type and secrect manager, there is no mechanism to guarantee the assumption is correct.
{code}
+  public UserGroupInformation verifyToken(
+      Token<? extends AbstractDelegationTokenIdentifier> token)
+          throws IOException {
+    // If the token identifier has a subclass associated to its kind, we should
+    // use the class's method to do decoding
+    AbstractDelegationTokenIdentifier id = token.decodeIdentifier();
+    // For the web token identifier, id will be null because it's unable to
+    // find the subclass associated to its kind. Instead, we should use web
+    // DelegationTokenIdentifier to decode it.
+    if (id == null) {
+      ByteArrayInputStream buf = new ByteArrayInputStream(token.getIdentifier());
+      DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(buf);
+      id = new DelegationTokenIdentifier(tokenKind);
+      id.readFields(dis);
+      dis.close();
+    }
{code}
# Nit: there is an unused import in DelegationTokenManager, [~jingzhao], thanks for the comments.

bq. I guess we do not need to add "rawtypes", which is used by Eclipse Helios, to suppress warnings.

Nice to know. Remove the "rawtypes" in the new patch.

bq. However, since the user can set his/her own identifier type and secrect manager, there is no mechanism to guarantee the assumption is correct.

That's correct. I was aware of it, but want to minimize the change while it seems that only web.DelegationTokenIdentifier fails into the other category. As the decoded token is verified by the secret manager, hopefully it's the fair point that the secret manager should know best about how to decode the token. Therefore, I add a method "decodeToken" for AbstractDelegationTokenIdentifier (to limit the problem to delegation token only but not others), and make it simply call token.decodeIdentifier(). On the other side, I make the secret manager that works with web.DelegationTokenIdentifier override the method to use the previous decoding method in verifyToken(). Please let me know how  you think about the new approach.

bq. Nit: there is an unused import in DelegationTokenManager

Good catch. Fix it., Thanks for addressing the comments, Zhijie! The new approach looks good to me. For the latest patch, some minor/nitty comments:
# maybe we can rename the new {{decodeToken}} method to {{decodeTokenIdentifier}}
# It will be good to have an extra unit test for this new method, covering several different subclasses of AbstractDelegationTokenSecretManager.

This message is automatically generated., bq. maybe we can rename the new decodeToken method to decodeTokenIdentifier

Changed it accordingly

bq. It will be good to have an extra unit test for this new method, covering several different subclasses of AbstractDelegationTokenSecretManager.

For decoding web.DelegationTokenIdentifier, the code path inTestDelegationTokenManager has already covered it:
{code}
    try {
      tm.verifyToken(token);
      Assert.fail();
    } catch (IOException ex) {
{code}
Anyway, I enhance the test case to run through both ZKSecretManager and DelegationTokenSecretManager, which are the two using web.DelegationTokenIdentifier right now.

On the other side, I changed TestRMWebServicesDelegationTokens to use the inherited AbstractDelegationTokenIdentifier.decodeTokenIdentifier to do the decoding., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
