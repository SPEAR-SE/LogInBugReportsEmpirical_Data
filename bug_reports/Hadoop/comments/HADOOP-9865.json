[Attach a patch demonstrating the problem described above. I will work on a more complete fix and add some unit tests., {code}
+    String scheme = schemeFromPath(fixRelativePart(pathPattern));
+    String authority = authorityFromPath(fixRelativePart(pathPattern));
{code}
This is a good start, but the problem is that pathPattern is not actually a path-- it's a pattern.  So it may be something like {/,a}/foo, which you can't really make into an absolute path in a sensible way.

I think the right fix is something like this:
{code}

This probably needs more testing, including unit tests..., Thanks for the suggestion, Colin! I was also thinking something similar. The patch was just to demo the problem in the description. I will add some unit tests to cover the scenarios as well!, Attaching a patch. The fix looks exactly as Colin shows. So the credit also goes to him. I added a new test case in TestGlobPaths. Without the fix, the test fails with {{FileContext.globStatus()}} (this bug), and passes with {{FileSystem.globStatus()}}. I removed a previous pTestRelativePath test case because it is duplicated with the new test case I added. I tested this on Linux. On Windows, I need to incorporate the change in HDFS-5093 to get the test case pass. , The unit test cases added in this patch also rely on HDFS-5093 to pass on Winodws., Thanks for working on this, Chuan.

In TestRelativePath, I would suggest using {{TestPath#mergeStatuses}} to get back a string which you can compare using {{Assert#assertEquals}}.  The reason is because {{globStatus}} doesn't guarantee the order in which it returns results-- you test could break if someone changes Globber.java slightly and that changes the order in which results are returned.  {{TestPath#mergeStatuses}} avoids this problem by sorting all the results.  It's also much nicer to see a test error message that includes all results., Thanks for the suggestion!
