[It seems that the hadoop-project/pom.xml has not be pushed to the snapshots repo, I manually deployed hadoop-project.

The problem is that the post commit jobs (e.g. https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/) run from the project subdirectory (e.g. hadoop-common-project), so hadoop-project never gets deployed. The longer-term fix would be to add a new job for the top-level or merge them into a single job.
, seems this is fixed now]
