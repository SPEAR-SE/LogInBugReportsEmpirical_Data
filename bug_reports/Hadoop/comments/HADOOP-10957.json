This message is automatically generated., v1 of this patch tried to remove the code described by this comment:
{code}
// If we get back only one result, this could be either a listing
// of a directory with one entry, or it could reflect the fact
// that what we listed resolved to a file.
//
// Unfortunately, we can't just compare the returned paths to
// figure this out.  Consider the case where you have /a/b, where
// b is a symlink to "..".  In that case, listing /a/b will give
// back "/a/b" again.  If we just went by returned pathname, we'd
// incorrectly conclude that /a/b was a file and should not match
// /a/*/*.  So we use getFileStatus of the path we just listed to
// disambiguate.
 {code}

Unfortunately, removing this code isn't possible.  In the presence of symlinks, the result of {{listStatus}} is simply ambiguous when it returns only one item.  Comparing paths won't work, because of the way symlinks play with paths.  The only way around this would be adding a new RPC (or a new option to the old {{listStatus}} RPC) that would let us know whether we listed a directory or file.

Anyway, v2 of the patch is super minimal.  It basically just adds a fix for the case where we tried to recurse into a file when handling a glob.  I also took the liberty of fixing two lines that had bad indentation in Globber.java, and avoiding the "no groups found for user" spew by adding this:

{code}
-      UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser("myuser");
+    UserGroupInformation.createUserForTesting("myuser",
+        new String[] { "mygroup" });

The original patch this is an offshoot from is never supposed to call listStatus on a symlink which avoids the problem.  A symlink is resolved via getFileStatus prior to a listStatus call.  Do you see a bug in the original patch?

I'd rather not fragment the original patch.  We already have it internally deployed.  A piecemeal change will cause me to rework the internal patch multiple times due to conflicts..., Let's just discuss the bug here, and discuss optimizations on HADOOP-10942.  This is a tiny patch which fixes a significant bug, so hopefully we can get it in quickly., If you insist on splitting up the patch, take all the test changes on HADOOP-10942.  The existing tests were sufficient if permissions are enabled and the the priv/unpriv fs are handled as intended., OK.  This patch also switches over TestGlobPaths to use non-privileged FC and FS, +1 LGTM, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
