[Here is a straight-forward fix...

Doug, the attached patch contains necessary changes for the scripts; however due to deficiencies of the unix 'patch' utility can you please manually add the 'svn:executable' property (value '*') to the following files:
 src/native/config/config.guess
 src/native/config/config.sub
 src/native/config/depcomp
 src/native/config/install-sh
 src/native/config/missing
 src/native/configure
 src/native/packageNativeHadoop.sh

thanks!, I just fixed this.  Thanks, Arun!]
