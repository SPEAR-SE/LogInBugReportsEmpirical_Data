[I think that having source attachments are extremely valuable during debug sessions;
would it be possible to get them uploaded for the 3.0.0 release?, [~shv] could you take a look? At least for the 2.7.x releases., I checked on [Nexus|https://repository.apache.org/]. It looks like the releases were staged like that. See e.g.
 [https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/2.7.5/]
 * For 2.7.5 it's very strange, because some sub-projects like hadoop-common and hadoop-hdfs do have sources
 [https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common/2.7.5/]
 [https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-hdfs/2.7.5/]
 while others don't.
 * For 2.8.3, 2.9.0, and 3.0.0 sources are consistently not there.
 * The 3.0.1 RC0, which is currently staged, seems to have all sources. Didn't check all sub-projects though

I will try to debug this when I release 2.7.6. May be we need to update the [HowToRelease|https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease] runbook., Thanks [~shv], 

I quickly checked, all the releases since 2.8.3 doesn't have source jars. (including 3.0.1 released version).

You can change the version to see per-release artifacts., Hi, [~shv]

If we run "mvn deploy -Psign -DskipTests" as suggested on https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease, there is no source jars for all.

However, if run "mvn deploy -Psign -DskipTests -Dgpg.executable=gpg2 -Pdist,src,yarn-ui -Dtar" seems to work, as the repository located below:

https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehadoop-1102/

"dev-support/bin/create-release --asfrelease --docker --dockercache"  seems work too.

Update:

Some package has jars without sources:

https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehadoop-1102/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-client-runtime/3.0.2/

But others have sources:

https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehadoop-1102/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-hdfs-client/3.0.2/, Thanks [~eddyxu] for looking into this. I suggest we update the how-to-release page for now, but we should fix it so that "mvn deploy -Psign -DskipTests" worked. I am definitely not qualified to deal with maven builds. Do you think you can track this, Eddy?, I tried "mvn deploy -Psign -DskipTests -Dgpg.executable=gpg2 -Pdist,src,yarn-ui -Dtar" when uploading 2.9.1 RC0.  It works.  

Thanks [~eddyxu] for providing the solution. , 3.1.0 have also came out without sources as well...
http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common/3.1.0/
I've added 3.1.1 as a target version..., Only just seen this; we'll have to see if the 2.7.7 release I just promoted has the files.

We should be able to automated checking for this; just have a project with build profiles to D/L the relevant artifacts, all of them, [~stevel@apache.org] seems to me that 2.7.7 has source attachments!
but unfortunately 3.1.1 doesn't seem to have....
http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common/2.7.7/
http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common/3.1.1/

I've written a small script  ([^chk.bash]) which could run checks based on the projects in the maven build - I think that modules may come and go between releases...so having a project might not be  good (but of course there might be some maven tricks I'm not aware of)
It lists a few bogus results for even 2.7.7 (like hadoop-main and friends...which are logical modules)
but for 3.1.1 source attachment is missing for example modules like: hadoop-yarn-services-api
