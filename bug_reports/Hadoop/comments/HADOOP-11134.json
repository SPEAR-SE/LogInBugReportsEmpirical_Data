[A level makes sense, but I'd be wary of changing the default ... documentation, code that greps the output, etc etc depends on it.

All that is likely to happen is people will log more at warn.

(this isn't a justification for all the noise at info we have today .. maybe cleaning that up could be good), In trunk (and maybe branch-2), we could change the default for interactive and server commands separately.    Most of what I see at the INFO level for the interactive commands is not very actionable by the end user., I would be very conservative to change default log level behavior (no matter trunk or branch-2). 
There should be many places we assume LOG.info will log some important messages (don't have to be warn, as it could be information in normal behavior, like real port number for servers started with ephemeral port settings) with default settings. The unimportant messages in normal case should be set as debug level which should be enough. I don't think it is necessary to review all LOG.info cases (huge or even impossible effort) to make such a trivial changes without any significant benefit.
I prefer to close this issue as "not a problem". Thoughts?, bq. Thoughts?

Most of the stuff that we actually log at info is pretty useless on the client side, which is what this is effectively targeting., valid point about client side. FWIW the most annoying I see there is the one warning of no native code, Please code review.

No tests because there aren't any existing tests that check the log level in the script..., Please code review, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, We should probably revisit this before the 3.x alpha is cut.  Ping [~andrew.wang]. I'll update the patch since it doesn't work for 3.x anymore., -02:

{code}
{code:title=hadoop.cmd}
@rem   HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER The root appender. Default is INFO,console
{code}
The defaults should be WARN., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
