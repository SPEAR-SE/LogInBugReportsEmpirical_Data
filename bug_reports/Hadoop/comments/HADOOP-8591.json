[I think this JIRA should be moved to Common. Eli, do you agree?, Yup, thanks., I looked into this today and realized that it was a problem with a particular Jenkins slave. Whenever a pre-commit test or nightly build was run on hadoop1, it would fail. Whenever it was run anywhere else, it would pass. When I logged in to hadoop1, I noticed that there were a bunch of pre-commit processes and even a nightly build that had been running for weeks or months. After killing these zombie processes, TestZKFailoverController now passes reliably on hadoop1.]
