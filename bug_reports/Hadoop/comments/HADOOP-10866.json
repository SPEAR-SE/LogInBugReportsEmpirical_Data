[I saw other tests didn't fail often with this set of tests, but HDFS-6588 happened to fail for 3 times. So I looked into and found that the problem is that testDandlingLink doesn't create the source file initially. Submit patch 001.

Hi [~cmccabe], thanks for your earlier comment. I wonder if you could help doing a quick review of this small patch? thanks a lot.
, I hope I didn't miss anything when reading the patch, but if you create the file that the symlink is pointing to, isn't this no longer testing dangling symlinks?  Try making the delete the first thing you do, and see if that helps you reliably reproduce the problem., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The problem I saw is, without creating the file, the first call {{wrapper.createSymlink(fileAbs, link, false);}} would fail because the source file doesn't exist.  The patch I did was, to create the file first, then create the link, then delete the file, then check the danglng link. I thought that's what the test intended to do.



, Though jenkins has sent out email notification of the test result, clicking on https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/7392// shows that the test job is stuck at: 
{quote}
Description set: HDFS-6707
Recording test results
Publish JUnit test result report is waiting for a checkpoint on PreCommit-HDFS-Build #7389
{code}

, Sorry I was mistaken, linking with missing source file actually will create a link... let me look further. thanks.
, The real problem is, somehow on the machine used upstream, the "isSymlink()" in the code below returned false (it returns true when I ran locally)
{code}
  /**
   * @return The contents of the symbolic link.
   */
  public Path getSymlink() throws IOException {
    if (!isSymlink()) {
      throw new IOException("Path " + path + " is not a symbolic link");
    }
    return symlink;
  }

I wonder if anything is special about this type of test slave Slave {{H4 (Build slave for Hadoop project builds : asf904.gq1.ygridcore.net)}}

This message is automatically generated., https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/7392//testReport/ and
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/7405//testReport/ were results from two runs on the same host
Slave H4 (Build slave for Hadoop project builds : asf904.gq1.ygridcore.net).

The latter one is with patch 004, which resolved all symlinks failures reported in run 7392. 

The root cause is that on this kind of host, the command {{stat -c "%s,%F,%Y,%X,%a,%U,%G,%N" target}} gives
{code}
    6,symbolic link,6,1373584236,1373584236,lrwxrwxrwx,andrew,andrew,'link' -> 'target'
{code}
kind of result instead of
{code}
    6,symbolic link,6,1373584236,1373584236,lrwxrwxrwx,andrew,andrew,`link' -> `target'
{code}.
The former is not handled currently. The patch is introduced to handle both. Since this fix is to fix existing tests, I didn't try to introduce additional tests.

Hi [~cmccabe], would you please help review again? thanks.


, Good find, Yongjun.

Parsing the output of this shell command is definitely worrisome.  It has been the source of bunch of bugs in the past.  Unfortunately, even if we came up with a JNI method to do this, not everyone would use it, so here we are.

Can we do this by skipping over the first code point following the comma, rather than by looking for a specific quote type?  That seems more flexible in case there are any more wacky variants., HI Colin, thanks for the comments. Same feelings on my side that I wish we don't have to depend on parsing shell output. 
If you look at the patch, you can see that I've already got rid of the dependency on quote type, I used "->" as the separator to find the link target, which hopefully is more robust.
Thanks.
, +1 once you add a unit test to TestStat.java (and pending Jenkins, of course)

Thanks, Yongjun., Thanks Colin, will do!
, Nice find here Yongjun. I moved this to HADOOP since it's in common, and linked to HADOOP-10510 where it was previously reported. Let's close that one as a dupe when this gets resolved., Thanks Colin and Andrew. I just posted a new version (005) with added test Colin suggested.
