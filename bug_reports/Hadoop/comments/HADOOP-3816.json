[Hi Sriram, is it possible to know what kind of changes are being done to improve directory listings? Just curious. Is it like a bulk readdirplus call to retrieve multiple entries in a single RPC?, Hi Dhruba,

Yes: I have added a new readdirplus() API that returns file attributes for all the entries in a directory.  The KFS side of the code is checked into the KFS repository.  In KFS client library code, see:

src/cc/libkfsClient/KfsClient.cc : KfsClientImpl::ReaddirPlus() for the client side changes
src/cc/meta/request.cc: handle_readdir_plus()

Sriram, There are two attachments for this issue:

1. kfs-0.2.0.jar: This should replace lib/kfs-0.1.3.jar
2. patch file that contains the fixes.  

Also, please rename lib/kfs-0.1.LICENSE.txt to lib/kfs-0.2.LICENSE.txt

Thanks.

Sriram, Since this is a performance improvement, I think we should move this to 0.19 instead of 0.18., I just committed this. Thanks, Sriram!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
