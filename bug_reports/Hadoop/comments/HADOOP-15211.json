[Do mean "copies permissions over"? Because update is different from non updating distcp, in that it doesn't create dest, it copies src/**/* into the already existing dest (at least I think so).

What happens if you try the command and dest doesn't exist?, In case when child directories are *not* present, *distcp copies the permissions*

In case when child directories are present, *distcp preserves the permissions*

In case when parent directory is *not* present, *distcp copies the permissions*

In case when parent directory is present, *distcp does not preserves the permissions*

I think ideally the behavior of child and parent should be same as I am passing "pugpb" options

 , I played around a bit more and it looks that I was wrong in my understanding.

-update and -overwrite does not prevent the user from having an <extra_file> at target location which is not in the source. As such,  preserving root permissions would be asking to preserve permissions even for the <extra_files>.

Verified this in CopyCommitter.java that this behavior is intentional

        //
        // Skip the root folder when syncOrOverwrite is true.
        //
        if (targetRoot.equals(targetFile) && syncOrOverwrite) continue;
