[bq. 3 of the main links in the menu are "buy stuff for money", "give us free money" and "thanks for giving us free money" but no source code...
The downloaded tarball from [here|http://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html#Download] includes the source codes in form of source jars.

'Version control' is mainly helpful for the people who are willing to build hadoop on their own and/or contribute to apache hadoop.

You can find the details of building and contributing in this page.
http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute

Hope this helps.
