[It is because Forrest 0.9 does not have 'fop-0.20.5.jar' that has the class 'org/apache/fop/messaging/MessageHandler'

You may check them out, for example, in my Forrest 0.9:

jongwook@localhost:~/apache/apache-forrest-0.9/lib/core$ ls *fop*
cocoon-fop-block.jar

In my Forrest 0.8:
jongwook@localhost:~/apache/apache-forrest-0.8/lib/core$ ls *fop*
cocoon-fop-block-2.2.0-dev.jar  fop-0.20.5.jar  fop-0.20.5.jar.license.txt
, Looks like this is a duplicate of HADOOP-7303.]
