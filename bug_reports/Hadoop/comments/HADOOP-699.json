Attached patch contains fix for the port reported by the data nodes. Now registration is done Http server is started and the correct port is reported to NameNode. Another change is to update datanode info in NameNode when it receives a registration.

This patch also includes various changes to name node front page. It includes #blocks for each datanode. Datanode table can be sorted on any field, etc.
