http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html#Proxy_user, attaching patch.
* renamed Supserusers.apt.vm to ProxyUser.apt.vm and replaced the word supseruser by proxy user in some place because it is confusing
* replaced the description in SecureMode.apt.vm by the pointer to ProxyUser.apt.vm
* left ProxyUser.apt.vm as a separate page because it is not mandatory to use it with secure mode, of course it is not secure without kerberos authn
