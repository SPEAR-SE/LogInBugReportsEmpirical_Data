[Patch attached. 

- update hadoop.security.logger to NullAppender in log4j.properties, it is set explicitly by default in the bin and env scripts, so this is mostly a nop
- hdfs/mapred.audit.logger and now default to the NullAppender in log4j.properties. Update hdfs.audit.logger in hadoop-env.sh to match. This is being made configurable in HADOOP-8224. mapred.audit.logger is not set in the bin or env scripts and is dead code, filed HADOOP-8392 for that (and to hookup RM/NM).

Testing, verified the hdfs audit log is no longer automatically created and logged to when run from a tarball install., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
