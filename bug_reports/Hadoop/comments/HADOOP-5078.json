[Try removing the lines in hadoop-ec2-env.sh that set AMI_KERNEL. These were being set to get better performance, but now the default kernel works fine., It works. Thanks a lot !, Here's a patch which makes the change. More information on the problem it's fixing here: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=109139. I'll apply this in the next couple of days unless anyone objects., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #756 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/756/])
