[The short answer is "mvn javadoc:aggregate -Dmaxmemory=1024". However, we should only publish the public API, which means we should use the annotation-aware doclet, and we should group the API by project using the groups parameter. 

More at http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/examples/aggregate.html and http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/aggregate-mojo.html

I can look at this one if you like.
, Thanks for taking this up Tom!, I've added a reporting section to the top-level pom, so "mvn site" will generate aggregated Javadoc.

I've added package-level InterfaceAudience annotations to hide non-public APIs in new packages - mainly MR2/YARN (which is why the patch is so big).

I've also added a slightly modified doclet to only include classes that have been explicitly marked @Public (IncludePublicAnnotationsStandardDoclet). Being conservative about what's in the public API is probably a good thing, since its easier to add a class at a later date than to remove one. This is basically done, but there may be a few places where InterfaceAudience should be added., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Only immediate change to do is that api/ should go under hadoop-project/ (instead of next to it).
