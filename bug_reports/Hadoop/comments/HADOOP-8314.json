[Patch looks pretty good to me, Tucu. One small comment. This should either say either "users are not authorized" or "users are unauthorized" but _not_ "users are not unauthorized". :)

{code}
+      response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED,
+                         "Unauthenticated users are not " +
+                         "unauthorized to access this page.");
{code}

Otherwise the patch looks good. +1 pending Jenkins., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
