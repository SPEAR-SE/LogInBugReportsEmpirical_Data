[Using /tmp is simply not a good idea.  It leaves you vulnerable to various of system configuration differences, of which there are millions out there.  We should create temp files in the test's working directory. , We should start a unit test authors document and add this to it!, Streaming tests and libhdfs tests also use /tmp., This patches fixes TestMiniMRLocalFS, all the streaming tests, and the libhdfs test.  Once this patch is applied, no test should write files to /tmp (except for those temporarily created by Jetty)., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12350777/HADOOP-761.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r505362., I just committed this.  Thanks, Nigel!]
