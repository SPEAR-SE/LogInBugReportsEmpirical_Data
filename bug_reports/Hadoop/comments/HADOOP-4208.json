[Also note that checkAndAddJob is also deleting files that don't have the expected pattern of job_ * _ * , which should be removed too., Owen,
Pre HADOOP-3245, the whole of system-dir was deleted upon jobtracker (re)start. So if there is nothing to recover, then the jobtracker should switch back to its earlier behavior. Hence anything that doesnt match the pattern will be deleted as done earlier., Job recovery failure is logged to jobtracker's log along with the reason (exception). Deleting the files doesn't cause any problem as there is nothing one can do from those files (job.xml, job.jar and job.split). There is always the history file to see what the final state was. Hence I think this is not a bug but an improvement. Should we move this to 0.20? One question to answer is what all needs to be backed up or preserved and for how long?, JT recovery is just plain broken and at this point won't get fixed....]
