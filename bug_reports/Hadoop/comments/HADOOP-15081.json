[The JvmPauseMonitor does not call System.exit (or proxies to it like ExitUtil), so I don't see how JvmPauseMonitor could be responsible for the process exiting.  Do you have evidence other than the log message appears towards the end of the logs?  What seems more likely is that there is memory pressure to the point that out of memory errors are being thrown and caught by the YarnUncaughtExceptionHandler.  Check the stderr log to see if there's a message about halting the system due to out of memory errors.
