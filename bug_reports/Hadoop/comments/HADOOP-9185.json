[Attaching a fix for the testcase to cleanly shutdown the MiniDFSCluster on exit., This change has been made in branch-1 in HDFS-4161. So this change is only relevant to branch-1-win. I will update the Affected Version(s) field to reflect that., I have committed this to branch-1-win., Suresh, thanks for fixing the version and committing it. My apologies for the oversight.]
