[See error below.  We'll need to change hadoop-maven-plugins/pom.xml to put Clover on the classpath.

, It turns out that there is a configuration option that a sub-module can set to skip Clover instrumentation.  I'm uploading a patch that does that.  With this in place, the plugin won't get instrumented, and we won't have a situation of an instrumented class having a dependency on a Clover class during plugin execution.

I've tested this patch by running Maven with the -Pclover option.

, +1, This seems to be a duplicate of HADOOP-9235., Sorry, I had missed HADOOP-9235.  Thank you for pointing it out.

I think the patch shown here on HADOOP-9249 is preferable, because the <skip> declaration skips all Clover processing for the sub-module.  If we ever change the internal code structure of hadoop-maven-plugins (i.e. add code outside of org/apache/hadoop/maven/plugin), then we won't need to remember to update the <exclude> filter in the top-level pom.xml.  Also, if we ever decide we'd rather deploy hadoop-maven-plugins as a separate project instead of a sub-module of hadoop-common, then we won't need to remember to clean up the top-level pom.xml.

Ivan, what do you think?
, Chris, yes, I absolutely agree with you. This fix is much better., +! for the patch. I verified that this patch indeed fixes the problem., Committed to trunk.
