[The attached patch uses JUnit {{assumeTrue}} to skip running the test on Windows.  Otherwise, the rest of the test suite runs successfully on Windows., This patch can commit to trunk and then merge to branch-trunk-win., +1 I like this trick, +1 for turning off the test not relevant to windows., I committed the patch to trunk. I will be picked up by branch-trunk-win when I merge trunk to that branch.

Thank you Chris., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3113 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3113/])
