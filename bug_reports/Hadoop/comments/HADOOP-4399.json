[building on hadoop-4397, I did the following:

1. protect dfs_read accesses to the read buffer with a critical section based on a per file handle mutex.
2. open inits the per file handle mutex
3. release destroys the mutex

Also put a comment in dfs_getattr and a "soft" assertion that dfs->fs global filesystem handle is already set in dfs_init.

No new tests as this is a concurrency fix, but all the existing 10 tests pass.
