This message is automatically generated., The changes look fine to me.  I just don't totally understand why it was failing before.  Is it because there is a bug in FileSystem.moveFromLocalFile? If so do we need to fix it too?, Yes, I filed HADOOP-9161.  This patch fixes the shell and makes it behave more consistently with other shell commands., OK I am +1.  Even if HADOOP-9161 were in, it would not give the same detailed error messages on failure that this patch does, and it would not be as consistent with other FsShell commands.  I'll check it in., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3146 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3146/])
