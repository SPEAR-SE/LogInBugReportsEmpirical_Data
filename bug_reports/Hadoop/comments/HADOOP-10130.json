This message is automatically generated., It looks like you removed all the uses of {{TrackingFileInputStream}}, so you should remove that class.  Looks good aside from that., RawLocalFileSystem is a public class, I was not sure I can remove the class in it, it looks safe to do so. 
Attaching new patch., {{RawLocalFileSystem}} is a public class, but {{RawLocalFileSystem#TrackingFileInputStream}} was a package-private class.  It is ok to remove it.
