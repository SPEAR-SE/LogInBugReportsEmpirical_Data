[Here's a patch which detects this situation and throws a ConnectException.

The test case manufactures the problem by binding to an ephemeral port and then trying to connect to itself.

(fwiw, I actually did run into this issue while testing hbase under failure injection scenarios - a client tried to open RPC to the hbase server, but got itself instead, and was very unhappy), I was bit by this "feature" of TCP in my past life too. :), FWIW, I can't duplicate this on Solaris or Mac OS X, both of which are based upon BSD sockets.  So I'm guessing this is a bug in the Linux TCP/IP stack., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This is not a bug, but the usefulness of this feature is certainly questionable., Also, it seems somebody experienced this problem on freebsd too. http://osdir.com/ml/freebsd.devel.hackers/2002-05/msg00209.html, Hudson bot isn't commenting automatically anymore, but results here:
