[I suspect this might be something with Linux or Ubuntu in particular, since it works fine for me on OS X.  , Looks like parameters on the shebang line aren't portable.  That makes this a Yetus bug. :(, Opened YETUS-544.  [~ajisakaa], we should probably revert HADOOP-14671. :(, Thanks Allen for the report. Now I'm +1 for reverting HADOOP-14671., Reverted., Can this be resolved with the revert of HADOOP-14671?, Yes, I think so.  it's definitely a bug in Yetus 0.5.0.  So we'll revisit upgrading when 0.5.1 comes out.

I'll go ahead and close this.


Thanks [~ajisakaa] for the quick revert!]
