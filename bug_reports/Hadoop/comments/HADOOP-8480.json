[P.S. I'm working on a Maven plugin which will do the CMake / native tests stuff in a cleaner way.  However, in the meantime, this patch should at least spare people the annoyance of running native tests when -DskipTests is specified., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I've applied the patch and run *mvn clean test -DskipTests -Pnative* and HDFS native testcases still run. I've tested this in Ubuntu 10.4., After chatting with Colin offline I've tried changing the link /bin/sh from /bin/dash to /bin/bash and it works. Still we have to get this working in vanilla Ubuntu as we cannot assume we can tweak /bin/sh in the build machines., * don't use double equals sign (it only works on bash, not dash).  Single equals sign is actually the right thing to use here in both bash and dash., That's a pretty awful hack, but there's no better way AFAIK.  LGTM.  Patch .002 should work for all shells.

It does break for certain evil values, if the user specifies {{-DskipTests="foo bar"}} I think the shell expansion will throw an error and we will run the tests.  Which is, sort of, what the user asked for, so I think it's OK., +1, tested in ubuntu with the default sh->dash and it works as expected. regarding Andy's comment on -DskipTests="foo bar", not sure that will every happen, so I wouldn't worry about it., -1 overall.

, I tried to build native library for hadoop 2.3 in 64bit Centos, this issus happed again.
mvn package -Pdist,native -Dskiptests -Dtar always failed ., bq. mvn package -Pdist,native -Dskiptests -Dtar always failed .

What failed and how?, I ran 
mvn package -Pdist,native -Dskiptests -Dtar
for libhadoop.so file. That command failed when running some tests. I forgot which testcase.Finally I ran mvn compile instead, I have solved this problem already! Here is my solution: 
1. find the file : hadoop-hdfs-project/pom.xml
2. open the file,search "skip" , find the label , change the value "false" to "true".

If you have any problem , you can ask me : QQ international:940417022.]
