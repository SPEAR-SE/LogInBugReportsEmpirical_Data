[Here is a trivial patch to add the refresh to the tests that were missing it., +1 Looks good.  I'd suggest that maybe a {{@Before}} that calls {{ProxyUsers.refreshSuperUserGroupsConfiguration()}} to reset the config.  That way only tests that need to twiddle the proxy config will need to refresh, and it will guard against someone adding a new test and forgetting to explicitly refresh the config to reset it.  It's up to you., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
