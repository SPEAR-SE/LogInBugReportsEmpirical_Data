[This patch removes the non-determinism in testReplication by
1. waiting until all replicas are placed
2. allows chooseTarget to ignore the datanode load factor when placing replicas, I had ran TestReplication using the trunk plus this patch and the HADOOP-1063 patch for 50 iterations without any failure under both redhat & cygwin., I just committed this.  Thanks, Hairong., Do we really need a new option in hadoop-default.xml?  If this is only used by test code, then it probably does not need to be documented in hadoop-default.xml, as that will just confuse folks.  So we might remove that, no?]
