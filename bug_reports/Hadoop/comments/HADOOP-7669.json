This message is automatically generated., Hi Uma! I was getting 10 license missing errors :( I've uploaded a patch for that on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7671 (for all the files in the conf directory), Hi Ravi,
This issue is for trunk.  All other files are having the apache header in trunk.
You are looking at 23 branch. In 23 branch, apache header missed for many files.


Thanks,
