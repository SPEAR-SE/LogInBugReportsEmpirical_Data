[This is turning out to be harder than I expected - the problem being that only MapTask.TrackerRecordReader updates progress and in this case the Pipes application isn't looping through the Java RecordReader...

Possible solutions:
1. Add a 'setProgress' api to org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Reporter - this is quite dangerous since applications can potentially use this to throw the Scheduler off.
2. Use a dummy InputFormat/RecordReader along with a specialized Reporter which can communicate the progress to the RecordReader and hence the rest of the framework.

Given the dangers of the first approach, Owen/me agree we should go with the second for now. Thoughts?, Patch using the approach outlined above..., Updated patch, I had to change course mid-way to use the RecordReader directly to report progress..., Updated patch to reflect recent changes to trunk..., I changed the signatures on the RecordReader that is passed around to be RecordReader<FloatWritable,NullWritable> to avoid the compiler warnings., +1, I just committed this.
