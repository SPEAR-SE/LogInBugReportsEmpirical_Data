[The issue is fixed in 0.21 and trunk branches already. To fix it it's needed to add new method:

public void close() throws IOException {
      r.close();
      super.close();
    }

to TextRecordInputStream class, This issue has been fixed in 0.21 and beyond, and was only relevant for the 0.20.x branch.  Since the 0.20.x branches are not on the RoadMap anymore, and there are no plans to release another 0.20.x version, I suggest that this gets moved to WontFix., FsShell got reworked. Closing as Stale.]
