This message was automatically generated., Hello [~onpduo].  The patch looks good to me.  I also looked around for other bare calls to {{updateFolderLastModifiedTime}} that aren't guarded by the lease, and I didn't find any.  Hopefully that means these issues are completely fixed now.

bq. The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests. Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch. Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.

I understand that it would be extremely complex to try to cover this in a unit test.  Can you please describe any manual testing that you've done?  Thanks!, [~cnauroth]

I compiled the code and replaced the jar on an existing cluster, then I ran YCSB to ingest data for hours and rebooted some nodes, distributed log splitting worked fine., +1 for the patch.  I have committed this to trunk and branch-2.
