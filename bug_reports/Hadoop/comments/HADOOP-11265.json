This message is automatically generated., Hi [~cnauroth] - can you try and apply the patch with:

git apply -p0 {path}/HADOOP-11265-3.patch

That works for me - I can't get patch to work the way that I used to do it.
Maybe jenkins is using patch?, +1 for the patch.  I built a distro locally with the patch and confirmed that I can run the commands on Windows.  I'll commit this now.

Converting to CRLF has worked for me in the past, so I'm not sure what's wrong.  There have been some changes in the Jenkins automation, so I'll have to review that another time., I have committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.6.
