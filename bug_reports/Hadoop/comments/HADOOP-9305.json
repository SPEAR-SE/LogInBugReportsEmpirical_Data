[Here's a simple patch which addresses the issue. The only behavior changes are to conditionally load the AIX64LoginModule and the UsernamePrincipal classes if we're on a 64-bit AIX box, instead of the AIXLoginModule and AIXPrincipal classes. This patch also refactors the getOsPrincipalClass a little bit to reduce some code repetition.

No tests are included since to test this properly would require an AIX box. I tested this manually by running with both 32-bit and 64-bit AIX clients and confirming that it works as expected, both with and without Kerberos enabled. Without the patch only 32-bit clients will work. I also ensured there are no regressions by testing the Hadoop client with both IBM Java and Sun Java on Linux both with and without Kerberos enabled. Everything worked as expected., +1 pending jenkins. ATM, what about opening a JIRA to clean this spaghetti of conditionals replacing it with a MAP and a simple struct having the needed settings?, Thanks a lot for the review.
