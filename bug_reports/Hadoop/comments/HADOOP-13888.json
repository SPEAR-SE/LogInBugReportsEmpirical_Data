[I am sorry but this doesn't look like a hadoop issue at all. Please specify correct dependency information in your application pom file., Actually I suspect it's been caused by HADOOP-10105, which is an attempt to purge all httpclient dependencies.

[~gehaijiang]: we have cut out {{httpclient}} dependencies from all our code, moving on to {{httpcore}}. This is a good thing. It's better, its maintained, and its generally not hard to move.

You should really move to it yourself. Short term, add a dependency on the it yourself. This is the version in Hadoop 2.8:

{code}
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
        <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
        <version>4.5.2</version>
      </dependency>
{code}, Closing as a wontfix. We are trying to update all our dependencies and trim out stuff which we can, especially the stuff which is obsolete and unmaintained. This is for security reasons, as well as to avoid dictating what people have to have on their classpath]
