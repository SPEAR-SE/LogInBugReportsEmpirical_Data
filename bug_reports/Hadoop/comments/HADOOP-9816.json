[Daryn, should we release new rc for 2.1.0-beta, given the release voting is still in progress?, It's a logic ordering issue.  The server is setting useWrap as soon as the sasl server is complete, but before it sent the last response so the last response got encrypted.  The RPC client needs that response for its sasl client to complete and begin decrypting.

All the SASL RPC are now run with each of the QOP settings and verified.

(I had to worm some tracking of the actual negotiated QOP into the connectionId to provide adequate test coverage.  I tried to implement cleaner setting of the QOP but bizarre test issues made me give up), [~sureshms]Yes, and I've communicated with Arun.  This is a major regression of functionality, luckily with a simple fix., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
