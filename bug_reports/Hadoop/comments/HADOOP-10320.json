[Please excuse my ignorance, but I can't seem to cope with jira. I tried to upload a patch for this issue, but I was unable to do so., Hi, [~René Nyffenegger].  You can attach your patch file by clicking the More button at the top and then clicking Attach Files.  That will take you to another dialog where you can select the file to upload.  After that, you can click the Submit Patch button.  This will trigger trigger an automatic run on our Jenkins continuous integration servers to download your patch, apply it to a working copy of the current trunk, and then build and run tests.

If you don't the buttons I mentioned at the top yet, then we might need a jira admin to flag you as a contributor.  I'm working on getting that done for your account., Here's the patch, finally., Thanks for the directions. I was now able to upload the patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

, Patch to branch-2 actually reintroduced the problem, as branch-2 lacked the opening {{<ul>}}, so leaving an invalid javadoc; see HADOOP-11449.
