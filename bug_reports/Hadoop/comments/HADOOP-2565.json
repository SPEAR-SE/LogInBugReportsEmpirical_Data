[2565_20080424.patch: remove DfsPath, A few comments:
- FileStatus should remain immutable, I think.  If DFS wants to ensure that the FileStatus instances that it generates always have a  fully-qualified Path, then it should construct them with a fully-qualified Path, no?
- Until HADOOP-3095 is fixed, this will make mapreduce *slow*.  Should we make this depend on HADOOP-3095?, - Regrading to FileStatus,
-* I am not sure whether Path is required to be fully-qualified but I am afraid there are user codes depending on it.
-* Strictly speaking, FileStatus is currently mutable and it is impossible to make it immutable since it extends Writable.  We cannot prevent the readFields method changing the content of the object.   I will update the patch to keep the original code if it is desire.

- Linked it to HADOOP-3095, 2565_20080604.patch: HADOOP-3095 just has been committed.  This patch removes DfsPath and keeps creating fully-qualified Path., This looks good.

Can you please rename 'makeQualifiedPath4FileStatus' to just be 'makeQualified' or perhaps 'qualifyPath'?
