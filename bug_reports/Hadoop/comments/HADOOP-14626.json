[Hello saurab, thanks for filing the jira.
Would you like to also post a stacktrace or elaborate your bug report?, Also, look at your classpath: the signature of that method changed between 2.7 and 2.8...if there's a mismatch between classes I'd expect to see this.

If its your own code (or someone else's) calling the method, and signature is breaking it, well, nominally they shouldn't be using some internal code. But we can see what can be done to mitigate the problem in 2.8.x+ releases,, This error arose due to jar file incompatibility. I had hadoop-2.8.0 but hadoop-hdfs-client-2.8.0 and hadoop-hdfs-2.6.0 were trying to call the same method . It was resolved after I deleted hadoop-hdfs-2.6.0.
If anyone else ran into same problem, make sure you have compatible jars]
