[HDFS-6949 was filed to track the effort of adding NFSACL protocol support. We can use this JIRA to track the effort of the change in COMMON., This Jira brings up two separate issues:
# Accessing HDFS files via NFS does not respect existing ACLs. If so this needs to be fixed since we'd expect file access via NFS to respect both HDFS unix-style permissions and ACLs.
# HDFS ACLs are not exposed when listing files/directories via NFS. HDFS-6949 as [~brandonli] mentioned., https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3530#section-5.11

NFS v4 defines ACL explicitly in RFC 3530.]
