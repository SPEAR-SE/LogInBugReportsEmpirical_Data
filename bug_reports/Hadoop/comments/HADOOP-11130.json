[The code looks like this:

{code}
  /** Shell commands to get users and groups */
  static final String LINUX_GET_ALL_USERS_CMD = "getent passwd | cut -d: -f1,3";
  static final String LINUX_GET_ALL_GROUPS_CMD = "getent group | cut -d: -f1,3";
  static final String MAC_GET_ALL_USERS_CMD = "dscl . -list /Users UniqueID";
  static final String MAC_GET_ALL_GROUPS_CMD = "dscl . -list /Groups PrimaryGroupID";
...
    if (OS.startsWith("Linux")) {
      updateMapInternal(uMap, "user", LINUX_GET_ALL_USERS_CMD, ":",
          staticMapping.uidMapping);
      updateMapInternal(gMap, "group", LINUX_GET_ALL_GROUPS_CMD, ":",
          staticMapping.gidMapping);
    } else {
      // Mac
      updateMapInternal(uMap, "user", MAC_GET_ALL_USERS_CMD, "\\s+",
          staticMapping.uidMapping);
      updateMapInternal(gMap, "group", MAC_GET_ALL_GROUPS_CMD, "\\s+",
          staticMapping.gidMapping);
    }
{code}

dscl is *only* supported on OS X. getent is supported on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, ... Ideally, 'LINUX_GET_ALL_USERS_CMD' would get renamed to something less Linux specific, we'd check to see if the OS is Mac, etc. to be much more compatible with other OSes., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me. But as Allen suggested, we may also want to rename "LINUX_GET_ALL_USERS_CMD" to a less Linux specific name (maybe just remove the "LINUX_" prefix). 

Other than this +1., Thank you, Jing, for the review.
