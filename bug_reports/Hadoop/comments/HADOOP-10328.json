This message is automatically generated., Hi, Haohui.  This patch looks good.  Just 2 minor things:
# The {{br.close()}} and {{fr.close()}} could instead use {{IOUtils#cleanup}} to save a line of code and guard against {{IOException}} during closing.
# {{genFile}} could fail to close the file, because the close isn't in a finally block.  This isn't directly related to your patch though.  The code was always this way.  If you prefer, we could queue up a separate issue to address that., Thanks Chris for the review. The v1 patch addresses the comments from Chris., {{genFile}}: I was thinking that the while loop with the write calls ought to go inside a try block, and then the close ought to go inside a finally block.  Right now, an exception from one of the write calls would cause us to skip closing the file.  (Sorry if my earlier comment was unclear about this.), The v2 patch address the comments., +1 for the patch, pending Jenkins run on v2.  Thank you for addressing the feedback., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
