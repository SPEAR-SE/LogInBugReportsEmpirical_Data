[This patch reduces the time taken to restart MiniDFSCluster. A new method waitActive() blocks the calling thread till all the datanodes have checked in with the namenode., Review comments from Milind:

Dhruba,

Looks good. There are a few whitespace-only changes. Plus, the growing number of constructors for MiniDFSCluster concerns me. Maybe the right thing to do is to have a single constructor, and change other tests to specify defaults.

I am submitting the patch because I would like to attack the case of having multiple constructors for MiniDFSCluster as a seperate issue., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12351980/FastTestCheckpoint2.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/hadoop/trunk/511100. Results are at http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch, I just committed this.  Thanks, Dhruba!]
