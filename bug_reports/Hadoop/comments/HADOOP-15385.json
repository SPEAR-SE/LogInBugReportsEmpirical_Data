Cc [~Sammi]., Added blocker for 2.9.1 also. Please remove if you feel its not a blocker.

 , Hi [~shahrs87], thanks for ping me. Are you going on work on this JIRA?  I fully agree that we should better resolve the issue before the release. And on the other hand, there are some customers who are waiting eagerly to try the enhanced features in 2.9.  So If we can resolve the issue in a shot time window, that would be great.  Otherwise, I might consider leave it to next release. Your thoughts?, {quote} Are you going on work on this JIRA?

Hi Sammi, I am _not_ planning to work on this soon. I am occupied with some other stuff.
Maybe we can ping who broke/introduced these failures and request them to take a look ?
These failures are not seen in trunk or branch-3.1. Haven't checked branch-3.0.

bq.   Otherwise, I might consider leave it to next release. Your thoughts?
Since the junits are failing, I think there is a hidden bug somewhere and distcp is too important tool to ignore the failures. If there is a bug, then it can result in data loss/corruption.

Would like to hear from other community members viewpoints.
, Thanks for reporting it, [~shahrs87], and thanks for working on the release of 2.9.1, [~Sammi].

I looked into this issue a little. Seems MAPREDUCE-6909 broke the tests. They succeeded with {{9f9d554edfd83cbd2249c780124a75feebc52ef3}} and failed with {{71f49406f291038ef5772f216001c9e5abb14c8d in branch-2.8}}.

I'd like to ping [~jlowe] and [~ajisakaa]., Thanks for the analysis, [~tasanuma0829]!

I took a quick look at this, and the failures are an unfortunate collision between the test directory and the staging directory.  Both of these end up using 'target/tmp' as a directory, so the staging directory used during the launch of the distcp job ends up showing up in the test directory and confuses the test when it checks how many files are in its test directory.  I can put up a patch shortly., Here's a patch that uses a unique path for each test suite that won't collide with the hadoop.tmp.dir set during the unit test runs.  This is something we would need to do for parallel unit tests anyway., Thanks for the explanation of the cause and uploading the patch quickly, [~jlowe]!

+1 (non-binding) for the latest patch. I confirmed that the tests succeeded with it in branch-2.8., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~jlowe] for the patch and [~tasanuma0829] for the review.
+1 (binding).
There are 3 test failures in {{TestDistCpSystem}}.
Since this patch is just a test code change, I can't think this patch broke tests in {{TestDistCpSystem}}.
Jason, can you please verify that these failures are unrelated and if possible create a tracking jira.
I will commit this patch shortly., The failures are unrelated and pass for me locally on branch-2 with or without the patch applied.

The ASF warnings are for hs_err pid files, so apparently the JVM was crashing on the system at least twice during the tests.  That could easily explain why the test was failing with timeouts and other errors if the launched distcp didn't complete properly.  I'm not sure that's so much a problem with the test as it is with the setup of the Jenkins host.
, Thanks [~shahrs87] for reporting the issue and [~jlowe] for fixing. I also verified locally that the patch work well to resolve previous UT problems and Jenkins report UT failure cannot reproduce locally too. ASF warning are related to environment but not our code.
+1. [~shahrs87], would you like to do the honor?
btw, because this is only test problem but not serious production issue, downgrade this from blocker to critical., I have commit the patch to branch-2, branch-2.9 and branch-2.8. Thanks [~shahrs87] for reporting the issue and [~jlowe] for delivering the fix and [~Sammi] for comments! I haven't commit it in 2.9.1 branch as leave it upto [~Sammi]'s decision given RC0 is out., Thanks [~jlowe] for the quick fix and [~djp] for the commit. I'm glad the issue limits to the test case, doesn't impact the code.]
