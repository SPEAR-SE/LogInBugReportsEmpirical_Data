[001 patch, Hi [~jira.shegalov].  Do you think it makes sense to combine this with HADOOP-11778, which is upgrading the checkstyle version?  There is a patch attached there, but it's not ready to commit, pending some code review feedback I gave., Hi [~cnauroth], sure, I missed HADOOP-11778. I can add version upgrades to this patch. , Will checkstyle:checkstyle still work from individual modules?  HADOOP-11866 changes the checkstyle test-patch.sh support from global report to a per-module with (naive) filtering., (and yes, I'm currently working on making that filtering smarter) :), \\

This message was automatically generated., I hate to comment on this late. Can we please follow the multi-model example method documented by the checkstyle maven plugin. This will allow us to retain the one definition of checkstyle plugins as well as make it play nicely with eclipse.

http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/examples/multi-module-config.html
https://jgonian.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/maven-checkstyle-and-eclipse/, This effectively creates a reusable resource module (yes another module) we we can host resources that can be shared and depended on by checkstyle and eclipse. , In addition, can we consider updating the checkstyle version the maven checkstyle plugin uses. This will allow us to pick up all the bug fixes 
http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html

{code}
<checkstyle.version>6.6</checkstyle.version>
          <dependencies>
            <dependency>
              <groupId>com.puppycrawl.tools</groupId>
              <artifactId>checkstyle</artifactId>
              <version>${checkstyle.version}</version>
            </dependency>
          </dependencies>
{code}
, Thanks for all suggestions. Here is updated patch 002., From a high level I would still like to see the checkstyle.xml file under the hadoop-build-tools src/main/resources. Perhaps that explains the build failure below.

Couple of minor nits below.
can we remove azure maven-checkstyle-plugin definition?
{code}
      <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
          <configuration>
            <!-- To run with the default Sun ruleset, 
                 comment out the configLocation line -->
            <configLocation>src/config/checkstyle.xml</configLocation>
          </configuration>
          
      </plugin>
{code}

Looks like a few typos
{code:title=hadoop-build-tools/pom.xml}
  <name>Apache Hadoop Build Toolst</name>
{code}

This is the first reference to dependency of hadoop artifact by version. I think we are safe without this.
{code:title=pom.xml}
            <dependency>
              <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
              <artifactId>hadoop-build-tools</artifactId>
              <version>3.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            </dependency>
{code}

the mvn checkstyle:checkstyle goal fails to the checkstyle/checkstyle.xml file being in the incorrect location
{code:title=pom.xml}
          <configuration>
            <configLocation>checkstyle/checkstyle.xml</configLocation>
            <failOnViolation>false</failOnViolation>
            <format>xml</format>
            <format>html</format>
            <outputFile>${project.build.directory}/test/checkstyle-errors.xml</outputFile>
           </configuration>
{code}, Thanks for reviewing the patch, [~jeagles]!

bq. From a high level I would still like to see the checkstyle.xml file under the hadoop-build-tools src/main/resources. Perhaps that explains the build failure below.
That's already the case, see patch:
{code}
rename from hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/dev-support/checkstyle.xml
rename to hadoop-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml
{code}

bq. can we remove azure maven-checkstyle-plugin definition?
Meant to do this, but they have different rule sets.
{code}
[tw-mbp-gshegalov hadoop-common (HADOOP-11889)]$ diff -u ./hadoop-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml ./hadoop-tools/hadoop-azure/src/config/checkstyle.xml | diffstat

bq. the mvn checkstyle:checkstyle goal fails to the checkstyle/checkstyle.xml file being in the incorrect location

the location is correct. I forgot to remove {{RedundantThrows}} (not supported since 6.2) from azure's checkstyle.xml the same way I dropped it from the main one.

bq. Looks like a few typos
fixed

bq. This is the first reference to dependency of hadoop artifact by version. I think we are safe without this.

This message was automatically generated., I looked into this further. The maven-checkstyle-plugin was added to build/pluginManagement but not to build/plugins. This won't change anything for mvn clean install since checkstyle is tied to the mvn site goal. If you remove the maven-checkstyle-plugin definitions from azure and add a build plugin to the top level pom for maven-checkstyle-plugin and add back the version ${project.version}, then it will work. , 004 patch:
- adding project.version to build-toolls dependency
- adding reference to checkstyle plugin in build lifecycle

I would like not to deal with azure in this JIRA. This module uses a distinctly different checkstyle.xml. If that's no longer required we can discuss removing this override in a different JIRA.
, (!) The patch artifact directory has been removed! 
This is a fatal error for test-patch.sh.  Aborting. 
Jenkins (node H3) information at https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/6233/ may provide some hints., +1 pending hadoop qa. patch 004 is working sufficiently well for me. i have kicked the build since the error before seems spurious., Pretty much anything that touches hadoop-hdfs or is in the queue after hadoop-hdfs is subject to random failures like the above.  It's only going to get worse as hadoop-hdfs gets closer and closer to the Jenkins time limit., Agreed, I don't think there is much value in waiting for the build results on this patch., Thanks, [~jira.shegalov].
