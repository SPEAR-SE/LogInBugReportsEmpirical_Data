[Prevent the divide-by-zero exception by checking to see if the number of racks is zero. (No datanodes had checked in with the namenode)., We need to do more investigation on this issue.

The rack-aware patch enforces that each datanode belongs to a rack. So when the number of datanode is not zero, the number of racks should not be zero either., In my test case, there no datanodes registered with the namenode. It was a brand-new cluster. Hence the problem., Check to see that clustermap has no leaves and exit chooseTarget early., I've just committed this. Thanks Dhruba!]
