[5384_20090303.patch: use Block.GRANDFATHER_GENERATION_STAMP instead of 1., Would it be less error-prone to provide a constructor Block(blk-id, blk-size), which sets the default generation stamp to be Block.GRANDFATHER_GENERATION_STAMP?, Yes, it is good to add a new Block constructor.  I think we better to refactor the constructors of Block so that the invalid values can be detected.  How about we do it in a separated JIRA?, > How about we do it in a separated JIRA? 
Sounds good to me.

+1. The patch looks good to me., Marking this as a blocker so that simulated datanode could work with NameNode., NameNode can reject such blocks, but dieing does not seem correct., > NameNode can reject such blocks, but dieing does not seem correct.
Agree.  This is going to be fixed in HADOOP-5399.

Tested the patch manually.  It fixes the problem with DataNodeCluster.  Since the patch is simple, I won't add new unit tests., {noformat}
