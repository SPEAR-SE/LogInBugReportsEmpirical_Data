This message is automatically generated., +1 Ideally the get groups method itself would use a LinkedHashMap (like this test) to eliminate dups.  In practice, the user shouldn't have duplicate groups and it should "work" but conceptually it feels wrong to return dups.  It's up to you if you want to change it at the actual code level., Thanks for the suggestion [~daryn]. Attaching the patch for changing what the getGroups method returns. I ran the TestUserGroupInformation suite to verify the changes and it works., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
