[This'll be my fault, given HADOOP-14553 was mine., This is the format of a URI: "wasb://contract@steveloughran.blob.core.windows.net" . So (a) The field {{MOCK_WASB_URI}} appars correct and by inference, the assertion expected != actual needs to be fixed by working out what is wrong with the mock filesystem, rather than changing the assertion until the error goes away.

Anup, I'm not seeing this, neither are others. Which means there is probably something odd with your setup, JVM, something odd causing the problem. Which doesn't make it invalid, just means you are going to end up the person who has to try and track down the problem.

Why not sign up for an MSDN account and a real azure credential, so you can see if the real FS client works, rather than the mock? Otherwise, run the test in an IDE and follow its flow: how is the mock FS getting mixed up regarding deconstructing the URI?]
