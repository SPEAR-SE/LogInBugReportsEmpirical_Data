[There's a simple fix for this issue. I'm working from v 0.20.1. If you change bin/hadoop so that the "cygwin path translation" block contains the line

 JAVA=`cygpath -u "$JAVA"`

the spaces are removed from the path to the java executable and all invocations of bin/hadoop work without the "C:\Program: command not found" message. See patch below ...
