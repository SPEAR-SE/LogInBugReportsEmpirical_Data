[This patch makes the log directory absolute, so that they don't change in the child jvm., It would also be good to improve logging messages.
Printing the status of a failed task does not say a lot about why it failed. 
The real error message could have saved us a lot of time., I thought it was better to do that as another patch, HADOOP-1750., -1, build or testing failed
