[When a high frequency of requests are made to namenode, each resulting in a response of size greater than 1MB, a lot of garbage is created on the heap. This could result in tenured heap getting filled up very fast and trigger full GC. Full GC results in long stop the world pauses, affecting the applications using HDFS.

In one of the instances observed on the production cluster, an application repeatedly made list status calls, each with response sizes ranging from 3 to 5MB. This resulted in full GC, which could have been avoided by setting the max response size to 10MB.

More permanent solution for this problem is to ensure an operation that results in large response (listStatus) are broken in to multi-step smaller operations. This will be addressed in a separate jira. In the interim I propose adding a hidden config param that could be used for setting the max resp buffer size., Patch introduces new parameter "ipc.server.max.response.size" used for configuring the max response buffer size., +1 overall.

, In your setup, are you going to be setting ipc.server.max.response.size to 10MB?, bq. More permanent solution for this problem is to ensure an operation that results in large response (listStatus) are broken in to multi-step smaller operations. 

Hairong created HDFS-985., @dhruba - In your setup, are you going to be setting ipc.server.max.response.size to 10MB? 
depending on the production cluster response sizes and patterns, we may have to set the resp buffer size to 10MB. With 100 handlers, this is 1GB hit on the heap.]
