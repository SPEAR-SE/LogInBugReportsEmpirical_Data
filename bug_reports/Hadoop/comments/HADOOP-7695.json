[In that case can i put the same patch (HADOOP-7694) here?, bq. In that case can i put the same patch (HADOOP-7694) here?

Note my comment in HADOOP-7607 where I said:

The patch Uma supplied won't quite work as-is, since the {{proxy}} and {{invocationHandler}} objects can't be assumed to be non-null, but it's close.

I'd prefer to take care of this JIRA, if you don't mind, Uma., Sorry, i put the patch in HADOOP-7607, {quote}

{quote}
Are you ok with the same patch?
(or) Expecting some change?
Can you please clarify.


, bq. Are you ok with the same patch? (or) Expecting some change?

No, the same patch won't work. Note that the {{else}} clause where the log message is printed could be reached if the {{proxy}} or {{invocationHandler}} objects are {{null}}, so it's not safe to call {{.getClass()}} on the objects, as is done in your patch.

If you feel strongly, I don't mind reassigning this issue to you., Hi Aaron,
Thanks for the clarification, I got your point.

Is this below proposed change fine?
Since this is not positive flow, i just handled with conditional statements.
{code}
LOG.error("Could not get invocation handler " + invocationHandler == null ? invocationHandler
              : invocationHandler.getClass() + " for proxy " + proxy == null ? proxy
                  : proxy.getClass()
                      + ", or invocation handler is not closeable.");
{code}

Thanks
Uma, Here's a patch which addresses the issue.

Uma, there's not much reason to check that {{invocationHandler}} is null, since that object is likely not in fact a proxy object, so it should be safe to call {{toString()}} on it. I also prefer to explicitly include {{null}} in the string, instead of {{proxy}} which happens to be {{null}}, to make things more clear.

Does this look OK to you?, Make sense, Patch looks good to e.
+1, One small nit,
 i don't prefer printing invocation object reference numbers along with class names in logs. org.apache.hadoop.io.retry.RetryInvocationHandler@900e24. Here intention is just to print the class name of RetryInvocationHandler to know which handler it is. 
 This comment is not major, you can take decision. :-)

Thanks
Uma, Thanks for the review, Uma. I'd prefer to stick with {{toString()}} where possible, to allow for implementations of {{InvocationHandler}} to provide their own implementation of {{toString()}} that makes sense for them., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
