[Eclipse does not seem to complain for any of the patch's changes.

I do not see any @Override issues on trunk of all three projects right now. Please do not hesitate to re-open in case it is still an issue as per., I'm still having this problem come up occurring in 33 cases in hadoop-auth. I'm using Eclipse version 3.2.0. This is actually simple enough that I can create a patch for this if anyone would like.

I'm new here, so I apologize if this isn't the proper protocol for bringing something like this up.]
