The line points to same line TaskTracker , I'd been seeing an NPE in this code too, but assumed it was something I'd been doing, so was adding various checks based on the hypothesis that it was the directoryCleanupThread that was null -but that didn't make it go away. If either of localJobConf or defaultJobConf were null, I'd expect to see stack traces somewhere round here., Yes. Exception occurs if localJobConf is null, which is possible if cleanup happens before localization of the tip., I dont think this is critical BTW; the exception is caught and logged and everything continues., If the exception occurs during ReinitAction, the TaskTracker process dies., In SVN_HEAD it gets caught and logged:

       } catch (Throwable ie) {
          LOG.info("Error cleaning up task runner: " + 
                   StringUtils.stringifyException(ie));
        }, Thanks Steve, I didn't notice that.  Reinit on TT didn't happen because of HADOOP-5198 in my setup., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #763 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/763/])
    , Fixed as part of HADOOP-5233]
