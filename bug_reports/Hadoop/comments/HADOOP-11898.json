This message was automatically generated., [~aw], could you please let me know if the path is not named properly? It's a tiny patch and I manually apply it to branch-2 with no problem. Thanks!, bq. git revision 	branch-2 / f71c49c 

So it's switching to branch-2 according to that.  It's failing because branch-2's smart-apply-patch.sh doesn't support dry-run mode.  So when test-patch.sh is checking to see if the patch could be applied, it is actually getting applied.  Then later when test-patch.sh wants it applied for real, it's already applied and the patch application fails.

The fix here is update smart-apply-patch.sh., filed HADOOP-11925 to update it., Thank you, Allen. I will trigger the build again after HADOOP-11925 is resolved., Kicked off a rebuild., \\
