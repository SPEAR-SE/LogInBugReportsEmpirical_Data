[I am trying to link 'Analyze the Job' page to jobdetails.jsp and see that the jobTrackerID used is different. What would be the right way to initialize JobHistory so that it uses JobTracker's startTime., Attached patch changes this. No tests as this just changes initialization of variable. , Patch looks good to me., Thanks Amareshwari, making it PA, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
