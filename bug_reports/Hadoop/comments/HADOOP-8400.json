[arghh, the problem here is that hadoop-auth does not have Configuration in the classpath, thus we cannot check if security is enabled or not. I'm kind of inclined to revert HADOOP-8086.

thoughts., Perhaps just make the log-level debug instead of warn?, changing log from warn to debug, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
