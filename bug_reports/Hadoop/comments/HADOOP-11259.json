[something appears to have gone wrong with an rsync somewhere ... working with ASF  infra to recover

in the meantime go to : http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/, just wondering if the older versions (specifically 1.2.1) of hadoop are to be reinstated to the /Common folder or will they only be available via archive from now on?, oh, it's just i couldn't justify putting in the time to download them all from the archive and svn them up to the redist infra. If there really is pent-up demand we could do it. , yeah, that's fine with me. 

It was purely just we have infrastructure scripts set up which we were downloading older versions from mirrors using the common folder but its a simple change to move over to archive and just download from there instead when we are needing them., which versions do you depend on? I could put the core 1.03, 1.2.1, 1.3 ones up without too much effort. I draw the line at 0.17.0, it is only 1.2.1 that we require at present, and don't think that we will be moving any point soon. If the other ones aren't too much effort and there is time for it then I have no objections. ]
