[I don't know the internals of Hadoop, but it seems that this link 
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch9.en.html could be helpful to resolve the issue., For the sake of others having the same issue, I've been able to workaround the problem by running:

{noformat}sudo groupadd -r hadoop
sudo useradd --comment "Hadoop MapReduce" --shell /bin/bash -M -r --groups hadoop --home /var/lib/hadoop/mapred mapred
sudo useradd --comment "Hadoop HDFS" --shell /bin/bash -M -r --groups hadoop --home /var/lib/hadoop/hdfs hdfs{noformat} , In the preinst script file of the package. The command:

getent group hadoop 2>/dev/null >/dev/null || /usr/sbin/groupadd -g 123 -r hadoop

should be changed to:

getent group hadoop 2>/dev/null >/dev/null || /usr/sbin/addgroup -r hadoop, Closing as won't fix as we no longer distributed packaged software.]
