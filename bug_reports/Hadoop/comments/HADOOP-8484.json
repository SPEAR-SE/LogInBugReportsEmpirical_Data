[In general I would prefer to have it crash than to silently ignore an incorrect configuration. Even if a warning is printed, it will end up deep in some logs and probably go un-noticed., The only issue I have is that there are cases where it is helpful for it to crash to alarm for the incorrect configuration and there are cases where picking the default is just appropriate and will enhance the fault-tolerance. But I agree with you, the generalization here in Configuration may not be the right choice, and it is better to handle this on a case-by-case basis, so the code reading the property can decide to catch the exception if needed. I am closing this one.]
