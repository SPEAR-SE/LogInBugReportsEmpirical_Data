[Attaching patch. Kindly review.

Marking addDeprecated for String[] arguments as deprecated as there are 0 instances in the HDFS, Common and MR code that use this functionality and if other projects stop using it too, the resultant code could be a lot cleaner and simpler to understand., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Anupam,  Can you look into the increased javac warnings?, Dropping priority because in practice we are not using this feature., Thanks Bobby. While a plain diff in the patch's javac warnings and the turnk's javac warnings is filled with noise from differences just in the branch-2 vs. trunk code bases, I was able to narrow down and find that these are deprecation warnings arising from my adding the @Deprecated tag to addDeprecation(String, String[]) method. These mostly arise in the file hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/util/ConfigUtil.java.

, This patch seems to have caused two new Javadocs warnings to appear in the aftermath apparently:
