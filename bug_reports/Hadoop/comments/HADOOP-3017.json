[Mukund, minor point, but the error message is not *that* confusing, because we are specifying the name of the invalid directory, and it is not very hard for the user to correlate. We should probably fix it, but it is definitely not critical, IMHO. I am reducing the priority to minor. If you disagree, please comment., hod contrib was removed]
