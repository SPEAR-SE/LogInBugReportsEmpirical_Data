The Eclipse classpath warning happens for unmodified trunk too, and this UI change is too small to need tests, so I will commit the patch., I've committed this. Thanks Joydeep!

I can't mark the issue resolved though due to some issue with my JIRA permissions however., Matei,

I just changed your Jira permissions so you should be able to resolve this now. Also, you should update CHANGES.txt with an entry about the change. Thanks., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #756 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/756/])
