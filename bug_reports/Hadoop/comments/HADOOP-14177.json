[A locale isn't set in the Dockerfile so that users may set their own manually after running start-build-env.sh., Thanks for your reply.
How about setting a default locale in start-build-env.sh like this?
for many developers may not know how to set a working locale in ubuntu:trusty

start-build-env.sh:
docker build -t "hadoop-build-${user_id}"   - UserSpecificDocker
…
…
RUN locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANG='en_US.UTF-8' LANGUAGE='en_US:en' LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
UserSpecificDocker
, Developers who want any other locale may override the default locale manually as you said]
