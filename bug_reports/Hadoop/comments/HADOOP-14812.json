[I am unable to reproduce the problem and given the 2.7.3 build was checked by a number of community members before it was released I suspect others will not be able to either.  Is this really the vanilla 2.7.3 build or are there other changes on top of it?  Also it would be good to know the following:
- The git hash being used for the source to double-check we're on the same code base.
- Details from the cmake build logs.  The above error simply says cmake failed but has no details on how it failed.  Earlier in the maven log there should be some output from the cmake build about the error.
, I cannot reproduce it either. Tried both 2.7.3 and 2.7.4.  The real issue must be shown if you scroll up the build output to where cmake for pipes ran.  It's most likely due to an unsatisfied dependency. , Thank [~jlowe] and [~kihwal] you both, i find it will not produce now, very strange.
And if reproduce i will update the failed reason here.]
