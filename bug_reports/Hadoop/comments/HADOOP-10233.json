[Issue was seen when a errant job's 6k tasks issued listLocatedStatus on a 9k directory.  Each initial response for the 1k entries was ~1.2M.  The full response couldn't be sent immediately so the response queue held 6G+ of buffers.  The NN went repeatedly went into GC for up to 5m., Dup of HADOOP-8942?]
