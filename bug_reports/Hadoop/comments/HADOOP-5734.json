[The fix is clearly a minor modification of the placement logic's description. 
It doesn't affect any code but the documentation template and the JavaDoc of the ReplicationTargetChooser class, which is invisible anywhere but in the source code of the class.

However, as I'm a very new to the project I'd appreciate if someone can make a quick review of at the patch to the internal javadoc to make sure it is "accurate, sufficient for future maintainability".
