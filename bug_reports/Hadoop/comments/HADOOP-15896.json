[This is working correctly. Do not attempt to change this behavior., JWTRedirectAuthenticationHandler is not specific to proxy usecase it is merely an authentication handler that accepts a JWT based cookie., Let's unpack the description:  Other than guilt through association, kerberos service principal validation is irrelevant to JWT.  We need to be careful to not conflate service principal validation with proxy users.  These are completely independent concepts.  Authenticators authenticate, they do not implement the authorization of proxy users.

The only nugget of truth in the description is the host in a service principal isn't validated as the remote peer.

If it is not validated, then any knox service principal can work on any host.  Hadoop opt in for encoding hostname in Kerberos instance name to prevent replay attack.  If this validation is not checked, then Hadoop kerberos proposal to prevent replay attack would have been for nothing., You seriously need to google "kerberos replay attack"., [~daryn] It would be naive to think that every host with a krb5.conf file in the private vlan can be trusted.]
