[This looks like a misunderstanding, the stack trace came from HADOOP-1193 which is scheduled only for the 0.14.0 release (and the offending spurios throw/catch isn't going to be in the release). 

Since 0.13.0 doesn't have HADOOP-1193 I'm marking this as invalid, I strongly suspect this is one of my debug-patches floating around... *smile*, Speaking on behalf of Runping ^smile^. This exception is seen with 0.13 patched with the patch for 1193 (the one that is in the trunk). Maybe it has got something to do with config but worth investigating., Ok, after a discussion with Devaraj, this is a duplicate of HADOOP-1505.]
