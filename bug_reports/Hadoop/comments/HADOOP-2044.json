[I am marking this as a blocker for 0.15 unless proven otherwise., The patch fixes 2 important bugs:
# access and modification of FSNamesystem.sortedLeases should be synchronized (under a lock, which is different from the global FSNamesystem lock).
The bug was that startFileInternal() modified sortedLeases  with the global lock but without the leases lock.
# completeFile() or getAdditionalBlock() cannot rely on that they always deal with a file under construction, because if client fails to remove the lease, 
the file is automatically converted into a regular file, and modifications of such files are not allowed.

I have 2 comments, which do not address the correctness of the patch but rather intended to make code more understandable.
# instead of using the "instaceof INodeFileUnderConstruction" operator it is better to define an virtual method INode.isFileUnderConstruction().
# All modifications of the FSNamesystem.leases member are performed under the global FSNamesystem lock.
While modifications of FSNamesystem.sortedLeases  are done under the lock associated with the FSNamesystem.leases, which
is correct but unintuitive. I'd propose to replace all 
{code}synchronized (leases) {}
{code}
sections by
{code}synchronized (sortedLeases) {}
{code}, Incorporated Konstantin's suggestions., I would like the automatic testing from HadoopQA in parallel with getting another round of feedback from Konstantin. Hence marking this as patch available., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
