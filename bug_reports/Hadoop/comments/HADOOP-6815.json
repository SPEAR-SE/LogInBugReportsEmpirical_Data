This message is automatically generated., fixed javadoc warning, 1. javadoc annotation  @param cn   for method refreshSuperUserGroupsConfiguration(Configuration conf) may cause warning.
2. minor : It might be better to remove commented code //private static Configuration conf=null;
, addressed comments, +1, refreshUserToGroupsMappings() is also having the same client side configuration problem. Is there a separate ticket for this or is it being done in this issue itself?, bq. refreshUserToGroupsMappings() is also having the same client side configuration problem. Is there a separate ticket for this or is it being done in this issue itself? 
Yeah, although the conf is actually not used in the server (since the server already instantiated the Groups using the server's configuration), it is a good practice to not accept Configuration from clients for such commands... I'd propose that that issue is also addressed here..., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Do we need to increment the version number of RefreshUserMappingsProtocol.java?
+1 apart from that., no, it is newly introduced protocol., javadoc warning is related to "sun.security.krb5.PrincipalName is Sun proprietary API and may be removed in a future release" issue introduces elsewhere.
