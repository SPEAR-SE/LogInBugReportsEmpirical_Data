This message is automatically generated., Hey Bobby! I have no idea what patch is complaining about! 
bq. cp: cannot stat `/home/jenkins/buildSupport/lib/*': No such file or directory
Could it be because I am removing two files in hadoop-tools ?

The patch applies just fine. I have to svn rm TestUlimit.java and UlimitApp.java but it works :(, This patch is failing because it makes some modifications to the tools project as well.  I ran the tests myself and they pass so +1., Thanks Ravi, I just put this into trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2180 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2180/])
