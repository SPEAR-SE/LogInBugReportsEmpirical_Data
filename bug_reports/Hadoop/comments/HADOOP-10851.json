[The attached patch adds 3 test cases 
* a basic test for _NetgroupCache_
* test where a user is initially part of a group and later removed from that group.
* test where a group is initially added to cache, but later removed.

_NetgroupCache_ is fixed by clearing the cache properly.

Code is slightly refactored :
* uses {{addAll}} instead of looping through the set of entries.
* removed call to {{isCached}} inside {{add}} since the callers call {{isCached}} before calling {{add}}.
* two unused imports are removed., The _NetgroupCache_ is fixed by keeping state in only one _ConcurrentHashMap_ - {{userToNetgroupsMap}}.
{{add}} updates {{userToNetgroupsMap}} directly.

There is a slight performance loss when invoking {{isCached}} and {{{userToNetgroupsMap}}
But these are invoked only during {{refresh}} and adding a new group. These invocations should be rare compared to {{getNetgroups}} invocation., The above comment is intended for a another jira., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
