[fyi; http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-general/201209.mbox/browser is a thread talking about spinning these tools out. 

I can take a look at this to see if there is something easy to make the existing work.

One question though, when you say juno, do you mean eclipse 3.8 or 4.2? Look in the about if you aren't sure.
, Hey Adam,

Indeed, and I supported that move as well. Just needed to track these issues though, until a separate project floats (has a proposal been sent?).

Happy to help fix this. The Eclipse I tried it out on, is 3.8. Preferences parts are the ones that are failing, although the plugin loads fine otherwise (rendering it unusable to a certain extent)., The eclipse plugin is formally out.]
