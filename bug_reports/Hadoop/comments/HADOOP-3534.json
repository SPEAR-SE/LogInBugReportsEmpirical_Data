[In HADOOP-3509, I did the following change
{code}
-        try {
-          dir.close();
-        } catch (IOException ex) {
-          // do nothing
-        }
+        IOUtils.close(LOG, dir);
{code}
Before HADOOP-3509, it formally ignores the IOException.  I think it is good to log the exception, at least for debug.

How should we handle the exception in close?, 3534_20080613.patch: log in error level., no new tests added since it only changes a log message., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., HADOOP-3520 is taking care the failing TestDistributedUpgrade., I think it is better to separate the control flow in the preferred way.

{code}
try {
  ...
  f.close()
} catch (IOException ie) {
  IOUtils.cleanup(LOG, f);
}
