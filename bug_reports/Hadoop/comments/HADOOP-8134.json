[Interesting, I wasn't aware of this class.  I thought the NetUtils lookups were used everywhere.

BTW, with earlier changes I was dismayed to find that trailing dots were causing problems.  Notably kerberos host equivalence failures in my case.  The purpose of a trailing dot, other than the cited requirement for zone files, is tell a resolver *never* to walk the dns search path for the given host, ie. it is what is.  We may want to consider treating a trailing dot correctly., I investigated and think we can remove the reverse DNS lookup path entirely. Filed HADOOP-8156., This hasn't proven as a problem in late. Closing as stale.]
