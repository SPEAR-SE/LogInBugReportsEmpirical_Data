[The problem is that the Connection object was doing:

out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FilteredOutputStream(sock.getOutputStream()) { 
// definition of write(byte[], int offset, int length)
});

The problem is that the write definition called super.write(byte[], int, int), which did a loop calling write(byte) for each byte. So I changed the definition to call out.write(byte[], int,int), which will send the array in a single call., Thanks for catching this, Owen!  This can make a big performance difference!]
