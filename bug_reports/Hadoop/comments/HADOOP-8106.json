This message is automatically generated., Since there is Jira to fix the link in the rpm's HADOOP-8109 i am resolving this as invalid., HADOOP-8109 addresses this., @Suresh

We no longer have rpm scripts in trunk and branch-2. Also the patch in the rpm script fixes a different issue. What this tried to resolve is even in a tar ball layout the config dir that was expected was HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop where as in branch 1 it is HADOOP_HOME/conf]
