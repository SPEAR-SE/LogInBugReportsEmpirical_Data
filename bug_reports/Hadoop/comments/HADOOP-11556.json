[the partitioned bit of swift is something that is best described as "troublesome". It appears to violate some of the core semantics of a filesystem (size of a file in a directory listing == size of file in stat() == amount of data you can read), and things like rename get very confused.

Declaring swiftfs an object store with expensive renames via HADOOP-9565, along with your fs -put improvements could somewhat improve this situation. 

I believe that swift now supports >5GB files...adding support for that would also help
, [~stevel@apache.org] Thanks for confirming this.

It also appears to me that if a partitioned upload fails in the middle, a {{bar._COPYING_}} directory is there as side effect. So I am wondering whether should we describe it as a {{ObjectStore}} in HADOOP-9565, in which the {{PUT}} failure should have no side effect.

But for this particular issue, I have doubt about this line of the log:

{code}
15/02/06 21:00:49 DEBUG methods.EntityEnclosingMethod: Request body has not been specified
{code}

It looks more like a small bug to me. If it is the case, partitioned upload should not work at all?
