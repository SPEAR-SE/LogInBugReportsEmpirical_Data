[Though obviously we should fix this, I don't think it can actually cause any problems at the moment, since {{getUserToGroupsMappingService}} is only called in one place (UserGroupInformation.java:243) and that method is {{synchronized}}., This FindBugs warning is already fixed in trunk and a patch is available for 0.22.  See HADOOP-7046., Closing as duplicate of HADOOP-7046., Though HADOOP-7046 may address the findbugs warning, the underlying synchronization issue remains, and should be addressed. I think we should leave this open until it is., I see
{code}
  public static synchronized Groups getUserToGroupsMappingService(
{code}
Both in trunk and in 0.22 after HADOOP-7046. Does it solve the underlying synchronization issue?, Ah yes, I see my confusion. This bug was indeed addressed, though not by HADOOP-7046, but rather by HADOOP-6864.

Re-resolving as a duplicate.]
