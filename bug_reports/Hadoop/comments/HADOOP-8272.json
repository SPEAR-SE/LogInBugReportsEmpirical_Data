[This is not a bug - this is the expected behavior of getBytes(). Please refer to the javadoc:
{code}

  /**
   * Get the data backing the BytesWritable. Please use {@link #copyBytes()}
   * if you need the returned array to be precisely the length of the data.
   * @return The data is only valid between 0 and getLength() - 1.
   */
{code}, My bad, you're right.
I read all the source code of BytesWritable to understand what's happening and miss the getBytes() javadoc.

Sorry for that]
