[I believe it is caused by the fact that Kerberos needs a config file to merely instantiate its {{Config}} class. Very unfortunate., for previous version, not for commit, + 1 patch looks good. One small nit:
{noformat}
+        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Can't get Kerberos configuration",ke);
{noformat}
put a whitespace after comma. However, it might be considered like a formatting change from the previous state of the code. So, it's up to you., will do in trunk commit., in trunk done as part of HADOOP-6815.]
