[TestDFSIO is creating files in DATA_DIR, which is not output directory for the mapreduce job. If speculative execution is on for the test, two attempts of the task are trying to create same file. This test should have speculative execution off. , Suman, can you try running test again with speculative execution off by specifying configuration properties *mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution* and *mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution* as *false*., Tried this test with above mentioned configurations i.e. mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution and mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution as false but it is still failing., Its giving the same AlreadyBeingCreatedException.
