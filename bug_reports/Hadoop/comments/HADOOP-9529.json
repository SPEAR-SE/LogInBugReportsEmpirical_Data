[I noticed that mapred.system.dir and staging dir use hadoop.tmp.dir in the defaults thus it ends up being used for both local file system and hdfs., So the work-around would be to explicitly define mapred.system.dir and staging dir (what is the full name of the property?)

, This is default for staging in hadoop 1

<property>
  <name>mapreduce.jobtracker.staging.root.dir</name>
  <value>${hadoop.tmp.dir}/mapred/staging</value>
  <description>The root of the staging area for users' job files
  In practice, this should be the directory where users' home 
  directories are located (usually /user)
  </description>
</property>
, But that seems like a local folder. How does the temporary folder get missed in with the HDFS directories?

, It depends on how the paths are used in the code. In this case the config values are used to create a path on hdfs., [~rkevinburton]

Would you like to submit a patch for this?, I am not sure if I understand how to fix it.

, cool i will upload a patch., So if hadoop.tmp.dir is a local directory, what properties use this path to create an HDFS directory?

, The staging directory and system directory are both HDFS directories., Would you mind sending me a copy of the patch? I think it will take some time to get this patch to Cloudera for the CDH distro. 

Thank you.
