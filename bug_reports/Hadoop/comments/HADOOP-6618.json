[It seems that the bug is in FileSystem.GlobFilter.isJavaRegexSpecialChar(..), the ^ character is not included.

c6618_20100305.patch: added ^, Can we make use of Pattern.quote rather than hard coding the list of special chars?, How to use Pattern.quote exactly?  We cannot simply quote the entire filename., It would be a bigger change, but you could call Pattern.quote() on each character that wasn't already determined to have special significance in the other branches of the if.

(I'm fine with your patch, just seems inelegant to manually specify this list), > .. just seems inelegant to manually specify this list)
I totally agree but it is the current implementation, which is quite complicated.  Indeed, I am not sure whether there are still other special characters missing in the list., The ^ handling is definitely broken in the current code, so is the patch.

{code}
} else if (pCh == '^' && setOpen > 0) {
  // looks like ^ is skipped here?!
} else if (pCh == '-' && setOpen > 0) {
{code}

The correct fix, according to the POSIX.2 standard for glob: http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man7/glob.7.html, seems to be escaping the ^ and translating "[!" to "[^" to handle the set negation, which is missing right now.

I'll post a patch @ HADOOP-6787, > ... translating "[!" to "[^" to handle the set negation, which is missing right now.
The regular expression pattern with [^ is not missing.  Have you tried it?

{noformat}, @Nicholas, if you make ^ as part of the escape characters in your patch, the [^ functionality would be broken. 

BTW, glob pattern [! is defined by the POSIX standard, and [^ is actually undefined (see above link for details). We can support both though., Thanks Luke for fixing this in HADOOP-6787.]
