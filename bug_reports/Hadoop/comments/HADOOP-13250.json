[Been thinking about this myself too for a while and found this JIRA already exists.

Will get this in starting 2.8.0 and 3.0.0-alpha1 to get the visibility, marking against these versions.

The next step is to include jdiff checking in per-patch validation - will file a JIRA for that too., Sync with Vinod offline and push out from 2.8., Hi [~vinodkv], any plans to take this up, or should I bump it out of 3.0.0-alpha3?, Is the priority and target version of this JIRA still up-to-date?

[~rchiang] has been working on an API checking tool using JACC, that adds whitelisting and more. It might supercede JDiff and thus this JIRA too. We're planning on getting it in for beta1.

Ray, is there a tracking JIRA for this yet?, Not yet.  I've been busy enough with other Hadoop 3 stuff that I haven't gotten done with the tool refactor for Yetus (also no tracking JIRA for Yetus yet).  I was hoping to set things up when I get closer.

I did fix a command line argument in the Hadoop-trunk-JACC job about 3 months back so that it actually generates reports., I'm not sure what generates the dependency reports...]
