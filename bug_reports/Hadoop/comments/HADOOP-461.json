[Diff file after fix, Java 1.4 compatibility is not currently a priority for Hadoop.

Is there a platform you require where Java 1.5 is not available?, Mac OS X - version 10.3.9 

No java 1.5 is availabel for this platform., Is there a reason you can't upgrade your mac to 10.4 (as required for Java 1.5)?
, Hadoop is not targetting Java 1.4, but rather 1.5.  I've made this explicit in the build.xml.]
