[I checked the root cause. Building in IntelliJ worked before, Can you make IntelliJ run in debug mode and attach the logs?

It sounds like it's ignoring our configuration of the compiler plugin to change the default test-compile to ignore ITs., [~busbey], I attached the logs requested., This is due to the fact the 'hadoop-client-integration-tests' depend on the post shaded artifacts.
HADOOP-13999 introduces a 'noshade' profile that adds the dependencies. You just need to enable the profile in the Projects dropdown in IntelliJ Maven projects window (View > Tools Windows > Maven Projects). , Thank you, [~asuresh]. That helped., the profile is an okay work around, but having all IntelliJ users skip the tests for shading isn't a good long term solution.]
