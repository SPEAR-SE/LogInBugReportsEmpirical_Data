[The attached patch specifies maven-pdf-plugin version to be 1.2-SNAPSHOT.

I've verified that the pdf is generates for hadoop-distcp correctly while w3c.org is no longer contacted. It also seems all docs build fine.

Since this is not part of code generation, the risk is low., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The precommit tried to apply the patch from inside hadoop-common-project, so it didn't apply. smart-apply-patch.sh does not catch this case since the patch contains none of the three subproject directory names.  The patch actually applies fine., Is there any other module generating PDFs? Wouldn't make more sense to remove the PDF generation for now?, Thanks Alejandro! since DistCp is the only thing that uses maven-dpf-plugin, it will be better to disable the pdf generation temorarilly until we have a better way or v.1.2 is releaed., The new patch disables the pdf generation in DistCp. , -1 overall.
