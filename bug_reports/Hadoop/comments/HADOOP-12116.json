[In this patch I enforced $cygwin to be true to trigger cygwin related env settings. In this way if $cygwin is unset we will not trigger those branches. , +1 pending Jenkins., Let me elaborate a little bit more on this issue. We discovered this problem when testing rolling upgrades. When running a hadoop streaming job which runs "hdfs dfs -stat", if HADOOP_HOME is set to the old version of Hadoop but the current hdfs script is from the new version, we're losing all CLASSPATH and cannot find any classes. The reason for this is we did not set $cygwin in old scripts, so $cygwin remains unset when the new script evaluates "if $cygwin; then". Therefore, we'll set cygwin classpaths for all cases which will set classpath to empty (since we do not have cygwin). 

Given this fact, [~vinodkv], do you agree that we need to include this fix in 2.7.1? Thanks! , bq. if HADOOP_HOME is set to the old version of Hadoop but the current hdfs script is from the new version

Why are you ending up in this, IMO, completely broken state?  In other words, why are you running the new script on top of the old dir layout?  There's no guarantees that will work and it will *definitely* break if you do this from 2.x->3.x., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~aw], I agree with you that in the use case, mixing the new script with old home dir may be problematic. We're fixing them right now. Meanwhile, the problem exposed here is valid since we need to conservatively treat unset $cygwin as false and not triggering the branch? , +1 for the patch.  I also tested this on Windows to confirm that the Cygwin support still works for all of the main entry points.  I committed it to branch-2.

Just to reiterate Allen's earlier comment, there really is no general guarantee of compatibility if multiple versions of the script files get mixed arbitrarily in a single invocation.  It's fine to do a little defensive coding around this flag check, but it's just one example of the kind of thing that can go wrong.
