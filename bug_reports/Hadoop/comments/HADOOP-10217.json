[Anand, Cygwin is not supported.

Hadoop 2.0 has native support for Windows. There is no official Windows  package yet and some features are work in progress but the good news is that most of the functionality is in place and building Windows packages is easy.

I suggest looking at BUILDING.txt in the source distribution for instructions. If you run into any issues please send email to the mailing list. Resolving as 'Invalid'.
, Dear Mr. Arpit:

Many thanks for quick response. Appreciate it. At this time can you suggest, a right stable version that will work on Cygwin and Windows XP.  Reply truly appreciated.

, Anand - Cygwin has never been supported. I encourage you to try out the native support for Windows in Hadoop 2.2 and send any further questions to the hadoop user mailing list., I suggest just set HADOOP_HOME and JAVA_HOME using Windows path instead of cygwin path and run the commands from a Windows cmd shell instead of Windows shell. However, I have never tested the Hadoop on Windows XP; so I cannot guarantee it will work., HADOOP-11464, targeted to Apache Hadoop 2.7.0, reinstates support for launching Hadoop processes on Windows using Cygwin.]
