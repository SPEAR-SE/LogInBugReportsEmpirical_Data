[Hi,

This error is due to missing bswap opcode in Power. I checked primitives.h header file which has definition for bswap32 and bswap64 for other architectures. So, I added a definition for power. I have used macros "__builtin_bswap32()" and "__builtin_bswap64()" which are part of GCC builtin's.

I verified the assembly output of the above macros on my power machine and then went ahead and created a patch.

Please find patch added for resolving this issue!
