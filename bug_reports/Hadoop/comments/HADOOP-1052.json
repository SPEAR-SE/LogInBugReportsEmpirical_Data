[Can you please supply a standalone unit test that illustrates this, preferably using MiniMRCluster?  Thanks!, Hi doug,

I am not familiar with writing test cases, and there is not much
documentation for that in hadoop. Could you please guide me in this (point
me to some documentation, the current tests are more complicated than what I
need to achieve in this). I probably will assign more bugs, and so I might
need to write one myself.

Thanks,
Srikanth

I'm sure you can find documentation on JUnit, but the short of it is that you implement a class that extends JUnit's TestCase whose class name starts with "Test", and that is placed in the src/test tree.  Then you define methods within that class whose names begin with "test", and call JUnit's "assert" methods within these.  These will then be run by "ant test".

The TestMapRed.java is a standalone MapReduce-based test, as is TestFileSystem.java.  Even simpler, not MR tests are TestPath.java, etc.  Tests based on MiniMRCluster are TestMiniMRLocalFS.

I hope that helps., In release 0.12.2 I have seen the long standing map jobs getting killed consistently when they exceed the time.
