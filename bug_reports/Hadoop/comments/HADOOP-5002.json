As this patch makes the 2 tests pass, I guess this doesn't need extra testcases to be written.

Unit tests also passed on my local machine., This is due to HADOOP-4847, With HADOOP-4847, setting of work output path is moved to method,  initialize(), which is the first method called from run() of Map/Reduce Task, after starting communication thread.
In branch 0.19, ReduceTask.run() does instantiation of class Reducer in the beginning of the method. i.e. before initialize() call, which is not necessary.
The patch moves the instantiation of reducer down, where the reducer is actually called i.e. after shuffle and sort.
 , I just committed this. Thanks, Amareshwari!]
