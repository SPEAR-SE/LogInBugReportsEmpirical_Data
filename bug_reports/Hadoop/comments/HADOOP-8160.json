This message is automatically generated., +1, the patch looks good to me.

FYI, a significant effort has been done in branch-1-win to support HADOOP on Windows platform (without cygwin). You can check it out if you are interested., I am so sorry that, after double checking the patch, I got a couple more comments.
1. it would be nice to have a method to convert DOS path to CygWin path, and have a unit test to just test the conversion.
2. can you document in the code why using another thread to getLinkCount? , This is no more a problem as Windows support is implemented and hardlink count is found using winutils.exe.

Closing as not a problem.]
