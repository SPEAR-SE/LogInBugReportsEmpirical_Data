This message is automatically generated., As I mentioned in HADOOP-10660, TestNetUtils failure is not related to this JIRA., Null username with non-null password shouldn't be allowed, right ?, anonymous with password?, I think the original source code throws exception when user and password are both null.  , I guess that is what it means., The unit test failure is because of HADOOP-10664., trigger QA, \\

Mind updating the patch ?

Thanks, Sure, I will do it tonight. Thank you for remaindering me [~ted_yu]., Actually, if user specify user is "" and password is "", current code:
    Preconditions.checkState(userPasswdInfo.length > 1,
                             "Invalid username / password");

will report "Invalid username / password" because userPasswdInfo.length is 0;, If we only provide user but passwd is "" it will also report invalid since userPasswdInfo.length is 1, Hi [~tedyu@apache.org], looks like current Preconditions check can guarantee neighter user nor passwd to be "". But null is allowed. Do we still need to fix this?]
