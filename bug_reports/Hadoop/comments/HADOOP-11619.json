Please add a simple unit test to assert the new behavior. Please create a class such as {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.ftp.TestFTPFileSystem}}

Nits:
Leave an empty after the closing brace of getDefaultPort before the next method declaration.

In the javadoc comment use the class name {{FTPFileSystem}} instead of "FTPfile system"

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for updating the patch [~brahmareddy]! The logic in 004 looks good. Please fix these code style nits:
In {{fs.ftp.FTPFileSystem}} add a line break before
{code}
   @Override
   public void initialize(URI uri, Configuration conf) throws IOException { // get
{code}

In {{fs.ftp.TestFTPFileSystem}} use the 2-space indentation.

Per [HowToContribute wiki|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute]:
bq. Code must be formatted according to Sun's conventions, with one exception: Indent two spaces per level, not four., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
