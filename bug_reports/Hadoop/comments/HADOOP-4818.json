This message is automatically generated., Discussion with Owen and Arun, and we don't want to make this API public.  Fix job conf parameter only., Can you comment on why we don't want the API to be public?  Seems like that's very limiting..., Owen and Arun thinks it is too open for outside of hadoop community to inject code at this level., I committed this. Thanks, Eric]
