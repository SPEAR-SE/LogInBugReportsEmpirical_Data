[This issue looks really weird as I cleaned all findbugs warnings in HADOOP-11379. After looking into it, seems like the fix in HADOOP-10670 introduce the warning to the current location. In the findbugs log of HADOOP-10670, I can notice the following lines:
{code}

So apparently Jenkins ran findbugs against a wrong place on HADOOP-10670. I reran findbugs locally against hadoop-auth and now the warning is gone after this quick fix. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Cloning the bytes every time might be too expensive as {{getSecret()}} is called on every authentication request.  We can either disable the warnings or change the API to return a read-only {{ByteBuffer}}., Thanks [~wheat9] for the review comments! I rechecked our solution to the (now test only) StringSignerSecretProvider. Since we're exempting StringSignerSecretProvider for findbugs I'm doing the same thing with FileSignerSecretProvider. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
