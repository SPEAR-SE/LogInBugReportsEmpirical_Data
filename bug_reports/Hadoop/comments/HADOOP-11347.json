This message was automatically generated., Checkstyle issue is related to file length which is not under the scope of this JIRA., Thanks for looking at this, Varun.  I don't think we need to change the FileSystem base class.  This JIRA is about the local file system-- that's the FS that is having trouble with this, and that's the one that should change., Ok...Will make the necessary change., \\

bq.  private FsPermission umask = new FsPermission((short)0022);

I don't think this needs to have a default value, given that {{initialize}} should always be called first.  It can just be null until the FS is initialized.

{code}
@@ -296,12 +299,16 @@ private FSDataOutputStream create(Path f, boolean overwrite,
   
   protected OutputStream createOutputStream(Path f, boolean append) 
       throws IOException {
-    return createOutputStreamWithMode(f, append, null);
+    return createOutputStreamWithMode(f, append, FsPermission.getFileDefault());
   }
 
   protected OutputStream createOutputStreamWithMode(Path f, boolean append,
       FsPermission permission) throws IOException {

+    }
+    return new LocalFSFileOutputStream(
+        f, append, permission.applyUMask(umask));
   }
{code}
Rather than changing this, I would prefer to change the {{LocalFSFileOutputStream}} to apply the umask to the permission that was passed in.  It's a package-private constructor only used in this file, so we should be able to change it without compatibility issues.  That way we would have fewer pieces of code that needed to be dealing with umask.  Similarly with mkdir / mkOneDirWithMode., [~cmccabe], will make the necessary change., \\
