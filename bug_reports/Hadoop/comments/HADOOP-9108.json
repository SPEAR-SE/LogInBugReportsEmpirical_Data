[I found out the necessary changes have already been made in trunk and branch-2 by HDFS-3663 and HDFS-3765.  But we cannot simply pull these patches to branch-0.23 because HDFS-3765 contains more than just ExitUtil change.

I will use this jira to implement something equivalent for branch-0.23. Since this is for tests, a slight divergence should be of no concern., This is simplified version of what's in branch-2/trunk, where the {{terminateCalled}} has been replaced with exception record to show back trace.  This patch does not include that change.

I tested this with HDFS-4233., +1 looks good, Thanks Kihwal!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12555457/hadoop-9108.branch-0.23.patch
  against trunk revision .

This message is automatically generated., This patch only applies to branch-0.23, hence the jenkins failures.  I committed it only to branch-0.23 since trunk and branch-2 already have similar functionality., +1 for the patch., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #451 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/451/])
