[Eventually, the other build nodes will lose their cached copy.  

We're basically waiting for the upstream folks to fix their JDK package.  The ability to rebuild the Docker image is going to continue to degrade until we move away from Trusty as attention moves to Xenial.  I suppose the other option is to move to a CentOS build, but whatever., [~aw] when I ran HADOOP-14816 locally, I tested with {{--dockerfile}}, assuming test-patch used that as the base. It [looks|https://s.apache.org/7uHe] like Jenkins takes the default from Yetus (trusty), instead.

How do we get our tests running on Xenial, if that's the best way to fix this?, Jenkins is configured to use test-patch will use whatever Dockerfile is in that branch:

{code}
        --dockerfile=${WORKSPACE}/dev-support/docker/Dockerfile \
{code}

So branches that are still using Trusty will continue to pick up Trusty.  This way different branches can have different Dockerfiles.  This is especially handy for branches like the HDFS-8707 which have additional requirements. 

But newer runs are picking up Xenial:

e.g., https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/21769/consoleFull

FWIW, I just removed the --findbugs-home option on the existing jobs so that findbugs testing works again.

, Ah, OK. I must have been looking at an older build. Can we resolve this, then?, Yup, I think so.  Thanks., Committer of this patch, please set the *Fix Version/s* for this JIRA., Fixed byÂ HADOOP-14816.]
