[[~harisekhon] Can you please list the commands that you used to run distcp. I deeped into the code to find that maybe the name of  {{targetPath}} is {{"/"}}, so its parent is null,thus causing this problem.

*Update*

tmp does not set make AtomicWorkPath = null., i think we should add a default tmp workPath for distcp. [~yzhangal]

i files a new jira to HADOOP-14631  to state it obvsiously.]
