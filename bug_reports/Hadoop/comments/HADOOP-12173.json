[Currently, the code does:
{code}
  public void add(Node node) {
    if (node==null) return;
    int newDepth = NodeBase.locationToDepth(node.getNetworkLocation()) + 1;
    netlock.writeLock().lock();
    try {
      String oldTopoStr = this.toString();
      if( node instanceof InnerNode ) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
          "Not allow to add an inner node: "+NodeBase.getPath(node));
      }
      if ((depthOfAllLeaves != -1) && (depthOfAllLeaves != newDepth)) {
        LOG.error("Error: can't add leaf node " + NodeBase.getPath(node) +
            " at depth " + newDepth + " to topology:\n" + oldTopoStr);
        throw new InvalidTopologyException("Failed to add " + NodeBase.getPath(node) +
            ": You cannot have a rack and a non-rack node at the same " +
            "level of the network topology.");
      }
{code}

This implies doing a toString for every single addition., Patch to fix overcalling toString, \\

, The patch applies cleanly to branch-2.7. Attached a branch specific patch to trigger the nightly build., I just committed this to branch-2.7.
Looks like it was intended for 2.7.3 based on CHANGES.txt, but didn't make it there.]
