[This patch adds a new thread to the JobTracker that every three minutes checks the list of launched tasks that haven't been reported yet. If any of them are older than 10 minutes, they are marked as failed., Might it be cleaner to make the launchingTasks field private to ExpireLaunchingTasks, and have access to it through syncronized methods?  That would make it much easier to assure oneself that it is always accessed in a thread safe manner, as access would be more localized, no?, Ok, this patch pulls the set of launching tasks into the runnable object that checks for expired tasks., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
