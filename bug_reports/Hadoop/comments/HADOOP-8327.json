[Logalyzer and TestCopyFiles are two utilities that depend on distcp V1, and further use an incompatible constructor.   I suggest renaming the DistCp (v1) class to DistCPV1 for now, which will prevent random distcp failures from the above problem, and not affect those utilities that still depend on DistCpV1.    Further any external utilities that use this class will be flushed out, but the class will still be accessible (though now called DistCpV1).

DistCp (v2) will still remain (untouched) as DistCp., The attached patch renames the v1 DistCp class to DistCpV1.   Further, the utility dependencies that use it Logalyzer and TestCopyFiles are adjusted to use the renamed DistCpV1., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I don't seem to have any visibility as to why the above auto patching isn't succeeding.   Patch looks good to me. , Though the intent is for the fix is branch 0.23.2, I'm attaching a trunk patch now as it has been speculated that the auto patch is testing to trunk rather than 0.23.2 as the attached patch name specifies., -1 overall.
