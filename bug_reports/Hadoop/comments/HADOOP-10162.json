This message is automatically generated., It was supposed to fail as this change is only for branch 2, Thanks for looking at this, Mit.  Since this patch is for branch-2, it does not require a Jenkins run and we usually don't press "patch available."  I renamed this to "Fix symlink-related test failures in TestFileContextResolveAfs and TestStat in branch-2" since that's really what this patch is about (the disabling patch is already backported to these branches)  I have run the tests and verified that it fixes them as promised.  +1., Thanks Colin. I will keep this in mind from now on :-)]
