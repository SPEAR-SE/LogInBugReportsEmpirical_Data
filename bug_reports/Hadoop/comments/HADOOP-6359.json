[Hi [~szetszwo],

I could see {{numOfDatanodes == 0}} scenario has been taken care. Anything else needs to be taken care. Otw can we close this?

NetworkTopology.java
{code}
    if (numOfDatanodes == 0) {
      throw new InvalidTopologyException(
          "Failed to find datanode (scope=\"" + String.valueOf(scope) +
          "\" excludedScope=\"" + String.valueOf(excludedScope) + "\").");
    }
{code}, Rakesh, thanks for pointing it out.  This was fixed as a part of HDFS-5939., Resolving as "Duplicate".]
