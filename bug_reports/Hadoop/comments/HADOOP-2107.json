[The command to run the examples was:

{noformat}
$ hadoop jar build/hadoop-0.16.0-dev-examples.jar randomwriter -Dtest.randomwrite.bytes_per_map=1000000 /rw/in
{noformat}

I've attached the complete error file.
, I rolled back HADOOP-1622., This is due to a bug in the createJobJar method in JobClient not using the context classloader to resolve classes.  I have created a patch for this and am in final testing right now.  I have also brought the patch up to the current trunk level.  Patch should be posted within an hour., This issue has been resolved and a patch posted to HADOOP-1622.]
