[This feature will be really useful in clusters that have long-running JobTrackers. 

There are times when we have to restart the JT. HADOOP-3245 gives us the flexibility of restarting the JT anytime without losing any currently submitted jobs. But the entire story is complete only if new job-submissions do not error out when the JT is restarting. This JIRA will be immensely helpful if it can make the JobClient aware of JT restarts and not fail a new job submission., bq. This JIRA will be immensely helpful if it can make the JobClient aware of JT restarts and not fail a new job submission.
I think HADOOP-3618 is related to this. JobClient should keep on retrying until the JobTracker is ready. Its probably ok not to reveal that the JobTracker is _re-starting_ / _initializing_., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/]), HADOOP-5577 fixed this.]
