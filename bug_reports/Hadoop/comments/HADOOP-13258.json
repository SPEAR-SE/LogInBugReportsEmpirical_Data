[We can either disable whitespace check for L&N specifically, or fix it up. I don't see any harm fixing it, so here's a patch.
Fixed trailing whitespace by {{sed -i '' 's/[[:space:]]\{1,\}$//'}} on L&N., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, +1 (Non-binding). Thanks for fixing this.
, Hi [~xiaochen] and [~andrew.wang], I'm thinking it's straightforward to revert HADOOP-12893 from trunk and then committing a patch without trailing whitespaces, instead of committing the patch and backporting it to branch-2 and branch-2.8. What do you think?, Thanks [~ajisakaa] for the suggestion. I don't have a strong opinion on this, so will leave it for [~andrew.wang].

I think a single commit would make it easier for backporting, but maybe a little confusing from git history? It looks like you've already put up a patch for branch-2 on HADOOP-12893 (thanks again! :)), so maybe future backporting to 2.x.x can be just from branch-2., I'm okay with whatever is easiest. If reverting and re-committing is easiest, let's go with that. Thanks Akira., Thanks Andrew and Xiao. Reverting and re-commiting is easiest for me. It does not affect git history in branch-2.
In addition, I don't want to confuse developers. If we commit HADOOP-13258 to trunk only, developers might think it's weird that
* HADOOP-12893 broke HADOOP-13258
* HADOOP-12893 will be committed to branch-2, 2.8, 2.7, and 2.6
* HADOOP-13258 is not backported to all the branches, Reverted HADOOP-12893. Closing this., Sure, thanks Akira!]
