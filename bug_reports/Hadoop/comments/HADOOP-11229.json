This message is automatically generated., Better enclose the call to close() in a try / finally around the following code:
{code}
      exitCode = distCacheEmulator.setupGenerateDistCacheData(jsp);
      if (exitCode == 0) {
        // If there are files to be generated, run a MapReduce job to generate
        // these distributed cache files of all the simulated jobs of this trace.
        writeDistCacheData(conf);
{code}, I added try and finally method..

So JobStoryProducer object is always closed..

This message is automatically generated., [~skrho], thanks for the contribution. One suggestion: you can use o.a.h.i.IOUtils.cleanup. And you don't need to check if jsp is null or not., The patch can be simplified with the try-with-resources statement., [~skrho]:
