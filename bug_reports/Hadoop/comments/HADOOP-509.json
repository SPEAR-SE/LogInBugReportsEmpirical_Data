[Yes, the JobTracker should unpack the jar and construct a classpath similar to what is done in TaskRunner for child processes.  Ideally these would both use the same code to build the classpath.  A caching mechanism, like that in HADOOP-452, could be used to minimize DFS access., Yes and it seems there is some code located in the IsolationRunner class which creates a classloader provided a JobConf and a working directory., This was fixed by moving the input split generation to the client instead of the JobTracker.]
