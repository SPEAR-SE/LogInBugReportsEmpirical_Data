[hi [~ajisakaa], sorry to bother you.

I'll open a pull request to fix this typo later. Before that, I want to make sure: another 'specified' typo found in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/site/markdown/ArchivalStorage.md too. Should I fix it together in this patch or create another issue to fix? , GitHub user wenxinhe opened a pull request:
