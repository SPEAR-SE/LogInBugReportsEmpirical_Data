This message was automatically generated., Hi [~hex108], It is a good catch. Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods. That is why getVersion always get the version of hadoop common. 
 , Thanks [~zxu] for the review., This is a very minor and safe change.
+1 for the patch.  I'll commit this tomorrow if no one objects., Thanks [~hex108] for the contribution! Committed it to branch-2 and trunk., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8417 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8417/])
