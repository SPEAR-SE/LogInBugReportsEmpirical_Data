[This patch:
  1. Refactors the Task Tracker's offerService loop into a handful of routines
  2. Adds exception handlers inside the offerService loop.
  3. Moves the Phase enum into the TaskStatus class rather than free floating at the top of TaskStatus.java, which was harder to find.
  4. Adds generic arguments to some of the data structures in TaskTracker.
  5. Pulls the Running Job stuff introduced in caching into methods.
  6. Removes the old TaskTracker.getCallStacks, which used kill-all -QUIT java.
  7. Adds some new stack gathering code into ReflectionUtils.
  8. Add a short-circuit to enoughFreeSpace to handle the case where required size = 0.
  9. Add equals/hashCode to TaskTracker.TaskInProgress to make them hashable.
 10. Add a new switch to enable contention tracking in the TaskTracker (tasktracker.contention.tracking)., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
