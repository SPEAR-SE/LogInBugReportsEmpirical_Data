[Examples:

{code}, +1 on the proposal. I often have to search for the real error buried in this kind of messages. Suggest to allow command line to turn on and off of printing these messages, the default can be either on or off.

# HDFS-4629 proposes a fix (include xerces, switch to it). It's ready to go in and I was planning to do it to 2.6+ once hadoop 2.5 was out the way
# Oracle are planning to remove access to much of this in java 9. Hiding the warnings is going to hide current use of the proprietary code -and won't pick up uses for it., There are places where we have consciously chosen to use {{Unsafe}}, i.e. unmapping a memory-mapped file without needing to code a JNI wrapper over {{munmap}}.  It would be legitimate to suppress these.

Unfortunately, I don't believe there is any way to do so.  I once tried and failed to suppress the warnings on {{Unsafe}}.  According to this, it is by design that you cannot suppress these warnings.

bq. Sun does not support such API and the warning will not be suppressible.

Maybe we just need to close this as won't fix?]
