I would like to commit this to trunk and the 0.19 branch. Thanks Enis for reviewing this one., I just committed this. Thanks, Joydeep

This isn't a regression, so I don't think it belongs in 0.19., I agree that this is not a regression, but it is a major bug that basically renders MultiFileSplit useless to process files from different file systems. This is a major use case for us. Also, the fix is very low-risk. I would really like this to go into 0.19, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #659 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/659/])
    . Fix MultiFileSplit to get the FileSystem from the relevant
path rather than the JobClient. Contributed by Joydeep Sen Sarma.
, I am going to commit this one for 0.19 branch too., I committed this to 0.19. Thanks Joydeep!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #661 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/661/])
    Move  into the 0.19 release.
