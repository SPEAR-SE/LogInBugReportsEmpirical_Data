[We should probably consider making these errors fatal after fixing this too., I peeked at dependency:list and dependency:tree for hadoop-aliyun, and these two errors at least look like issues with the hadoop-tools-dist stitching.

* jasper-compiler is a test-scoped dependency, but it gets picked up by grep since it has the word "compile" in it.  The dep plugin can print a specific scope with the "includeScope" option, which seems better.
* json-lib is available as {{json-lib-2.4-jdk15.jar}}, the script misses this because it has multiple version components. The build-classpath goal prints things out as jar names, which is what we really want.

Other questions:

* should this be looking for "runtime" scoped dependencies rather than "compile"?
* all the modules except hadoop-pipes have this dependency plugin invocation. Maybe we can move the dep plugin invocation to a shared location, and special case hadoop-pipes.

Allen, are you planning to pick this one up? I'm not much of a bash scripter..., bq. jasper-compiler is a test-scoped dependency, but it gets picked up by grep since it has the word "compile" in it. The dep plugin can print a specific scope with the "includeScope" option, which seems better.

I had a lot of problems getting includeScope to work correctly for our build, so gave up on it.  We can change the grep to be grep -E compile$ and it should work as well.

bq. The build-classpath goal prints things out as jar names, which is what we really want.

It does, but without getting scoping to work, this doesn't work well.  

bq. should this be looking for "runtime" scoped dependencies rather than "compile"?

I seem to recall that there was something that broke with just the runtime listed. This is likely a pom issue, but I was doing all of them at once sooo...

bq. all the modules except hadoop-pipes have this dependency plugin invocation.

Not quite.  They call the file name extensions different things in order to build different types of shell profiles., I'm downgrading this from a Blocker since there's currently no assignee, and the two errors that I looked at were false positives. If there are functional issues, then we can re-upgrade the priority., FYI most of these appear to have been fixed. What remains is:
{code}
ERROR: hadoop-azure-datalake has missing dependencies: okhttp-2.4.0.jar
ERROR: hadoop-azure-datalake has missing dependencies: okio-1.4.0.jar
ERROR: hadoop-azure has missing dependencies: jetty-util-ajax-9.3.11.v20160721.jar
ERROR: hadoop-aliyun has missing dependencies: json-lib-jdk15.jar
{code}

The Azure dependencies are all in the HDFS directory:
{code}
./hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.0.0-beta1-SNAPSHOT/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/okhttp-2.4.0.jar
./hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.0.0-beta1-SNAPSHOT/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/okio-1.4.0.jar
/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.0.0-beta1-SNAPSHOT/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/jetty-util-ajax-9.3.11.v20160721.jar
{code}

The Aliyun dependency appears to be getting the 2.4 stripped from the version:

{code}
./hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.0.0-beta1-SNAPSHOT/share/hadoop/tools/lib/json-lib-2.4-jdk15.jar
{code}, I couldn't find much official documentation on the formatting of dependency:list's output so this is based on a few assumptions I don't 100% like, but it works well right now and I don't see better options.

There are 5 fields by default, 6 if there's a classifier. So I'm constructing those fields into the JAR name based on the number of fields. Including the classifier when there are 6 fields appears to fix both the json-lib issue as well as the jetty-util-ajax issue (though that one surprises me).

I'm also exiting in the event there are NOT 5 or 6 fields, and exiting if there are other errors. Still have to fix the okio and okhttp issues, though., So: hadoop-tool-dist is including these dependencies in its share/tools/lib directory, but dist-layout-stitching is not copying it over because the findfileindir function reports that 1 copy is already included (under hdfs). But then when we're checking, we're not looking under hdfs, so we report it as missing. One of these should change. I think my preference would be to have findfileindir not be looking in hdfs (at least not for tools - maybe not for some other things too), because anyone not using HDFS for storage shouldn't be pulling in other HDFS-specific things into their classpath. [~aw] - any thoughts on that?, Changing findfileindir in dist-layout-stitching to only omit copying files if they're under share/hadoop/common (rather than anywhere under share) fixes the problems, but has some other effects as well. It increases total tarball size by 4MB and adds the following files:

{code}
./hadoop-3.0.0-beta1-SNAPSHOT/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib: # dir didn't exist at all before

{code}

This seems like the correct solution to me, although it perhaps indicates a few other dependencies could be moved to common since they are in fact shared between multiple things apparently. The alternative is to not consider dependencies missing if they're provided by HDFS, but having tools share classpath with HDFS doesn't feel right. Although I'd expect they actually do that in practice now?, bq. anyone not using HDFS for storage shouldn't be pulling in other HDFS-specific things into their classpath. 

From a logistical stand point, this is correct.  However, as you observe:

bq. Although I'd expect they actually do that in practice now?

In practice?  

* 0.x-2.x always forces subproject directories into the classpath. Don't want them? Too bad.
* 3.x at least looks to see if these directories exist and allows function redefinition to cut them out.
* I don't know of a single distribution that *doesn't* include HDFS or YARN (yes, including MapR).  In fact, I'm not even sure it's possible to run Hadoop without HDFS given things like hdfs getconf have no equivalent in common.

It's pretty much a guarantee these jars are already in the classpath. It's worth pointing out that if they weren't, these tools likely wouldn't be working now. :)

IMO, if someone is going to go through the effort of ripping out HDFS, then changing the hadoop-tools dependency profile is the least of their concerns.  That said... we should probably at least add comments to the profile what the implied dependencies are though to make that easier.
, .000 patch:

I added an "extra_dir" parameter so you can specify a dependency. It's used to specify that MapReduce can rely on whatever is already in YARN's classpath as well as the common stuff. That cut down most of the duplicated JARs. What's left are the okio and okhttp JARs and just a couple of things that happen to also be in HDFS.

Very slight increase in bloat, but I feel this is the more correct solution. If anyone wants to argue that just accepting it anywhere under ./share and minimizing duplication is better, I'd be happy to create and test that patch too, but this is what I'm proposing for inclusion to resolve this issue., *shrugs*  None of the solutions are great, honestly.  Most of the gains that we got by doing the dedupe were quickly ate up by YARN's bloat anyway. :(

Code-wise:

1. using an array will be significantly faster. (Yes, getting rid of awk's and cut's is my new thing, now that I've just thrown in the towel on arrays.)

{code}
function depline_to_jarname
{
  declare depline="${*}"
  declare jarname
  declare -a fields

  IFS=':' read -ra fields <<< "${depline}"
  case "${#fields[@]}" in
    "5")
      # format: groupId:artifactId:type:version:scope
      jarname="${fields[1]}-${fields[3]}.jar"
      ;;
    "6")
      # format: groupId:artifactId:type:classifier:version:scope
      jarname="${fields[1]}-${fields[4]}-${fields[5]}.jar"
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Error: unrecognized number of fields in mvn dependency:list output"
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
  echo "${jarname}"
}
{code}

2.  Probably better to do bash-style math:

{code}
declare -i errors=0
...
((errors=errors+1))
{code}, Made the suggested changes, rebuilt and re-ran Yetus (although note that the order in the 6-field case is 1-4-3, not 1-4-5, as the dependency plugin lists the classifier before the version)., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
