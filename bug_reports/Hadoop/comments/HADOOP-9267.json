[Patch for {{hadoop}} and {{hdfs}}. Ran TestHDFSCLI and TestCLI successfully. No unit tests since this is kind of trivial, but I could wrangle it if desired., Hi, Andrew.  The changes look good.  Would you want to do the same thing for hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/bin/yarn?, Sure, new patch with same changes to the yarn script., +1

I applied the patch locally, built the distro, and ran namenode, datanode, resourcemanager, and nodemanager.  I tested the various ways to get help (--help, -help, -h) through the 3 different scripts.  I also tested a few other HDFS interactions and a MapReduce job.  Everything looked good.

Thank you!

This message is automatically generated., No tests because it's a pretty small change. I can add some if desired though, wouldn't want it to block a commit., +1, I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
