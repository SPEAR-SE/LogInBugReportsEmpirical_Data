[Attached patch:
# Handle single digit and two digit octal umasks
# Interprets them and applies them correctly as in the description., Renaming the patch with correct jira number., +1  Looks good to me., If this change goes through, we should update the documentation in FsShell.java (in common):
{noformat}      "\tMODE\tMode is same as mode used for chmod shell command.\n" +
      "\t\tOnly letters recognized are 'rwxXt'. E.g. +t,a+r,g-w,+rwx,o=r\n\n" +
      "\tOCTALMODE Mode specifed in 3 or 4 digits. If 4 digits, the first may\n" +
      "\tbe 1 or 0 to turn the sticky bit on or off, respectively.  Unlike " +
      "\tshell command, it is not possible to specify only part of the mode\n" +{noformat}
Eli - it's always good to consider the other components as well!, Currently UmaskParser does not parse sticky bit. So do you see any concern in allowing less than 3 digit umask?, On HDFS we do not support set-user-ID-on-execution-bit. On linux all the following is support for chmod:
7, 77, 777, 1777. Should we make chmod parser also consistent with this? I feel we should either change both creation umask and chmod umask or leave both of them as it is. Any thoughts?, Yep, we should fix it for both umask and permissions to be consistent. If so, this is a good change to make. ]
