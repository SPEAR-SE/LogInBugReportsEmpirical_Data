This message is automatically generated., Updated patch: Silly me, Ganglia has no long data type - and I mapped it to int32, which overflows quickly (especially when reporting bytes transferred!).

This now maps Long to float in Ganglia.  , Please close this issue; it is fixed by the patch for HADOOP-3422.]
