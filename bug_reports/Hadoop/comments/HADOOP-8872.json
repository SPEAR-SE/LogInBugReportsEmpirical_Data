[Attaching the patch.

A few notes on the patch:
 - Introduced NativeIO#Windows#getLengthFollowSymlink that provides native implementation for File length that also follows symbolic links. 
 - Introduced FileUtil API for extracting the file length that now has the same behavior w.r.t. symlinks on different platforms. API first tries to extract the file size using native API, and falls back to Shell if native library is not loaded. The fallback mechanism was introduced because we generally don't want downstream projects to worry about the Native hadoop library.

Just want to add this patch also add options to 'winutils ls' so that it can be used to get symlink target file size. Because we have both ways, i.e. native library API and 'winutils', to get the file length, there should be no regression for other projects that uses Hadoop., +1 for the patch. Committed it to branch-1-win. Thank you Ivan.]
