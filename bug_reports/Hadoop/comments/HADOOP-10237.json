This message is automatically generated., You should pass the permission in to the create call instead of the doing it as a second step. Otherwise, you have a race condition where the data is visible to outsiders until the chmod happens., Understood.
Thanks for the review.
I will more deeply investigate the additional parameters for the signature of create that take an FsPermissions object. Like progressable for instance. Can this be null? Block size? 
Javadocs are a bit lacking there.
, Switched to using the static method that takes an FsPermissions object., Changed to set permissions and create the file in one call per Owen's review., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
