[Hi, [~trtrmitya].  This one is another duplicate.  Take a look at HDFS-5365.  The bug is fixed in Hadoop 2.3.0 and later.  If you have to stick to version 2.2.0, then the patch on HDFS-5365 probably still would apply cleanly on top of the 2.2.0 codebase.  I hope this helps., > If you have to stick to version 2.2.0, then....

Isn't 2.2.0 is the stable branch of Hadoop-2 I should stick to?
What branch will become next -stable release? 2.4.X?, Hi, [~trtrmitya].  The 2.4.x releases are stable.  I do see that our documentation link for "Stable" still hyperlinks to 2.2.0, but that probably needs to be corrected to point to 2.4.0.]
