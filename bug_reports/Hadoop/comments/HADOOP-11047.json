[On my Mac, I build with:

{code}
mvn -Pdist -Psrc -Dtar -DskipTests -DskipTest -DskipITs  -Dtomcat.download.url=file:///Users/aw/Src/dl/apache-tomcat-6.0.36.tar.gz install
{code}

I get the following build error:

{code}
Warning: Could not find file hadoop/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-kms/target/tomcat.exp/apache-tomcat-6.0.41 to copy.
{code}

... which, of course, is true because I'm not giving it 6.0.41., Looks like it was always this way, but because I was using the same version, it worked.  ]
