[This also fixes HADOOP-4419 at the same time, Should also add: no unit tests, because it's just straightforward null checks., For Hadoop-0.20, we should think about ways of informing clients about the failures, instead of just returning silently, as Hemanth pointed out [here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4419?focusedCommentId=12639889#action_12639889]. This needs API changes and so the approach in the current patch is fine for 0.19.

Some comments about this patch.
 - You don't have a null check for JobID in setJobPriority.
 - The update you made for Changes.txt is not getting applied cleanly. I think you can leave that to be done by the committer of this patch.

This message is automatically generated., core test failure is due to something in DFS testFileAppend -- Can't see how it's related to this., I've just committed this. Thanks Aaron!
