[7 hours after leaving safemode there are  179 under-replicated blocks, with 14 single replications. I was successfully copying 4 critical files containing single-replicated blocks to local filesystem.

Question is: why can replication of a block from a datanode repeatedly fail although it is possible to copy it to local filesystem?, Christian, I guess this problem is due to DataNode.  The source codes you using does not include HADOOP-2713, which is an important patch for DataNode.  I suggest you to download the current trunk (either wait for HADOOP-2755 getting in or apply it manually) and then try it again., +1

HADOOP-2713 fixes this issue. This issue can be closed. Thanks.]
