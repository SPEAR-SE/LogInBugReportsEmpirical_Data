[Here is a patch which adds a new TaskLogAppender for log4j which is then used to send the task-child's system logs; also contains necessary enhancements to the the tasklog.jsp to view the stderr/stdout/system-logs simultaneously., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12352255/HADOOP-1000_20070228_1.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/hadoop/trunk/512944. Results are at http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch, I just committed this.  Thanks, Arun!]
