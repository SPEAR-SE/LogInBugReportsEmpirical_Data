[The patch fixed the problem. It also makes sure that addStoredBlock does not add a block to neededReplications if it was not there before., I just committed this.  Thanks, Hairong!, -1, because the patch command could not apply the latest attachment (http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12350582/priority.patch) as a patch to trunk revision r504664. Please note that this message is automatically generated and may represent a problem with the automation system and not the patch.]
