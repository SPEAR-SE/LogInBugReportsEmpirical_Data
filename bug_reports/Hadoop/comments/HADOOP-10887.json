This message is automatically generated., The failing test TestIPC is unrelated to the changes in the patch. It's being investigated/fixed in HADOOP-10888.

Other than that, the Hadoop QA run looks good.
, Nice work here Stephen, just a single nit:

- line longer than 80chars in ViewFs

+1 pending this though., Thanks, [~andrew.wang]!
