, https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/366, We don't want it at compile as then everyone downstream gets it, but they don't need it & trying to force it in creates its own problems

what if you mark it as provided?, Thanks your advices. I have changed to provided. , We also encountered this issue, which makes running/debugging unit tests quite annoying. Not sure why more people haven't reported this.

[~lqjack]: can you submit a patch for the fix? in the Hadoop world we use patch instead of pull request., Github user sunchao commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/366
  
    Just left some comment on the JIRA - can you submit a patch and attach to the JIRA? that's the standard process of contributing to Hadoop (rather than PR).
, Attached patch v000 on [~lqjack]'s behalf. Verified on my side that it works., Github user sunchao commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/366
  
    I've already attached the patch for you in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-15410. So it's fine now.
