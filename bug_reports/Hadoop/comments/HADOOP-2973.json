This message is automatically generated., The failed core tests are TestCrcCorruption and TestDatanodeDeath but the patch only changed TestLocalDFS.  Therefore, the failed tests are not related., HADOOP-2955 is taking care TestCrcCorruption with OutofMemory.

It seems that there is no JIRA issue for TestDatanodeDeath yet., I just committed this. Thanks Nicholas., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #426 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/426/])]
