[That log shows you set "path.style.access=false". Which is the default. I would have expected path style access to not work.

I am tempted to close this as invalid. However, I give you the opportunity to see if you can recreate the problem, then show that it hasn't yet been fixed on branch-2.8. If it is the case that it is still outstanding, we welcome a patch with tests.

Though path style was set as "false" and is the default, logs show that path style is still being attempted.

, swell, we're setting it in the builder on the AWS SDK. I'll leave it to you debug what's going on. Try with branch-2 and the updated AWS SDK, in case amazon have fixed the issue.]
