[Which implementations of equals and hashcode do you mean?, equals and hashcode implementation in the class  org.apache.hadoop.net.StandardSocketFactory, Sorry for the delay in replying and patch preparation.

We may need this change if we use our custom StandardSocketFactory

In the equals method if we change the implementation like 
return obj.getClass().getName().equals(this.getClass().getName());

It gives a findbug error.

Is it fine ? is there any way to get approval for the same., checking by classname is wrong because if you have >1 classloader you can have multiple classes with the name -even singleton classes.

Better to use this.getClass().equals(that.getClass())

This message is automatically generated., - please use spaces, not tabs for indentation
- should probably remove the comment "dummy hash code"
- in tests, please use assertEquals instead of assertTrue with an == condition. Same for the false assertion
- to illustrate the bug, does DummySocketFactory need to override anything at all? I think it could just be an empty subclass. Also, the attached javadoc doesn't represent what it does, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., - There are still hard tabs in this patch.
- there is no contract that hashCode() has to differ if two objects are unequal -- so your unit test there is not valid
- for the implementation of hashcode, might as well use getClass().hashCode() -- you don't need to get the class name
