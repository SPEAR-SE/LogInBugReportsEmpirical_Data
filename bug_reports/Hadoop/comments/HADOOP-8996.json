[It is complaining that your input directory has a conf directory under it.  I am confused about how

{code}
mkdir input
cp conf/*.xml input
{code}

could result in input/conf  My guess is that this is that you did something else with the input directory that is not listed here.  If that is the case please correct it and try again.  Also in general when you have problems with instillation etc it is a good idea to ask on the user mailing list first before filing a JIRA to be sure that it is an actual bug int he code or tutorial first.  If this turns out to be a bug in the tutorial feel free to reopen this jira.]
