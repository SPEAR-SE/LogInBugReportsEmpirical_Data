[Straight-forward patch..., -1, because 3 attempts failed to build and test the latest attachment http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12352803/HADOOP-1075_20070306_1.patch against trunk revision http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/hadoop/trunk/515311. Please note that this message is automatically generated and may represent a problem with the automation system and not the patch. Results are at http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch, This didn't seem to fix the patch process as expected.  I think we should hold off on this for now.  A more complete fix to the port rolling problems is needed.]
