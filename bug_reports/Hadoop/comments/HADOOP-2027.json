[Note that we also need Map/Reduce to use the new method so that it only does one call per a file to get block sizes. This would require that FileSplit have a new constructor that takes an array of locations rather than computing it on demand. The locations do NOT need to be serialized in the read/write fields methods. FileInputFormat should use a single call to getFileLocations rather than the current getSize, getBlockSize, and getFileCacheHints (down in FileSplit)., Thanks Owen. Attached patch includes
1. new API getFileBlockLocations which invokes getBlockLocations to return BlockLocation[]
2. Changes FileSplit to store host information and return when getLocations() is invoked 
3. Change FileInputFormat to one call of getFileBlockLocations and store host information in FileSplit using new constructor

I ran the unit test and do not see failures. Will test benchmark and report the timings. , I ran sort (twice) on 100 nodes on trunk+this patch. It took 28.4 and 27.3 minutes.

This message is automatically generated., You should deprecate the old FileSplit constructor and make it call the new one.

Set hosts to null in readFields., You should:
  1. Not use strings of '*' around your javadoc.
  2. Fill in the javadoc of public methods in BlockLocation.
  3. I'd prefer using String[] in BlockLocation, since the API uses String rather than Text.
  4. FileSystem.getFileBlockLocations should just pass the desired values into the constructor rather than setting them all, same for DFSClient
  5. The indentation in FileInputFormat should bring lines to the open of the paren
  6. Fix the calls to the now deprecated methods.

Thanks! I'm looking forward to this patch., Incorporating changes suggested by Owen, removed javac warnings which were due to deprecated calls. I could not get rid of 2 of them which were deprecated calls to Kosmos FileSystem. I am submitting this patch for QA run.

, Uploading new one with comments from dhruba., Dhurba suggested it would be good to have information about host:port which is already provided by namenode call.
So i have one more API getNames() which is similar to DatanodeID's getName, this returns hostname:port and getHosts() returns hostnames as earlier. He suggest this is useful when we consider running 2 datanodes on same node. Attached is the patch which address this., making this PA, -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., TestRackAwareTaskPlacement was failing because of my latest changes.
