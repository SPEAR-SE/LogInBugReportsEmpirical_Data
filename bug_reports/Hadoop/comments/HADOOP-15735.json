Thanks for a clarification. I will see what I can do with spark-master for updating hadoop-aws dependancy.

I did my homework and all s3a test suite seems to run with success. 
( I guess s3a test suite is located under hadoop-aws/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs )
( mvn test output is  https://gist.github.com/ruseel/26e98aea480f8c2138fa070c5f3930fc ) 

, thanks for doing this, especially the testing. Fix will be in 2.7.8

Note that spark rolled back from 2.7.7 to 2.7.6 because part of a security lockdown broke things...that will need to be addressed in the same release before they can move up]
