[This is a new version of the Derby release. HadoopQA won't work here because it is not a patch file. I am running tests myself and if all goes well, will check in this patch. This files goes into src/contrib/hive/lib/derby.jar
, I have been able to run all unit tests using this derby.jar., why does hive test against derby and not hdfs; that's a lot faster at the expense of some concurrency rules; good for testing though not always what you want in production., The hive metastore code talks SQL to store the data in the db. Apache Derby is packaged into the Hadoop distribution to serve as a simple easy-to-use and lightweight SQL store. In production, people might actually use mySQL or something else instead of Derby., Please mark it as a blocker for 0.19 if required, [exec]     +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.
[exec]     -1
[exec]     +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.
[exec]     +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings

I just committed this. Thanks Prasad!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #622 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/622/])
