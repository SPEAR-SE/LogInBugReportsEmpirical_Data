[The attached file fixed the problem., Can you use the same logic for readLine() as in HADOOP-474?  Ideally we could use the same implementation even.  But I don't like the 'new PushbackInputStream()'. mark() and reset() seem better, if the input stream supports them..., A PushbackInputStream seems overkill for what we are talking about. And performance is critical here.

There is a standard efficient code pattern that will consume:
'\r'
or 
'\n'
or 
\r\n

(for Mac, Unix, Windows respectively)
, In hadoop streaming all the input streams passed to readLine support mark and reset. So the attached new patch followed Doug's suggestion., I just committed this.  Thanks, Hairong!]
