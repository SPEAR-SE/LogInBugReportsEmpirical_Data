[It sounds like we should experiment with AsyncAppender with a large buffer size (10k messages?) and perhaps with blocking=false (drops messages when buffer is full, logging a count of dropped messages).  Have you tried this, Pete?, I am setting it up on a non-hadoop test server, just to ensure it operates the way I think it should.  You are right, if we went from 10 microseconds/call to something more like ~0.5-1 microsecond that should probably do it -- The 10 microseconds is measured from a call to LOG.info with a couple of strings and 2 ints to format (standalone program with idle disk and about a million calls). The 0.5 is the same call with info logging disabled and just guestimating the overhead of the call to AsyncAppender. Probably can have #s on asyncappender performance maybe early next week.
