[more flexible parsing for chukwa commands, Revised parser for chukwa commands -- remove the "exactly one space" requirement, remove a lot of flakey brittle code for computing offsets into strings., also do sensible parsing for FileTailingAdaptor args, allow trailing spaces in add commands, +1 the new interface is more forgiving in the command line input., I committed this. Thanks, Ari]
