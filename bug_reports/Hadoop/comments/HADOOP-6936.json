[another 404: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToConfigure has links to:

http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/hadoop-default.html, Not sure where went to or was replaced by: the closest existing page I could find was:

http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/core-default.html, Not sure where http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/hadoop-default.html went to or what it was replaced by. 

The closest existing page I could find was:

http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/core-default.html
, A possible replacement as a link target: 

http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToConfigure, Please feel free to go ahead replacing the links.  You may sign up a Wiki account and edit it directly., Fixed the FAQ links.

The HowToConfigure page is highly outdated. I do not know if it still serves a purpose beyond the tutorial (which explains how to too). It could be possibly set up to redirect to a current documentation.

But as Nicholas notes, this is all doable by anyone signed into the Wiki (free account signups, just gotta enter captchas). Filing a JIRA for this is not required., Just for a history lesson ref. here: There used to be hadoop-*.xml files once upon a time. Its now split over to core-*, hdfs-*, mapred-* files (* -> {site, default}).

Closing as the HowToConfigure link has also been updated by me. Although it needs more love in general (We should switch to confluenceâ€¦ its more encouraging)., Failed to add, link that has proper sublinks is: http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/cluster_setup.html#Configuration+Files]
