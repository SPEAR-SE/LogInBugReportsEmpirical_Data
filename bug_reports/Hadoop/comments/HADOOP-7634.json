[Patch attached., +1.

Note that the file can actually be owned by anyone, it just can't  be writable by anyone but root. The error message displayed is correct:

{noformat}
11/09/16 17:59:06 INFO mapred.TaskController: Invalid permissions or ownership on conf file /etc/hadoop/conf/taskcontroller.cfg
11/09/16 17:59:06 INFO mapred.TaskController: Must be owned by root and not writable by group or other
{noformat}

{noformat}
$ ls -l taskcontroller.cfg 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root atm 185 2011-09-16 17:53 taskcontroller.cfg
{noformat}, If the file can be owned by anyone should we update the error message to not indicate "Must be owned by root"?, Sorry, Eli - I should have said "group-owned by anyone." You are right that it must be owned by root.

The error message really is completely correct: "Must be owned by root and not writable by group or other.", Thanks atm. I've committed this., Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.1.0.]
