[Pre patch for review., Don't forget other OSes (like FreeBSD) which do not have libdl at all (dlopen() is in libc), See HADOOP-8811 for a similar bug that was fixed in the hadoop-common native build., Thanks for your kind reminding [~trtrmitya] & [~cnauroth].
A simple fix. At present i don't have a FreeBSD env, but libc is linked automatically, so the fix is expected work on FreeBSD (if it can before the fix). However, i'll build a FreeBSD env and check it., A fix to avoid link libdl in FreeBSD like OSes., Check passed on FreeBSD 10.1, SUSE 11.3 SP3, CentOS 7.1 and Ubuntu 14.04., On Solaris dlopen & friends are part of libc, no special treatment is required., +1 pending jenkins, \\
