[Better documentation for distcp was added in [0.18|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/core/branches/branch-0.18/docs/distcp.pdf?revision=667705&pathrev=667705], Although the description is there in distcp.pdf but this information is not being displayed by online help (on running "hadoop distcp -help" command)., While protocol compatibility is certainly relevant when using distcp, it's not part of its command-line usage, which \-\-help describes. I'm not sure which online help you refer to, but the same documentation will be posted once 0.18 is released., How about we display a link to distcp.pdf  in the distcp command help?, This will be distributed with the tarball (under docs) and posted on hadoop.apache.org under documentation. I guess we could refer the user to the docs distributed with Hadoop in the \-\-help message, but shouldn't this be sufficient? Since we're talking about 0.18, isn't it redundant? I'd worry that users of 0.17.x will, reasonably, expect to find distcp documentation where it only exists in >0.18 releases, but I think the situation in 0.18 is acceptable., I agree with Nicholas. We can provide link to pdf help file is fine as a solution to command line help. Currently command line help is not providing sufficient information to copy between different version of Hadoop.]
