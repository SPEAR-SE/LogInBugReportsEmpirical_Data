[Looking at the git logs the HADOOP-10926 patch went in to trunk at 01:22 GMT, the first patch application failure report from jenkins arrived at 01:32. Reverted that patch to see what happens. , after reverting HADOOP-10026 all seems well: patches are applying, [~stevel@apache.org], thanks for unblocking jenkins build!, Thanks for taking care of this, Steve, and sorry for the inconvenience., no worrries -it's why you need committers in different time zones. We european developers get to find problems with broken -SNAPSHOT artifacts before the US does too.]
