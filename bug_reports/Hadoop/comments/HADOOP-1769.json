[Doesn't look like its a problem anymore.

Here's a simple test to guarantee (there may already exist something like this, but I did not look)

{code}

  public void testStack() throws IOException, URISyntaxException {
    Configuration conf = new Configuration();
    String url = "/";
    URI uri = new URI(url);
    assertEquals(null, uri.getScheme());
    FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(uri, conf);
  }

{code}

Marking as 'Cannot Reproduce' (now).]
