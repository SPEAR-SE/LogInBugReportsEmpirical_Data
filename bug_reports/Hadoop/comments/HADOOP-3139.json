Just fyi, this is the warning message I was getting before the patch.

This message is automatically generated., 3139_20080403.patch:
In HADOOP-3003, I added consistency check in FileSystem.Cache.closeAll() to check whether the cache key is consistent with the stored fs (with the conf returned by fs.getConf()).  However, a conf can be shared by several FileSystem objects and some other object like JobTracker.  Therefore, the consistency check makes no sense since the conf will be modified from time to time.  I remove the consistency check in this patch.  Indeed, the conf shouldn't be shared between FileSystem.  We should fix it in another issue., +1 overall.

The important thing is that the deadlock problem is solved.
It turned out to be that the only way to get rid of the warning is to remove the verification itself.
The problem here is that people keep using configuration class as a container for passing
parameters between methods, which is a bad practice.
, 3139_20080403_0.16.patch:
0.16 needs a sleep() in the test.  Otherwise, it will fail in (a) Java 1.5.0_13 in Mac and (b) Java 1.5.0_08 in Linux.  It won't fail in Java 1.5.0_14 in Windows or Java 1.6 in any platform.  For the fail cases (a) and (b), the test won't fail if adding -Dtest.output=yes in ant.  It probably is a bug in Java 1.5 or JUnit., I just committed this. Thanks, Nicholas!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #451 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/451/])]
