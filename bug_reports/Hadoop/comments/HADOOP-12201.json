[Patch,LGTM +1 ( non-binding)., Thanks, Brahma.  createFileSystem generally happens only once and it seems to take a long time (about a second), so it seems like a great candidate for tracing.  Globber#glob also can be time-consuming so there is value in tracing it.  I've been looking at a lot of FsShell traces lately and this came out of that., +1, thanks Colin., +1

I like the pretty picture [~cmccabe], re-uploading same patch to get a jenkins run., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks, guys.

checkstyle issue is something we can't do anything about: ./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.java:1: File length is 3,412 lines (max allowed is 2,000).
