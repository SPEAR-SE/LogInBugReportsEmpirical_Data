[I checked the code. If a block is overreplicated, UnderReplicatedBlocks.add handles the situation well. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is impossible to be thrown. It seems that the only possibility that causes the exception is that the time-out block has zero copy., Dhruba, could you please check if this patch gets rid of the exception? Thanks., I cannot reproduce this problem on demand. So I am not able to test this conclusively. But your code change looks good.
We need this fix.
