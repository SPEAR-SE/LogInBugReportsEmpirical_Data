why didn't the HADOOP-8644 test results catch this? Added in a later patch that jenkins didn't run against or the primary job doesn't run the hadoop-auth tests (seems for former given jenkins reported "The patch passed unit tests in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-auth")?, @eli, I think it was a case of  'tucu' error, run the tests from the IDE and it looks I didn't force a recompile and it was pickup the previous compiled class.
