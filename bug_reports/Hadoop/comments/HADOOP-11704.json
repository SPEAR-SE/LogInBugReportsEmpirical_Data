[Hey [~adhoot], doesnt {{MachineList}} handle both hostname as well as IP addresses ? or am I missing something ? , Hi [~asuresh] the way MachineList support hostnames is try to convert the passed in ip Address into a hostname and check if its a configured host, and if that fails convert all the configured hostnames into an ip address and check if it matches the passed in ip address. That means you can configure hostnames in the config but the caller still has to pass in an ip address. , Aah.. got it.. thanx for the clarification.. Your patch will I guess solve the problem, but you think maybe we should raise a JIRA to fix {{MachineList}} too ? , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., I think the logic is sound, as it normalize the configured ipaddress/hostname/cidr to ipaddress and then expects ipaddress to be passed in. Otherwise supporting both hostname and ipaddress to be passed in can be challenging. I can add a warning if the input is not an ipaddress to catch existing bugs like this. , Attaching unit tests to validate fix, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
