[This is either:

a) permissions issue in /home/hadoop
b) misconfiguration in hdfs-site.xml

I've run namenode format in many many directories, including /home and not /home.

It should be noted that changing HADOOP_PREFIX has zero influence on where the NN fsimage gets created.

Closing as cannot reproduce., Agree - mea culpa -  configuration issue - indeed etc/hdfs-site.xml was incorrectly set. Fixing it solved the problem - thanks!]
