[Is this only in YARN or you are seeing this in HDFS UIs too?, We don't use HDFS (using parallel file system instead) so I haven't tested this with HDFS. Only Yarn., Hi guys, any update on this issue ? Thanks!, [~tatacalu] a workaround is to tick the Remote DNS box in your browser proxy settings when tunneling through. For example on Firefox this is under the last port entry box.

e.g. check the grab here: http://hod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/02_network_settings.png, [~ehiggs] thank you for the quick reply but now I realised that I might have misunderstood the bug contents. 

I am experiencing the following problem: 
If I set the yarn.nodemanager.webapp.address property one a node as HOST:PORT, in the GUI of the ResourceManager that node registered with that setting is ignored in the nodes list. Instead the yarn.nodemanager.webapp.address, the URL displayed in the Node HTTP Address column is {yarn.manager.hostname}:PORT

Example:
If yarn.nodemanager.webapp.address is set to mywebhost:1234 and yarn.manager.hostname is set to mynodehost, the node will appear as mynodehost:1234 in the web GUI.

Is this a known behavior ?

YARN Version I am using: 2.6.0-cdh5.5.0

Thank you in advance!]
