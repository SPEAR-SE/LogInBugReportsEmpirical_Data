[Possible resolutions:

* Reimplement in such a way that new API is not needed
* Create a default definition so that only a recompile is needed
* Mark this as acceptable, Implementations of custom decompressors can add the new method (but not mark it with @Override) and it will work in both 1 and 0.23, I think. Would that solve your issue?, Essentially, that will be the recommended action if we mark this behavior as acceptable.

It also seems that Decompressor is an interface, preventing option 2 of providing a default definition., @Tom's solution is an acceptable work around]
