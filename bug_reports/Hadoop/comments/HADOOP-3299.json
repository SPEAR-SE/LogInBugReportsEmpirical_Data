[ensure that compressionCodes is initialized in isSplittable before dereferencing it., ensure that compressionCodes is initialized in isSplittable before dereferencing it., The issue is with o.a.h.mapred.join.Parser. When it instantiates an InputFormat through ReflectionUtils::newInstance, it passes in a null JobConf so the InputFormat- if {{Configurable}} or {{JobConfigurable}}- remains uninitialized.

The test case includes a separate class, {{ConfigurableInputFormat}} because the Parser doesn't support inner classes (i.e. '$' is unexpected in its grammar)., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
