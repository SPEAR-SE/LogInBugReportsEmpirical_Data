This message is automatically generated., I think you meant {{Math.min}}.  Although I'd suggest maybe something like this to avoid spurious whitespace:
{code}
fmt.append((maxOwner > 0) ? "%-" + maxOwner + "s " : "%s");
{code}
, Ignore the -Math.min-. I'm tired., Hi Daryn, Your fix looks a bit cleaner than mine, thanks!
-Eugene, +1, built & tested with S3, Eugene, just noticed you did not update the patch to Daryn's suggestion. Would you mind uploading a new patch?, Eugene, I'm uploading a patch tweaking your patch to Daryn's comments. Hope this is OK with you.

I've tested with local/hdfs/s3 filesystem., +1 looks good to me, Thanks Eugene. Committed to trunk and branch-2., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2402 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2402/])
