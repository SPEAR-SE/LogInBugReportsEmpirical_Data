, Hello [~mahongbin].  Thank you for the patch.

I was thinking that it would be better to make {{GenericOptionsParser#buildGeneralOptions}} a {{synchronized}} method.  All of the usage of the non-thread-safe {{OptionBuilder}} class is inside that method.  By making that method {{synchronized}}, we'd fix the problem for all potential users of the {{GenericOptionsParser}} class, not just usage through {{ToolRunner}}.

Could you please take a look at our wiki page on how to contribute?

https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute

Specifically, there are some instructions in there about how to name patch file attachments so that they trigger our pre-commit testing., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, thanks [~cnauroth], I merely copied the code changes in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22462665/is-hadoops-toorunner-thread-safe without too much think. 

Just uploaded the modified version with correct name. thank you!, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, I thought you can even make {{buildGeneralOptions()}} non-static and remove the SupressWarnings annotation.

Oops. Next second I realized, you cannot make it non-static and synchronized since we want to block multiple access to static {{OptionsBuilder}}. So {{buildGeneralOptions()}} has to be static, otherwise whole purpose of this jira will not be served.

Current fix works. +1., thanks

any other thing I can do to merge to code into trunk?, Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.8.

Thanks [~honma] for the contribution.
Thanks [~cnauroth] for the suggestions and review., This just broke my never-gets-reviewed YARN-679 patch, where I'd allowed for services to be able to define their own options parser. Not your fault, just one of those details which arises when patches don't get reviewed in a timely manner. I'l have to fix my code there.

FWIW, I think we should jump to JCommander for future work: introspection+annotation based, much easier to work with., Looking at the code, I don't think this actually fixes the problem of concurrent access to {{OptionsBuilder}}...there are lots of uses of the class in the Hadoop codebase, and they are all synchronized off different things.

The way to do this safely would be to make them all {{synchronized(OptionsBuilder)}}, bq. Looking at the code, I don't think this actually fixes the problem of concurrent access to {{OptionsBuilder}}...there are lots of uses of the class in the Hadoop codebase, and they are all synchronized off different things.

That's correct.  The scope of this patch was limited to thread safety of {{GenericOptionsParser}}., OK. In YARN-679 I go {{synchronized(OptionsBuilder.class)}}; that is what should be done throughout the codebase. I'll file a JIRA, [~stevel@apache.org], I just realized my last comment was pretty terse and might have looked dismissive.  If so, I apologize.  It was good for us to get this small patch in, because it definitely addresses the one specific case of the bug that was reported.  However, I agree with you about fixing throughout the codebase.  I linked known instances of the bug to your HADOOP-13391 issue.  Thank you for filing that.]
