[It succeeds if -Dcompile.native=true is specified. On a related note, I found the rpm target for hdfs trunk fails if the native lib is not built. Do you think the packaging should work without the native lib/bin? Or is it just a matter of adding the missing dependency?, IMO the tarball and rpm builds should should not require the native build. , branch-0.20-security won't work without the native library. If we simply remove the dependency, we will end up allowing creation of nonfunctional package. So a solution can be removing this dependency AND adding a separate package target for the native stuff. Then it will be possible to build one (large) platform-independent package and multiple platform-specific packages for all supported platforms.

How so?  Maybe you mean security requires the native libs? , bq. How so? Maybe you mean security requires the native libs? 

Yes, you are right. But the branch and the releases off of it have dependency on the native libs. You can turn the security off, but that's a run-time option, not a build/packaging time one.  Also, the native lib requirement may go beyond the security feature in the future. , Right, there's a dependency but it's not required. Lots of people run releases w/o the native libs., moved target version to 1.2.0 upon publishing 1.1.1 RC., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2., closing as stale, as branch-1 is effectively EOLed.]
