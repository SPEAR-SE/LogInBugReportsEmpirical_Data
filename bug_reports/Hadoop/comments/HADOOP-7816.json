1) No tests included/changed.   The patch merely changes the order of a small code segment in bin/hadoop.   Testing was done by running a hadoop fs -ls, with HADOOP_HOME_WARN_SUPPRESS turned on and turned off.

2) Regarding patch, this patch was done against the tagged version rel-0.20.205.0-rc1.  Failure to patch against trunk is not unexpected., +1 for the change., Dave, is this relevant to trunk? If so could you please attach a trunk patch?, I committed the patch and marking the jira as resolved. Dave, please reopen this bug to attach trunk patch, if trunk requires this change as well., Thanks Suresh.   It appears that HADOOP-7398 hasn't been applied to trunk, nor does it seem to need to.  As such this issue shouldn't be necessary for trunk as well., Corrected the Target and Fixed fields., Closed upon release of version 1.0.0.]
