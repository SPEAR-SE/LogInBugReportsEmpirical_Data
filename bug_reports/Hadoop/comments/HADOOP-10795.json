[Moses, you need to look at the ERROR output.  The WARNING output is not the issue here.

In this case, there is one error:
{code}
testROBufferDirAndRWBufferDir[1](org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestLocalDirAllocator) Time elapsed: 0.014 sec <<< FAILURE!
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.16:test (default-test) on project hadoop-common: There are test failures.
[ERROR]
{code}

So {{TestLocalDirAllocator}} is failing.

I think you'll find that if you run with {{mvn package -DskipTests}} (skipping tests), you will not get this error.  Without knowing more about that test, I can't say why it might be failing for you., I faced the same issue while building hadoop 2.4.1 on Windows 7 x86. I changed the JDK version from  "*jdk1.7.0_51*" to "*jdk1.6.0_45*". This resolved the issue for me!]
