[Quick code walk-through with [~jianhe] tells me that metrics2 was never integrated with the web-server. *sigh*., {code}
    addServlet("metrics", "/metrics", MetricsServlet.class);
{code}

Does this line mean we have already added the metrics into httpServer ?, Wasn't the /jmx endpoint supposed to replace the /metrics going forward?

@Xuan - I believe that servlet only serves MetricsV1, not V2?, I suggest moving the target to {{/jmx?qry=Hadoop:*}} to fix the dead link., Attaching a patch to move the link target to {{/jmx?qry=Hadoop:*}}. I confirmed the link worked locally., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This patch is just to move the link target, so new tests are not needed. In addition, the failures are not related to the patch., Hi [~ajisakaa], thanks for the patch.
Seems like an existing bug, if I click the "server metrics" link on MR web app page, it will be redirected to the RM's "server metrics " instead of its own. Similarly the link for "/stacks"., We can fix that separately in MR, patch looks good to me, This isn't a blocker for 2.4. It's been around since the first release of 2.x line, not specifically a blocker for 2.4.

Coming to the fix, let's make sure how jmx and /metrics are different in the 1.x lines. If they are equivalent, then the approach is fine, but let's check that first., I verified "/metrics" link is not working and "/jmx?qry=Hadoop:*" works with Hadoop 1.2.1.
Should I create a patch for branch-1 also?, This needs a rebase if it is still relevant., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
