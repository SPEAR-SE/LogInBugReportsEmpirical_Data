[Hi Angelo, Can you comment on whether or not this bug exists in trunk?, Looks Todd has fixed the bug to remove the id in below condition	
{code} 
} else if (state == Status.ERROR.state) {
{code}
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6833

But in Fatal State 
{code}
} else if (state == Status.FATAL.state) { 
{code}

It is marking as closed.
So, markClosed will do  shouldCloseConnection.compareAndSet(false, true)

After receiveResponse , it will call close().

As per my observation close should clean the calls. ( by invoking the api cleanupCalls(); ).......no?
, @Uma

It looks like it fixed at HADOOP-6833. I will mark this issue as duplicate., Is it still a problem in 0.20.203? If so, we need to fix it in 20x as well., @Luke

We got this issue at 0.20.204., Looks HADOOP-6833 fixed in *0.20.3, 0.21.1, 0.22.0* versions.
Then before 0.20.3 versions may have this issue. May need to back port the issue to that versions also if applicable., Uma, I do not think the 0.19/0.18/-- branches are officially supported anymore., ok..
but I think 20.X versions are supported right..
Luke also mentioning about 20x versions in above comment. , Yep, so 0.20.204 should be added to fix versions if it has been integrated. I think that'd be the next 0.20.x based release -- no idea on action plan for 0.20.3., Could anyone check if 0.20.204 has been integrated or not? I only can see release-0.20.203.0. Maybe backport to 0.20.204 will be suggested if 20X versions are still being supported.]
