, When I run
bq. mvn apache-rat:check -DHadoopPatchProcess 2>&1

I see the following error and I have no clue how to go on

Now's as good a time as any for some help from maven/rat experts. :(
, Looks like the conf files in src/main/packages/templates/conf/ were not being excluded from RAT. They should otherwise you get license warnings.

Can someone please commit this?
, The real problem was the conf files not being in exclude. Not the warnings I mentioned in my first comment., It would be better to add license headers to the configuration files., @Tom: Ok! I've added the headers to all the files in this patch. Can you please commit it?, Ravi, is this necessary in taskcontroller.cfg?

This message is automatically generated., the patch doesn't apply to trunk. Is this a 0.23 branch only patch?, Hi Steve,

 In trunk Apache header missed only for log4j.properties.
 For Trunk fix https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7669.( Patch available)


 In 23 branch, Apache header missed for other files as well.
 Current patch in this issue should for 23 branch only.

Thanks
Uma, +1
