[This is intermittent, isn't it?, I can reproduce it consistently with my ADL store. Maybe it has something to do with the permissions of my store. Let me retry with a fresh store., Very interesting! The test is ok with my new store {{jznew}}. The old store is {{jzhugeadls}}., It turned out {{jzhugeadls}} had default permissions and one of them is {{Other}} whose {{Read}}, {{Write}}, and {{Execute}} were all unchecked. Once I checked them and deleted all the content of {{jzhugeadls}}, the unit test passed., Glad to know that. Thanks for debugging and confirmation.

Maybe we can add those related debigging experience to doc section as Trouble Shooting. S3 has such similar doc and it's helpful., Great idea!

Re-opened this as a doc JIRA to add a new section {{Troubleshooting}} to {{index.md}}. Document what I encountered here., I've just seen this too on 3.0.1RC0, where things were all working before. Interesting., Saw it on 3.0.3 (RC0).]
