[I believe this might be related: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/pig-dev/200901.mbox/%3C769829701.1232482019672.JavaMail.jira@brutus%3E, I believe this is fixed in trunk/2/23.  You may want to investigate backporting HADOOP-8906 which should solve this bug and others., This doesn't occur branch-2 due to HADOOP-8906. Shall I close this as a "Cannot reproduce?", Closing old tickets that are already part of a release.]
