[Similar issue exists with other dfs commands, especially: cat, ls, lsr, mkdir, rm, rmr and du. All these commands operate only on the first specified argument and ignores the rest. I propose that we fix all of them to operate on multiple input arguments., We should also explore whether commons-cli might make it any easier to parse all of these DFS command line options., The dfsshell utility now process all command line arguments. Earlier most commands (ls,  lsr, mkdir, cat, rm, rmr and du) were processing only the first argument., The dfsshell utility now process all command line arguments. Earlier most commands (ls,  lsr, mkdir, cat, rm, rmr and du) were processing only the first argument., I applied this last week.  Thanks, Dhruba!]
