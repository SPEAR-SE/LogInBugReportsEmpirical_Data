This message is automatically generated., Hello [~cnauroth],  Could you please review this jira ?, Hi, [~benoyantony].  I think it's a safe change.  I did some digging and traced back to MAPREDUCE-2746 introducing the locking.  It was meant to fix a problem with {{ServiceLoader}} lazily loading the real {{securityInfoProviders}} and not implementing its own thread-safety.  It looks to me like the same pattern was applied to {{testProviders}} for consistency, but it doesn't provide any real benefit.

I see the same thing in {{SecurityUtil#getTokenInfo}}.  Do you want to change that one too?, Thank you for the review, [~cnauroth]. I have removed the synchronization on testProviders on _getTokenInfo_ also. Attaching the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
