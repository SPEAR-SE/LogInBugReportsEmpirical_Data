[Update: the archive seems to be fixed now, /www/archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/ is a symbolic link to /www/archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/.
However, it doesn't always seem to show up as such when you browse to http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/.  Not clear why.  (I attempted to modify the ownership of the link file to match the other files in the archive, but was denied.)

So as a work-around, I changed http://www.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/readme.txt to refer to common instead of core.  We can change it back if the link starts working reliably.

I also copied hadoop-1.0.4 back from archive, and set the stable link to point to it correctly.  These changes should all be auto-published to the web site in the next hour or two., Thanks Matt]
