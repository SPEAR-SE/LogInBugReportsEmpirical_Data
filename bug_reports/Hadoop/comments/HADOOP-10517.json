This message is automatically generated., [~tedyu] Thanks for the new patch. Out of curiosity, should we use the IOUtils#closeQuietly[1] instead of nesting try/catch since we are anyways pulling in the commons-io dep?

This message is automatically generated., Patch v2 doesn't work while v1 works., That's very interesting because the only thing extra that closeQuietly does is check for null which anyways should throw an NPE for a null value, It looks like there is a bug which we can fix with this JIRA. The closeEntry is called twice, Once here[1] and second here[2]. So if the "if" portion gets executed, we try to close the entry twice resulting in the error in the JUnit. I think we can remove the one inside "if" to fix the issue.

[2] https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/JarFinder.java#L72, The reason that patch v2 doesn't work is that ZipOutputStream#closeEntry() should be called instead of ZipOutputStream#close().
See:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/zip/ZipOutputStream.html#closeEntry()

IOUtils.closeQuietly() calls close() method., I might be mistaken but isn't the closeEntry closes just the current entry but still leaves the stream open. I would have thought that we would still need to call the close() on the outputstream to release all the resources that it is holding on to., zos.close() is called at the end of jarDir()., +1 for hadoop-10517-v1.txt.  I'll commit this., I committed this to trunk and branch-2.
