[A simple, safe fix.

, 
This little patch has been available for a week.  Is there something I need to do to get someone to commit it?

Be patient.  I'm operating at reduced capacity.  (We have a new baby in the house, and I flew to a conference yesterday.)  I know there's a substantial patch queue.  I'm trying to catch up on email before I work on it, so I don't just commit things blindly, but rather am aware of the whole picture.  As a result, I'm only managing to commit a few patches a day, and the queue is growing faster than that.  With luck I'll have a good day soon (tomorrow?) and manage to work the queue down substantially.  Sorry!  Soon we hope that Owen, Nigel and Dhruba will be permitted to commit (they've all been OK'd by Apache, but not yet by Y!) which should help to eliminate this bottleneck., Sorry - FWIW I was just about to commit this one yesterday, when I realised that we should be concentrating on 0.12.3 bugs first. (The release process is being discussed in HADOOP-1161.)

(And my other excuse is that most of my family's been ill this last week!), I just committed this.  Thanks, David!, Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #42 (See http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/42/)]
