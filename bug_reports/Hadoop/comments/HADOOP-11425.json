[IT does work, because I've done it. It's painful, mainly setting up the gnu dependencies and paths.

Did you follow the instructions in [BUILDING.TXT|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/BUILDING.txt]? 

It may be that Hadoop doesn't build via visual studio —it does through the command line.

Why not have a go at seeing if the command-line based instructions in that document work. If they do, we should decide whether to cut all mention of VS201x support, and say "you must use the command line"

See also [my nodes|http://slider.incubator.apache.org/developing/windows.html], Well, It will not compile on Win32 platform, the targets are missing. See
below the winutils.sln. All targets are "Release|x64".
I am building on command line only.
The problem exists on version 2.2.0 and 2.6.0 and may be on other versions
also.

BTW if you build setting Platform=x64 (Possibly the build may be
successful, but it will not run on win32 platform)


on version 2.6.0 "lz4hc.c" file is not included in
<ClCompile Include="src\org\apache\hadoop\io\compress\lz4\lz4hc.c" />

It gives linker error " __LZ4_compressHC__ symbol not found

I am not sure how you build is working without these changes, as I am
consistantly getting these error and got fixed by manually changing it.

So to reproduce the issue


So if you set env as
setenv /x86
set TARGET_CPU=x86
set Platform=Win32
set HADOOP_PROTOC_PATH=C:\HDRIVE\Hadoop-2.6.0\Protoc\protoc

mvn clean package -Pdist,native-win -DskipTests


The problem will be

Build FAILED.

, missed the "32" bit, sorry. I don't think we support/worry about 32 bit windows —the amount of RAM you can address in a 32 bit CPU is less than the heap size of many Hadoop services. Hence the focus on 64 bits.

The only justification for effort on win32 bits would be if this is needed to support 32 bit client apps., My hdfs is on 64 bit linux
I am submitting mr job from remote windows 7 (32 bit) client
This is quite common at least in  devloper community.
Even release notes are also indicates win32 support

I have woking code
If ok and approved i can contribute the code
Tnx
Manoj

, We're working on adding the 32-bit build targets in HADOOP-9922.  I'm resolving this as duplicate.]
