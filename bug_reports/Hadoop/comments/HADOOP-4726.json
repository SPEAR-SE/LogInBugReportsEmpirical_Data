, - ReduceTask.java is missing in HADOOP-4726_v02.patch.

- Seems there are some EOL changes in streaming.xml.  It confuses svn.  Tried to apply HADOOP-4726.patch (or HADOOP-4726_v02.patch) and than did "svn diff > a.patch".  The resulted a.patch contained the entire streaming.xml file.
, Thanks for your review. I fixed them.
