     ie the 2nd number should be the max that are online , Most of the corrections Nigel suggested are made

Only one not included is about not printing a warning  "Could not find metadata file for ..." during datanode upgade. This warning is printed by the core part of datanode which is blissfully unaware of upgrade. It needs a few code changes to for this part of the DataNode to be aware of upgrade. We will include a note about this warning in the 'quick guide for uprade' we will have for this release.
  


, +1 code review, I just committed this. Thanks Raghu!]
