[Also TestFsck should be able to catch this.
, This is a corner case. It occurs when a block has an empty location list. So the namenode is either in Safemode or a block is lost in the cluster., Here is a simple fix., Add a unit test to TestFsck., +1

I wonder why fsck does not throw the exception passed to it from the name-node, but this is a different issue., +1
