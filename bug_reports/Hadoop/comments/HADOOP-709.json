Our streaming code creates an XML file for the job. This file as an entry of the form:
<property><name>stream.map.streamprocessor</name><value>/bin/sort -t'&#1;'</value></property>

One option would be that user-input be encoded in Base64 before being XML-ised. This is necessary to support non-ascii user-input., URLEncode the streaming related key-value pairs in the job.xml file.
   stream.map.streamprocessor
   stream.reduce.streamprocessor
   stream.combine.streamprocessor

, URLEncode the streaming related key-value pairs in the job.xml file.
   stream.map.streamprocessor
   stream.reduce.streamprocessor
   stream.combine.streamprocessor
