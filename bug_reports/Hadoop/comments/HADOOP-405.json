[Yes, the file browseDirectory.jsp need not be there in src\webapps\dfs directory. It is anyway overwritten with a copy from src\webapps\datanode during the build process. Only one copy need to be there in svn.
I think the *.jsp files have to be there in the src\webapps\* directories for the jsp compilation to complete successfully. Not sure whether we can avoid that copying., I agree with Konstantin: the build should not modify anything in the src tree.

Instead of the copy, you can add <jspcompile jspfiles="../browseDirectory.jsp" .../>.

, we checked these two copies of browseDirectory.jsp and found these difference:

1.  "dfs/browseDirectory.jsp":  if the input is a document, the page will be sent to "browseBlock.jsp" directly.  Otherwise, the links of sub-files will be displayed.
   "datanode/browseDirectory.jsp":  if the input is a document, the page will be returned.  Otherwise, the links of sub-files will be displayed.
2.  All the inputs of the two pages are the same.
3.  All the pages work well in our cluster. We use "dfs/browseDirectory.jsp" in fact.

4, "dfs/browseDirectory.jsp" is a newest version than "datanode/browseDirectory.jsp"
5, "datanode/browseDirectory.jsp" is not changed from 0.7.x or early to 0.10.x
6, "dfs/browseDirectory.jsp" is change from 0.9 and before 0.9 version of hadoop it is completeness same as "datanode/browseDirectory.jsp"
7, hadoop actually build the "dfs/browseDirectory.jsp" to "build/src/org/apache/hadoop/dfs/browseDirectory_jsp.java", and dosen't compile "datanode/browseDirectory.jsp" yet
8, so we may remove "datanode/browseDirectory.jsp"

Here is our solution for HADOOP-405
1, remove "src/webapps/datanode/browseDirectory.jsp" file
2, remove line "<copy file="${src.webapps}/datanode/browseDirectory.jsp" todir="${src.webapps}/dfs/"/>" in build.xml

We checked it worked okay, maybe remove file has a little risk, but I think it maybe a good way for 405, isn't it?

, 1, there are 2 identical files:
src\webapps\datanode\browseDirectory.jsp
and
src\webapps\dfs\browseDirectory.jsp
2, "dfs/browseDirectory.jsp" is a newest version than "datanode/browseDirectory.jsp"
3, hadoop actually build the "dfs/browseDirectory.jsp" to "build/src/org/apache/hadoop/dfs/browseDirectory_jsp.java", and dosen't compile "datanode/browseDirectory.jsp" yet

so the solution is
1, remove "src/webapps/datanode/browseDirectory.jsp" file 
2, remove line "<copy file="${src.webapps}/datanode/browseDirectory.jsp" todir="${src.webapps}/dfs/"/>" in build.xml , +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12350097/405.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r502030., I just committed this.  Thanks, navychen!]
