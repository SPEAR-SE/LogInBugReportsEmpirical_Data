src/test/bin/test-patch.sh should also be changed to specify '#!/usr/bin/env bash' as its first line.  That's what we've found to be most portable, as bash is not always installed in /usr/bin.  Can you please add that to this patch?  Thanks!, Good idea ! I made the replacement for the whole dir (with sed). Please find the result in the attached patch., I just committed this. Thanks, Brice!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #511 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/511/])]
