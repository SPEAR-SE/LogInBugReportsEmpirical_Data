[There is not need to deploy this POM, as its only use is aggregation of the Hadoop modules.

Deployment should be skipped for this module by setting the skip flag in the deploy plugin., patch fixes the version of the deploy plugin to use and skips deployment for hadoop-main, +1 This fixes the problem for me., $MAVEN_HOME/bin/mvn clean deploy -DskipTests 
Tried deploying hadoop common artifacts to the snapshot repo; it works
