[This isn't quite right; I misunderstood how the log4j stuff works.  I'm trying to figure out what the real solution is..., Also i cannot find the logs by {{TaskTracker$Child}}. 

We pass 
{code}
-Dhadoop.log.dir=/data/hadoop/logs
-Dhadoop.root.logger=INFO,TLA
-Dhadoop.tasklog.taskid=task_0008_r_000016_0
-Dhadoop.tasklog.noKeepSplits=4
-Dhadoop.tasklog.totalLogFileSize=102400
-Dhadoop.tasklog.purgeLogSplits=true
-Dhadoop.tasklog.logsRetainHours=12
{code}

to the child jvm but we do not specify the logging file name, so the logs at {{ TaskTracker$Child}} gets lost. I'm not an expert on logging, so correct me if I'm wrong. , The task logs are captured by the task tracker and are visible via the web ui. If you drill down to the task you are interested in, it will have link on the right side to look at the stdout/stderr/logs for a given task attempt.]
