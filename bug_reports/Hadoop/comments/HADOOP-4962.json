What is your build version?, I am pretty sure HADOOP-4679 was applied to branch 0.19.

Could you please check your build version?, > I'm able to consistently reproduce the same issue in 0.19.0.

Do you mean the 0.19.0 release?  HADOOP-4679 has been committed to 0.18 branch and above.  You will see it if you checkout the current 0.19 branch, or you have to wait for 0.19.1 release.  We cannot change 0.19.0 release anymore since it is already released., Correct, I was testing with the 0.19.0 release. Will grab the 0.19 branch., Closing this.]
