[Attached a minor patch, we should be able to get the 50/75/90/95/99th percentile latency for rpc queue/processing time.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Liang Xie, thanks for picking this up. Feel free to assign to yourself. Patch looks basically fine, just a few comments:

* I think a test case isn't too hard here, since we already have tests for metrics. Would be appreciated, even though it is a small change.
* Can we make the percentiles configurable the same way as in HDFS with a config key? I've been idly toying with the idea of a lower-overhead percentiles implementation and defaulting them on everywhere, but until then, it's probably best to keep it configurable and defaulting to off (especially since affects every RPC call)., Attached v2 should address your comments:), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
