[It took a lot of trial and error, but I was able to find the minimal set of dependencies and exclusions to get this to work without using any of their jars that include 3rd party packages (btw, the Apache DS artifacts are a big mess).

An especially tricky issue was that one of the dependencies, {{apacheds-jbm1}}, isn't a jar -- it's a "bundle", which requires the maven-bundle-plugin.  However, they aren't publishing it properly or something so it doesn't work anyway.  The workaround, which I figured out from [this|https://bitbucket.org/resah/embedded-apacheds/commits/85ff4716f58f4db8418a0a2ff965e7a8db9f5a0e#chg-pom.xml], was to exclude {{apacheds-jbm1}} and explicitly include it, but using version {{2.0.0-M3-SNAPSHOT}} instead of {{2.0.0-M15}} because it's not a bundle.  

I've verified that everything compiles, {{TestMiniKdc}} passes, and the issue I was having in Oozie goes away.  , Our artifacts are also a mess ;).

Using an apacheds-jbml from a different release does not seem kosher at all. It would be great if you can drop a line to the apacheds alias mentioning the problem and if the have a better idea or if they'll fix the apacheds-jbml in an upcoming release. Just leave out the big mess thing :).

Worse case scenario, as minikdc is used only for testing we could go with the propose approach., I agree, it would be best not to do that.  I found an old JIRA with the same issue on a previous version of ApacheDS but on {{apacheds-jdbm2}}, so I posted a comment there asking about this.  Their previous solution was to simply add the maven-bundle-plugin, but I already tried that and it didn't work.

This message is automatically generated., [~rkanter], thanks so much for fixing this!!!, After trying the solution of adding the {{maven-bundle-plugin}} again (which was their answer on DIRSHARED-134), it now works.  I'm not sure why it wasn't working when I tried it before; perhaps I have since changed something else.  

In any case, the new patch now uses the correct version of {{apacheds-jdbm1}} and includes the {{maven-bundle-plugin}}.  The only catch is that any project trying to use the MiniKDC will now also have to add the {{maven-bundle-plugin}} too.  , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

, This patch also changed the junit dependencies. Was that intentional? If not it slipped through review & also needs to be in the title of the patch/changes

Pushing through potentially significant changes in dependencies and export in 3h,  without even a chance of those people who are working on actually updating al 
# Please don't change multiple dependencies in one go as we are trying to do them one by one -with careful review. 
# This wasn't a critical "fix in hours our disaster" patch, so I'd have liked to have been given an opportunity to review -which I would have done by getting the junit part of the diff moved to a separate patch that also updated the junit version to 4.11

Now, was the junit patch an accident? If so could we roll it back and have a separate patch with the junit update, and a separate note in CHANGES.TXT?
