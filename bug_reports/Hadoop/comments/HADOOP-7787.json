[Here is the tony patch doing the following:
* It removes the "-dist" in the source tarball
* It adds a "-bin" suffix to the binary tarball to be more aligned with other Apache artifacts, As an exemple, here are the produced artefacts from hadoop-dist/target/:
-rw-rw-r--  1 bruno bruno 41928210 Oct 31 18:23 hadoop-0.23.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz
-rw-rw-r--  1 bruno bruno 13722578 Oct 31 18:04 hadoop-0.23.0-SNAPSHOT-src.tar.gz
, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I would suggest hadoop-${project.version}.tar.gz for the binary and hadoop-${project.version}-src.tar.gz for the source. We haven't used a -bin suffix in Hadoop before, and this is consistent with the 0.23.0 release candidate Arun created last week (http://people.apache.org/~acmurthy/hadoop-0.23.0-rc2/)., Please find attached a patch which will only modify the way source tarballs are built.


Although I used to be confused by the artifacts produced by Hadoop. Usually, the main artifact is the one named <NAME>-<VERSION>.tar.gz, and convenient ones are the one with suffixes. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
