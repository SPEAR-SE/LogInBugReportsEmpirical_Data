[It looks like {{KerberosName}} itself has also been duplicated on 0.20, right?, That is correct., The patch removes one for each of the following duplicate files:

KerberosName.java:
  The newer file (added in HADOOP-7119) had just one additional method, and was used at fewer places. The method is ported to the other KerberosName.java.

TestKerberosName.java:
  The two tests have identical testcases except that two principals were using different realms. The test was failing because in 20 the default realm for tests is APACHE.ORG, while the test was passing LOCALHOST. In trunk the same test passes because in trunk default realm is parametrized.
    I removed one because fixing the above would mean to put same realm as the default one and that would make the two tests exactly identical., I too verified that KerberosName are duplicates, with the exception you mentioned. +1 for the patch., This was committed to 205, 206., Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0, Patch for 22, Attaching the correct file., I just committed this to branch 0.22.1. Thank you Benoy., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-22-branch #106 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-22-branch/106/])
