The job directory is only cleaned up when all the tasks  for the job on the tasktracker have finished (completed or failed)., Mahadev, Sanjay reported this first here: HADOOP-737; and HADOOP-639 tries to get this accomplised via directions from the JobTracker to the TaskTracker... can you review HADOOP-639 and check if it meets your needs? If so, we could resolve this issue as a 'duplicate'... thanks!, thanks for pointing it out arun. I should have goen thorugh the bugs before filing and fixing it :).  I just read went through the patch for HADOOP-639. It does seem to solve the problem. We can mark this one as duplicate. , Duplicate of HADOOP-737, fixed as a part of HADOOP-639]
