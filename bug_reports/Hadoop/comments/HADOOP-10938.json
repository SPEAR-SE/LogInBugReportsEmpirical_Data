[I think this issue is going in the wrong direction.  PositionedReadable should be thread-safe.  It has been claimed so since its beginnings and on the canonical implementation, HDFS, it has always been if not very 'live'.  Rather, I'd suggest we mark implementations that are not thread-safe at fault and fix or undo their PositionedReadable claims if they can't positioned read in a thread-safe way., HDFS-6803 supersedes this]
