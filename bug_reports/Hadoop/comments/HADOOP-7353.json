[Cleanup exception handling in {{FsShell.run()}} method to print the stack trace of unexpected exceptions such as NPEs.

Converted -help & -usage into {{FsCommand}} subclasses to greatly simplify the aforementioned exception handling block.  All conditional chains are now gone!  Everything is dynamic.

A few trivial changes to {{Command}} & {{CommandFactory}} to support nested classes needed for -help/-usage to access the {{CommandFactory}}.

Break shell object instantiation, and population of commandFactory, into separate methods so DFSAdmin (already a subclass) can eventually take advantage of the modularity., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I also removed the slew of pre-existing warnings in {{FsShell}}..., Looks pretty good, Daryn. A few small nits:

* There's no need to expressly initialize the instance variables in the {{FsShell} ctor to {{null}}. Java will do that automatically.
* "The follow methods are syntactic sugar." - They're not really "_syntactic_" sugar, as much as they are just helpers.
* "if (instance == null) throw new UnknownCommandException(cmd);" - coding guidelines say to put always use braces on {{if}} statements, and always put the body on a new line.
* There seems to be an inconsistency with printing to stdout vs. stderr, or at least I can't tell why you chose to use one in some places, and the other in other places.
* "// historical abstract method in Command " - move this comment above the method., Thanks Aaron!

bq. There's no need to expressly initialize the instance variables in the {{FsShell}} ctor to {{null}}. Java will do that automatically.
Sure, I removed the initialization.

bq. "The follow methods are syntactic sugar." - They're not really "syntactic" sugar, as much as they are just helpers.
Changed.

bq. "if (instance == null) throw new UnknownCommandException(cmd);" - coding guidelines say to put always use braces on if statements, and always put the body on a new line.
Changed.  I found a few more, so I changed them too.

The -help/-usage commands will print to stdout.  The usage goes to stderr when no command is given, or because of an illegal argument.

bq. "// historical abstract method in Command " - move this comment above the method.
Moved.

Thanks again!
