[Here is a patch fixing the Null pointer exception.
I added a new api  getStrings(String name, String[] defaultValue) in Configuration.java, which returns default value if nothing specified for the configuration property., +1, +1, Just a small hit, 

lets change 
{code}
public String[] getStrings(String name, String... defaultValue) {
}
{code}

so that both 
{code}
conf.getStrings(key, new String[] {"foo.bar", "foo.baz"}); 
{code}
and 
{code}
conf.getStrings(key, "foo.bar", "foo.baz"); 
{code}
works. 

Moreover since we are at it, introducing a setStrings() might be a good idea (the patch for HADOOP-449 needs it).
