[Patch for the fix mentioned in bug description. This is more than one line change because I removed 'mountMap'. mountMap does not seem to be used anything other than for counting 'capacity' and 'bytes remaining'. , 
Another small patch to include 'Tb' and 'Pb' for bytes reported by 'dfs -report'. Patch is for DFSShell.java.
, 
dfs-report.patch

Resubmitting the patch with proper paths etc. This fixes 'dfs -report'.
, 
Updated patch with changes to dfshealth.jsp. It looks more pleasing to to eyes now. Note that this patch adds a file hadoop.css in webapps/static/
, 
Final version I hope., 
Ver 3 of the patch. Another minor change in jsp.

Please note that this patch adds a file : src/webapps/static/hadoop.css
, I just committed this.  Thanks, Raghu!]
