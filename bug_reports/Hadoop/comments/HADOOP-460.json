[Here is a patch for the ClasCast issue with latest trunk. , There are other changes in this patch, seemingly unrelated to the class cast exception.  Are these intentional?  If so, can you describe them?  Thanks!, There are 2 trivial changes in addition to Class case exception. 
- Removed JAVA_HOME check from run.sh as the script doesnt need it anymore. 
- Changed default input to ASCENDING from RANDOM, its only useful when outout needs to be compared against the input ( in case of single reduce) , its irrelevant for normal runs. 

Sorry about not describing these earlier. , I just committed this.  Thanks, Sanjay!]
