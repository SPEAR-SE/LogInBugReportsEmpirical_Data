[Are you trying to build a 32 bit version? It looks like you are building using the 64 bit compiler.

I used "mvn package -Pdist,native-win -DskipTests -Dtar" to build successfully on my window 7 machine, Yes, I have windows 7 32 bit version and in the command line set "set Platform=Win32" in order to build to my windows box. I also try to build in the VS2013 but unsuccessful.
I also followed instructions in this http://www.srccodes.com/p/article/38/build-install-configure-run-apache-hadoop-2.2.0-microsoft-windows-os#comment-1150229068., The issue has been fix by copying x64 configuration to Win32 configuration and recompiled., The issue has been fix by copying x64 configuration to Win32 configuration and recompiled., “The issue has been fix by copying x64 configuration to Win32 configuration and recompiled.”
can you tell me what configuration ? where it is  , The configuration should be in the *.vcxproj files, Be sure to set your Platform to x64 or Win32. Hope this helps.

set Platform=x64]
