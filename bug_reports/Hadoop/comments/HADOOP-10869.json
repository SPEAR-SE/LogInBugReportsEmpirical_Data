[ KeyProvider should {{flush()}} to a temporary file, load temporary file to verify it is healthy and then rename the temporary file to the actual file. The rename must be done in 2 steps to enable recovery on startup if the rename process was not complete:

* rename CURRENT to OLD
* rename NEW to CURRENT
* delete OLD

On start up:

* if CURRENT exists, delete NEW & OLD
* if CURRENT does not exist and OLD exists, rename OLD back to CURRENT and delete NEW, This is a duplicate of HADOOP-10224 - I certainly agree with it.
