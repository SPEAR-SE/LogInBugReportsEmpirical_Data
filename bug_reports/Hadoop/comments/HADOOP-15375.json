, We saw a similar issue for the Windows build and Powershell.
We weren't allowing the right SSL version.
+1, Thanks [~elgoiri] ! Committing this to branch-2. (I didn't check whether 2.x.y branches have this, can be cherry-picked as necessary)

For reference there was a thread on common-dev about this too: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e52a173f170d349ba6f4ac034578d98fd1ff7d649408f0157c391813@%3Ccommon-dev.hadoop.apache.org%3E, It appears the nodejs related lines were added by YARN-3368, so only branch-2 and branch-2.9. I'm cherry-picking this to branch-2.9 as well, assuming it would hit the same issue., Done... thanks [~elgoiri]!, Thanks [~xiaochen], hopefully we should have a branch-2 build tomorrow.]
