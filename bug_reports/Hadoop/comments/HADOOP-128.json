[This patch changes the client so that:
   1. it has replication * 1 minute timeout for the block replicas to be written.
   2. improved logging, including the filename and remote hostname when things fail
   3. 

It patches the DataNode so that:
   1. Failures downstream (from the mirror nodes) never propagate back upstream.
   2. Improved logging including filenames and remote host names.
   3. the changes involve a lot of whitespace changes because of block changes, so i'll include a separate upload that ignores whitespaces., These are the diffs to DataNode.java ignoring whitespaces., The read and write block functionality needs to be factored out of the huge if/then/else. I'll open a new bug for that., I forgot the default value for the retries value., I just committed this.

I note that you increased the timeout in the client, presumably to account for timeouts down the replication chain.  But shouldn't we then also increase the timeout in the datanode when it connects to the next link in the chain?  It didn't look like you added that.

+1 for refactoring this (in another patch).  The logic of this is hard to follow!
