[Code review please - should be straightforward, just added <Job> type declarations to ArrayList where required to remove compiler warnings., Fix should be self-explanatory when you look at the code.

As an aside, I always prefer to use the interface (e.g. List) rather than the concrete implementation (e.g. ArrayList) wherever possible, especially in methods which are in a public API (this is also recommended by Sun and many others). I notice the Job class exposes the depending jobs as an ArrayList, I think this should be changed to List. If you agree maybe a separate Jira issue is in order? I'm quite happy to code up a patch for it., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

----------------

The "tar" target which the "findbugs" target depends on is not generating the file hadoop-0.16.0-dev-streaming.jar. Line 594 of build.xml specifically mentions hands this file over to findbugs and if it isn't there you get the above. If I comment out that line the build goes fine, as does findbugs and my patch doesn't seem to introduce any new findbugs errors in JobControl.java. 

Should I create a new issue for the missing streaming.jar and it's impact on findbugs? Will that have to be solved before this patch can be accepted?
, Nigel, do you know why that exception occured?

+1, please file a jira/patch for it.

Unfortunately, this would have to be an incompatible change. Sigh, _now_ is as good a time as any., Re-submitting to the patch process..., OK, I have created a new issue (HADOOP-2268) for the ArrayList vs List issue. I think I will wait for this (2202) patch to (hopefully) be accepted before I start on that otherwise they will conflict with each other., bq. I think I will wait for this (2202) patch to (hopefully) be accepted before I start on that otherwise they will conflict with each other.

Adrian, if you can fix HADOOP-2268 in the near-future, I'd rather not get this patch in at all. 
Lets do it right the first time. Others?, OK, so you would rather that HADOOP-2268 fixes both this issue and the ArrayList -> List issue. I will make it so., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Adrian, assuming that HADOOP-2268 addresses the issue, I am cancelling the patch (will resolve once HADOOP-2268 goes in)., Duplicate of HADOOP-2268., Duplicates should not be resolved as "fixed".]
