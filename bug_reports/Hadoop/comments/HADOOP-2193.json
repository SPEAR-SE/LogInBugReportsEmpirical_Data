[Attached is a simple patch. Since fs.delete does not propagate FileNotFoundException, I have added a fs.exists() check even before we try to move to trash and attempt delete. updated testcase to verify this., this patch fixes the issue.

with dfs -rm[-r] /nonexistentfile
this prints 
cannot remove /nonexistentfile: No such file or directory.

the patch on a fs.delete returning false checks if the file does not exist. (this is just to save rpcs on a exists for every case) and then throws filenotfoundexcpetion.

, +1 re-throwing FileNotFound seems better., this patch removes some redundant code... , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
