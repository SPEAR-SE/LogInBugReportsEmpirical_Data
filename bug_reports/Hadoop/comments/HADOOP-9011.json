[This patch adds the branch to the version annotation.  This fixes TestYarnVersionInfo and the runtime errors., This part of the code seems unrelated to the change. (changing the variable name)
Since it is a trivial change, +1 for the change.
{code}
-    current_branch = filter_current_branch.search(branch).group(1).strip()
-    url = "%s on branch %s" % (origin, current_branch)
+    branch = filter_current_branch.search(branch).group(1).strip()
+    url = "%s on branch %s" % (origin, branch)
{code}
, Thank you, Raja.  While working on this, I noticed that the name current_branch was inconsistent with the rest of the code.  For all other substitutions into the annotation, the script variable name matches the annotation variable name (version, revision, user, etc.).  To make the code more consistent, I renamed current_branch to branch.  This didn't seem significant enough to warrant splitting it into a separate jira., +1 LGTM, +1. Committed to branch-trunk-win.

Thank you Chris. Thank you Raja for the review.]
