[Hi,

I would like to solve this problem but as I am new in Hadoop development community, I do not how and where to start. I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question.

Can you please give me some pointer regarding how do people usually solve problems in this community?

Generally when this kind of problem comes up, I ask for steps to re-produce this problem. How do things work in here?

Thanks,
Chandrashekhar, Hi Chandrashekhar, i use hadoop for my own study. I am also an outsider as regard to how people usually fix the jira. But I think the way to reproduce the error is to simply run a wordcount example with the installed hadoop distribution in a true cluster mode.

Thanks]
