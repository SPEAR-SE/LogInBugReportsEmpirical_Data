[Hadoop core has no kernel mode components so it cannot cause a kernel panic. You likely have a buggy device driver or hit a kernel bug.

Resolving as Invalid., We saw somthing very similar to this problem (among others) recurring on RHEL5.
It appears that the kernel, after an initial, legit, softlockup report (for instance because of IO contention), can go into a loop of reporting soft lockups and -- by the mere amount of data spewed -- lock itself to panic.

For us it was due to dumping data to the (relatively slow) serial console, for you it may be by dumping data to disk, which is presumably the cause for contention in your case.

Once you've cleared the way for real issues (controller problems, for instance), you may want to in vestigate one of the following:
0) reduce kernel verbosity on the console (provided it reduces the amount of data dumped to /var/log/messages, i'm not familiar with your setup, we're remote logging everything)
1) disable softlockup reboot
2) disable disk logging of kernel messages / log to tmpfs / log to a separate, dedicated system *disk*
