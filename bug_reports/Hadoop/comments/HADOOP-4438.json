[commands_manual has already been updated with setSpaceQuota and clrSpaceQuota.

In hdfs_shell, made the following changes:
- Added documentation for -count command
- -moveFromLocal command had "not implemented" as the description. Updating it with the description given in the command line help.
- -moveToLocal is currently shown as "Not implemented yet" in the command line help. Updated the hdfs_shell to include the same documentation.
- Anchors referencing to "put" and "get" sections from copyFromLocal, copyToLocal is currently not working. Fixed these anchor issues.
