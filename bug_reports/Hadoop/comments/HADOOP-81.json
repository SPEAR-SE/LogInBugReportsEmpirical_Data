[This patch does:

Changes the JobInProgress and TaskInProgress to keep the JobConf, which is the job specific configuration,
rather than the system-wide configuration.
Adds set/get speculative execution methods to the JobConf, so that applications don't need to get the string literal right.
On a side note, I also made all of the fields in TaskInProgress private rather than package-local., I committed this in 386224.  Thanks, Owen!]
