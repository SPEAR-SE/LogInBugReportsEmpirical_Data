[This patch fixes both problems., A better one: makes injection compilation target depends on a special wrapper target which should be customized in any subprojects., Before patch:
{noformat}[6980]shinytardis:hadoop-common(r6347) jhoman$ ant -Dtestcase=TestDU clean test | grep Running
    [junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestDU
    [junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestDU{noformat}

After patch:
{noformat}[6985]shinytardis:hadoop-common(r6347) jhoman$ ant -Dtestcase=TestDU clean test | grep Running
    [junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestDU
{noformat}
