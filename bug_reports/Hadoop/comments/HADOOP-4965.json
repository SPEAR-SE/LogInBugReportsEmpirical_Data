[Previously the file name was printed. Should the file name be printed in the log? Otherwise +1 for the patch., This patch may change the shell commands output., This patch 
- prints the file name;
- stringifyException
- also closes FileSystem in TestFileAppend3, You shouldn't need to call {{StringUtils.stringifyException()}}, because passing it down to the log tools as is lets your logging tool handle the chained strack trace themselves -which can include a more structured output than the {{stringifyException()}} call. I'd prefer something like:
{{LOG.error("Exception closing file " + src + ": " +ie,ie);}} 
, I thought this bugrep was familiar; , Incorporated Suresh's comment., Only one unit test failure with this patch. TestMapReduceLocal fails as in HADOOP-4907., +1 for the patch, I am removing the DFSClient related code from the patch because it has been resolved by HADOOP-3894. Leaving only the TestFileAppend3 improvement., I just committed this.]
