[Actually, I think that it would be even better to make DFSNodesStatus() a member of the JspHelper  class.
And sorting should be called directly in the jsp file.
In general it would be good to keep all data collection/processing in the JspHelper class,
and let the jsp-files just output information., Agree with this. Attached is the patch. In dfshealth.jsp, I also changed the DatanodeInfo references to DatanodeDescriptor to reflect the current code., DatanodeDescriptor is supposed to be used only be the namenode internally.
The class for external use is DatanodeInfo. See HADOOP-321.
That is why DatanodeInfo is public and DatanodeDescriptor is not.
So using DatanodeInfo in dfshealth.jsp was actually right.
I should add some comments in JavaDoc on that., Well, that should be okay since the jsp file actually belongs to the dfs package. But in any case, I have attached a new patch with the DatanodeDescriptor changes reverted., I just committed this.  Thanks, Devaraj!, I mistakenly submitted the same patch file that I submitted the first time. Sorry. Thanks to Konstantin for pointing it out. I have now placed the patch with just the DatanodeDescriptor -> DatanodeInfo changes. This will apply cleanly to the current trunk.,

This issue is closed now.
You probably need to create a new issue and attach your patch there.
I don't think it is possible to reopen closed issues.
