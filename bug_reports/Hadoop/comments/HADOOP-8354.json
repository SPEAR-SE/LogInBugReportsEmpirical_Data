[I just saw a very strange issue while running some of the tests.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-4233?focusedCommentId=13270757&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13270757

I am putting it here because I think it is for the same reason.  The Jars were not installed first so the tests were run against an older version of the code, not the patched version., I just verified that this fixed both the fidbugs and the junit issues.  I will be uploading a patch shortly., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
