[Thanks for posting performance data. Can you please let us know the test setup details? Like how big is your cluster?
It is interesting to see high Std Deviation without the patch. Did you try multiple runs?   
, Correction: Std deviation is high with patch., For simplicity this is a single node from a fresh checkout.  Yes I did run this multiple times... the stddev varies on read from 78 - 30... writes are fine in terms of stddev.

If you build the test jar you should be able to reproduce locally.]
