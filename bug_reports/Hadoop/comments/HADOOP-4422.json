This message is automatically generated., This patch needs to be re-generated without the a/ b/ stuff for Hudson to be able to apply it.  It must apply with 'patch -p 0 < foo.patch' when connected to trunk., Patch applies with -p0 now (used git diff --no-prefix)., Marked as an incompatible change, since existing code that relies on bucket creation will need to be changed., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., For consistency, we should make the same change to Jets3tFileSystemStore.

Also, regarding the tests, there are two unit tests: Jets3tS3FileSystemContractTest and Jets3tNativeS3FileSystemContractTest which can be run manually to test the S3 integration. The only difference with this patch is that the buckets they run against must already exist - so I don't think any change to the tests are needed., Cancelling patch pending change to Jets3tFileSystemStore., Bucket creation also removed from Jets3tFileSystemStore., I ran the tests as follows after setting the correct test buckets and keys in src/test/hadoop-site.xml:

ant -Dtestcase=Jets3tS3FileSystemContractTest test
ant -Dtestcase=Jets3tNativeS3FileSystemContractTest test

They seem to pass:

Testsuite: org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3.Jets3tS3FileSystemContractTest
Tests run: 25, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 131.575 sec
Testsuite: org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3native.Jets3tNativeS3FileSystemContractTest
Tests run: 26, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 52.694 sec

However, they both produce hundreds of warnings:

(s3) 2008-11-21 15:51:28,800 WARN  httpclient.RestS3Service (RestS3Service.java:performRequest(317)) - Response '/%2Ftest' - Unexpected response code 404, expected 200

Any ideas?, Never mind about the warnings from Jets3t during testing.  They are expected., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
