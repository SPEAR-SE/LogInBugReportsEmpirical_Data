[Added an override for close() in FsShell.TextRecordInputStream that closes the SequenceFile.Reader instance.  I didn't create new tests because I don't know the best way to force too many open file handles on the test machine.  However, with this patch I can set ulimit -n 100 and still use the -text option on a path glob with 1000+ files.  Without the patch, files fail to open at the 95th part., -1 overall.
