[MiniKdc generates its own krb5.conf, why do the tests still read /etc/krb5.conf?, I think the test's behavior depends on Java library.

The algorithm to locate the krb5.conf file is the following:

If the system property java.security.krb5.conf is set, its value is assumed to specify the path and file name.

If that system property value is not set, then the configuration file is looked for in the directory

<java-home>\lib\security (Windows)
<java-home>/lib/security (Solaris and Linux)
Here <java-home> refers to the directory where the JRE was installed. For example, if you have J2SE 5.0 installed on Solaris in a directory named /j2sdk1.5, the directory in which the configuration file is looked for is:

/j2sdk1.5/jre/lib/security
If the file is still not found, then an attempt is made to locate it as follows:

/etc/krb5/krb5.conf (Solaris)
c:\winnt\krb5.ini (Windows)
/etc/krb5.conf (Linux)

If the file is still not found, and the configuration information being searched for is not the default realm and KDC, then implementation-specific defaults are used. If, on the other hand, the configuration information being searched for is the default realm and KDC because they weren't specified in system properties, and the krb5.conf file is not found either, then an exception is thrown.
