Requires a patches suitable for both 0.17 and 0.16.3., 3186_20080418b.patch: corrected the rename permission checking, Can you describe what the permission checking policy for rename() is?

"-mv" is implemented by rename but not correctly. "mv file /dest" creates /dest/file if dest is a directly. but "rename(file, /dest)", will either fail or create /dest but will not /dest/file, right? , Ok, DFS.renameTo() is actually not a rename but a move. We should fix that separately., 3186_20080418c.patch: here is a new one, suggested by Raghu.  , We don't need to use Path.SEPERATOR. This is already in DFS. It is '/' (or DFS.seperator if one exists)., > We don't need to use Path.SEPERATOR. This is already in DFS. It is '/' (or DFS.seperator if one exists).
Oops. Path.SEPERATOR is our own constant. I though it might be platform dependent.

+1 for the patch. looks good.

This message is automatically generated., 3186_20080418c.patch changes FSDirectory. unprotectedRenameTo(...) but FSEditLog uses it.  So it failed the tests.  3186_2008042 only changes the permission checking in FSNamesystem.renameToInternal(...). , 3186_20080420_0.16.patch: for 0.16, +1., I just committed this.
