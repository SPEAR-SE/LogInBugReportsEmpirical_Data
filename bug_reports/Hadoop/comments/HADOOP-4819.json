[I'm getting the same exact compile issue.  Have you been able to find a workaround?, Hey Andy,
My work around was to use (copy over)  an install from a linux machine.
Making sure I had the upgraded JVM on Solaris everything worked fine, no
re-compile needed.

Don't know how to properly fix the builds.

, Given that LZO support has been removed, this issue can probably be closed in some fashion., Or create a issue ticket on hadoop-gpl-compression to help the community?, Another jira tracks solaris compilation.]
