[Files do not have an execute permission. (Directories _do_ have an execute permission.)

From the user guide:

" In contrast to the POSIX model, there are no sticky, setuid 
or setgid bits for files as there is no notion of executable files.", At the least, it is confusing to the user. 'x' is something user sets (unlike 'd'), I wonder why it is disallowed for files in HDFS., Also, 'fs -help chmod' needs to be updated to reflect this, at the time it was written, I didn't know DFS ignores 'x' on files. My preferred fix would be not to ignore it.

In Hadoop, all files are non-executable (which is different from Unix).  So there is no 'x' bit., Well, I don't think executable is real file system property. It is a file property interpreted by the operating system (and security layer). The fact that HDFS does not need it IMHO is not a good reason to restrict the users. If there is an improvement (either internal or user facing) because of not allowing this flag I would like to know., a useful example where x perms would be useful is mounting hdfs as a fuse module...
