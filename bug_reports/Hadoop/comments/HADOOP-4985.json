[4985_20090106.patch: remove unnecessary "throws IOException", 4985_20090107.patch: reverted the changes of try-catch, which need more thought., - FSDirectory empty line change.
- Javadoc for {{FSDirectory.setReplication()}} should not remove {{@throws IOException}} but rather replace it with {{@throws QuotaExceededException}}
- {{FileNotFoundException("Unknown file: " ...)}} should be {{FileNotFoundException("File does not exist: " ...)}}
I once tried to unify this in the code, but it's now back with all different messages. 
- Additionally we can remove IOException in 
FSEditLog.close()
FSEditLog.existsNew()
FSEditLog.logOpenFile()
FSEditLog.getFsEditName()
and then 
FSDirectory.persistBlocks()
FSDirectory.closeFile()
FSDirectory.setTimes()
and then
