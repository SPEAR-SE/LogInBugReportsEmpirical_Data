[Oh, I understand exactly what you mean.  There are two virables( !recursive && printHeader) to control wheather print the "Found xxx items". I'll mail the author: Mike Cafarella for detail.  
-Jianglei, In my opinion, we should provide a format option(for example: -v), then the output show some detail info in some format.
Can you give your suggestion about the detail format you want?  We can discuss about the format., I think the user was complaining that the output format was different in the case of of a directory vs that of a file. When we do a ls -l of a directory, it prints "Found xx items". When we do ls -l of a file, the "Found xxx items" is not printed. The user was asking that both these formats be same. He was not tto concerned about what the exact format it.

I think the current format that we got is appropriate.

If we look at linux/unix ls command, it too prints out different format based on whether it is a directory or a file.
, Yes, the ls command of unix print different format depends on the type of target. 
But I think if we can provide some option to fit the requirement of this user(if this kind of requirement is general). 
If all think this is unnecessary, we can close the bug? :) thx., This feature is no longer required by the reporter.]
