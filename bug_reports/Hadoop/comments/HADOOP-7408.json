This message is automatically generated., Looks good. I've updated your patch to annotate SnappyCodec as public evolving (like the other codecs in the package), and to provide a link to the snappy homepage from this class., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1, Why passing conf to the following method?
{code}
  public static boolean isNativeSnappyLoaded(Configuration conf) {
    return nativeSnappyLoaded;
  }
{code}
How about remove {{isNativeSnappyLoaded(..)}}  and change {{nativeSnappyLoaded}} to final?, Also, could you add {{@Override}} for overriding methods?, It turns out that we have to revert HADOOP-7206. So this is not a problem anymore.]
