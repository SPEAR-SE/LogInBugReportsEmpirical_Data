This message is automatically generated., How can a documentation patch make the tests fail?, Hi,

The test timeout may be due to a fault in trunk and is certainly not due to your doc patch.

Your patch looks good to me. Committing momentarily. +1., Thanks!, I'm not sure what went wrong with my commit, but copy pasting the localized name seems to be causing issues. I'll clean that and recommit., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4337 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4337/])
