[The change is minor, but it helps to avoid confusing people to a wrong direction. Can somebody help to review this ? 

Thanks a lot., \\

This message was automatically generated., I'm concerned that the new phrasing makes it more confusing.  It would help me if you could explain what you find confusing about "empty the trash.", Thanks [~templedf]

We'd like to keep it short here but informative and let user read the details from HDFS architecture guide, I am thinking to revise it to

+Find expired checkpoints in trash directory and remove them if trash is enabled. This command does not immediately empty the trash. Refer to the HDFS Architecture Guide for more information on the Trash feature.+

Looks better ?
, My primary concern is with the word "checkpoint."  I'm worried that a newbie, i.e. someone who would be reading the documentation, wouldn't understand what that means without having to do more research.  The advantage of the current phrasing is that it's immediately understandable, even if it's not exactly accurate., Hi Daniel 

someone who would be reading the documentation, wouldn't understand what that means without having to do more research
>> User can go to reference link to understand what is checkpoint and what does this command do

The problem is current phrasing is WRONG, it gives user a false impression., \\

This message was automatically generated., > User can go to reference link to understand what is checkpoint and what does this command do

The provided link is to the HDFS architecture guide.  In that guide, if you search for "trash", it tells you that deleting a file will actually move it into the trash.  True, but not helpful.  If you search for "checkpoint", it tells you about the NN's edit log checkpointing.  Also true, but not helpful.  The only thing I was able to find that clarified in specific terms what a trash checkpoint is, is the source code.  Googling around a bit, there are a couple of forum and blog posts here and there that do explain bits of how the trash works in HDFS, and taken together you get a pretty clear picture, but that's a handful of hits in a sea of "it empties the trash."

My point is that this is an excellent opportunity to create a useful source of documentation on what happens when you use -expunge.  I think these docs would be much more helpful if they said something like:

* The trash folder is divided into "checkpoints" that contain the files deleted during given time windows
* Every fs.trash.checkpoint.interval minutes, HDFS will create a new checkpoint, and all files subsequently deleted will go there
* Every fs.trash.interval minutes, HDFS will delete all checkpoints older than fs.trash.interval and then create a new checkpoint
* hdfs -expunge will causes HSDS to delete all checkpoints older than fs.trash.interval

I didn't think too hard about the phrasing, but you get my point.  Provide enough information that a user can understand what a checkpoint is and why they'd want to expunge one without having to go on a Googlequest or read source code., Hi [~templedf] 

Thank you so much for the comments, I get your point and it makes sense to me. My intention was to keep the phrasing simple and clear (like rest of docs), and give an extra link to elaborate how it works. I contributed another patch to improve the document (see HADOOP-5323), it explains checkpoints, those parameters and details about trash feature. So user can go to [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html#File_Deletes_and_Undeletes]. Note the link directly points to *File Deletes and Undeletes*, user doesn't need to search.

So based on that, can we document the expunge command like below ? 

+If trash feature is enabled, HDFS moves deleted files to a trash directory and creates checkpoints in a configurable interval, this command finds those expired checkpoints (exists more than fs.trash.interval) and remove them from the file system.+, Thank you for doing HADOOP-5323!  Very useful documentation.  I wasn't looking at the latest docs, so I missed it.

Updating the patch to link directly to that section would absolutely be helpful.  It would also be nice to mention that File Deletes and Undeletes is in the Space Reclamation section.  Because that's the last thing in the doc, the link points the browser further up the page.  Knowing the major section title would help folks realize where the right text is.

I do still have one concern: my original one.  The doc text says "checkpoint," but nowhere is that term defined.  Can we find a different way to phrase it?  What about something like:

  If trash is enabled when a file is deleted, HDFS instead moves the deleted file to a trash directory. This command causes HDFS to permanently delete files from the trash that are older than the retention threshold.  See [your link] for more information.

I don't think the details about checkpointing are important to have here.  I don't think the average user cares, and there's a link for those who do., Hello [~templedf]

Many thanks. I have updated the patch that incorporated with your comments, please review it and let me know if it is good now. , Looking good.  One last quibble: can we get rid of "checkpoint" in the description text?, Sure. I just updated that in 003 patch., \\

Thanks for working through this one.  I know it was a lot of fuss for a very minor change, but I think the net result is a big improvement to a small part of the Hadoop user experience. :), Thanks Daniel for all the valuable suggestions :), Is there anybody who can help to commit this? , +1 I just committed this.
