[It removes close() from FSDataOutputStream and FSDataOutputStream$PositionCache since it is not required., The updated patch just removes flush() inside close() for FSDataOutputStream(). , bq. For. e.g one bad side effect is that, in the case of DFSOutputStream which extends FSOutputSummer, flush() inside close sends the current data even though FSOutputSummer might have some data.. this left over data will be sent in side close() (so it sends data in two different packets instead of one). Other filesystems might have similar side effects.

I am fixing the above as part of HADOOP-1702 by renaming {{DFSOutputStream.flush()}} to {{flushInternal()}} (because it is not a normal flush() and needs to be called only inside close())., +1 for the latest version of this patch., Is part of HADOOP-2657.]
