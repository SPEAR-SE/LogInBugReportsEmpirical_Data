[Here's a patch which addresses the issue. 

I've written a test for this fix, but the test was easiest written in the HDFS project. I'm going to upload another patch in a moment which is the complete change, but uploading just the fix in Common here so that test-patch can run., Here's the complete patch, including cross-project test in HDFS., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Nit: spurious 'a' here at the end of the sentence
{code}
+   * port specified, as is often the case with an HA setup.a
{code}

Another nit: I think the test case should be capitalized "WithHA" instead of "WithHa" to match our other test cases which all have the keyword "HA" in them (makes it easy to run mvn test '-Dtest=*HA*')

+1 once you fix these, Thanks a lot for the review, Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses your feedback. I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
