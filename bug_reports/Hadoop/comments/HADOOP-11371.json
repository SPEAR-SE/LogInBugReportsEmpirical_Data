[I added a regression test that would catch this problem. However, it turns out that java.io.BufferedReader#readLine() despite the javadoc not mentioning it OpenJDK actually [returns the incomplete line on EOF|http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/java/io/BufferedReader.java#317].

Not sure about whether we can rely on this with other JDK's. 

# This patch eliminates arrayCopies in Buffered for readLine. 
# We also don't need to use synchronized StringBuffer for errMsg because there is already a synchronization point via {{joinThread(errThread);}}.
# No need to feed extra line.separator.

, Hi [~jira.shegalov], the patch doesn't apply any more. Do you think we still need this fix (especially for trunk branch)?, Hi [~djp], cancelling the patch since it no longer applies. Since my major concern turned to be a non-Issue with OpenJDK which is our JVM based off, we don't need it at the moment.]
