[A bug, but it's worth pointing out that this also sounds like a misconfiguration of HADOOP_STOP_TIMEOUT for your installation.  Whatever is restarting it should *also* wait HADOOP_STOP_TIMEOUT before doing that., There are service management mechanisms (e.g. monit restart) that are somewhat haphazard in terms of the stop and start timing. We came across that issue.

I wouldn't quite call this bug a blocker (probably a minor bug), but it's definitely useful defensive fix. +1 for it., a) This patch needs to get updated for trunk.
b) using single brackets in bash is bad
c) using single quote shellouts is deprecated

This message was automatically generated., I want to do some experiments: I have some questions whether this actually fixes the bug or just shrinks the window of the race.  Also, now that there is a unit test framework for shell code, it'd be great if there was a unit test written for this function., Also, pretty sure this doesn't fix the pid file removal if the daemon is secure., I think it significantly shrinks the window of the race, originally the window would be 5 seconds by default. If we are not satisfied with the reduced window, we might need to introduce synchronization of accessing pid file.

Also, can you point me the location of unit test framework for shell code., All of the shell unit test code for common is in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/test/scripts , \\

This message was automatically generated., Umm, those shellcheck errors are wrong.

Here's what shellcheck 0.4.1 says:

{code}
./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop-functions.sh:1678:13: warning: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values. [SC2155]
./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop-functions.sh:1705:9: warning: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values. [SC2155]
./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop-functions.sh:1706:9: warning: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values. [SC2155]
./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop-functions.sh:1711:9: warning: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values. [SC2155]
./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop-functions.sh:1712:9: warning: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values. [SC2155]
{code}

Basically, move the "local foo" to the top, then set "foo=bar" later.

Still looking at the rest of the patch, but thought I'd share that part. :), Also, bats doesn't support double brackets ( [[ ) since those are a bash built-in.  So there's a good chance your tests are failing, but bats isn't picking it up., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~aw], can you take a look at the latest patch, I have fixed the shell check and change double bracket to single bracket as you mentioned above, Looks good. At least, I'm not seeing anything obviously wrong.   Minor nit:

{code}
+    hadoop_error "WARNING: deamon pid has changed for ${command}, skip deleting deamon pid file"
{code}

spelling errors. :), Thank you [~aw] for the review, I have uploaded patch v5 that addresses the spelling errors, +1 committed

thanks!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8633 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8633/])
