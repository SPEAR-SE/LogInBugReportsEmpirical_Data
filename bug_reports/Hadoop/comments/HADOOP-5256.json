[If it doesn't start with "Test" then it's never been run, and seemingly was not intended to be run.  There are certainly tests in the test/ tree which are not meant to be run automatically.  But I have no idea whether the one you cite was intended to be run or not., > One example that violates this is src/test/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystemContractBaseTest.java. Is this on purpose to that it's not run automatically? Are there other tests like this?

I believe this is on purpose.  FileSystemContractBaseTest is an abstract base class providing codes for testing general file system contract.  FileSystemContractBaseTest  itself is not a test.  For testing an individual FileSystem subclass (e.g. DistributedFileSystem), we only has to define a test class (e.g. TestHDFSFileSystemContract) extending FileSystemContractBaseTest., Yes, FileSystemContractBaseTest was not intended to be run itself - as Nicholas says it's abstract and is meant to be subclassed to test the general file system contract of FileSystem implementations. See also HADOOP-4114., I agree that this is just a base class for tests to extend.  These extended tests look to be name correctly.  But should there exist any test that don't run automatically?, Is it worth adding a comment to FileSystemContractBaseTest and others of its ilk to avoid confusion in the future: This test is not run, but provides a base class for others that are.  It's implied by abstract nature of the class, but extra comments rarely hurt., Simpler fix could be to remove 'Test' from the file name. I guess that is source of confusion here.]
