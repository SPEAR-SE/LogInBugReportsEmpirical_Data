[ResolutionMonitor was removed by HADOOP-3620 in 0.19. So it may not worth fixing the dead thread problem. But it is still worth figuring out what caused the StringIndexOutofBoundsException. , Hairong and I determined the issue was caused by a race condition created by having lots of nodes with the same storage ID registering at the same time (due to being from cloned drives, not something that should normally happen), and the ResolutionMonitor not being properly synchronized.  The network location for a particular node is reset to UNRESOLVED (empty string, "") before being passed to add, which causes the substring to fail.

Since the ResolutionMonitor is now removed, it's not worth fixing it and will close as won't fix., Closing issue.]
