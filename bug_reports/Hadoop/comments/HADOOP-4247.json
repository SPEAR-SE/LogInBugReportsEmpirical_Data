{code}, The attached patch fixes the problem. But I absolutely don't know if that's the right fix. Can someone please review ?, Marking this a blocker for 0.19. The problem shows only when we use a deployed version of hadoop, such as one built with {{ant tar}} or {{ant binary}}. Specifically, if the build folder has the build files, then since build/tools is included in the classpath, everything works fine.

In the fix, I am not sure if {{HADOOP_OPTS}} needs to be included. I see that it is included in the {{sampler}} argument to bin/hadoop. So, I've left it there.

This message is automatically generated., What exception are you seeing? Branch-0.19 runs word count for me fine without the patch., Sorry! I had jira on "Subversion commits" since I was de-tangling the problems with HADOOP-4006 and missed your detailed description of the problem.

The fundamental problem is that examples.jar depends on tools.jar. We need to straighten out the dependencies, rather than just including both on the class path, I think., This patch moves the InputSampler into mapred.lib, since adding the tool.jar into the class path for non-tools would prohibit overriding distcp, etc. from the command line., Forgot to change the bin/hadoop script., -1 overall.
