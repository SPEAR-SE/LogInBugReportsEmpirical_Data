[modification to NameNode, DataNode, and RPC to allow thread shutdown., I wonder if these daemons should implement a Stopable interface?  Is that overkill?

Also, your patch needs to update the javadoc for NameNode.stop()., I will add the javadoc. Also in addition to the shutdown on the DataNode, I made a shutdownAll() method that will shutdown all the started datanodes that were created using DatNode.run(conf). I ran into a bit of a head banging issue that manifested itself as a socket timeout because I was starting my DataNodes on my own with offerService, but not starting the DataXceiveServer. I am not sure if there is even a way to start the DataXceiveServer other then dataNode.run(conf).

I will attach the new patch shortly.

I think a stoppable interface would be a bit of overkill right now, but certainly easy enough to add later., Patch includes updated javadoc as well as shutdownAll() method on DataNode, I just committed this.  Thanks, Barry!]
