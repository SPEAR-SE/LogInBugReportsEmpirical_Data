[Patch attached., +1 for the patch. Minor edit - I made timeouts that were 300,000 to 30000., Thanks, good catch! It was meant to be 30000., It does not compile. I think it is because @Test cannot be added to junit 3 tests., New patch attached, sorry about missing that., +1.

I committed the patch. Thank you Arpit for the quick turnaround. I will post a merge patch again to see how the consolidated patch fares with Jenkins.

, The earlier checkin added some incorrect timeout values. Will add a separate patch to just fix these., Resolving. HADOOP-9372 tracks the annotation fixes.]
