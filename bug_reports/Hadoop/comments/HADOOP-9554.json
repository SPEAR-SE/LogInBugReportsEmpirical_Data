[Do you mean authentication or authorization?, authorization . Please see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5210 which is the origin of the issue , I certainly don't want any changes in the {{FileSystem}} interface in 1.x, and doubt anyone else will, even the new method {{FileSystem.listFiles()}} has been troublesome enough to both implement and test, and is not fully functional on all filesystems.

# The addition of new abstract methods to {{FileSystem}} will be an incompatible change in the 1.x line, break all third party filesystem implementations and generally cause grief.

I'm -1 to this on 1.x for compatibility, and provisionally -0 on this on HDFS v2. If people really do want this, then in accordance with HADOOP-9361, you will have to "Strictly define the expected behavior of filesystem APIs and write tests to verify compliance". ]
