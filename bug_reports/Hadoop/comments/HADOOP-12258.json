[The following is the stack trace for NoSuchFileException:

{code}, I uploaded a patch HADOOP-12258.000.patch for review. The patch will throw FileNotFoundException instead of NoSuchFileException to make it backward compatible. We may also change FileSystem#exists and FileContext.util().exists() to fix this issue, but there are many old code which may still catch FileNotFoundException instead NoSuchFileException when call getFileStatus.
For example:DirectoryCollection#createDir. It will be good to make it compatible with old code., \\

This message was automatically generated., This is a major regression —it's good you caught it.

The requirement that getStatus on a nonexistent path throws an FNFE should be part of the fs contract tests -it should have been caught there.

Similarly, we need a test which checks the requirement path.setTimes(time) throws an FNFE if the path doesn't exist.

Do you fancy adding a new Abstract FS Contract test for set times, so that we can do it consistently across a filesystems? The same tests could be used (we could add an FS granularity option too to the test contract, so that filesystems could declare tighter vs looser times (I think FAT32 is 2s, for example), [~zxu], thank you for spotting this and filing the bug report.  I agree with Steve that a contract test would be great for this., Hi [~stevel@apache.org], [~cnauroth], thanks for the comment! Yes, it makes sense to add contract tests for setTimes and getFileStatus.
I just read the document [Testing the Filesystem Contract|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/site/markdown/filesystem/testing.md], It is an excellent guide. I figured out how to add the contract tests based on the document., Hi [~stevel@apache.org], [~cnauroth], I attached a new patch HADOOP-12258.001.patch, which implemented the contract tests for setTimes and getFileStatus and also I add two utility functions in IOUtils since java.nio.file is already used by {{IOUtils#listDirectory}}. Please review it. thanks, \\

This message was automatically generated., Hello [~zxu].  Thank you for adding the contract tests.  This is looking good overall.  However, I advise against putting the new helper methods in {{IOUtils}}.  The class is annotated {{Public}}, and I don't think we want to sign up for supporting these methods as part of our public API contract.

I'll give the whole thing a closer review after that's addressed.  Thanks again!, Hi [~cnauroth], thanks for the review, I uploaded a new patch HADOOP-12258.002.patch, which addressed your comments. Please review it., \\
