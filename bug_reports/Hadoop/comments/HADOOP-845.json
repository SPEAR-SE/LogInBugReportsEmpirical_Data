[-1, because the patch command could not apply the latest attachment (http://issues.apache.org) as a patch to trunk revision r489707. Please note that this message is automatically generated and may represent a problem with the automation system and not the patch., Some codes are added to org.apache.hadoop.dfs.DFSShell.java. then we can cat gzip file like others, Hadoop dfs -cat does not handle non-ascii bytes correctly. So it can not cat zipped files correctly. Wendy's patch to HADOOP-628 should also be able to fix this bug., Weilei's patch seems to implement zcat. You may refer to the method getRecordReader in hadoop.org.apache.mapred.TextInputFormat.java for a general implementation of zcat., It's a duplicate of HADOOP-628.]
