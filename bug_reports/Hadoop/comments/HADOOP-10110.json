[Attaching a patch that adds the missing dependency. I verified the build on both Linux and Windows., +1.  I verified that I could build without the jetty jars in my ~/.m2 directory with this patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12614482/HADOOP-10110.patch
  against trunk revision .

    {color:red}-1 patch{color}.  Trunk compilation may be broken.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/3292//console

This message is automatically generated., I've verified that the patch works as well. It seems that right now jenkins will fail to compile any new patches without this patch, thus it would be great if this patch can land in trunk as soon as possible., +1 for the patch, just verified it.

I will commit it shortly., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.2.

Thanks for contribution Chuan!, Also thanks to Colin, Haohui and [~brandonli] for re-verifying since we don't have a Jenkins +1., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4753 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4753/])

, Needed to be ported back into 2.0.x line as it's breaking the build there as well, What's the target branch for 2.0.x? Thanks., I downloaded the source code:
http://mirrors.cnnic.cn/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.2.0/hadoop-2.2.0-src.tar.gz
And I met the same problem.

With this patch, I solved  the problem.
It seems the source code have not updated., +1 on the patch., +1 on this patch as well. We have also encountered this issue., I will commit this as soon as my SVN password issue is resolved (hopefully by tomorrow). If someone want to commit it before - please do!, Committed to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.3. Thank you, Chuan!, Thanks [~chuanliu] for the contribution and everyone for the reviews.  I committed this to branch-0.23 as well., Pulled this back to branch-2.2 since Tez still supports hadoop 2.2 compatibility.]
