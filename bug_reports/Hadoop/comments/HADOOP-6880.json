[Best I can tell, the Chinese docs haven't been maintained since they were initially contributed in 2008 (HADOOP-4164).

I would like to propose that we remove them entirely, or add (in Chinese) a big red warning message on the page indicating as much and asking for help translating?

What do folks think?, cn docs were removed]
