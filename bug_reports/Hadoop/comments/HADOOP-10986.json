[It seems the culprit for the significant size increase is in the documentation, specifically protobuf javadocs:

{code}
$ cd hadoop-2.5.0/share/doc/hadoop
$ du -m -s *
55	api
119	common
1	css
1	dependency-analysis.html
1	hadoop-annotations
1	hadoop-archives
1	hadoop-assemblies
2	hadoop-auth
1	hadoop-auth-examples
1	hadoop-common-project
1	hadoop-datajoin
1	hadoop-dist
1	hadoop-distcp
1	hadoop-extras
1	hadoop-gridmix
1	hadoop-hdfs-bkjournal
11	hadoop-hdfs-httpfs
1	hadoop-hdfs-nfs
1	hadoop-hdfs-project
1	hadoop-mapreduce
3	hadoop-mapreduce-client
1	hadoop-mapreduce-examples
1	hadoop-maven-plugins
1	hadoop-minicluster
1	hadoop-minikdc
1	hadoop-nfs
1	hadoop-openstack
1	hadoop-pipes

1	yarn
{code}

{code}
$ cd hadoop-2.5.0/share/doc/hadoop/
$ du -m -s hdfs/api/src-html/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/
222	hdfs/api/src-html/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/
{code}

Also it seems we have duplicate javadocs dirs:

{code}
$ cd hadoop-2.5.0/share/doc/hadoop/
$ find . -name api -type d
./api
./api/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/v2/api
./api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api
./api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api
./api/src-html/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api
./api/src-html/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/client/api
./common/api
./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/api
./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/api
./hdfs/api
{code}
, Thanks for the investigation, Alejandro. I see why this happened - the script (create-release.sh) was doing mvn install with -Pdocs option, on top of which I copied the mvn site output as well. We can fix the script to not create javadocs during install, and use what we get from site. I tried this locally and the binary tarball is much smaller. 

I propose we handle this also under HADOOP-10956, and close this as a duplicate. ]
