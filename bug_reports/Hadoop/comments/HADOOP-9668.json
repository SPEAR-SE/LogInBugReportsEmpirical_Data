This message is automatically generated., I found there is getRaw method in Configuration which get the value of a property and TestReconfiguration uses it to compare each properties which have same keys without interpreting variables.
So, I suggest adding iteratorWithVariable method instead of modifying iterator method., ReconfigurationUtil have a method to get changes between two Configuration instances without expanding variables.
So, we should also add a new public method to ReconfigurationUtil class so that we can get changes between two Configuration instances with expanding variables.
And I will try to re-write TestReconfigurationUtil to test Configuration#iteratorWithVariable ( or iteratorExpandingVariables may be better name ) and the new public method in ReconfigurationUtil., In current implementation of Configuration, get method and getRaw method are defined as a pair ("get" expands variables and getRaw doesn't) but iterator method has no counterpart.
So, I've added iteratorExpandingVariables method to Configuration., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
