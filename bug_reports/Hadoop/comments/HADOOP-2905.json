[I can work around this by running fs -mkdir /lost+found, then rerunning fsck -move., DFSClient#mkdirs(String) was passing null FSPermission. Fixed it to use the correct mkdirs() which creates a default FSPermission. This fixes the call to mkdir which no longer passes null FSPermission so have not included any testcase. , Attaching new patch with test case. This test creates few files on DFS, then goes and corrupts few blocks by deleting them. then executes fsck / -move to restore the filesystem to HEALTHY state. , +1 patch looks good, +1 overall.
