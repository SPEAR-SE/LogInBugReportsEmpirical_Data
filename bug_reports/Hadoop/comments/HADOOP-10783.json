[presumably this is a reference to apache commons-lang.

2.6 is the last "legacy" release; there is now a commons-lang 3 release. This does look more modern, but an upgrade seems traumatic as [it requires every import to be changed|http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/article3_0.html].

There's benefits in doing this from the project's improvements, but there's 100+ imports that would need changing. That's a significant enough change that it would have to go into trunk and then be backported to branch-2 when people were happy. We'd also have to think about retaining the -2.6 jar on our classpath for the entirety of the hadoop 2.x lifetime to avoid breaking downstream projects that depend on it.

If you can supply a patch for trunk we to do this we can review it

(As you are clearly trying to get Hadoop working on BSD, you should switch to trunk because that is where fixes will go in. Consider also writing an Uber-JIRA "get Hadoop working on BSD" to which you can make these sub tasks or dependencies. Please also put "FreeBSD" in the environment field"), Well, I am not much familiar with maven build system (this change will require to update some maven stuff too?).
I can generate diff for Java files if you want (though I doubt it will be of much help because it is trivial addition of "3":
lang->lang3).

Of course I understand that it should go to trunk first.
At least this will mean that this change will *ever* appear in stable version., I am attaching a patch for this update., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., BTH, I don't understand what to do now:
If I run those test which fail at jenkins, they work on my Ubuntu 12.04 box.

If I run all tests at this machine, I get several other tests failing (should all 100% tests pass or there are some known broken ones? I see bug reports which state some tests do not work for others too).

So I am stuck with this change., Instead of outright replacing lang2, can we add lang3 too?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Cancelling patch, as it no longer applies., Hi [~stevel@apache.org] and [~trtrmitya], how is this issue going on? Now commons-lang3 is used in Apache Hadoop, so migrating to commons-lang3 seems easier than before., I've forgotten about this completely. Go for it, Thanks for working on this, all. I'd like to assign this jira to myself and take over your work., Thanks Takanobu!, Uploaded the 2nd patch. It completely upgrades commons-lang from 2 to 3.

{noformat}
find . -name "*.java" | xargs grep "commons.lang" | grep -v lang3 | wc -l
       0
{noformat}, Somehow Jenkins didn't work fine the last time.

I rebased a patch for trunk., There is a new import of commons-lang-2.6 that I didn't remove it in the 3rd patch. Uploaded the 4th patch addressing it., This is the build result with the latest patch. I don't know why it isn't reported here.
[https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/14623/]

Some of the failed tests seem to be related to commons-lang3. I will investigate it further., There is a bug of WordUtils in commos-lang3 and that is the cause of some of the failed tests., Uploaded the 5th patch addressing the failed tests. Some comments for modified class:
 * TableListing
 {{commons.lang3.text.WordUtils}} has a bug when {{wrapWidth}} is Integer.MAX_VAL. (See: LANG-1397) The patch use a workaround to use a large enough value instead of Integer.MAX_VAL.

 * ResourceUtils
 {{StringUtils.isAlpha}} breaks compatibility for emptye string. The patch handle it.
{code:java}
 org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils.isAlpha("") // true
 org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isAlpha("") // false
{code}, The build aborted due to out of heap memory.
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/14647/console, Rerun Jenkins., In most cases, I just modified package names of import statements. Some methods need to be renamed.

The biggest change is that Range classes have become a generic class. For other exceptions, I menthoned in the previous comment.

I've confirmed that "mvn clean package -Pdist,native -Dtar -DskipTests" succeeds with the latest patch. Please review it when you have time. Thanks., The build failed due to out of heap memory again... Would somebody please advise me about it?, HADOOP-10783.6.patch: rebased, Thanks [~tasanuma0829] for the work!

It looks precommit job timed out. https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/14670/console
Would you split this issue into modules (HDFS, MAPREDUCE, YARN, Common) to reduce the time to run precommit job?, [~ajisakaa] Thanks for the comments! I will create the JIRAs soon., I created HADOOP-15495, HDFS-13621, MAPREDUCE-7098 and YARN-8363 as the separated tasks., Thanks!, I also created HDDS-157 for hadoop-ozone and hadoop-hdds., All the subtasks were fixed. Closing this.
Thanks again [~tasanuma0829] for the work., Thanks for reviews and commits, [~ajisakaa] and [~anu]! Thanks for the early work, [~trtrmitya] and [~stevel@apache.org]!]
