[Attaching patch., +1 looks good, Instead of adding 40s of dead time to the test, could you use a loop that checks the mod time via {{FileSystem#getFileStatus}}?, It is actually 40ms. I don't believe it makes sense to "busy" wait given that it is so small duration. Make sense?, +1 Sorry, C temporarily scrambled me from ms to sec!  I realize now that you are trying to get past the 15ms granularity., Thanks Ivan, I have commit this to branch hadoop-1-windows.
