[JIRA for hdfs side tests for this change, Thanks to Daryn for handing over the change he made in getDefaultBlockSize and getDefaultReplication. I am attaching a patch with getDefaultBlockSize, getDefaultReplication, and getContentSummary. The tests are added as part of HDFS-3121., Just noticed that both of the getDefaultBlockSize methods in viewfs are throwing an exception as getDefaultReplication.

This message is automatically generated., I will attach a patch with the unit test fixes and addressing comment from Daryn. The following is the basic theme that this patch follows. Suggestions and comments welcome:

- {{getDefaultBlockSize}}, {{getDefaultReplication}} and {{getServerDefaults}} APIs with no {{path}} argument is invalid as far as viewFS is concerned. The logic behind this is that viewFS has no 'default' mount point. Even in cases where {{ROOT_PATH}} is mounted, my thinking is that it is not the 'default' mountpoint. Hence, viewFS will throw an exception in such cases.

- Any call with {{path}} argument given, will be resolved accordingly and the corresponding FS routing will be called.
, Looking good, however {{FileFileSystem}}'s no-path variants of the methods need to call the path variant with the root path instead of calling through to the underlying fs no-path method.  Otherwise there are problems such as {{ChrootFileSystem}} not getting a chance to rewrite the path., Also, do the existing tests already verify that the correct replication factor and block size are returned, and that a non-default replication and block size are honored?, Thanks for catching that Daryn. I will upload a patch with the fix soon., bq.

This message is automatically generated., {{FilterFileSystem}}'s no-path methods should be calling the path variant.  (Sorry I butchered it as {{FileFileSystem}} in an earlier comment).  Pushing this behavior up into {{ChrootFileSystem}} will force any other subclass of {{FilterFileSystem}} that wants to alter the behavior of path handling to implement both methods.  I think putting the behavior in {{FilterFileSystem}} is more future-proof for arbitrarily stackable filesystems.

Otherwise, looks great., Thanks for looking at the patch again Daryn - always appreciate your input. About moving the behavior to {{FilterFileSystem}}, I was thinking the other way round - I feel it is better to keep the behavior in {{ChrootFileSystem}} since, as of now, it is the characteristic of {{ChrootFileSystem}} to have a {{path}}. Anyone inheriting {{FilterFileSystem}} should probably implement the same behavior like you said. 

Other than this being a debatable change (since it could be either way), do you actually see a defect or an issue in this change? , I seem to recall that Hive's {{ProxyFileSystem}} is a subclass of {{FilterFileSystem}} that does path rewriting.  You may want to check that it won't break if {{FilterFileSystem}} doesn't loop the no-path methods to the path variants., I suppose if Hive's {{ProxyFileSystem}} is using it as of now, they would be overriding the method any way because otherwise would it end up using {{FileSystem}} methods, which is what these methods do in the patch as well. So, it shouldn't be an issue., Daryn,
Do you have any other concerns about the patch?, +1  I'd rather see the logic pushed back down as in an earlier patch, but I think it's good enough for now., Attaching a patch with minor cosmetic changes (line alignment etc, @keyword etc), +1 overall.

Most of these are minor comments.
# FileSystem#getServerDefaults() - is it better to day path p is used for identifying a destination file system? Same for FileSystem#getDefaultReplication(path). Perhaps adding information like a FileSystem could have another file system or file systems it could be delegating the call to. Path helps identifying the underlying file system?
# Please move NotInMountException to a separate java file
# FileSystemTestHelper#createParent not used in createFile() method. Do you need multiple overloaded variants of that method?
, bq. is it better to day 
is it better to say. I had to think for a long time to figure out what I was trying to say :-), BTW if you take care of these comments, I am +1 for the patch., Are you suggesting that {{fs.getDefaultReplication(Path)}} should automatically delegate to the filesystem of the path?  Would it be better to call {{checkPath(Path)}}?, Canceling patch to address Suresh's comment., bq. # FileSystem#getServerDefaults() - is it better to day path p is used for identifying a destination file system?

This message is automatically generated., bq. Are you suggesting that fs.getDefaultReplication(Path) should automatically delegate to the filesystem of the path? Would it be better to call checkPath(Path)?

bq. I understand that you expect a comment change here - basically add a comment explaining why path is used?
File system defaults with a path seems to be confusing - given common understanding would be defaults are the file system level. These variants of methods become more meaningful, once a user of API understands that a FileSystem implementation could be front ending another file system or file systems. The path is used only for identifying an underlying file system, where necessary. I was thinking if we could capture that information, to avoid confusion, where user might end up thinking that the defaults are associated with a file corresponding to the path.

Makes sense?, Just realized - my previous comment is addressed by your new patch.

In the new patch - {{Its spec and implementation is identical to {@link ViewFs}.}} not sure what you mean here. Can you please add description on when this is used or what error it conveys? Once you address that I am +1 for the patch, if the test failure is unrelated to this.
