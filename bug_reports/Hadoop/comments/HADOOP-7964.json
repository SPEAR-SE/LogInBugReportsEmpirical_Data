We haven't seen this in 0.20.205, which has the same stuff. Maybe it doesn't happen or happens rarely because of timing differences., Removed the static initialization loop in NetUtils and SecurityUtil.  I'm not sure why this wasn't uncovered in 205 except that it's a race condition between a thread trying to load one of the classes, and another thread loading the other.

* Moved resolver code from {{NetUtils}} into {{SecurityUtil}}
* Updated {{NetUtils}} to call resolver in {{SecurityUtils}}
* Updated tests
* Did my good deed by removing simple javadoc warnings in {{SecurityUtils}}, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I simply renamed one test file (net/NetUtilsTestResolver.java to security/NetUtilsTestResolver.java) to allow it to have package visibility.  Should I submit a shell script, or is that for mass moves?, Succinctly, every process that creates a kerberos authenticated connection will experience the race on its first connection.  The ticket renewal thread and the main thread race to load the classes., Is this applicable to 0.20.205?, Per Kihwal's first comment, we haven't seen the error in 205, but this is the same code so we suspect the problem must be there., This is a pretty major issue.  Would someone please provide review feedback today?, Daryn for jenkins builds to work, can you upload a patch with removal of moved file to delete and a new add? I will do the required to move it when committing the change., Daryn, patch looks good. A minor comment:
# Add @VisibleForTesting to SecurityUtil#useIpForTokenService and SecurityUtil#hostResolver. Consider just adding accessor for useIpForTokenService.
, bq. Per Kihwal's first comment, we haven't seen the error in 205, but this is the same code so we suspect the problem must be there.
We should perhaps post a patch for 205 also and get it in in a subsequent 1.x release., bq. Add {{@VisibleForTesting}} to {{SecurityUtil#useIpForTokenService}} and {{SecurityUtil#hostResolver}}

Sure, good idea.

bq. Consider just adding accessor for {{useIpForTokenService}}.

{{useIpForTokenService}} is only intended to ever be used in one place by {{SecurityUtil#buildTokenService()}}.  I thought it'd be faster to directly access the class member but I'll add an accessor if you like.

bq. We should perhaps post a patch for 205 also and get it in in a subsequent 1.x release.

Theoretically the patch should apply since the trunk code came from 205, but I'll double check., When you post the patch, can you delete and add a new file instead of move, so Jenkins can pick it up. I will do the need full to move the file, while committing., Add visibility tags., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
