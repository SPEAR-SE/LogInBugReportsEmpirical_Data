{noformat}, For this user, it happened when running on 200 nodes with 6 map slots per node.

Using distributedCache or increasing the replication would fix it, but problem still remains if we have a larger mapred cluster., This patch makes max xceiver into a setting so that users with large clusters can adjust this knob themselves. It's not a perfect fix but I think it's a start so we can release 0.17.2., +1. Looks good to me. I don't see any advantage not to make it a configurable., I just committed this. Thanks, Johan!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/]), Johan, was there a reason that this config options wasn't added to hadoop-defaults.xml?, As you can see in HADOOP-3633, it was conscious decision not to make this configurable. I didn't even try to make it public in this jira. It is expected to be a private config variable. Do we have any reasons to make it public (I can think of a couple I guess)?]
