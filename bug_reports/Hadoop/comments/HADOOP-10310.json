[Here's a simple patch which addresses the issue by initializing the SaslRpcServer in the case that there is either a secret manager OR security is enabled.

I tested this patch manually and confirmed that it works as expected. Without it, I cannot format JNs with security enabled. With the patch, the JNs can be formatted and work just fine., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
