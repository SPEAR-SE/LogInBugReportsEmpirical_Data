[Tom's book does not cover Hadoop 2.2; ask on mailing lists

https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/InvalidJiraIssues, Dear Whoever:

I am interested in knowing if Hadoop2.2.0 will work on Cygwin 1.8x running Windows XP- SP3. This is the issue for which I need advise and resolution. Many thanks,

Anand, hadoop 2.2 works on windows without cygwin

please follow the instructions in the link to get help, instead of filing jiras. 

closing as invalid: this is not a support channel, HADOOP-11464, targeted to Apache Hadoop 2.7.0, reinstates support for launching Hadoop processes on Windows using Cygwin., Closing old tickets that are already shipped in a release.]
