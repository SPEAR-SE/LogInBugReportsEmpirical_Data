[bq.  I'm not aware of any Linuxes that create system users with IDs higher than or equal to 500.

Notice that there are no user IDs between 500 and 1000 whatsoever.

Also notice that nobody is user id 65534, so we'll happily allow people to run mapreduce jobs as it (apparently).

This whole "check the numberic value of the user id" thing stinks.  I think we should either be validating against a whitelist, or checking if the given user has a valid login shell., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. Notice that there are no user IDs between 500 and 1000 whatsoever.

That's just because you haven't created 400+ system users.

{code}
[06:40:34] atm@simon:~$ cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS \n \l

[06:41:00] atm@simon:~$ grep UID /etc/login.defs 
UID_MIN			 1000
UID_MAX			60000
#SYS_UID_MIN		  100
#SYS_UID_MAX		  999
{code}

Even though the SYS_UID_ lines are commented out, I believe they're still the default values on Ubuntu., I think changing it to 500 for the tests is fine.  The patch is doing it only for testing, and we are not actually running with the setuid bit on for this part of the tests so there is no risk of a security issue.  It would probably be more maintainable to change it so that it sets the min id to be whatever the current user id is.  That way we don't have to worry about it in the future is something else changes, or someone does install 501 system users :)., ATM, reasonable to lower the min id to 500 for the tests?, bq. ATM, reasonable to lower the min id to 500 for the tests?

Sure, fine by me., +1  patch lgtm, I've committed this and merged to branch-2. Thanks Colin., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2532 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2532/])
