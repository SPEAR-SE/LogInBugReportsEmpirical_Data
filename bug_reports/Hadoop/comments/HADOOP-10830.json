, Hi [~benoyantony], thanks for the patch.

There is no need of double try-catch-finally blocks. existing itself you can re-use.
Like following..
{code}  @Override
  public CredentialEntry createCredentialEntry(String alias, char[] credential)
    throws IOException {
    writeLock.lock();
    try {
      if (keyStore.containsAlias(alias) || cache.containsKey(alias)) {
        throw new IOException("Credential " + alias + " already exists in "
            + this);
      }
      return innerSetCredential(alias, credential);
    } catch (KeyStoreException e) {
      throw new IOException("Problem looking up credential " + alias + " in "
          + this, e);
    } finally {
      writeLock.unlock();
    }
  }{code}

anyway {{innerSetCredential(..)}} have its own try-catch block. So its fine to use one try-catch-finally block itself., Thanks for the review, [~vinayrpet]. I have updated the patch accordingly., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
