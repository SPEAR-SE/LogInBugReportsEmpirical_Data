[This patch replaces the getMapOutput.jsp with a Servlet. 

The problem was that the getMapOutput.jsp was closing the output stream and the wrapper code was trying to close it again, which would sometimes generate the IllegalStateException.

The new servlet is more careful to handle errors including setting an error response if something goes wrong. It also sets the content-length with the length of the file., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
