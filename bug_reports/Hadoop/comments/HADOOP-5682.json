[this patch cleans the generated api docs
tnx!, Sometimes we commit that file, no?, I think we commit this file towards the release, as a stable api doc for jdiff to compare with the latest trunk api docs.

Then we probably shouldn't have 'ant clean' remove it.  It's not generated except by someone building a release, is it?, this jdiff file is generated whenever we call the package target., So maybe we should change the api-xml and api-report tasks to read/write the current version of the jdiff xml from somewhere in build/jdiff, then add a new target that copies this to lib/jdiff.  Then http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease should be updated to reference this new target.

While we're at it, we might rename these targets, perhaps as follows:
  - api-xml -> jdiff-xml (generates xml in build/)
  - api-report -> jdiff-report (uses xml in build/ & lib/ to generate html in build/)
  - jdiff-save (new task, copies xml in build/ to lib/, calls 'svn add' too?)

Does this make sense?, This is almost certainly stale by now.]
