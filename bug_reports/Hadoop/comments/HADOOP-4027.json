[To be more specific, streaming utility returns zero when input/output/reducer options are not specified(where a non-zero value is expected). But when mapper option is not specified, it returns non zero value as expected., I believe the mapper and reducer both default to Identity functions. So the error is the missing input and output directories., I surveyed some of the usual suspects and neither they nor I could conclude that the example is or should be an error. It is OK to successfully do nothing. 

I propose to resolve this a not a bug., I cross verfified this issue one more time. Streaming utility is behaving in the expected manner i,e it is returning non zero value when input and output dirs are not specified. I suppose the issue was resolved due to the improvement made in HADOOP-3722. 
Hence resolving this issue.]
