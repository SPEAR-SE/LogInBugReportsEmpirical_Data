This message is automatically generated., It works.  Manually tested by instrumenting UGI.getLoginUser to destroy the TGT after keytab login.  Connecting to a service generated the expected no TGT exception, then the client did a relogin from the keytab, and successfully connected., +1 Ok, the patch is straightforward. , I've committed this to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.1-beta and branch-2.1.0-beta.
