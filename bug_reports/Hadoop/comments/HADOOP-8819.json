      if (created) {
        String parentDir = parent.toUri().getPath();
        client.changeWorkingDirectory(parentDir);
        created = created && client.makeDirectory(pathName);
      }
{noformat}

In this code if {{created}} is true it enters the if condition and then executes client.makeDirectory(). If {{created}} is false that part of the code is not entered.

Aaron, can you add details on why this would change the behavior? , Aha! I misread it. You're right - it won't change the behavior at all. Sorry about that.

That would imply, then, that we could completely get rid of the "created &&", right?, On the second reading of the code I thought of it - too late :-), Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #1168 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1168/])
