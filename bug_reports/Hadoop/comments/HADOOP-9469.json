This message is automatically generated., Thanks Rob, a few comments:

in mapreduce is looks like we aren't packaging the sources for:

hadoop-mapreduce-client-hs-plugins-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
hadoop-mapreduce-client-app-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

You might also package the hadoop-tools sources jars., Added sources for hadoop-tools and corrected mapreduce sources that were omitted., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
