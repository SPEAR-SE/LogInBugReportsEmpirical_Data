[The failure was introduced by the patch fixing  MAPREDUCE-5330. We have used tests to verify the patch for MAPREDUCE-5330 works indeed. In that patch, on Windows, a delay kill is used (see JVMManager#kill()) for killing JVM and Signal.TERM is ignored. Setting  "mapred.tasktracker.tasks.sleeptime-before-sigkill" in this patch to zero ensures that in the unit test the kill will be executed with no delay so that the setup/cleanup attempts get killed immediately., +1 for the patch.  I verified on Mac and Windows.  I'll commit this., I committed this to branch-1-win.  Xi, thank you for the contribution., Thanks Chris!]
