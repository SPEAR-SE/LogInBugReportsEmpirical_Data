[5300_20090220.patch: the javadoc-dev target needs dependence "compile, ivy-retrieve-javadoc"., After 5300_20090220.patch, the build problem is fixed.  However, "ant javadoc-dev" reports 82 javadoc warnings., 5300_20090220b.patch: fixes also the javadoc warnings., - * @see org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.metrics.NameNodeActivityMBean
+ * @see org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.metrics.NameNodeActivtyMBean

Shouldn't we instead rename that class rather than further propagate the misspelling?

Other than that +1., Since NameNodeActivtyMBean is a public class, I hesitated to rename it.  I agreed we better to rename it.

5300_20090220c.patch: renamed NameNodeActivtyMBean, changes to javadoc-dev target looks good., I committed this without submitting to Hudson since Hudson is not able to test this., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #766 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/766/])
    , Editorial pass over all release notes prior to publication of 0.21. This is just a bug.]
