[This issue may go away after HADOOP-13597., Because this JIRA issue has a fix version, it's effectively dead because it's referenced in the release notes/changelog.  So why was it re-opened?, This was resolved as a dup, and it seems neither the [release notes|http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0-alpha2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/release/3.0.0-alpha2/RELEASENOTES.3.0.0-alpha2.html] nor the [changelog|http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0-alpha2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/release/3.0.0-alpha2/CHANGES.3.0.0-alpha2.html] includes it (I think expected).

In HDFS-12027 people are saying they see this in branch-2, so I re-opened this and updated affect version. Removing the fix versions now because it's a dup....
If this is deemed bad practice, we can resolve this again and open a new jira., Seems there's also HADOOP-14024 for branch-2, which I don't remember at all..... re-resolving this as dup then. Thanks., TL;DR; for future reference:
- This jira is just an indication the issue goes away from trunk after HADOOP-13597.
- HADOOP-14024 tracks the same issue in branch-2 (and branch-2.x), Thanks [~xiaochen] for the clarification. I am working on a fix for HADOOP-14024.]
