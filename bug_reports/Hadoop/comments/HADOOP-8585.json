, bq. Wouldn't it have been easier to just suppress the warning as a false alarm?

That would certainly work, but it doesn't seem much easier to me. I also don't see how the method used by this patch could possibly cause any problems, as it changes the behavior back to what it was before the recently-committed HDFS-3568, i.e. each invocation of newLoginContext will create a new HadoopConfiguration object., Clearly they have the same effect, because the configuration doesn't have any state. The new approach just creates a throw away object for each invocation. In the future, you should probably just revert the previous fix and update it rather than create a new jira the next day., bq. Clearly they have the same effect, because the configuration doesn't have any state. The new approach just creates a throw away object for each invocation.

This is not really a "new" approach. This is going back to the way it was done before HDFS-3568.

bq. In the future, you should probably just revert the previous fix and update it rather than create a new jira the next day.

We routinely file follow-up JIRAs to fix trivial problems that were introduced by a recent commit. I don't see how this is any different.]
