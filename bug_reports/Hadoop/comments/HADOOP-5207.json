[This may be related to HADOOP-4930 because it is the only issue committed between these two builds., Looking into this issue., This is a duplicate of HADOOP-5204. 

All or most core tests did not run on Hudson, because the Hudson build script calls the create-c++-configure target explicitly while running ant test. This has a bug as per HADOOP-5204, and hence the core tests did not run.

Unfortunately, this issue was not caught locally because the create-c++-configure target is called explicitly only by Hudson and has no dependency on ant test locally. Same with test-patch. It would not have been caught. Running the patch through Hudson should have caught it, and its a mistake that we did not do it. I think Hudson is more reliable now than it was a few weeks back, and hence should get back into that habit. *smile*

We will submit patch for HADOOP-5204 so that we can verify that hudson builds are working fine. Sorry for the inconvenience.]
