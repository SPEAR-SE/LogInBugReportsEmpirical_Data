[This was seen while running secondary namenode with heap of 1.5G and an image of 300MB (on disk). At each checkpoint heap usage kept of increasing for SN, even force GC did not free the space. After about 4 checkpoints SN crashed with OutOfMemory exception.

At each checkpoint, I see that FSNamesystem object count incremented and not released.

{noformat}, Tested on trunk, but Lohit says that SNN is unchanged from 0.18.
The SSN can only run for 2-4 snapshots before OOM.
, I tested this on trunk, (since CreateEditsLog used to created huge edits was on trunk). But I think SecondaryNameNode hasnt changed between 0.18 and trunk. , There was a reference to fsnamesystem from within FSNamesystemMetrics used by shutdown(). Looks like we never needed that as FSNamesystem::shutdown() would be called by stop() and we unregister the MBean. This bug was introduced as part of FSNamesystem Metrics., I tested this manually and watching the heap and checkpoints. We garbage collect as expected and no more additional FSNamesystem objects., Another version of patch. I think we shouldn't be creating Namesystem bean in the second constructor. , - I agree, metrics should not shutdown the name-node, it should be the other way around.
- Also we probably can get rid of the {{FSNamesystemMetrics.fsNameSystem}} completely since it can be accessed using static method {{FSNamesystem.getFSNamesystem()}} and set to a local variable where necessary.

This message is automatically generated., Test failures are un-related to this patch HADOOP-3874 and HADOOP-3882 have been opened to track this. 
I tested test-patch and ran tests on 0.18. They pass. , I just committed this. Thanks, Lohit, Why HADOOP-3874 and HADOOP-3882?  Your patch has passed the tests described in HADOOP-3874 and HADOOP-3882.  The failed one is TestFileCreation.testFileCreationSimulated., Thanks Nicolas. My bad, I see that TestFileCreation is also unrelated to this patch. I will open a JIRA for that and try to run the test in loop for few times. , Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
