This message was automatically generated., The failure test TestDistributedFileSystem.testDFSClientPeerWriteTimeout is not related to my change. it was already reported at HDFS-8785.
, Nice catch, [~zxu]! The fix looks good to me. Two comments:
1. Would you remove unused imports in TestHDFSContractAppend and AbstractContractAppendTest?
2. Would you please fix the following javadoc comment?
{code}
/**
 * Test concat -if supported
 */
public abstract class AbstractContractAppendTest extends AbstractFSContractTestBase {
{code}
"concat" should be "append"., Thanks for the review [~ajisakaa]! I uploaded a new patch HADOOP-12268.001.patch, which addressed all your comments. Please review it., \\
