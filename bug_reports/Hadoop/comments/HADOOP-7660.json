[Would you try Bobby's approach first?


bq. It said that we can manually add in the target/generated-test-source/java directory as a source directory with something like
bq. <sourceIncludes>target/generated-test-source/java/**/*.java</sourceIncludes>
bq. I have no idea if it will work, but it looked cleaner to me.

, sourceIncludes approach didn't work for me. Please check if my usage is wrong.

, Sorry about that. Like I said I have no idea if it works and it looks like it does not, so I guess you cannot trust everything you read on the Internet, especially in comments of some random tech help forum., {quote}
All these compilation issues are resolved after changing the phase to "generate-sources".

This doesn't seems to be caused by this patch. Any idea?

Patch involves build script[pom.xml] changes only., Just filed a JIRA for release audit warning.

Warning is not related to this patch., Thanks for the info Uma., +1 I tested this and it works great.  I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23.  It should get pulled into HA, as they pull from trunk regularly., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1837 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1837/])
