[Ok, this entails a simple fix; however what are everyone's view on how we handle the MetricsException? Perhaps log and ignore it? 
Thoughts?, Simple fix which catches the MetricsException and just logs it... I'll rework it if someone has objections., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12349842/HADOOP-934_20070129_1.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r501616., I just committed this.  Thanks, Arun!

We should also probably figure out why that exception is thrown by metrics, since that looks like a bug, but we certainly shouldn't let a metrics exception mess things up this way, so I think this is a good patch.]
