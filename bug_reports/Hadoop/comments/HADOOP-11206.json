[I saw the same error after running mvn clean install on https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common. 

Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.703 sec <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.hadoop.crypto.TestCryptoCodec

, In the past, we had a lot of frustrating cases where the native encryption code was not getting built and used at all on Jenkins, but that fact was being hidden by an elaborate series of fallbacks in the test code.  Given that background, I would prefer to resolve this as WONTFIX and just let people who don't have OpenSSL installed simply avoid running the OpenSSL tests locally.]
