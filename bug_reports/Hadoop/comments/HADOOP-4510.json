[The simple solution is to make the method public.

The alternative of not having RecordWriters write to this magic directory seems more daunting considering this bit of Hadoop changes every release. , changes protected to public, Users can get the task's temporary output path from the api FileOutputFormat.getWorkOutputPath(), where he can create side files and etc. 
The method FileOutputFormat.getTaskOutputPath() is used internally by the RecordWriters. And it is protected sothat outputFormats extending FileOutputFormat can use this in RecordWriters. I dont see a reason why this should be made public., We prefer it public because we write through the FileOutputFormat class via a RecordWriter, which internally (magically) inserts the temp path and task id path at the end of the intended path. 

This is done so that speculative execution will succeed. And we would like to benefit from this behavior, so aren't really asking that it change.

The side effect is that we have no way of finding the actual location of the data written and then moving it to where it was intended to be written. 

Since we don't have multiple (named) output collectors, we must emulate the behavior through our own api., I just committed this. Thanks, Chris!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #644 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/644/])
    , I see this is marked as fixed for 0.20. Any way it can leak into the 0.19.x release?, Now this is pushed to the 0.19 branch, Jira should reflect the change., Great news, thanks!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #648 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/648/])
    Move  to 0.19.0
