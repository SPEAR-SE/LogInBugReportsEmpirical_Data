[One possible/conceptual approach is viewfs issues a virtual-token.  The real token for the underlying mount point of a path would be dynamically acquired on-demand and cached.  The viewfs token's renewer would need to be aware of these cached tokens so the renew/cancel methods operate on all acquired tokens.  The UGI would need to be updated to allow the ipc client to locate the tokens., Is this related to HADOOP-7950?, I thought of this while reflecting on HADOOP-7933, although I believe the issue pre-dates that jira.]
