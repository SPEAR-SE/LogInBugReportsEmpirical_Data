Nits:
- The System.err.println on line 111 in the test seems gratuitous
- On line 112 perhaps s/contains/equals/ since you're explicitly looking for the Timer objects, Unfortuntaely the Timer threads have java.util.TimerThread on the stack, but this class is a private "implementation detail" class. To work across different JVMs I elected to just look for the word "Timer" - make sense?

Will fix the println, Makes sense.
