[Is this problem still seen? Some of the committed patches appear to have resolved this issue, no?, It was observed just twice, in the same timeframe.

I'm not aware of any patches that attempt to address this. Logging was added though.
Let's wait a while before closing, unless there's a specific fix., Looks like HADOOP-178 addresses this. Let's monitor and re-open if it manifests again.]
