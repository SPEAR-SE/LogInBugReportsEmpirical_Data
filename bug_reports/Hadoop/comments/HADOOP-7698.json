[Add a check for x86_64.
Add a fail if arch isn't set instead of trying to download a file with an unexpanded property in it., -1, for os.arch set to x86_64.  This means the compilation is done on MacOSX.  Build on Mac should not include linux jsvc binary because the native library and jsvc would not work.  Therefore, this was excluded intentionally.

This message is automatically generated., Since we no longer carry jsvc in our build, this is not a problem anymore. Please reopen if am incorrect. Thanks for the patch though (back then) Daryn!, Dang, I forgot to see this was 1.x related. Reopened to check 1.x now., Daryn's patch seems to work pretty well.
