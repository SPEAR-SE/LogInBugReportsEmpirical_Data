, ... except that's probably not the actual issue.

a) The limit was increased in trunk because of JDK8 + surefire upgrade.

b) Java threads show up as processes on Linux kernels.  Due to limits placed around # of processes, new threads can't be spawned.  Java mistakenly reports these as "out of memory".  See also INFRA-15685 where the limit is getting raised.

c) branch-2's version of surefire doesn't kill timed out unit tests properly.  This results in MASSIVE process counts, exacerbating the problem pointed out in B.  Since there are two executors on each build node which means that anything running alongside of a branch-2 build will likely die., [~aw] thanks for prompt reply.

ok.

Hoping INFRA-15685 will be pushed soon so that jenkins will be happy..will close this jira once INFRA is getting resolved..?

 AFAIK,this problem with only HDFS project., bq. Hoping INFRA-15685 will be pushed soon so that jenkins will be happy

Not likely. Someone should probably upgrade surefire since that helped trunk tremendously.  But branch-2 shows the problem significantly worse than trunk, so there are likely other things going on there too.  With the vendors having mostly decided to run their own testing pipelines, it's pretty much a community problem at this point.

bq. AFAIK,this problem with only HDFS project.

Mostly. Rarely common and sometimes MR.  See HDFS-12711 and any reports that talk about unreaped processes.  This has been a problem for months.  Yetus is just smart enough now to stop it from crashing the boxes.

, bq. branch-2's version of surefire doesn't kill timed out unit tests properly.

Sounds like we should upgrade surefire, unless there's a good reason not to, Committed as HADOOP-15279, thanks [~chris.douglas] and others for useful discussions.]
