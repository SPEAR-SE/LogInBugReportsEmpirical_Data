[Patch attached., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12349604/Hadoop-929.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r499156., We should really add a FilteredFileSystem that delegates all methods to a wrapped FileSystem implementation, as a base class for things like PhasedFileSystem.  In the meantime, this bug in PhasedFileSystem should be fixed., I just committed this.  Thanks, Sanjay!]
