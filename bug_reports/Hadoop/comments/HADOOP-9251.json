[i am getting around it by running mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-eclipse-plugin:2.6:eclipse, It went through after i cleaned up my maven cache., It's not sufficient to blow away your m2 repo. Per HADOOP-8924 you need to run mvn install before mvn eclipse:eclipse (and you may need to nuke a stale hadoop-maven-plugins directory is your m2 repo).]
