This message is automatically generated., Aaron, why not just move the static initialization to ipc.Server. Then there is not need to make a call ensureInitialized() right?, bq. Aaron, why not just move the static initialization to ipc.Server. Then there is not need to make a call ensureInitialized() right?

Because presumably o.a.h.ipc.Server is supposed to be independent of underlying {{RpcEngine}} implementations, which is why there's a {{resgisterProtocolEngine}} method in the first place. If that's not in fact a design goal, then sure, adding the initialization to {{ipc.Server}} is fine., Ignore my previous comment - will take a look at this issue more closely., +1 for your patch. I plan to cleanup this later. The way RpcEngines are initialized is not correct currently. Will clean it up later., Thanks a lot for your quick review, Suresh. I've just committed this to trunk., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1519 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1519/])
