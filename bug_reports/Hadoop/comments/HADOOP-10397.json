[we don't build native libs for the different versions of linux. furthermore, 2 different releases may have native libs for different versions of linux. 

if we want to address this, then we should build a tarball for each linux version. 

what i would do is refer your user to bigtop, they provide packages for the different linux distros with the corresponding native libs. 

i think the bug we have in the current release is having native libs, we should not (unless we do what i suggest at the beginning of this comment
 , This is a duplicate of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9911 

Alejandro: Fair enough, that you don't want to build multiple tarballs, but wouldn't it make sense to build the one and only tarball for 64bit linux? After all that is the deployment target of hadoop anyway, so having that instead of the 32bit version makes a lot more sense to me., your build process will have to span across all target OSes you want native libs for to build them, then you'll have namespace them per OS version, etc etc. you'll end up duplicating most of what bigtop does.

, Right now hadoop ships with one set of native libs which are  for linux 32bit. All I propose is switching to linux 64bit. That will cover almost all use cases and you don't have to build multiple tarballs. Make the one version you ship useful for your biggest user group makes sense to me. , I would be *very* cautious about setting expectations for having native libraries released as part of the tarball. In fact, I'd rather have them dropped completely. Otherwise you have to guarantee that you build on the lowest common denominator of the Linux OSes people are using and you essentially pin down your build environment. Something that I'm not sure all future Hadoop RMs are willing to do.]
