[Alejandro - here is a patch which adds only 'completed' jobs to the queue... could you give it a whirl and let me know? Thanks!, +1

tested the patch and it fixes the issue.

, Thanks to Alejandro for helping test this..., It would be very nice if the information about completed jobs is persitent and is NEVER lost.
Once it purged from JobTracker RAM, it should be moved into some persistent storage and still be retrievable., Arkady, all information is persisted already into 'JobTracker History' (link at bottom of JT's web-ui) regardless of whether the in-memory data-structures are purged or not... is there any enhancement you'd like to see there?, +1
