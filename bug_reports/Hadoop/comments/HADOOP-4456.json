[Christian, can you please confirm that the URI added to the DistributedCache was the form: hdfs//<namenode>:<port>/source#target?

The DistributedCache uses the 'URI fragment' as the target for the symlink..., Confirmed, I tried to reproduce this. But I couldnt.
I did mapred.create.symlink=yes and gave file to be symlinked as mapred.cache.files=hdfs://localhost:19000/user/amarsri/file.txt#file.  And I see symlinks created on branch 0.17 and also trunk., Did you try this with a pipes job?, Yes. I tried with the pipes job and also normal java job., Amareshwari looked at my job file and noticed that my setting was:
mapred.create.symlink=true
instead of
mapred.create.symlink=yes

My bad. Somehow I did not think this would make any difference.

Thanks, Amareshwari, for looking into it.]
