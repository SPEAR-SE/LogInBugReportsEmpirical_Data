Minor comments:
# Can you name {{fIBMJVM}} to {{IBMJVM}}?
# Can you please use java conditional operator ?: instead of if else., Good morning Suresh, yes I have signed and emailed icla. good suggestions, will make the modification ., Suresh, please review the latest patch.If it is acceptable, i will apply same changes into Branch2 patch. BTW, thanks for adding me as a contributor.   , Instead duplicating the logic in 2 different classes, wouldn't make sense to have in the SSLFactory class a {{public static String getCertificateType()}} method?, Alejandro, I like the way you think :) and I am in complete agreement. Our goal was to minimize number of files impacted by IBM JAVA enablement process . Will gladly make recommended modifications. Will resubmit the patch after executing all unit testcases, for regression, on both IBM and Oracle JAVA., modified trunk patch based on Alejandro recommendation.. please review, Thanks, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
