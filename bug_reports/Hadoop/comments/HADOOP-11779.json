[Hi Karthik! I hope you are aware of HADOOP-11746 . , Ravi - thanks for pointing that out. Nice to see it being reworked. Hope that takes care of this too, but I guess we ll only know once we start using the new version. , Closing this as fixed.  It's all related to the race conditions that were in test-patch and smart-apply-patch.]
