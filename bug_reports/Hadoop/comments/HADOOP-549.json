[Existing attachment is the patch:
readstringarray.patch (0.8 kb)
, This is not a bug in readStringArray, it is a bug inTaskReport's serialization. The _fix_ is to use read/writeStringArray., Since this changes the wire format of TaskReport, shouldn't it also increment the version of protocols and files that read & write TaskReport?  At a glance, I think that's just JobSubmissionProtocol., Actually, I think it is ok. The old serialization code would never work, so it is pretty clear that no one was actually using that method., -1, because the patch command could not apply the latest attachment (http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12341144/readstringarray.patch) as a patch to trunk revision r501616. Please note that this message is automatically generated and may represent a problem with the automation system and not the patch., This patch updates the fix, exports the functions via JobClient and adds calls to the offending functions to a unit test., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12350074/task-report.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r501946., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
