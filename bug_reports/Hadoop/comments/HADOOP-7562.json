[Unfortunately asf-mailer.conf isn't accessible to mere ASF mortals. Can someone with access please attach the current version of the file here? I can make a diff if so., +1 Right now all the commits for mapreduce are going to common. I think Ian might be able to do it? , From my read of the authorization file any committer may be able to read the directory, even if they cannot read directories above it.  Try to check out the following:

 https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/subversion

Regardless, here's a patch that I think does what we want.  Does this look right?  If so, I'll commit it., +1 looks good., Turns out committers cannot see this file.  PMC chairs are meant to maintain it.

I committed this.  Should do the right thing now.]
