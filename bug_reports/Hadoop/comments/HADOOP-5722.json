[Hi Marco,

To implement HADOOP-5469, I didn't need to open a new port; I merely added a servlet to the HTTP server already running.  (The relevant code snippet is below.)  If folks would like, it'd be easy to add if clauses around relevant methods.  Feel free to propose configuration names.

Unlike JMX, /metrics is read-only.  The scariest stuff it gives you access to is some of your JVM configuration and the counters for jobs running on JobTrackers.

{noformat}
  protected void addDefaultServlets() {
    // set up default servlets
    addServlet("stacks", "/stacks", StackServlet.class);
    addServlet("logLevel", "/logLevel", LogLevel.Servlet.class);
    addServlet("metrics", "/metrics", MetricsServlet.class);
  }
{noformat}, What about making the list of deployed servlets configurable? That way an administrator could choose any list of favorites, and no individual servle would have to test whether is was enabled or not., I'm going to dupe this to a new bug, as it isn't just metrics that has this problem now.]
