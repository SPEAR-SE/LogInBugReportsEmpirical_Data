[Let me know if any additional info is needed, I will reach out to customer/engr. Thx, Please file this issue under https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI, Hi Wei-Ching,

Accept my ignorance here & please gude:

Is there a way I can move this bug/issue to suggested bug/issue to AMBARI or I have to create new one?

Thanks,
Arun

, As suggested moved this to : AMBARI-15659, Hi [~aksingh],

This bug tracker is for Apache projects, not for Hortonworks.  It is good that Hortonworks is involved with Apache Zepplin, but Apache Zepplin is much more than "a new component in Tech Preview in the latest HDP stack."   Many other companies are involved.

You've filed several tickets now that seem like they don't belong on the Apache bug tracker, since they are vendor-specific.  Let's keep the vendor stuff to a minimum (this goes for other vendors as well, not just Hortonworks.)  Also, please don't file HADOOP jiras for issues with packaging... the HADOOP project manages hadoop core, YARN, and HDFS.  For packaging issues, I would start by asking your vendor, or perhaps emailing the BigTop list.

thanks., Hi Colin,

Understood. Please accept my apology for filing HortonWorks related issue at wrong place. 

Thanks,
Arun, Hi [~aksingh],

No problem.  Thanks for replying.  If you have any questions about where JIRAs should be filed, don't hesitate to ask on the mailing lists.

best,
Colin]
