[What version of Hadoop are you running into this error on? It is not 0.23.1 as you have marked here, since http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/common/tags/release-0.23.1/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/JobClient.java?view=markup does not show line 226 as a match with the stack trace., I apologize for the wrong version, This is the correct version <version>0.23.1-mr1-cdh4.0.0b2</version>, Thanks! This appears to be a CDH-specific error, so can you instead log a JIRA (just dupe this) at https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/DISTRO please? This JIRA is for Apache Hadoop related issues alone, and yours may be 0.23.1-mr1-cdh4.0.0b2 specific., Thank you I filed a ticket in there. ]
