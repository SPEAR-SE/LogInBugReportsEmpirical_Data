[As per [RFC|http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt] specification type and sub type can be followed by parameters separated by ";"

So, I think its sufficient to check as {{conn.getContentType().startsWIth("application/json")}}

[~stevel@apache.org] please let me know your opinion., yes to starts with, but the case conversion may also want to go {{toLower(EN_US)}} (oh, and handle a null content-type), which the first check does, I think, we no need to pass EN_US.Correct me If I am wrong....Attaching the patch,,kindly review.., \\
