This message is automatically generated., The Jobsubmitter was passing classpaths to the DistributedCache without the protocol. This caused issues in local mode.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Abin!

Thanks for your contribution! Please refer to Matt's comment (from when I first started :-))
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2011?focusedCommentId=13041707&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13041707
Also, please consider reading http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute . The two things I'd recommend are using 2 spaces for indentation and following the 80 char limit per line.

I noticed that the change was made as part of MAPREDUCE-181 . Before that it used to be what you are proposing. Do you understand why that change might / might not be relevant any more? I can review the test code once we finalize the src/main code.
