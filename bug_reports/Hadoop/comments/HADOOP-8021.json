[@Anupam,
 I dont uderstand how this is different from running from CLI. Both of them should call Configuration.load(). Why is there a difference?, @Mahadev, 
There seem to be 2 different overlapping bugs, one in the Hadoop code that HADOOP-7993 addressed and a second one in PIG for which I filed the linked JIRA (please see description for my detailed analysis).]
