{code}, +1 on the patch. Please ensure that "ant test" goes through with the patch.
BTW while reviewing this patch, I noticed that the JobHistory calls use the user's jobconf to create/read history file paths on both hadoop.job.history.location and hadoop.job.history.user.location. This should be fixed (in a separate jira) to use the JobTracker's conf for the history files on hadoop.job.history.location., Attaching a patch incorporating Devaraj's comments. Ant test passes on my box., I just committed this to the 0.19, 0.20 branches and trunk. Thanks, Amar!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #778 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/778/])
