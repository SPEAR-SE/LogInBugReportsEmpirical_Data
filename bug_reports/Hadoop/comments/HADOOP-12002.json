It'd be better to loop over all the executables and print out all of them that aren't found, then give the -1 and return. Right now, if someone is missing several of them they'll probably have to run through multiple times., Thanks [~busbey], I revised the patch.

This message was automatically generated., * Generate a -1 jira table for every missing executable.  This simplifies the code and gets rid of a lot of excess variables.
* We can drop the extra line feed, so just just use echo instead of the more complex printf 
* This isn't java, we don't need camelCase or really long names. ;) (e.g., findbugsExecutable)  [Yes, i recognize I didn't purge them out the first time, but we should make the effort to get rid of them when we can.]
* Remove the extra check:
{code}
if ! [[ -f "${findbugsExecutablePath}" && -x "${findbugsExecutablePath}" ]];
{code}

-x should fail if the file doesn't exist., Thanks [~aw], I'd like to discuss about the last point.
Without -f condition, the expression returns true also if the path is a directory, not only a real executable. On the other hand, I feel checking with -f is too strict because it is very rare case. Should I remove this condition?, bq. Without -f condition, the expression returns true also if the path is a directory, not only a real executable. 

I always forget that because as you said:

bq.  it is very rare case.

Frankly, I would have put this entire JIRA as a rare case. ( I mean, why would you only install only one of the findbugs binaries when we are clearly requesting the findbugs home and not the location of the findbugs exec???)  So I guess leave it in since people get confused., The mistake I made was to set {{FINDBUGS_HOME}} to  {{/usr/local/Cellar/findbugs/3.0.0}} instead of {{/usr/local/Cellar/findbugs/3.0.0/libexec}} as specified below. So this issue is indeed not as common as I thought it would be. That said, adding a +1 due to an invalid {{FINDBUGS_HOME}} could cause unnecessary patch iterations on the corresponding JIRA (as it did in my case).

, after HADOOP-12030 those would be -1s with some kind of "I couldn't run findbugs" message, I think.

this'll need a rebase for the change in HADOOP-12030, and I think we might use more executables now., Closing as won't fix.  test-patch has been replaced by Yetus.  This bug is already fixed there.]
