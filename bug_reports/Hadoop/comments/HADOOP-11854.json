[Currently two issues I linked this jira...If anyone disagree this approach, I will close this parent jira ( spending time on this also might not good,,anyway I am thinking to assign to newbie's) ...waiting for someone give their opinion.., Here's a list of the spelling errors I've run across.  It's very likely that someone will have to merge several batches of such errors found., Good collection...Thinking to raise separate issue for this and link to this issue.., [~jghoman] kindly review attached patch which contains bunch of typo's which is given by [~rchiang]....I will assigne this jira to him...., \\

This message was automatically generated., One other thing to be aware of.  The last time I tried submitting a bunch of typo fixes to multiple projects, I ran into Jenkins issues with HADOOP-11320.  It looks like the previous patch I submitted works okay (i.e. it gets a Jenkins update), but it could result in issues if this patch covers a lot of files., Found some more typos., * The changes to {{TestCompositeService.java}} incorrectly change coments naming a state ({{INITED}}) to "initialized" (same may apply to {{MRAppMaster}}
* Could correcting the spelling error in {{JobHistoryEventHandler}} break tools searching for the misspelled string? Didn't look at the context

These are pretty funny:
{noformat}
- * Unless required by joblicable law or agreed to in writing, software
+ * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
{noformat}

In the future, please try to break this up into smaller patches, per-subproject. Will run an updated version through Jenkins to re-test, * Reverted changes to {{TestCompositeService}}
* Reverted:
{noformat}
-        tEvent.addEventInfo("WORKLFOW_ID", jse.getWorkflowId());
+        tEvent.addEventInfo("WORKFLOW_ID", jse.getWorkflowId());
{noformat}
Since someone downstream may depend on it. This should still get fixed, but in a separate JIRA (with appropriate changes for branch-2/trunk), [~chris.douglas] thanks a lot for taking a look into this issue..

{quote}In the future, please try to break this up into smaller patches, per-subproject.{quote}
Yes, 


will raise seperate jira to handle the following.
{code}tEvent.addEventInfo("WORKLFOW_ID", jse.getWorkflowId());{code}, \\

This message was automatically generated., The test output is already gone... [~aw] any suggestions? Or should we just break this up?, I'm fine with breaking it into per-project or per-subproject., That'd be helpful, thanks. Could you add them as subtasks to this JIRA?, Will do., The longer a test run executes on Jenkins, the less reliable it gets. (Just to be clear, this is a Jenkins thing not a test-patch thing.) At a runtime of 504m 57s, that's exceptionally long., Sorry for the delay.  It took me a while to clean up the checkstyle/javadoc/whitespace issues.  This is the version I'll be basing the JIRA subtasks on., Cancelling the patch and killing the jenkins run.

The whole point of breaking up the patch is not kill the Jenkins servers..., Thank Allen, I should have thought of that.  I put up the latest patch as a reference., [~rchiang], if this isn't being worked on atm, do you mind assigning it to me?
I can look into it.

Thank you., Done.  Thanks for taking over.]
