This message is automatically generated., Thanks.  Patch looks good.  Are you going to use isRpcInvocation(..) in other packages so that you change it to public?  If yes, please add javadoc., You're right, Nicholas. isRpcInvocation now does not need to be public. Update the patch to change it to default., Hey Jing, change makes sense to me. One question: is this causing any acute problems? Any scenarios where you've actually scene this issue surface?, I actually think that you are going to use it somewhere.  If not, please also remove public from the RetryInvocationHandler class.  +1 after that., Update the patch to remove "public" for RetryInvocationHandler., bq. One question: is this causing any acute problems? 

Thanks for the comments Aaron. So without the patch the code 
{code}
if (isRpc) {
  Client.setCallIdAndRetryCount(callId, retries);
}
{code}
will not be triggered. In that case client's retry can have different "clientId + callId" and the retry cache in NN will not be hit.
, Ah, got it. Makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.

Not a big deal, but in the future you might want to include a little explanation of the user-facing problem in the description of the JIRA, rather than just describing the code change. That way people like me won't have to ask. :), bq. include a little explanation of the user-facing problem in the description of the JIRA

My bad.. I've update the description to provide more context information., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
