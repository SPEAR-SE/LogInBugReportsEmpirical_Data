[Restore hadoop-config.sh back to use for loop for constructing class path for jsvc, For what it's worth, I've had good luck asking the jsvc folks for compatibility fixes.  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DAEMON-208 was fairly similar.  Might be worth filing a bug with jsvc.

-- Philip, Apache Daemon has a fix for this:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DAEMON-166
We probably should update our jsvc dependency., When taking care of HDFS-2289 I can bump up common-daemon to the latest release (1.0.7). Makes sense?, Agree.  Thank you, Alejandro., Alejandro - http://archive.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/ only has binaries upto 1.0.5 (we need to d/w jsvc from there).

Also, I'm having trouble with commons-daemon-1.0.5 since it has an additional dependency on libpcap - not sure it's worth it. OTOH I can get everything working with 1.0.3 - can we just stick to that version? , Not a problem if we upgrade commons-daemon to 1.0.3]
