[4606_20081106.patch: check existence before cygpath., It would be better to create the path. You still need to run cygpath on it, or java will do the wrong thing inside of log4j., 4606_20081113.patch: use -w instead of -d

-w won't have error if the path does not exist., I just committed this. Thanks, Nicholas!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #661 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/661/])
    . Fix cygpath error if the log directory does not exist.
