[Bruno, 
 What maven command were you trying? The findbugs one does wait on input. I just added < /dev/null in test-patch.sh to work around that., Here is the command I type:
mvn3 -Pdist -Pnative -Dtar -DskipTests -Psrc -Pdocs -DskipTest -DskipITs package, The latest commit in my repository is:
"Merge -c 1195876 from trunk to branch-0.23 to fix HADOOP-7789."

And still see the issue., I'm running into this while trying to build Cloudera's CDH4 source tarball., Closing as stale.]
