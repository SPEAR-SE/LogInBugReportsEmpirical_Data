* switch to ubuntu:trusty
* "manually" install the latest JDK7, [~cnauroth], could you do a quick review since this is very broken and impacting folks for the bug bash?

Thanks!, +1 launched container and built successfully.

Also just noticed that start-build-env.sh lacks execute permissions., awesome thanks.  I'll fix the perms while I'm there. lol

Committing this in a bit., +1 from me too.  It's unfortunate that the image went stale so quickly.  Thanks for fixing it., committed to trustworthy sources and branch-2.

Thanks folks. Now hopefully my email will calm down for bug bash. lol, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7761 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7761/])
