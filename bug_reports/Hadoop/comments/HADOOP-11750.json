[DistCp is for hdfs:  to hdfs: copies only; you will have to use {{dfs -cp}} instead. Closing as invalid, Hi [~stevel@apache.org], thank you for reviewing this issue. 

If we use "dfs -cp", it is a single "JVM" serial copy, right? What if users want to copy 10TB data from swift to HDFS? Serial copy is impractical.

 IMHO, DistCp is a tool that can help people copy data across different filesystems in parallel but not limited to HDFS. Our team is working on resolving this problem, please at least leave one or two days for further discussion before close it directly.]
