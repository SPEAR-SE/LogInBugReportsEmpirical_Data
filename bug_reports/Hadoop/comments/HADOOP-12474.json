This message was automatically generated., Thanks Mingliang for picking this up. The patch looks good to me. One nit:

{code}
-    private int inPort = -1;
+    private int inPort = 0;
{code}

It can be simplified as {{private int inPort;}}., Thank you [~wheat9] for you review. It makes perfect sense to me that the class field will be initialized with default value (which is 0). The v1 patch address this., \\
