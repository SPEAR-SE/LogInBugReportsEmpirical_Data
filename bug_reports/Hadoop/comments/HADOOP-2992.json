[This patch fixes the following problems.
- Ordering of the registered distributed upgrade objects in UpgradeObjectCollection is corrected.
- UpgradeManagerDatanode starts a new upgrade when requested by the name-node.
- I improved the upgrade state reporting.
- TestDistributedUpgrade is testing 3 sequential upgrades now from a pre-upgrade data (LV=-3). 
It uses TestDFSUpgradeFromImage in order to unpack the storage.
- I separate the unpacking method into TestDFSUpgradeFromImage.unpackStorage()
- I also turned off the block scanner for both of these tests, because the name-node is in safe mode most of the time,
and the scanner is just receiving safe-mode exceptions, which only slows down the tests., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
