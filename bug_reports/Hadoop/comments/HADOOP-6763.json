committed to trunk, why didn't this make into a release (I'm using 0.21.0)?, it was committed to trunk on in May 2010. If 0.21 was cut before that, then the fix needs to be ported manually to it., okay, then shouldn't the fix version be set to 0.22?, $ svn co -r 941662 http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-0.21/ hadoop
$ ant -f hadoop/build.xml

I still get verbose logging at each command
11/05/11 22:45:39 INFO security.Groups: Group mapping impl=org.apache.hadoop.security.ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping; cacheTimeout=300000
, Yes, this should have fix version 0.22.]
