[I have a patch available for the issue. 

We found another minor issue where the log filename is wrong for one job.

Here is the second issue:
$GRID_MIX_HOME/monsterQuery/monster_query.small  2>&1 > monster_query.medium.$i.out &

The small job is logging to a file called medium. Fixed that as well.

Looks good.
