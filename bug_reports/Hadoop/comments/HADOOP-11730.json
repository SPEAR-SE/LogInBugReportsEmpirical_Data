Here's the patch in sync with trunk; it also incorporates HADOOP-11851 in the close logic, as they go hand in hand. We can't have the recovery process damaged by ConnectionReset exceptions being picked up while it closes the old stream., patch applied; tested against s3 EU.

Given the nature of these problems, it may be good to start thinking about whether we can do things with better simulate failures; the test here is a good start, though we may want more complex policies...mockito might be the tool to reach for., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7653 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7653/])
