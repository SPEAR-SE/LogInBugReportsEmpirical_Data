[Can you please check what version of the ant is actually used in building the hadoop binary package? 

I had filed an issue [HADOOP-4503|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4503] sometime back with respect to version information not being propagated, I am not sure by introduction of ivy if we did upgrade our ant also.
, ant-1.7.1 was used for compiling the build., If this is an issue at all, it's not a problem with the public builds., This issue is there in public builds also. It is in branch 0.18 and occurs if compilation is done using ant1.7 but it works fine with ant-1.6.5.
Problem seems to be with "package-info.java". For further details, please refer to bug HADOOP:4503 which is almost of similar nature.]
