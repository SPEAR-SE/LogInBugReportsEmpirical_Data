[Remove the deprecated method Path#makeQualified(FileSystem) and change all callers to use the newer indicated method., Also the javadoc improvements mentioned here would be nice:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4952?focusedCommentId=12756666&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12756666, Path#isAbsolute() is either badly named or incorrectly implemented.
If the intended spec was Path#isUriPathAbsolute(), then deprecate isAbsolute() and change its caller.
If the intended spec was "slash-pathname without a scheme and authority" (e.g. /foo/bar"),  then its implementation should be fixed (this unfortunately will require using slightly different method name to avoid breaking apps with change in semantics), The javadoc for Path#isAbsolute() is currently malformed since there are two comment blocks ({{/** ...*/}}). Only the second is displayed in the generated API documentation., There are a lot of random jiras involving Path.  With HCFS, is this jira still viable?]
