[Here is the patch. I have used the patch from HADOOP-7767 to create this updated list of deprecated properties. I have included an updated version that cleanly applies to trunk of the HADOOP-7767 patch. I think it is helpful to also commit this, so it can be easily used for future updates., The entries for mapred.create.symlink and mapreduce.job.cache.symlink.create are dropped in the patch, which looks wrong. Otherwise, +1., Many thanks Tom for the review! I have looked at why these two properties were dropped. This was a result of MAPREDUCE-4493 changes:

In ConfigUtil.java:

{code}
-    Configuration.addDeprecation("mapred.create.symlink", 
-      new String[] {MRJobConfig.CACHE_SYMLINK});
{code}

And then the doc was added to DeprecatedProperties.apt.vm:

{code}
-|mapred.create.symlink | mapreduce.job.cache.symlink.create
+|mapred.create.symlink | NONE - symlinking is always on
+*---+---+
+|mapreduce.job.cache.symlink.create | NONE - symlinking is always on
{code}

This is why these two properties were automatically dropped. I think dropping them is fine though. This document lists the deprecated properties and their replacements but these two properties are not deprecated, they are always on. So this apt document may not be the place to convey that. What do you think? I am also CCing Bobby to see if he has a different opinion. Any thoughts?, How about adding these two properties to a separate table on the same page? Alternatively a comment in the release notes., Thanks Tom! I have added them in a separate table at the end. Here is the new patch., I generated the documentation and it looked fine. +1 pending Jenkins. , The Jenkins job is timing out when running the HDFS tests - https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/1436/console. The HDFS pre-commit jobs are passing fine though - e.g. https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/3180/console. I'm not sure why.

Ahmed, can you run test-patch and post the results here please?, Thanks Tom, here is an updated patch that gets rid of a couple of javac warning that test-patch revealed. 

The test-patch results for the new patch:

{code}

-1 overall.  

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    -1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
                        Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.

, Hey guys,

Looks like this change introduced a findbugs warning:
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/1462//artifact/trunk/patchprocess/newPatchFindbugsWarningshadoop-common.html, This is weird, I don't know why it wasn't showing on my report here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8780?focusedCommentId=13454161&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13454161

I am attaching a minor amendment that takes care of this findbugs warning.

Eli, Tom mentioned earlier that jenkins is not running test-patch as it is timing out when running the hdfs tests. Any idea how to fix that so we can directly get the test-patch report?, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #1166 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1166/])

, bq. Eli, Tom mentioned earlier that jenkins is not running test-patch as it is timing out when running the hdfs tests. Any idea how to fix that so we can directly get the test-patch report?

Jenkins is running test-patch fine in other hadoop runs, eg see HADOOP-8812 which is how I noticed this one.  Please file a new jira with patch for the findbugs fix. 
, Looks like Suresh filed HADOOP-8821 with a fix for this.]
