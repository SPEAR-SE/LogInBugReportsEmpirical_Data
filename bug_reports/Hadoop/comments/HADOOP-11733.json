[Can we move these writes to be within a target directory instead?

It's maven best practice to avoid writing out side of the build directory. It'll also do a better job of e.g. allowing us to run tests in parallel., Yes ! I did not think about the risk of 2 guy running tests in parallel.
There is a risk to produce wrong results.
Good idea !
So, is this JIRA still Minor ? or Major ?, Since the work-arounds are pretty easy ("don't run tests in parallel" and "manually delete the directory in tmp"), I'd say still Minor., +1 for tracking down the individual tests that write to /tmp and changing them to write to the directory defined by the {{test.build.dir}} system property.  That's how we've handled problems like this in the past, but I guess a few new cases of writing to /tmp have been introduced., bq. +1 for tracking down the individual tests that write to /tmp and changing them to write to the directory defined by the {{test.build.dir}} system property.
Make sense to me but I'm thinking the cause of this issue is different.
* For hadoop-root, property "hadoop.tmp.dir" is set to /tmp/hadoop-${user.name} by default, so some files are created in /tmp. We should override the configuration in tests.
* For hsperfdata_root, I'm thinking it's a java issue. You can change {{java.io.tmpdir}} to the directory different from /tmp to avoid the issue.
* For Jetty and hdfs-nfs, we should change some configurations to avoid writing to /tmp. Now I'm not sure what configuration to change.]
