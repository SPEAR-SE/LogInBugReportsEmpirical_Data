[This could be mostly because of HADOOP-5269 and HADOOP-5235. There are committed to branch 0.19.2. Can you please try out 0.19.2 by checking out branch 0.19 ?, I also meet this such issue.

After a long time running of MapReduce (about 200 jobs have completed).  The MapReduce job is huaguped forever.
(1) The JobTracker always logs:
2009-03-17 16:29:39,997 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker: Serious problem.  While updating status, cannot find taskid attempt_200903171247_0387_m_000015_1

(2) The Job cannot complete and stopp at 79% forever.

(3) All TaskTrackers may hungup at the sametime, since the logs of each TaskTracer stop at that time.


And nefore the hangup. I can also find odds and ends such logs of JobTracker, such as.
2009-03-17 16:29:21,767 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker: Serious problem.  While updating status, cannot find taskid attempt_200903171247_0387_m_000015_1


And another experience is:
One time, I found the task slot cannot reach the capability, maybe some slot is also hungup., I am using branch-0.19, it seems fine., Got fixed in 0.19.2]
