[I'm attaching the backport patch.  The prior jiras included in this backport are: HADOOP-6522, HADOOP-7547 (partially), HADOOP-9103, HDFS-3844 (partially), and HDFS-4282.

Porting in the new tests also required including several dependency classes that previously didn't exist in branch-1: {{Time}}, {{GenericTestUtils}} and {{TimedOutTestsListener}}.

One of the changes in trunk had been in {{FSImageSerialization}}, which doesn't exist in branch-1.  I made the equivalent change in {{FSImage}}., I'm uploading version 2 of the patch.  I realized that the Guava dependency caused by {{GenericTestUtils}} could be problematic.  This version of the patch does not introduce a Guava dependency, and instead uses a stripped down version of {{GenericTestUtils}} that contains just enough to support the new tests in {{TestUTF8}}., +1 patch looks good.

Please run all the unit tests and post the results., Thanks, Nicholas.  I'll report back when I have the test results.  Here is the test-patch output.  Regarding findbugs, it appears that the filterBugs command in test-patch.sh is not actually filtering out anything.  I've seen mention of other people having this problem on the mailing lists.  It's unrelated to this patch.

, I also have run test-patch.  I consistently see 19 Findbugs warnings in my machine.  So that I believe they are not related to the patch.

, I have committed this.  Thanks, Chris!, Thanks very much for the review and commit.

Just to document it, my full test run came back successful.  There was just 1 failure in {{TestBalancerWithNodeGroup}}, which is known to be a flaky test., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
