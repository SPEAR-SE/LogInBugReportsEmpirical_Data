[The only thing I changed in {{TestUserGroupInformation.java}} was to change the order of the test cases. Without the corresponding change to {{UserGroupInformation.java}}, this modified test fails., I don't think we need the following code anymore:
{code}
       if (result == null) {
         result = new ArrayList<String>();
       }
{code}
right?

Also, any reason that you've relocated the testLogin method?, oh, now I understand: reordering the tests makes it fail. Then, fixing UGI makes it pass again., bq. I don't think we need the following code anymore:

Perhaps, but only incidentally so because the underlying implementations of the {{Groups}} interface happen to do this themselves.

I can remove it if you want, but it seems like leaving it in will only potentially be helpful., well, if the underlying implementation returned null, then it would be a bug, right? In which case this behavior would be masking the bug in the underlying implementation., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
