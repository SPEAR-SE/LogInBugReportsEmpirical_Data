[The easiest way to see the problem is to run ant test-patch with a no-op (empty) patch file:

touch /tmp/empty && ant -Dforrest.home=/Users/chris/apache-forrest-0.9 -Dfindbugs.home=/Users/chris/findbugs-1.3.9 -Dpatch.file=/tmp/empty test-patch

     [exec] -1 overall.  
     [exec] 
     [exec]     +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.
     [exec] 
     [exec]     -1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
     [exec]                         Please justify why no tests are needed for this patch.
     [exec] 
     [exec]     +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.
     [exec] 
     [exec]     +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.
     [exec] 
     [exec]     -1 findbugs.  The patch appears to introduce 14 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.
