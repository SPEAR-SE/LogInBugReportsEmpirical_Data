[On trunk a lot of the documentation uses the current symlink, so generated docs for an old release contain pointers to new documentation that the release does not support. 

I think these links should be relative links, looks like they're using absolute urls because they point to generated files and forrest will complain about broken links if relative links are specified and the target files do not exist when forrest is run. One fix is to create empty xml files (eg core-default.xml etc) in the docs that are later over-written. This way forrest won't complain about the relative link (and the link will point to the appropriate document)., This is not an issue in 2.x+ documentations.]
