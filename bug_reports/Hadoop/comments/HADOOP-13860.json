[Hi [~kasha], I would like to take care of this issue if possible. Are we more inclined to leave it as it is and document it or create the implementation? In case of the latter, should we follow a similar approach as YARN-5677 did?, IMO, we should implement it similar to YARN-5677. That said, I would defer the judgment to HDFS devs. [~atm] - do you have an opinion here? ]
