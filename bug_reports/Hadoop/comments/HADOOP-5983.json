[Hi Rajiv,

This issue has laid dormant for quite some time. Can you confirm whether or not this is still a problem? Thanks a lot., I cannot reproduce on trunk.  I am unable to find references to the mapred config in the namenode code.  To verify, I created a mapred-site.xml and local-mapred-site.xml with syntax errors.  The namenode starts w/o a problem., It probably might have been fixed in trunk. 

I still see this on our Y! internal 0.20.2xx branch. But this has been existed for a while and should be the same for a Apache Hadoop 0.20 release.

$ xmllint /conf/hadoop/namenode/mapred-site.xml

, Are you requesting for the bug to be reopened so it can be fixed on an older release?  

An aside: while this is likely a bug since the namenode shouldn't need the mapred conf, it seems odd to push an unneeded file to the namenode, but then not push it's dependencies.  It seems like it should be all-or-nothing operation.  Ie. Push both or neither?, 
This was opened for 0.20 when it was the current release. If its
validated in 0.22, I am ok. 


The dependencies might be more specific to our setup, but since
configuration gets serialized, a user can't have separate parameters for
hdfs and mapred . For eg: fs.default.name when a cluster has multiple
hdfs instances. 

, I can confirm that this issue still exists on branch-0.20-security. Reopening it so it can be fixed on that branch.

Daryn, do you have time/interest to address this issue for branch-0.20-security? If not, I'd like to unassign it or maybe assign it to myself., Unfortunately, no, I'm swamped with other 205 work.  Feel free to take it!  Perhaps you already debugged the issue and know this:
# the mapred-site.xml should not be read in the first place
# the reporter's mapred-site.xml includes local-mapred-site.xml, but the latter file does not exist
# I think the "solutions" are one of:
#- code change: Namenode doesn't include mapred-site.xml, but I very vaguely remember there was problem that made it a non-trivial change
#- user change: Don't have mapred-site.xml include a non-existent local-mapred-site.xml
#- user change: Create local-mapred-site.xml as a blank file

205 has a lot of change as it is, so I'd be hesitant to add another potentially incompatible change when the issue is arguably "user error".  Someone, somewhere, might incorrectly be relying on settings being read from mapred-site.xml that shouldn't be in that file.  I wouldn't make that case for anything but the 20.x line, but I'm by no means going to block the real fix if it's deemed necessary., Thanks for the update, Daryn. I agree with you that this change would in some sense be backward-incompatible, but in a very real sense it's a "feature" that we never intended to include in the first place. I'm certainly not married to this making it into 0.20.205 per se, but I do think it should get fixed on branch-0.20-security, for the purpose of future releases., Closing this again.]
