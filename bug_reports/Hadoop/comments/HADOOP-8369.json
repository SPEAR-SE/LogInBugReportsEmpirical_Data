[Hey Arun

TestFSMainOperationsLocalFileSystem and TestCodec (w/o -Pnative) both pass for me on the top of branch-2. What change did you run these at, and what specific tests failed?

TestViewFsTrash fails sporadically, this is HADOOP-8110, I'll take a look now, but don't think this flaky test a blocker for an alpha.

Thanks,
Eli, Thanks for taking a look Eli, downgrading from 'blocker'., Removing Fix-version. Please use Target-version for the intended release and let committers set the fix-version at commit time.]
