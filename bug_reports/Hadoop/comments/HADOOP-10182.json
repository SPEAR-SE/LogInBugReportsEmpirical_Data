bq. Formatting without an explicit request seems like a bad idea - a wrong configuration could easily end up formatting the znode of a different cluster. At the very least, if we decide to go this route, should have a config to disable/ enable this.
Just to clarify, when I say "format' in the context of this Jira I assume making sure that parent ZNodes exist. If parent ZNodes exist, no action will be performed. I don't think this can do any real damage. I will clarify this in the description of the Jira. Let me know what you think. I don't mind adding a config, but before doing so, would like to make sure it is really needed., Calling {{ActiveStandbyElector#ensureParentZNode}} immediately after creating the elector sounds reasonable to me. If that is the intention here, I agree it is a good idea and no need to add a config. Would modify the title/ summary in that case., bq.

Great, changed the bug title and description. Will attach the patch soon., Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0.]
