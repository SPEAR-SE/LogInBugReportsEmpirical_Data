[Marking this for 0.17.2 upon Rajiv's request, On branch 0.17, when a task gets a KILLTASKACTION and the tasktracker doesnt have anymore tasks running for that job, the job is removed from runningJobs data structure. So, when it gets a task for that job again, it does localize again, which is causing the Mkdirs to fail, because the job directory is not cleanedup properly. HADOOP-3370 has fixed the problem on 0.18.

I think HADOOP-3370 should be also be applied for 0.17. That will solve this issue.
Still, there could be garbage left on the jobcache, which is addressed by HADOOP-3386.
, +1 to applying 3370 on 17. , bq. because the job directory is not cleanedup properly
Job directory should not get cleanedup before the job completes because the shared scratch space will be lost.

I uploaded the patch for HADOOP-3370 for the branch 0.17.  And also the patch is tested. , Fixed by HADOOP-3370., "resolved as duplicate" means that "fixed version" should not be set.]
