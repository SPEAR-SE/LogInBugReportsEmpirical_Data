[Here's a patch that fixes the issue.  I'll work on a test now., Here is a patch that includes a couple of tests:
- renew token test that tests setData is used instead of create with ZK
- cancel token and verify, which requires that the znode was actually deleted

new tests fail without the code changes, pass with them., +1 Looks straight forward... Thanks for the test cases [~gchanan], {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
