I manually ran findbugs again. There is no difference before/after the patch: Both have the same 217 warnings., Another patch for TRUNK., Resubmiting the same trunk patch for jenkins to pick up.,  I am concerned about adding another configuration for negative caching. Every new configuration parameter adds to operational complexity. I was wondering how serious is the issue that empty groups are cached? The groups will be recovered after cache expires. How long is the cache expiry?, The config for negative cache seems like an overkill. I'd suggest that we just handle the transient failures better., We use a refresh cycle of 4 hrs. It becomes a serious issue when headless users associated with tight SLA jobs get in there. This behavior is not a hypothetical one. We've seen this in production. 

I do agree with you on the problem of having too many configs, but we often end up going this route in (sometimes justifiable) fear of breaking compatibility even if the bug is clearly there and in need of fix. I would appreciate your further input on how we can address the issue with the minimum negative impact. , bq. I do agree with you on the problem of having too many configs, but we often end up going this route in (sometimes justifiable) fear of breaking compatibility even if the bug is clearly there and in need of fix. I would appreciate your further input on how we can address the issue with the minimum negative impact.

The problem of operability is not in having too many configs, but in having too many configs that one *needs to tweak.* I think having a config for this is fine, as long as we choose the correct default. If after deploying this on a cluster an operator decides they want to change the behavior, they'll be very happy there's a config to do it, so they won't have to recompile/redeploy., Thinking about it, it may make sense to not cache negatives at all (I don't think the original implementation aimed to handle this use-case). I can't imagine a situation where we'd have many queries for non-existent users (so we'd still be fine with not overloading the infrastructure, like ldap, which was the primary motivation for the cache). Does that make sense?, bq. Thinking about it, it may make sense to not cache negatives at all.

I initially thought so, but was not sure about the original design goal of the group caching. On many systems, nscd or equivalent can do negative caching to reduce unnecessary network traffic to ldap server, etc. So removing the behavior might not be too much of concern., I agree with devaraj's proposal. Too many queries for a non-existent user should happen only in case of a security attack, but authentication should prevent any rogue user if security is enabled. , The new patch removes the negative caching behavior. The test case was modified accordingly., Hudson appears to be down.  I looked over the patch and it looks good.  +1 assuming that the tests pass when I run them manually., bq. Hudson appears to be down.

I actually think Jenkins itself is fine, but for some reason test-patch builds aren't getting triggered automatically when new patches are uploaded. I've just kicked Jenkins manually to run test-patch for this JIRA: https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/724/

Thanks Kihwal.  I just checked this into trunk, branch-0.23, branch-1 and branch-1.0.  I plan to check this into branch-0.23.2 shortly too, and I will resolve the JIRA once I put it into 0.23.2, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #1905 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/1905/])
