[Can't fix something in an already-released version., The -k (lowercase) flag is to specify the name of the keypair as created by the ec2-add-keypair command during set up (see the Getting Started Guide http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2007-08-29/GettingStartedGuide/).

The -K (uppercase) flag is to specify the path to the private key on the local filesystem. It is not used by the scripts since it is assumed that the EC2_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable has been set (as suggested in the Getting Started Guide).]
