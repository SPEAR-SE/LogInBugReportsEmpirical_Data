[To fix this, I propose
# the javadocs for the out of range -> empty array policy is defined. The test {{TestGetFileBlockLocations}} does implicitly test for this against the default FS, but it isn't part of the contract test suite.
# The expected behaviour for a directory argument needs to be defined, an FS Contract test written, and all filesystems for which there is built in support must pass the test., The current behaviour from the base class is (unintetionally?) to return an empty location array on a directory.

This is a consequence of a directory having length 0, so the "gone off the end of the file" logic kicks in
{code}
    if (status.getLen() <= start) {
      return new BlockLocation[0];
    }
{code}]
