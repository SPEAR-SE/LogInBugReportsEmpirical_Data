[I briefly tried stuff around https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/94ca52ae9ec0ae04854d726bf2ac1bc457b96a9c/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/CMakeLists.txt#L171 but still failed. , I think, but I'm not sure, that the basic problem is that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH/DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH/linked runpath isn't getting set correctly when the native libraries are getting tested.]
