[HADOOP-14507 actually reverts the change in HADOOP-14135. That is: it restores the constructor args of 2.6-2.8. Which is why I wasn't worried about incompatibility there, see HADOOP-14723 for that. Looks like it isn't in branch-2 at all. If we want to reinstate the HADOOP-14135 change in trunk, we should think about adding HADOOP-14507 to branch-2 as well., w.r.t. HADOOP-14935, not sure it's really a public API, so not worth worrying about. Though I don't see why NativeAzureFileSystem should have been tagged Public+Stable in the first place, as only the FileSystem API should be considered the API external code can use. Maybe downgrade to private there (I don't see anything in the compatibility doc on that topic tho', unless [~daniel@cloudera.com] has an opinion.

For HADOOP-14507, given branch-2 is still alive, I'd be happy with reinstating the 3-arg ctor there. and the 2-arg one to trunk. That way, you get to implement something which works in both places]
