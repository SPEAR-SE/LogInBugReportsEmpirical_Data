[This patch cleans it up, by making it more transparent as to what Configuration itself is doing.  The real problem now is that it now shows how convoluted some of what Configuration does.

For example mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.outputdir is set programmatically, but because it is set programmatically mapred.output.dir is also set.  But when job.xml is written out the HashMap backing Configuration will put mapred.output.dir after mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.outputdir. So when job.xml is read back in the source information for mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.outputdir indicates that it was set because mapred.output.dir was in job.xml.

I am not sure if there is a good way to not confuse customers unless we clean up Configuration to be less confusing or we stop reporting it to end users. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
