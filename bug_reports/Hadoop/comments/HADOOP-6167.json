[proposed new bin/hadoop script file.

The only change is in the last few lines., HBase scripts have the same issue since they were just copying things from Hadoop.. so they have the same bug.

Here is the related bug in HBase: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1687
, I'm not sure this is true, my datanode processes are running like so:

/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_14/bin/java -Xmx1000m -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Xmx2000m -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis (all the other arguments)

in hadoop-env.sh i have:
export HADOOP_DATANODE_OPTS="-Xmx2000m -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis ...."


how does this not work?, This might be better done by:
 - adding JAVA_HEAP_MAX to HADOOP_OPTS if it does not already contain -Xmx
 - removing JAVA_HEAP_MAX from the java command

Also, please attach a patch file, not the altered source file.

, Ok. this is the diff now.  Have a look, I cleaned it up a little to do what you suggested., bq. how does this not work?

I agree with ryan.  It does work as is (at least in our environment).
If the goal is to make it look better, I'm fine.

In our rhel environment, jvm gives preference to latter if argument is provided twice.
, Ok. So is this -Xmx behavior documented?

I guess not, but I guess it is working without any code change.. so you can mark this bug as "invalid" or some such..

sorry for the confusion., Having -Xmx listed multiple times is misleading and confusing.  It should be listed once, preferably near the beginning.  Using tools like 'top' with the front of the command line printed shouldn't lie.  IMO listing things as important as -Xmx twice is a bad idea regardless of the actual behavior., I agree with Scott.  This should be fixed., Closing this as a dupe of 9902 given that it has code in place to fix try to fix this issue.]
