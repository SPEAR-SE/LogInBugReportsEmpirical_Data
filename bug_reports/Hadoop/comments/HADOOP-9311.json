[Instead of throwing an exception on expiration, nullify the toek to force an authentication, Please code review., HADOOP-10301 has added a similar logic to address the issue:
{code}
      try {
        token = getToken(httpRequest);
      }
      catch (AuthenticationException ex) {
        LOG.warn("AuthenticationToken ignored: " + ex.getMessage());
        // will be sent back in a 401 unless filter authenticates
        authenticationEx = ex;
        token = null;
      }
{code}]
