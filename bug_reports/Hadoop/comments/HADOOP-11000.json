This message is automatically generated., It's a good catch Ming. The patch looks good. If I have a minor nit, the following code doesn't need to use if-else:

{code}
  private boolean isHealthCheckFailedException(Throwable t) {
    if ((t instanceof HealthCheckFailedException) ||
        (t instanceof RemoteException &&
        ((RemoteException)t).unwrapRemoteException(
            HealthCheckFailedException.class) instanceof
            HealthCheckFailedException)) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
{code}

It can simply be

{code}
  private boolean isHealthCheckFailedException(Throwable t) {
    return ((t instanceof HealthCheckFailedException) ||
        (t instanceof RemoteException &&
        ((RemoteException)t).unwrapRemoteException(
            HealthCheckFailedException.class) instanceof
            HealthCheckFailedException));
  }

Good finding [~mingma]. 
Though there is no much functional difference, correct state changes make sense., +1 from me too.  [~vinayrpet], I see you already +1'd a few months ago but did not commit.
