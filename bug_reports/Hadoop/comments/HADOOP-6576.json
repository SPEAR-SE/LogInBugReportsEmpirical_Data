[MAPREDUCE-1155 I believe fixes this, Here's the patch we've applied against the 0.20 branch of CDH (as a somewhat modified backport of MAPREDUCE-1155). NB this hasn't been tested against Apache branch-20. It's also a pretty big rework of the streaming tests, so perhaps not good for inclusion in Apache. But I figured I would contribute it in case it helps this issue., Thanks, Todd. MAPREDUCE-1155 was a worthwhile refactoring, so I'd have no problem including it in 0.20. What do you think about leaving out the changes to StreamJob for compatibility?, Hey Chris. Which StreamJob change are you referring to? Are you looking at the patch above or the original from the other issue? This one changes the following files:

, Thanks, you're right; I was looking at the patch for MAPREDUCE-1155. +1

I'd rather not rerun all the 0.20.2 tests to validate the change to the test config or add {{StringUtils::join}} just for the unit test. Attaching a version of the original, but with these minor nits addressed. All the streaming tests passed on the 0.20 branch, I committed this. Thanks, Todd!]
