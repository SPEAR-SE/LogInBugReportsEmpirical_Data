[Once HADOOP-4012 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4012) is accepted it will automatically resolve this issue as a side effect.
, Suhas, HADOOP-4012 got committed yesterday.  Do you want to confirm that fix resolves this bug for you?
, If HADOOP-4012 resolves this case, I'd like to keep this issue open to track the implementation of an appropriate unit test. If such a test could be completed for 0.21, that would be excellent.]
