[I looked at this problem. It stems from the fact that JobClient creates a new JobConf rather than use the Configuration from ToolBase. It would be nice to have a version of the CLI parsing library that wasn't based on ToolBase and OO inheritance, since clearly part of what happened here was too much OO magic not making the required usage clear., > It would be nice to have a version of the CLI parsing library that wasn't based on ToolBase and OO inheritance,

See GenericOptionsParser that Enis added under util. This is the one used by ToolBase., The problem is Ä±ndeed in the JobConf initialization. The patch fixes the problem, changes {{LocalJobRunner#getJobStatus}} and {{#getJobProfile}} to return null if job could not be found. Now we have undocumented feature that the methods at {{JobSubmissionProtocol}} expects valid arguments(existing jobid's), but  {{JobSubmissionProtocol#getJobStatus()}} and {{JobSubmissionProtocol#getJobProfile()}} does not.
