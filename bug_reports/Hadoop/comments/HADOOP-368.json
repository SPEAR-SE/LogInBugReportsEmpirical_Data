[1) I included calls to cleanup() for DistributedFSCheck and TestDFSIO.
DistributedFSCheck calls cleanup before and after execution of the main part.
After - in order to restore the files system state.
Before - in order to be able to run if the previous run failed.
TestDFSIO cleans up only within the unit test.
2) DistributedFSCheck snapshots files at the initial state and then reads them.
I added correct processing of files that have been snapshot but disappeared after that.
3) A bug fixed in DistributedFSCheck. The mapper did not seek to the required
offset when reading files.
, I just committed this.  Thanks, Konstantin.]
