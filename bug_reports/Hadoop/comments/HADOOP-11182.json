[Sascha, could you please upload a patch? I'm happy to commit it., Thanks Ravi. I have attached a patch but it's been the first time for me. I'm insecure as to whether I have done the right thing.
I created the patch relative to the trunk of the following SVN repository  (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/trunk), which was linked to from the official hadoop website. However, the most recent commits in there seem to be 6 weeks old.
, Thanks Sascha! This patch looks good to me. +1. I'll commit it pending a +1 from Hadoop QA. I've clicked on the "Submit Patch" button for you.

Recently Hadoop was moved from the old svn repository to git. You can clone the latest code from https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop.git . I'll file a JIRA to update the link. Thanks :-), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I resubmitted another path against the trunk of the git repo this time.
Also added a new unit test class as the GraphiteSink class didn't have a unit test class yet.
Added one test which fails if the fix is not applied but succeeds under the fix.

I was not able to go through with all "HowToContribute" suggestions though. Some strange things happened on my system like timeouts during test executions.
However, these failures seem to be unrelated to my patch. I also get a "The patch does not appear to apply with p0 to p2" from the dev-support script. No idea what this is supposed to mean, nor do I find anything on googling for that message.

I hope that this patch will do. I've spent about a day on it. If the patch still does not go through, it would be nice if someone more familiar with the workflow could make the modification on my behalf as it is just a single line of code that needs to be replaced in the code.

This message is automatically generated., the links contained in the above QA output all lead to HTTP 404 errors while a local execution of the dev-support script gives me a ""The patch does not appear to apply with p0 to p2" error and then aborts. 

I guess that means I'm stuck. ;)

I also have no idea what a release audit warning is., Hi Sascha! Thanks a lot for all your effort! 
That -1 release audit warning is probably because you haven't included the Apache license at the top of the new file you have introduced (TestGraphiteSink.java). By the way, there already was a file (TestGraphiteMetrics.java) . Could the test not have been added to that? In fact you are right, this patch was probably small enough that fixing the test which failed (TestMetricsSystemImpl) in the earlier patch would have been enough.
You are right about the 404. As a workaround you can check the console output or run test-patch yourself. The findbugs warning seems to be coming from a file not in this patch so we shouldn't have to worry about it.

I can't +1 a patch that I have uploaded. , Hi Ravi, Thanks for your help. I will try to make progress.
I can't find an existing TestGraphiteSink file in the trunk 
here http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/metrics2/sink/
or here https://github.com/apache/hadoop/tree/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/metrics2/sink
Can you advise?
Thanks
, Ah. I found the right Unit test class now and moved the new test into that one. Resubmitting the patch and keeping my fingers crossed. 
BTW:
I'm still unable to make use of any local patch testing. The run test-patch takes like forever and outputs many tests failures but nothing that would resemble the QA report. The Jenkins console output doesn't contain any findbug warnings. It just says in there that the findbug report got stored as a local file on Jenkins which I cannot access., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks a lot Sascha! The patch looks good to me. I'll commit it shortly.
Its strange that you are unable to run test-patch successfully. On my laptop it usually takes 15-20 minutes. I was then able to see the file newPatchFindbugsWarninghadoop-common.html in /tmp . I am uploading what was produced for your perusal (which btw I checked had no instance of metrics2) . I did get 67 warnings but I'm guessing that's probably an error in the test-patch. 

Its probably worthwhile to setup your dev environment properly if you plan on continuing to contribute. Unfortunately it is a bit of a chore right now :( , Thanks a lot Sacha! This patch is now committed to branch-2.6, branch-2 and trunk, Hi, [~raviprak]. It seems that the jira number is wrongly edited in the commit.
