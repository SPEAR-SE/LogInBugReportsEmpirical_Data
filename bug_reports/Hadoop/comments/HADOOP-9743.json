[[~jbonofre] I still these errors while doing a "mvn install" on the source code checked out from trunk.
Could you pls provide your pointers on how to resolve? Any patch to be applied?, Hello,

I saw the issue is resolved, but I was still facing the issue when doing my first Hadoop build for 3.0.0-alpha1. And here is my observation.

I think the issue occurs depending on how your internet provider handles the address lookup. When I am connected through my broadband provider I get the build failure. I observed that createQueryList() adds two dummy hosts 'n1' and 'unknown'. Now when I traceroute to these hosts while connected through broadband, I am returned with some random IP which is same for both the hostnames. But when I am not connected to internet or I am connected through my mobile data, traceroute gives the unknown host error. In this situation the build is also successfull for this test case in particular. So it makes me think that some ISP might be providing a random IP for unknown hosts and thereby forcing the client to think that host exists at that IP address. In my observation, since both the hosts are dummy ones,  ISP provides same randon IP and therefore test is landing up with single IP in the cache. I have not thought of any concrete resolution but turning off network helps resolves this issue (though it fails TestDNS test). 

Thought of sharing my observation. I hope this helps, if issue still exists.Pardon me for missing the resolution if any is provided.

Best Regards,
Paurav.]
