[org/apache/hadoop/mapred/lib/TestCombineFileInputFormat moved to org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/input/ as part of HADOOP-5698. I forgot to remove the empty file. 
I have now deleted the empty file org/apache/hadoop/mapred/lib/TestCombineFileInputFormat.java, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #863 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/863/])
