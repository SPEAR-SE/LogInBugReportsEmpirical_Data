[a\ntest, I propose that the jar files stay where they are and that bin/hadoop only include the hadoop-<version>.jar file in the classpath., Attached a simple patch that I'm currently still testing., Attached an updated patch.  A couple of tests that are run with
  bin/hadoop jar hadoop-*-test.jar ...
were failing after the changes to bin/hadoop because they were relying on the test jar to be in the task tracker classpath.

This patch is ready for review., I wonder if, rather than checking that the jar isn't named '-examples' or '-test', we should instead name the core core to be 'hadoop-XXX-core.jar', and then only add this to the classpath?, +1



, Attached new patch that changes the main hadoop jar file to hadoop-XXX-core.jar where XXX is the version.  Also updated bin/rcc and bin/hadoop to include in it's classpath just this jar file from the $HADOOP_HOME directory., I just committed this.  Thanks, Nigel!]
