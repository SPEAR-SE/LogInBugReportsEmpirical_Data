[this is probably a result of the way Ant's (classic) XML logger buffers the entire doc in memory, so that it can include summary statistics in the top level XML node.

Its failings are known, but there's no easy way to change it without breaking the current set of CI tools (though we could go from a different XML to the legacy XML via an XSL operation). I've proposed something XHTML-based that gets streamed out in the past., Ya, this is more of an Ant Junit problem.  I suggest we close this.  The workaround is to run with -Dtest.output=yes so that output goes to the console.  We do exactly this on Hudson builds so that timeout tests can be seen in the console log (which as a result is > 40 MB)., Now that Nigel has clarified saying Hudson builds *do* capture the output even in case of test time outs, and that it is more of an Ant and Junit problem, closing this issues as won't fix. ]
