[Sorry, incorrectÂ component. Should be MAPREDUCE., A "Fixed" resolution should only be used for cases where a patch has been committed.  Marking this as a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-7137.  Note that in the future JIRAs can be moved between projects rather than refiling them from scratch.  See the "Move" action under the "More" tab at the top of the JIRA.
, Thank you [~jlowe]. "Move" option is not available for me for now since I'm not added to the project., I added you as a contributor to the HADOOP and MAPREDUCE projects.
, Thank you a lot [~jlowe]. Appreciate your help.]
