[Is file2 an absolute path?  If I remember correctly, distcp cannot handle relative paths., This lets FileDataServlet share code with the browseDirectory service and redirects to a random datanode using ReplicationChooser now that zero-length blocks are not returned for zero-length files., Since the class FSNamesystem is package private, we can remove getDatanodeByIndex(int index)and randomDataNode() directly without deprecating them.
