[An updated jar is included in this attachment., this issue should also contain a patch file that updates
.eclipse.templates/.classpath with the new kfs jar name
otherwise Hudson will fail the contrib unit tests., A patch file eclipse classpath is included., This was tested locally. I ran tests and we used this to test it against the latest kfs deployement using the jar., I just committed this. Thank you Sriram., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #615 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/615/])]
