[Trying to expose federated namespace from within FSShell to get expunge working might be tricky and not very clean. Passing a filesystem argument to the expunge works and results in creating a timestamp-named directory inside trash and moves the contents under current to that dir.

For example, if one of the namespaces is called "namespace1" in the cluster, a command like the following will work:
{noformat}
$hadoop fs -fs hdfs://namespace1/  -expunge
13/09/27 23:07:06 INFO fs.TrashPolicyDefault: Created trash checkpoint: /user/hadoop/.Trash/130927230706
$ hadoop fs -ls hdfs://namespace1/user/hadoop/.Trash
Found 1 items
drwx------ - hadoop hadoop 0 2013-09-27 22:59 hdfs://namespace1/user/hadoop/.Trash/130927230706
$
{noformat}, Interestingly enough there is a workaround for the expunge by passing the URL to the fs command.
The help (boths docs and when typing "hdfs dfs" does not seem to show that additional optional argument.
w/o looking at the code users won't know about this workaround., I would like to work on this issue . 
[~vrushalic] , if you are working on this please reassign to you., Attached an initial patch .

This message was automatically generated., Source Fix looks good. 
But in test, test failure is actually not fixed. Its just not using {{TestLFS}} which have the different home directory.
Since {{LocalFileSystem}} have {{RawLocalFileSystem}} as a child fs, Overriding the home directory required in child also during creation. This can be done as below.

{code}
     }
-    TestLFS(Path home) {
-      super();
+
+    TestLFS(final Path home) {
+      super(new RawLocalFileSystem() {
+        @Override
+        protected Path getInitialWorkingDirectory() {
+          return makeQualified(home);
+        }
+
+        @Override
+        public Path getHomeDirectory() {
+          return makeQualified(home);
+        }
+      });
       this.home = home;
     }{code}
, Thanks [~vinayrpet] for reviewing.
I have updated the testcase as you have suggested.
Please review the patch., \\
