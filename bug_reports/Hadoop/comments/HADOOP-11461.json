[Looks like it is a known jersey bug for version 1.9.
Upgrading Jersey to 1.10 should resolve the issue. ( http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.jersey.user/10977)
Basically jersey patch downgraded this message level from "SEVERE" to "FINE".

Working on a patch to upgrade  the version.

If needed, an alternative approach may be to hide this "minor issue" by turning off this log. Related reference is in Hadoop KMS patch at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-10433.
We can test this by adding "log4j.logger.com.sun.jersey.server.wadl.generators.WadlGeneratorJAXBGrammarGenerator=OFF" into log4j.properties.

, Would it be a good idea to upgrade the version to 1.10 or 1.11 or something higher?

I am inclined to upgrade to 1.10 only. 

comments?, HADOOP-9613 covers moving up to 1.17: if you are going to do it, go up more. What is the latest jersey 1.x release, SLIDER-878 is a report of Java 8 + Jersey 9 incompatibilities. We are going to have to do an update, We ran into this issue with YARN timeline server v1.5 again. Seems like in Jersey 1.9 the logging is not performed through log4j, so changing the log4j settings was not helpful. Jersey uses java's logging.logger instead, so changing java's logging properties file and adding com.sun.jersey.server.wadl.generators.WadlGeneratorJAXBGrammarGenerator.level = OFF appears to work for us. The trunk code does not have this problem because it's using a later version of Jersey. ]
