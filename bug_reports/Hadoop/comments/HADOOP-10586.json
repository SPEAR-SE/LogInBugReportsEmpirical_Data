[Charles, my bad on my offline comment on this to you, Option are settable via KeyShell, the options are set in the Configuration itself instead creating an Option and setting the values. What is missing is, as you told me, setting the description. The description cannot be set via Configuration, I would suggest refactoring this to create an Option object and sett the properties that are coming via CLI and add description to it., @tucu00 Here's a small patch which lets a user set the Key description field., [~tucu00] Here's a small patch which lets a user set the Key description field., Description is optional, shouldn't have a default value, if not specified it should be NULL. 

I understand that you are trying to follow the current pattern in key shell to build the option, but seeding the configuration seems odd, Option has a builder, we should use that from KeyShell. Makes sense?, [~tucu00] I believe this addresses your previous comments.
, LGTM, one minor NIT, we don't need the {{description = null}} in the Option constructor, no? If so, mind updating the patch and setting 'submit patch'. After test-patch report we are good to go. , The .4 patch removes the description = null.
