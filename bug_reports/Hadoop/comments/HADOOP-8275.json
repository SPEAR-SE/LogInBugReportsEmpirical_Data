Thanks for making this runnable by Jenkins.  I forgot to do that!

The tests are actually in the patch for HDFS-3134, which depends on this patch.  I guess I should have commented on that earlier..., Can you write some unit tests for the new behaviour/method in this patch? It looks like the test in HDFS-3134 is only testing indirectly., * add unit test, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Maybe update the jira subject to "readVInt range checking to restrict DelegateKey len to 1mb" or similar?
 
Nits:
- {{MAX_KEY_LEN = 1024*1024}} would be more readable
- @return javadocs don't get periods (readVIntInRange)

For sanity, check the impact on the load time of a large edit log since readVInt is called frequently?  Otherwise looks great!, * remove period from javadoc

* use 1024 * 1024 instead of 1048576, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., @eli: I re-ran some of the tests and found no appreciable performance difference (including the oev test, which does a lot of serialization/deserialization)., +1 looks good.  Test failures are unrelated (HADOOP-8330 and HADOOP-8110)., Forgot to mention, jira for other places where we need to use readVInt range checking?, I've committed this and merged to branch-2.

, bq. Forgot to mention, jira for other places where we need to use readVInt range checking?

I think HDFS-3134 takes care of all the other cases.  It also adds a fuzz tester for the edit log.

I filed HDFS-3346 for FSImage fuzz testing., Beautiful, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #1032 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1032/])
