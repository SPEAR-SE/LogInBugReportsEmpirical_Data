[No way.  That's *way* too verbose for INFO., No tests are modified since this is a minor change that changes logging level, Just to make sure that we are on the same page, if you look at the patch you will see the only 2 lines are changed. The Bug contains the log from a DEBUG session with lots of noise.

Are you concerned even with those 2 lines, since they will happen for each authentication and worried that it will bloat the logs ?

Thanks

, I am +1, [~aw], are you ok to commit it?, I agree with [~aw] it is way too verbose to bring it to info.
