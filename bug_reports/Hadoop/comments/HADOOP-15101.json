[What you get should be that defined in filesystem.md, as taken from what HDFS does, Thanks Steve Loughran. Will the details in filesystem.md be add to FileSystem.java? At least add a link to filesystem.md., [~zhoutai.zt], We can update {{hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/site/markdown/filesystem/filesystem.md}}., No. Not until you are confident that it is wrong.

The test is considered correct, in that listStatus(file), returns [status-of-file]. The test is executed by HDFS, which is the normative source of what things are meant to do.

This test is consistent with what we say in filesystem.md. Therefore I consider filesystem.md to be valid
```

If `path` refers to a file and the filter accepts it,
then that file's `FileStatus` entry is returned in a single-element array.

If the path refers to a directory, the call returns a list of all its immediate
child paths which are accepted by the filter â€”and does not include the directory
itself.
```
If there is confusion, it's in the javadocs.

there's one [right at the top of the javadocs|https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0/api/index.html].]
