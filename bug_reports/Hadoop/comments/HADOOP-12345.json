[bq. I would be happy to submit the patch but I need some help to commit into mainline. I haven't committed into Hadoop yet.

The contrib docs are [here|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute]. Thanks for looking into this!, [~pradeepu], please use "Target Version" only for your intention; fix-version is used by committers once a patch gets committed., Also 2.6.0/2.7.0/2.7.1 are released, targeting for 2.8.0., Is there anyone actively working on this? I was planning to commit a patch for this issue., I am actually working on this

Pradeep

, Is there anyone working on this issue?, Given that no patch has been submitted for 8 months, I'd recommend changing Target Version to 2.9.0 or getting something up for review ASAP., I'm downgrading this from a blocker since it's not a regression.

I also spent a little time trying to make a repro. I'm not that familiar with the NFS gateway, and my IDE didn't see a place where mCredentialsLength was being used. I think this requires an actual NFS gateway unit test, which presumably uses this length somewhere in the RPC code.

This is one is probably best handled by one of the NFS gateway experts, e.g. [~brandonli]., Not much going on here for a long time, dropping from 2.8.0.

Not putting any target-version either anymore, let's target this depending on when there is patch activity., The patch for both HADOOP-12345 and HADOOP-11823. Please let me know if I need to separate them out ?, I have attached the patch for HADOOP-12345 and HADOOP-11823. Sorry for the confusion. Using Jira for the first time. The patch file is attached., GitHub user pradeep1288 opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/103

    HADOOP-12345,HADOOP-11823 fixes

    I have already filed the HADOOP-12345 and HADOOP-11823 jira. 
    
    The fix for HADOOP-12345 is to correctly compute the credential length which is passed as part of the NFS request. We need to round the XDR bytes to a multiple of 4 if the hostname in the credential is not a multiple of 4.
    
    The fix for HADOOP-11823 is when RPC returns a denied reply, the code should not check for a verifier. It is a bug as it doesn't match the RPC protocol. (See Page 33 from NFS Illustrated book).
     
    
    This is my first time contributing to Hadoop.

, Hi Pradeep, thanks for working on this,

Is it possible to add an NFS-server level test? Or could you comment on manual repoduction and testing here?

I'd also prefer to keep these two patches separate, since they seem to be different issues. I think you can reassign HADOOP-11823 to yourself, since Brandon doesn't seem to be actively working on it. This would also need a unit test. Thanks., Andrew - 

You would need a NFS-server to do the nfs server level test. I can point to the RFC where this is mentioned and comment on what is the error with which the NFS server would respond. Would that suffice ? 

I will separate out the changes for HADOOP-11823 and make that as a separate fix. I will try adding a unit test for that as well , Hi Pradeep,

Based on my recollection from reading the spec the last time, your patch looks correct, I just couldn't figure out where in the HDFS NFS gateway this was actually being used. What I'm ideally looking for is a unit test with the HDFS NFS gateway. If this is difficult, I'd appreciate if you could comment on manual reproduction and testing., Github user pradeep1288 commented on the issue:

    HADOOP-12345: Compute the correct credential length

    I had to discard my earlier pull request as that included fix for the jira HADOOP-11823, hence creating a separate one for each of them.
    
    The fix here addresses the correct credential length to be computed. We need to round of the machine name length to the next multiple of 4, else using such a credential in the NFS RPC request will result in GARBAGE_ARGS from the NFS server. See RFC-5531, page 24 and page 8

    HADOOP-12345: Compute the correct credential length

----
, Looked at the PR. Can we add a test for the length % 4 == 0 case? I think the current code is not quite right:

{code}
+    int padding = 0;
+    // we do not need compute padding if the hostname is already a multiple of 4
+    if (mHostName.getBytes(Charsets.UTF_8).length != 0) {
+      padding = 4 - (mHostName.getBytes(Charsets.UTF_8).length % 4);
+    }
{code}

I think you meant to check that the len % 4 != 0. I think it'd be even better though if we just {{%4}} the padding one more time, saves the if statement.

Also we only need that comment about the padding once, can delete the second one., Also, do you mind posting a patch here on JIRA? We use github optionally for code review, but don't have our precommit bot watching github PRs., Oops! I meant to say len % 4 != 0. I will update the pull request with the latest change. I will incorporate your suggestion., Ok, I will put the patch file here after the code review. Does that sound okay ?, I normally just review the patch on JIRA, so you can just post it here., Updated patch file after addressing review comments from Andrew, I have attached the new version of the patch here. 

Also added test cases for hostnames being multiple of 4 and not being multiple of 4. I need to add a couple of public methods to the class for this to happen., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Looks good overall, few more nits:

* The "m" prefix on variables normally means non-public (e.g. http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#follow-field-naming-conventions). I understand we need to expose these for testing though, so how about we leave these package-private (rather than public) and also put a {{@VisibleForTesting}} annotation on the new methods?
* This comment needs to be updated since we're doing mod4 rather than if now: {{// we do not need to compute padding if the hostname is already a multiple of 4}}
* Could you also post a consolidated patch on JIRA? The 001 patch doesn't apply by itself to trunk., Consolidated patch after addressing comments from Andrew., Cool. I have addressed your comments., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
