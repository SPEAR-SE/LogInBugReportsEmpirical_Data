[Attaching a patch that closes the input streams in the {{unTarUsingJava}} method., Good catch.  Thanks, Chuan!

Can you please close these streams in a finally block to guarantee that they get closed even if there are exceptions?  Also, using {{IOUtils#cleanup}} would shorten the code a bit.

This method also exists in branch-1-win with the same bug.  Can you post a branch-1-win patch too?
, Thanks for the suggestion, Chris! A new patch using {{IOUtils#cleanup}} is attached. I will prepare a branch-1-win patch shortly., Attach a branch-1-win patch., +1 for the patch.  Thanks for incorporating the feedback.  I verified that the tests pass on both Mac and Windows for both branches.  I'll commit this., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4032 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4032/])
