[I see three options:
1) Anywhere we call RPC.closeProxy, we check "if (foo instanceof Closeable) { ... } " first. But, that defeats the whole purpose of throwing the exception when we pass non-closeables, so we might as well just revert the behavior back to the original rather than does this.
2) In RPC.closeProxy, if the object doesn't implement Closeable, check if the proxy is a mock object. We can do this by looking for the string "EnhancerByMockitoWithCGLIB" in the class name. If we see that, pass through.
3) Anywhere we mock out an IPC protocol, we could use the syntax {{mock(FooProtocol.class, withSettings().extraInterfaces(Closeable.class));}}. I am not a fan of this, since it leaks the issue out to all of the test code, rather than localizing the workaround in the one place that matters. Plus, newer users of the mock framework won't know this advanced usage syntax (I had to google for a while to figure it out)

So, I plan to implement #2., Attached patch fixes the failing unit test. I'm not thrilled about the implementation but I think it's the least of the evils., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Todd, can the mock object implement a new interface that extends HAServiceProtocol and Closeable? Will that solve the problem?, #2 makes the main code aware of test specifics, which isn't a good idea. How about doing #3 by creating a helper method that encapsulates that code in one place?, bq. Todd, can the mock object implement a new interface that extends HAServiceProtocol and Closeable? Will that solve the problem?

That avoids the advanced syntax, but requires that you make such a fake interface everywhere you mock a protocol, which again is somewhat counter-intuitive.

bq. #2 makes the main code aware of test specifics, which isn't a good idea. How about doing #3 by creating a helper method that encapsulates that code in one place?

I was thinking about doing that... ie a MockitoUtils.mockIpcProtocol(FooProtocol.class). Since it seems people like this idea better than #2, I'll prepare such a patch.
, This much bigger patch implements option #3 as Tom suggested.
It will also require a HDFS-side change to fix TestDFSHAAdmin which is currently failing.

So, I still think #2 is better, but you both think #3 is better, we'll go ahead with this, and I'll file a new HDFS JIRA to fix TestDFSHAAdmin to use the new mock util once this is committed., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Todd, I agree with Tom. The proxy must implement Closeable or have associated invoker with Closeable, is the new requirement. Without this, we were silently ignoring the failure to stop the proxy. The mocks also need to satisfy this requirement.

Thanks for doing a patch for option #3. +1 for the patch., Here's another option I'd like to put forth:

Change back RPC.stopProxy to *not* throw an exception in the event the proxy or invocation handler doesn't implement Closeable. Add some tests that RPC.stopProxy does indeed correctly call close() on proxies or invocation handlers which do implement Closeable. This should ensure that RPC.stopProxy doesn't ever inadvertently regress so as to fail to stop a Closeable proxy, and still allows for mock objects to mock out IPC interfaces without having to jump through any hoops.

Thoughts?, I'm fine with that, too. Suresh/Tom? Pick your patch, I'll do it. I just want to get something committed today to fix the failing tests., Aaron and Todd, I am not sure why making mock implement Closeable is that hard and deemed to be jumping through the hooops. There are only couple of instance of this. The problem associated with not implementing Closeable is typically caught while writing the unit test it self.

That said, if you guys feel it is such a pain, I am okay with Aaron is suggesting, in the interest of saving time. So I am +1 with what you guys choose, as long as we silently do not ignore failure to stop proxy, in non mock cases., Since the patch is up, and people seem OK with it, I'll commit the version Tom suggested (the latter patch), Committed to 23.3 and trunk. I'll open an HDFS JIRA to fix the failing HDFS tests to use the new mock utility., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #725 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/725/])
