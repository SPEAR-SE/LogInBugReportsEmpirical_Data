[Yes, this is a pain.  I think the root of the problem is that file modes are not cross-platform, so Java doesn't have an API to access them.

As a work-around, can you, instead of directly invoking your scripts, invoke '/bin/bash myScript.sh'?  That way you don't require things to be executable., That'll do.  Thanks.

I'd suggest that you can close this issue.  The suggested workaround -- a /bin/bash or /usr/bin/env prefix -- will likely work for most.]
