This message is automatically generated., Sorry this has taken me so long to respond.  I don't think this is needed any longer.  The tests all pass on trunk without the patch. If you disagree we can reopen the JIRA., Looks like it was already fixed, but I don't know by what JIRA exactly., Looks like this is the JIRA that fixed it in trunk: MAPREDUCE-4884
Ivan, do these failures happen in branch-2, branch-0.23, or was it affecting just trunk?, These tests now pass okay in trunk and branch-0.23, however, they still fail in branch-2:
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Queue configuration missing child queue names for root
	at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.CapacityScheduler.parseQueue(CapacityScheduler.java:328)
	at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.CapacityScheduler.initializeQueues(CapacityScheduler.java:255)
, Application of patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-4884 to "branch-2" resolves the problem., OK I will dupe this to MAPREDUCE-4884, and then merge it into branch-2.

Thanks Ivan and Andrey for looking into this and finding the solution., Reopening to resolve as a duplicate.]
