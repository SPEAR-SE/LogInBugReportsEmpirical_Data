[The correct switch is {{-conf}} and ordering of the args is wrong.  The correct cmdline is: {{hadoop fs -conf XXX -ls /}}, --config is a switch given to export the HADOOP_CONF_DIR path in the command line.
When I run this on non-windows environment, the command works-

/Users/trupti/WORK/Software/Hadoop/hadoop-1.0.3/bin/hadoop  --config /Users/trupti/WORK/Software/Hadoop/hadoop-1.0.3/conf dfs -ls /

/Users/trupti/WORK/Software/Hadoop/hadoop-1.0.3/bin/hadoop
Usage: hadoop [--config confdir] COMMAND
where COMMAND is one of:
  namenode -format     format the DFS filesystem
 ...
 ...

But the same switch is unavailable for Windows Hadoop., --config is a switch given to export the HADOOP_CONF_DIR path in the command line.
When I run this on non-windows environment, the command works-
/Users/trupti/WORK/Software/Hadoop/hadoop-1.0.3/bin/hadoop --config /Users/trupti/WORK/Software/Hadoop/hadoop-1.0.3/conf dfs -ls /

But the same switch is unavailable for Windows Hadoop., My apologies...  Too many variations of specifying a config., This is fixed in branch-1-win along the way. Resolving the issue as cannot reproduce.]
