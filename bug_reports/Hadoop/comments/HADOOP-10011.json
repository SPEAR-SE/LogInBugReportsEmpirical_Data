[This is probably the correct behaviour; needs documenting though, May be better to have this fail with a meaningful error "we don't know our own hostname, please fix your underlying system configuration", +1 That sounds great., doing a review of the code, the issue is still there -DNS.getHosts assumes that {{netAddress.getByName()}} never returns null, which is the official failure state of the method according to the JDK:
{code}
        hosts.add(reverseDns(InetAddress.getByName(ips[ctr]),
                             nameserver));
{code}
