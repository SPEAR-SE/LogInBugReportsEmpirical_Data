[there are branch-2 patches to fix these; just cherry pick them in, [~steve_l], do you have the JIRA numbers?

IAC, we can close this as dup if there are existing tickets., I've been looking into it. There are 5 issues (duplications), and some of the fixes can be cherry-picked but not all. I'll update with more info later today., There are 5 issues of duplicate dependency definitions.

(1) hadoop-project/pom.xml: jsp-api defined twice
- branches affected: branch-2.6
- HADOOP-10563 fixed it but the fix is much bigger than just cleaning up jsp-api, thus cannot be easily cherry-picked
- I propose fixing it manually (trivial)

(2) hadoop-project/pom.xml: curator-framework and curator-test defined twice
- branches affected: branch-2.6
- HADOOP-12230 fixed it, and we can cherry-pick this

(3) hadoop-project/pom.xml: maven-enforcer-plugin defined in 2 places
- branches affected: branch-2, branch-2.6, branch-2.7
- it was fixed (in trunk) by MAPREDUCE-3003 but the fix is much bigger than fixing this, and cannot be easily cherry-picked
- I propose fixing it manually (trivial)

(4) hadoop-auth/pom.xml: jetty-util defined twice
- branches affected: branch-2, branch-2.6, branch-2.7
- the trunk did not have the problem to begin with
- I propose fixing it manually (trivial)

(5) hadoop-common/pom.xml: maven-surefire-plugin defined in 2 places
- branches affected: branch-2, branch-2.6, branch-2.7
- fixed by HADOOP-9242, and can be cherry-picked

So I'll go ahead and cherry-pick the fixes for (2) and (5). For others, I'll fix them using this JIRA. Will post the fixes soon., v.1 patch for branch-2 (and branch-2.7).

The redundant definition for jetty-util has been removed.

The maven-enforcer-plugin issue is bit more involved. The trunk version removed one section entirely (MAPREDUCE-3003), but I'm not sure if that was completely intentional. In that JIRA, that section was left in for 0.23.

Here, I'm essentially combining these two sections, and implementing the intent that's implied in the existing code. One section defines a number of executions that are not meant to be inherited to child pom's, and another section defines an execution that's meant to be inherited. The patch fixes the pom so that it does do that. Currently the inherited action is not really being inherited due to this issue.

, The -1's are not applicable. Since the run was on branch-2.6 (which does not support JDK 1.8), the javadoc errors are not relevant. Also, the reported whitespace errors and asflicense errors are strangely about the patchprocess files! cc [~aw]

And since this is a dependency clean-up in pom files, unit tests are not really feasible., bq.  Also, the reported whitespace errors and asflicense errors are strangely about the patchprocess files!

This is a bug in the branch, not Yetus.  This branch is missing HADOOP-11917 which fixes the bug., Also, it's good to see that minor branch detection in Yetus is working.  It's another new feature vs. trunk's test-patch. :), Can I get reviews on these changes?, Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3. Please revert back if you disagree., I'm fine with moving it to 2.7.3. I added back 2.8.0 and 2.6.3 as we want them in those releases too., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
