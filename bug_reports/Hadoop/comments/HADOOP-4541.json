[Attached file is sample strace output., Any thoughts Pete or Arun? Pete's had his fingers in there the most recently., I thought this might be related to removing exit calls in libhdfs but that was introduced in 0.19, so that's not the culprit if this is indeed 0.18.1. I will look into it some more.   

You wouldn't happen to have code to reproduce this problem?
, Looking at the code, hdfsWrite should be returning -1 when this happens.  There are no loops in the hdfsWrite or invokeMethod.
, Dhruba mentioned that HADOOP-4517 could be causing the underlying DFS exception but not the infinite loop. So, maybe you could try 0.18.2 that includes the fix for 4517?
, Dummy me forgot the greatest tool for debugging of them all: gdb.

Here's the stack trace of one of these suckers in action:

(gdb) where

That dump_buffers call (internal to my application) worries me; give me a few hours to step through things in GDB; if errors aren't propogated right in that particular function, it could lead to an application-side infinite loop., Ah, I think this was caused by my error handlers.  Closing for now.]
