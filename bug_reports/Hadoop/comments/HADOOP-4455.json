[this has jar files so hadoop QA may not be able to seemlessly handle this..., +1, The trunk has this modified derby.jar whereas the 0.19 b build does not have. That's what is impacting the tests. I will makr this as a blocker and put it in 0.19 branch as well., +1 @author. The patch does not contain any @author tags.

+1 javadoc. The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

+1 javac. The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

+1 findbugs. The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs warnings., I just committed this. Thanks Ashish!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #637 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/637/])
