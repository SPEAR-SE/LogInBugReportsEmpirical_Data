[I checked the test again and it passes in my local machine. There seems to be no problem in Hudson hadoop-trunk in builds 609-613. 
I could not find the reason why the test failed, the mapred job and DBCountPageView#verify() seems to have completed successfully, and the HSQLDB and miniMR-DFS had been shut down w/o trouble. 

Raghu, could you be able to get the stderr log for the failing build?, Checking to see if we can get stderr. This happened 3 days back once. If we can not get more info we could make this a non-blocker until there are more failures., Just got it failed in my machine.  4267_426720080925TestDBJob.txt is the test output., HSQLDB occasionally throws an exception when shutting down. This patch catches the ex, and logs it w/o rethrowing. , We should also do

svn move lib/hsqldb-LICENSE.txt lib/hsqldb-1.8.0.10.LICENSE.txt
