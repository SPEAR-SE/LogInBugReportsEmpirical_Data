[Hi Eli,

 It looks to me that in latest code null check has been handled.

{code}
public static String getServerPrincipal(String principalConfig,
      InetAddress addr) throws IOException {
    String[] components = getComponents(principalConfig);
    if (components == null || components.length != 3
        || !components[1].equals(HOSTNAME_PATTERN)) {
      return principalConfig;
    } else {
      if (addr == null) {
        throw new IOException("Can't replace " + HOSTNAME_PATTERN
            + " pattern since client address is null");
      }
      return replacePattern(components, addr.getCanonicalHostName());
    }
  }
{code}


is it the same place you are talking.
or, you are expecting some more meaning full message. Please confirm to proceed..


Thanks

, Thanks for following up Uma. I think so, a test which enables security and sets a bogus dfs.https.address would confirm., I've talked with Shingo Furuyama and he has taken over this jira.
Could someone assign to him?, Hi guys, 

I attatch a patch which tests this error case.]
