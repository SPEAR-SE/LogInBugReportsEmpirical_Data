This message is automatically generated., The test failure is not related to attached patch: it only includes document change.

TestSymlinkLocalFSFileSystem/TestSymlinkLocalFSFileContext failure looks related to HADOOP-10510. TestIPC fails because of timeout. I'll create JIRA to make the timeout value larger., +1 (non-binding). Since BUILDING.txt says openssl devel is required to compile native hadoop-pipes, we should update the document also., +1, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5924 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5924/])
