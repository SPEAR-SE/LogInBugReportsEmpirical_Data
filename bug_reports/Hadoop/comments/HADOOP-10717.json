, JSP is no longer required in trunk. The dependency should be removed., According to the log, this is not caused by missing JSP support. It looks like it fails due to configuration issues.
I run trunk daily, and it does print the message but it is a benign warning.

I propose to revert this patch., OK, I have reverted this patch in trunk., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5728 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5728/])

, Hi Steve 
 Thanks a lot for your review. 
 
Hi Haohui
 The time-out exception blocked me about 2 minutes every time. 
 I only remain the property "fs.defaultFS" and clean all the cache files ( include maven cache in my environment), I still get the time-out error. 
 After I applied the patch, the error was fixed.
Also thanks for your review.
, The fix does not seem right. If this was the case, jenkins would have been broken for a long time.

It looks to me that the stack trace implies that jetty tries to get the DTD from the network? Can you figure out what jetty is getting and why?, Thanks [~dapengsun] for reporting the issue.
I noticed this (connection timeout and taking longer time to run tests) when I run the tests in proxy environments. Please check if this hint will help to detect the actual issue., Thanks Uma and Haohui, 

My lab can not access Internet directly (I think most enterprise environment should be like this for security),

After debuged the code, I found Jetty will try to download http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-jsptaglibrary_1_2.dtd, the file exists in jsp-api-2.1-glassfish-2.1.v20091210.jar, the jar file is depended by org.mortbay.jetty:jsp-2.1-jetty:jar:6.1.26

I tested it in internet environment, it's okay. When I map hostname "java.sun.com" to 127.0.0.1, The following exception was thrown:

I'm agree with you, thank you.

Hi [#wheat9] 
"NO JSP Support for /" is fixed, it's great.
But the time-out exception is not. You can add {noformat}127.0.0.1 java.sun.com{noformat} to your /etc/hosts to reproduce. Thank you., bq. After debuged the code, I found Jetty will try to download http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-jsptaglibrary_1_2.dtd, the file exists in jsp-api-2.1-glassfish-2.1.v20091210.jar, the jar file is depended by org.mortbay.jetty:jsp-2.1-jetty:jar:6.1.26

Looks like Jetty has hard coded this part. It looks to me that the right thing to do is to bring in {{javax.servlet.jsp-api}} (instead of the jetty / glassfish jars) as a runtime dependency in maven. [~dapengsun], can you please update your patch? Thanks., Hi [~wheat9] 
I'm agree with you, I will use *javax.servlet.jsp:jsp-api:2.1* update the patch.
Thank you for your review.
