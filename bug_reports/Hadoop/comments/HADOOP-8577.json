[The JIRA is to track issues with the project, not for user/dev-help. Please ask your question on common-dev[at]hadoop.apache.org mailing lists instead, and refrain from posting general questions on the JIRA. Thanks! :)

P.s. The issue is your OS. Fix your /etc/hosts to use the right format of "IP FQDN ALIAS", instead of "IP ALIAS FQDN". In any case, please mail the right user/dev group. See http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html, It's not his host config because this test is not using the system resolver.  The resolver for host-based tokens is overriding the call to the system resolver with one that simply returns lookups from a pre-defined map.

These failures should not be possible.  The only thing I can think of is that SecurityUtils is somehow broken and not using the resolver it's told to use.  I have no idea why this would be unique to JDK7...]
