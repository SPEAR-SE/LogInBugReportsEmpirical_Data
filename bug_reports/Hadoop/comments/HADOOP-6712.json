[Resolving as Won't Fix, since the whole recordio component is now deprecated in favor of Avro (and technically ought to be removed in 0.22/0.23).

Please see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6155

Do reopen if you wish to maintain recordio over 0.20.x branches. Although Avro works with 0.20 as well.]
