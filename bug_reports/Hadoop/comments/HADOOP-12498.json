[bq.  but the folder is only "input", instead it should be "/user/<username>/input".

{code}
  $ bin/hdfs dfs -put etc/hadoop input
{code}

is the same thing as

{code}
$ bin/hdfs dfs -put etc/hadoop /user/<username>/input
{code}

So unless the example requires input to be a directory, these are equivalent statements.  I do think the documentation should be cleaned up to point out absolute vs. relative paths here though.

The other thing is that this should really be using 'hadoop fs' instead of 'hdfs dfs' so that it works on non-HDFS-based file systems., etc/hadoop is a directory, so the example requires input to be a directory too.]
