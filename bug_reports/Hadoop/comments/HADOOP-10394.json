[I am not familiar with this the code that is being tested but from a quick look it appears safe to increase the fudge factor up to a couple of seconds without compromising the correctness of the test case., Patch to increase the fudge factor, replace hard-coded timeouts with constant., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The RA warning is unrelated to the patch., I think that it is sufficient to assert {{token.getExpires() != 0}} instead of asserting on the absolute time. That is, changing

{code}
+        Assert.assertEquals(System.currentTimeMillis() + TOKEN_VALIDITY_SEC * 1000,
+                     token.getExpires(), TOKEN_EXPIRATION_DELTA_MS);
{code}

into

{code}
+        Assert.assertNotEquals(0, token.getExpires());
{code}, Thanks Haohui, updated patch attached.

Haohui explained offline that weakening the assert does not weaken the security check.

{quote}
Even the cookie does not expire as expected, the token (which is validated on the server side) will expire anyway. The security of the system does not depend on whether the cookie has expired or not.
