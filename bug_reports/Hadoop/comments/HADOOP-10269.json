[If the sasl wrapping fails then it really doesn't matter if disposing of the sasl object fails.  Disposing shouldn't fail because it's clearing internal state but even if it does it's likely related to the wrap failure.  The original/rethrown exception from the wrap failure is what really matters.

If that makes sense, I think this jira should be marked invalid., Thanks for the response. It makes sense. I don't want to sound like a pest but in this case this "ignored" is a different exception from se, and since the code completely ignores it, later no one will ever know that there were another exception "ignored" thrown by the dispose. Although 'dispose' shouldn't fail in most cases, the purpose of an error handler is exactly to prepare for those extremely rare cases where some failure modes are not anticipated. So in this case maybe it's worthwhile to at least log this "ignored" exception?, Not a pest by any means.  This issue is whether to log cascading and irrelevant exceptions.  For example, upon stream exceptions we usually swallow exceptions from closing the stream.  We don't care the stream failed to close (likely attributable to the real exception that prompted the close), all we care about is the actual stream exception.]
