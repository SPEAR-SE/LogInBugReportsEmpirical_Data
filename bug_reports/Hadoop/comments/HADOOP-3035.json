[This patch fixes the problem
- With OP_WRITE_BLOCK, we also send a boolean.
- If this boolean is true, we also send Client DatanodeInfo along with Client name string
- This DatanodeInfo would be used to report bad blocks to the namenode by the receiving datanode
- Added a test case, which creates a file with replication of 1, corrupts it and requests a replication of 2. Upon replication, receiving node detects this and reports it as bad block.

This message is automatically generated., +1. A few minor comments :

- Unit test: our normal approach is to wait in a loop and in each iteration, wait for shorter time (500 millisec) in each iteration. So normally test finishes faster and will be able to handle platform related unexpected (and unavoidable) delays.
- The test does not belong to TestDatadndeBlockScanner.
- you could log before invoking reportBadBlocks().
