[surfaces on java7 too, hence hdfs precommit builds failing, lgtm

Want to just go for 4G rather than 2G or you thinking that if we OOME on 2G, we'll take a look at the dumped heaps to see what is going on?

This message is automatically generated., we could go to 4, easily enough, will apply a new patch, Patch -002 goes to 4G heap

one thing to note is that this will also be the heap requirement on local dev systems, though if people do want to tune it down they can set the {{maven-surefire-plugin.argLine}} property to a different  value, +1, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
