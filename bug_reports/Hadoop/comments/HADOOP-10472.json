This message is automatically generated., What is wrong with using SLF4J? 

The patch as 2 issues, it breaks 7 log statements using message templates (supported by SLF4J), i.e.:

{code}
      LOG.info("Initialized, principal [{}] from keytab [{}]", principal, keytab);
{code}

You are unnecessary guarding log statements, ie.

{code}
+        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
+          LOG.debug("Performing our own SPNEGO sequence.");
+        }
{code}
, Hey [~jingzhao] could you elaborate more on the rationale? Based on the common-dev thread on the topic, I think we're trying to move towards slf4j, not away from it.
