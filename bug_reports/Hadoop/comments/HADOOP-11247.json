This message is automatically generated., Hi [~brandonli],

Thanks for working on this. 

I reviewed the patch and have one question, if user didn't specify old config property "nfs.static.mapping.file" before, then the old default value "/etc/nfs.map" was expected. Now with this change, even if user has "/etc/nfs.map" file, user still need to rename /etc/nfs.map" to "/ect/usergroupid.map". So it's kind of breaking backward compatibility. That said, I don't see a good solution here to really maintain the full backward compatibility. I just want to point this out. Comments? thanks.


, I didn't add unit test because the change is just to fix javac warning and user guide., Thanks, Yongjun. I uploaded a new patch to remove the incompatibility. , HI Brandon,

Thanks a lot for quickly addressing my comments, and your latest patch looks good to me. 

We tried to remove the keyword "nfs" from IdMappingConstant.java, which was why I said there was no good solution to main full backward compatibility. Now with a little imperfection of having one appearance of "nfs" in this file, we are able to have full backward compatibility. So the patch looks reasonable to me. Thanks again for addressing that.
