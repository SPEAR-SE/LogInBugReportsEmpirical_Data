[This may depend on Java 7 providing better APIs -a check and fail wouldn't be atomic, ...actually, you could have the check for the destination being a file only run *after* the mkdir() operation returned false, [~stevel@apache.org],

I think it was solved by HADOOP-9361.
{code:title=RawLocalFilesystem.java#mkdirsWithOptionalPermission}
if (p2f.exists() && !p2f.isDirectory()) {
      throw new FileNotFoundException("Destination exists" +
              " and is not a directory: " + p2f.getCanonicalPath());
}
{code}

Do you agree?, yes, looks like I fixed it then and forgot about this JIRA. Closing as duplicate]
