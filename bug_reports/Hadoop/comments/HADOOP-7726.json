[If this is for trunk version. You can read the BUILDING.txt in the top directory. 

for importing to eclipse you have two options. 

1) install m2-eclipse and import as existing maven project.
OR
2) mvn eclipse:eclipse

I think the ant targets are no more used. The doc is old perhaps.
, P.S. If you are new to hadoop. you might wanna try this. 


https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3131

You can build the docs by running mvn site:site 
For instruction and docs are generated in hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/target, (This has nothing to do with the eclipse-plugin)

No longer an issue on trunk/2.x branches. Please see http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute to import sources into eclipse.]
