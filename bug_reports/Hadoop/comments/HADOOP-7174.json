[Looks good.  Two comments:
1) I'd suggest throwing a more posix error string like srcPath + ": No such file or directory"
2) Should test the exit code of shell.run() to ensure it's non-zero upon failure.  If it happens to return 0, and it's a non-trivial fix, I'm universally addressing it via HADOOP-7176., +1, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Hi Uma, some tests in HDFS failed after this; see {{HDFS-1786}}.  Could you fix them as well?, Thanks Nicholas, i addressed this.
I prepared the patch ,  will upload it in HDFS., This wasn't committed to branch-21 -- removing 0.21 fixversion., > This wasn't committed to branch-21 - removing 0.21 fixversion.

I have double checked.  This was indeed committed to 0.21.  See also [this comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-1786?focusedCommentId=13012726&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13012726].]
