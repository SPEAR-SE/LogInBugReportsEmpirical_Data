[Options that I see to address this:

1* set(dK, V) should store (dK, V) and get(nK) should do a reverse look up if nK is not found

ISSUE: This may break new code that iterates and expects nK in the iterator.

2* set(dK, V) & set(nK, V) should store both (dK, V) and (nK, V)

ISSUE: increases the number of stored key/values.

3* keep current set/get logic and make iterator() to return 'duplicated' entries for deprecated values (dK, V) & (nK, V)

ISSUE: complexity in the iterator logic as well.

4* keep track in Configuration of the key used regardless of being deprecated or not and return those on iterators()

ISSUE: it will require Configuration to have an additional data structure to keep track of deprecate values being used. This will add more complexity to the configuration.


I'm inclined to do either #2 or #3.

Thoughts?, Going for option #2, seems the least invasive one. taking care of unset as well. added testcases, this time with --no-prefix, Forgot to mention, this is breaking Oozie with Hadoop 0.23 as Oozie heavily uses Configuration objects with iterators, -1 overall.
