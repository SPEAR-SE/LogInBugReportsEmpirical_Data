This message is automatically generated., Reading the patch, it appears that you used BASIC auth to authenticate the user.
Could you confirm, clarify that?

In a secure cluster, the correct thing would be to authenticate the end user with SPNego for WebUI access.

Did you follow the instructions at
http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/HttpAuthentication.html, bq. Reading the patch, it appears that you used BASIC auth to authenticate the user.

Yes, actually that's the original behavior. 

bq. http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/HttpAuthentication.html

Thanks for the link! I will follow the instructions and do the test., Update the patch. 

I followed the instruction in the HttpAuthentication link and enabled Spnego authentication in the http server. The old patch did not break the Spnego, but with Spnego enabled the log directory link is inaccessible again.

Since the cause of the issue is that the getRemoteUser call on the http request returns null, and the AuthenticationFilter wraps the http request with the short name retrieved from the token, we do not need to add the security handler (and the user realm) when AuthenticationFilter is specified. So in the new patch I simply check if AuthenticationFilter has been specified in the configuration.

I have locally tested the patch with/without specifying Spnego. And with the patch the log directory link can be visited., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
