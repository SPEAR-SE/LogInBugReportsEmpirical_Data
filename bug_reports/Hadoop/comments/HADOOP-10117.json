[Just have tried.  I have no problem to compile it in my Mac.  Look like that this is Windows specific., This looks like a duplicate of HADOOP-10110.  A fix was committed for that yesterday, so if you pick up the most recent version of the code, then I expect the problem will go away., > This looks like a duplicate of HADOOP-10110. ...

From the description, the source dir was D:\hadoop-src\hadoop-2.2.0-src\, so the source was probably from v2.2.0 release but not trunk., HADOOP-10110 was also applicable to 2.2.0.  Patches were committed to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.2., I see.  Thanks., Seems, it appear again, and have been check-out the code from here http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-2.2.0/

Please refer the error message here
