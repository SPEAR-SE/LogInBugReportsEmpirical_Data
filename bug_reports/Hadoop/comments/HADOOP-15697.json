[Hi [~maheshk114] thanks for reporting the issue. Do you have a heap dump after the OOM? Without a heapdump or a stacktrace it's hard to know what went wrong exactly.

One source of OOM that we are aware of is the file lists (distcp has to get a list of every files) and it can grow to several gigabytes for a large directory. This known issue is addressed byÂ HADOOP-12502. But there could be other issues as well so we'll need more data to understand better., https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RNcAcRbATM7RfYboGLSpTmbzHbHPsrU8tRo9O9pPOZM/edit?usp=sharing

The hprof file is shared. 

,  !gc-root.png! , Can you tag this JIRA with the hadoop version you are seeing this on? If its a commercial product, just say the name in a comment and we'll guess the closest ASF release to it. thanks]
