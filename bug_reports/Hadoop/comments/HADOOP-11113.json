[Uploading initial patch.

The patch also modifies {{hadoop-auth/o.a.h.sec.authentication.server.AuthenticationFilter}} to return {{401}} error instead of {{403}} on an {{AuthenticationException}}. Wondering why it was throwing {{403}} in the first place.. am I missing something [~atm], [~jingzhao], [~tucu00] ?

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for working on this Arun, just a few review comments:

* Re: status codes, 401 requires that the WWW-Authenticate header is set. I think we're stuck without an appropriate error code here, so we went with 403. [~tucu00] might remember this better than me though.
* Commented out kdcConf lines in TestKMS could be removed
* Rather than modify all the runServer lines, you could do some method delegation (have one version without a port param, have it call the one with a port param)., Updating patch:

bq. Re: status codes, 401 requires that the WWW-Authenticate header is set. I think we're stuck without an appropriate error code here, so we went with 403. Alejandro Abdelnur might remember this better than me though
[~andrew.wang], makes sense.. updated patch to have {{KMSClientProvider}} check for 403. unfortunately, this means that the authToken on the client side will be flushed on ANY unauthorized access (Since no we don't have an error code differentiating Authentication errors from Authorization errors)., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
