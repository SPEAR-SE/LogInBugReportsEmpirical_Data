[bq. 2. TT reports the task status as SUCCEEDED.
When TT reports task as SUCCEEDED, and there was user request to kill the task, 
1. we can accept the state as SUCCEEDED. and ignore user request to kill. (remove the request from tasksToKill map and don't send a KillTaskAction). 
or
2. Dont accept the state as SUCCEEDED, mark it KILLED and send a KillTaskAction.

Thoughts?, Patch accepts the state as SUCCEEDED and ignores user request to kill,  when TT reports task as SUCCEEDED, and there was user request to kill the task.

All unit tests passed on my machine., +1, Actually, the patch does not solve a synchronization problem at the TT . Cancelling patch till Amareshwari comes up with a new one., There is a small window at TT, when KillTaskAction and reportDone are processed together, the state will be SUCCEEDED and still TT cleanups map outputs.
So, taking up option (2) looks like proper solution.
Patch marks the task KILLED, if TT reports task as SUCCEEDED, but there was user request to kill the task., test-patch result:
