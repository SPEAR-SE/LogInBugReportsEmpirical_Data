[Hi Trevor, is jsvc definitely accessible/executable in the package you built? Did you definitely have some low ports configured for the DN?, Good Day,
I have jsvc under $hadoophome/libexec/

$ ls -l
total 100
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 52776 Oct 13 10:51 jsvc.amd64
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 42624 Oct 13 10:51 jsvc.i386

I figured this was good looking at the hadoop script.
hadoop:  exec "$HADOOP_HOME/libexec/jsvc.${JSVC_ARCH}"

As for my DN ports I have this:

<!-- DataNode security config -->
<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.address</name>
  <value>0.0.0.0:1004</value>
</property>
<property>
 <name>dfs.datanode.http.address</name>
 <value>0.0.0.0:1006</value>
</property>

Thoughts?, Did you start the DN as root? The DN won't be able to bind to low ports (< 1024) without being started as root., Yes. 
I run "sudo hadoop-daemon.sh start datanode", I see "tags/release-0.20.205.0-rc2" is not in SVN anymore and there is a release of "0.20.205.0" on the general site.
I will download this and try it out., i found this problem in 1.0.3-release]
