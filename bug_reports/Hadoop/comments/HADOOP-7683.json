[attaching the path for 20 security branch., patch for only the 20s branch as trunk refers to those properties in the defaults., +1 looks good., canceling patch, as it isn't for trunk., Committed to 0.20-security and 0.20.205.  Thanks, Arpit!, Three other files have references to this property. Incorrect in just the same way, so we'll require cleanup on them as well:

src/hdfs/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/DFSConfigKeys.java
src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/TestCheckPointForSecurityTokens.java
src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/TestHDFSServerPorts.java

Prop in reference is {{DFS_NAMENODE_HTTP_ADDRESS_KEY}}.

Sorry for pitching in late, was traveling yesterday.

Arpit - can you update these files appropriately as well? Or let me know, and I'll do it. A separate (but linked) jira is fine I think., Ah and additionally "DFS_NAMENODE_HTTPS_ADDRESS_KEY" and "DFS_NAMENODE_BACKUP_HTTP_ADDRESS_KEY" from src/hdfs/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/DFSConfigKeys.java again, while we're at it.

Unsure how that backup namenode thing got pulled in. We need to remove docs away for these too, which is at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7297 awaiting a review for removal from branch security before I commit it in., Reopening until Harsh's comments are addressed., Harsh i have linked the JIRA HADOOP-7690. Thanks for your input., Actually after some thought i dont think doing key cleanup is needed in 2xx. We logged this jira to only clean up the templates so the user is not confused when they see multiple properties having the same value., Well, it's in 205 and 0.20-security.  Does it belong there or should it be reverted?, This jira only makes changes to the config templates we should keep this in. The linked jira has been created to update the code cleanup. But like i mentioned before adding clean up of keys is something not necessary for 2xx, Thanks, then we'll consider this one closed and finish the rest in HADOOP-7690 in 0.20.206., Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0]
