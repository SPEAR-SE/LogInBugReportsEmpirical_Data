[I'm sorting data generated using random writer, like so

bin/hadoop jar hadoop-0.12.3-examples.jar randomwriter rand
bin/hadoop jar hadoop-0.12.3-examples.jar sort rand rand-sort.

Most of the maps succeed, but a few always fail with the above exception., Although I don't know what value is mapred.child.java.opts configured to, could you please try increasing that to something like -Xmx512m? , Also, what is the value of io.sort.mb ?, Deveraj, thanks for the suggestions. I am using the default settings:

mapred.child.java.opts = -Xmx200m
io.sort.mb = 100

I'll try again with mapred.child.java.opts as you suggest., Setting mapred.child.java.opts to -Xmx512m resulted in no failures. Thanks Devaraj!]
