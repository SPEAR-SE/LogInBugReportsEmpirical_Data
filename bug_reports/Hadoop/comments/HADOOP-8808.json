This message is automatically generated., One nit: There are currently not being published as they have to be ported to the APT format., Wow, ok. Thanks for that info Harsh.. I couldn't find the equivalent for the fs shell guide among the new apt documentation files. Is it missing or intentionally removed ? (In which case we can close this bug as won't fix or some such), Not intentional, was just missed as part of the port of the rest of the docs. I'm unable to recall the porting JIRA but I'll comment back shortly with that. Sorry for the short response earlier Hemanth., Attaching a patch for the latest trunk., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
