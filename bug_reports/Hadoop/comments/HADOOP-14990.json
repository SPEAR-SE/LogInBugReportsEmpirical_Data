[FYI, I raised this as blocker as all Yetus builds are failing with no license header warnings, like:
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/18204/artifact/out/patch-asflicense-problems.txt, Thanks [~subru] for reporting the issue. These XMLs are supposed to under "hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/dev-support/jdiff" instead of "hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/dev-support/". I will go ahead to commit the change if get +1 here., Thanks [~djp] for your response. I assume  "hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/dev-support/jdiff" is under ignore for RAT as if not, you have to add them or add License headers?, I think so, there are other versions of jdiff XMLs under that directory which works fine., I am not sure if Jenkins can take patch here in right way. My local try with "patch -p0" is failed with recognize the file move. My suggestion is someone give a +1 here and I do the commits to all affected branches which should fix the issue., +1 from my side if the license warnings are fixed with the move as like I mentioned earlier all Yetus builds are failing because of it. It should be straightforward to verify with local test-patch execution. Thanks., Thanks [~subru]. I verified locally that "mvn apache-rat:check" can pass after the fix. Already commit the patch to trunk, branch-2, branch-3.0 and branch-2.8. , Thanks [~djp] for the quick fix., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13161 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13161/])
