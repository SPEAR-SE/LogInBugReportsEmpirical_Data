[I see three options:
 # update the plugin code to work with more recent releases
 # do not include a pre-built eclipse plugin in 0.18.0
 # identify which old release the eclipse plugin does compile with, and use that in 0.18.0

In any case, we should document which Eclipse release the plugin works with.
, Here is a patch that fixes the build, but may not in fact be correct.

Can an Eclipse user test this?, This is possibly related to HADOOP-3744., Unless someone objects, I will commit this patch later today, to fix the build of the eclipse plugin and perhaps even fix the plugin.  Then I'll roll a 0.18.0 candidate release build., I just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
