What is the right way to set static variables in JSP (set using StatusHttpServer.setAttribute())?

One way is application.getAttribute() (as done in tasktracker.jsp). But not sure if there is one "application" per server or per JVM. We need a variable that is per server., Actually predefined variable {{application}} is not available in static ("{{<%! ...  />}}") part of the jsp page., Let me know if we should really fix this. We need to set attributes in servlets etc.]
