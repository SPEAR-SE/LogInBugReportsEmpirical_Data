[I'm not sure, but would this work?, sorry, I haven't uploaded the patch., this does not seem like the right way to fix it. The StreamInputFormat inherits from TextInputFormat and should not return a SequenceFileRecordReader. We really need to merge the code for record reader and inputformat in streaming and hadoop mainline., +1, Owen, I'm not sure if you are voting for this to be committed or for it to be solved following Mahadev's suggestion., take back my comments... the code already used to return a sequencefilerecordreader. We can cleanup the code to solve that problem later. +1 for applying the patch to fix the problem for now., Sorry for the confusion. Koji had some concerns so, I moved it to not patch-available. This fix is certainly necessary. , I've just committed this. Thanks Koji!]
