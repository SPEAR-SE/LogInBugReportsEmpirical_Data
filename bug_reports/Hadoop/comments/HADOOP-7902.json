, Thanks Uma for the quick comment.  Revised the summary and the description., Identified the problem, the skipping of setting name rules is done in the wrong place. working on a patch., skipping the setting the KerberosName name rules if already set should be done on UGI initialization only (where the initialization is done with a new Configuration()).

When UGI is being configured passing a configuration (ie NN initialization) it should not skip the setting of the namerules.

This message is automatically generated., +1, the patch looks good to me. I'm confident the javadoc warnings are unrelated, since this patch doesn't update any javadocs., committed to trunk & branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1464 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1464/])
