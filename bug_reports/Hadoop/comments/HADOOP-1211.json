[Most of the problems listed above have been solved by HADOOP-1203
So I removed remaining deprecated methods:
NameNode.getDirs() is replaced by FSNamesystem.getNamespaceDirs()
which lead to changes in TestCheckpoint()
DatanodeRegistration() constructor is removed.
FSDataset.FSVolume.dir redundant field is removed.
Got rid of generics warning in FSNamesystem.dumpRecentInvalidateSets(),
which was not included in HADOOP-1190.
And fixed a bug in DataNode.handshake() which was looping
while(true) instead of while(shouldRun)., -1
