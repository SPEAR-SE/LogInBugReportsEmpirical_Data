{code}, uprating to blocker; if we can't build on windows, you can't put out alphas on windows, which means you can't ship on windows, Continued Windows support depends on Windows-interested contributors; is there someone willing to take this? Else, I don't want to hold the release for this JIRA., issue is that irrespective of server-side use, this is needed client side to run spark standalone, which creates problems when it stops working. That's why build and release Hadoop binaries for 2.x: https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils

I do think the release should look at windows. If people think otherwise, well, that's something that can be raised on the dev lists. Maybe also cc things like the spark-dev, "OK if we drop client side and standalone code working on windows". 

, Maybe this JIRA isn't getting enough attention, so it's worth asking for help on common-dev.

If no help emerges though, I don't think holding the release (particularly an alpha) will change that. This cross-platform stuff really depends on help from interested contributors., Steve, do you still have a repro for this?  I just completed a full build of current trunk on Windows successfully.

HADOOP-13149 was a similar bug report that I fixed, but that's fairly old.  Is there any chance you were running without this patch?, I've tried to build it on Windows 8.1 following this slightly outdated guide over here: http://harishshan.blogspot.com.br/2014/10/install-hadoop-251-on-windows-7-64bit.html
It got through that section without problem, but failed when it got to the Apache Hadoop Common due to an ammintrin.h issue.
, can you paste in the output?, I'm going to close this since Chris tested this in late October, and there haven't been any responses to requests for additional info.

If we get additional info, we can reopen to track a fix.]
