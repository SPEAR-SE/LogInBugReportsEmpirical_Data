This message was automatically generated., Please review the patch attached., Hi [~szetszwo] the below two i have handled in patch

# Argument for replication in test case was not passed correctly.
# All files including index and master index uses replication value passed
  
The replication value  as 5 i feel is definitely wrong .Either should be replication value passed as argument or default dfs.replication value currently i have used argument value passed 

Could you please check the current implementation is fine?
, Hi [~ajisakaa] and [~andrew.wang] any comments on this issue, bq. It seems that repl is for source files but not index files.
As [~szetszwo] pointed out, current {{repl=10}} which is passed as {{"-r" "3"}} in args, is used to set the replication for source files.
{code}jobfs.setReplication(srcFiles, repl);{code}

Same need to be used to set on index and masterIndex instead of hardcoded 5.

IMO there is no need of separate configuration {{HAR_REPLICATION_FACTOR}}, {quote}
IMO there is no need of separate configuration HAR_REPLICATION_FACTOR
{quote}
{{HAR_REPLICATION_FACTOR}} is label to be used in job conf to get replication in reduces . i have renamed {{HAR_REPLICATION_FACTOR}} to {{HAR_REPLICATION_LABEL}}. 

In reducer any other provision is there to get replication passed in  *"-r "*

{quote}
Same need to be used to set on index and masterIndex instead of hardcoded 5.
{quote}

Current patch i am setting the argument value passed in "-r 3" for master and index .

Please do correct me if am wrong .Any more update required in patch ?, \\

Oh. Yes, I didnt realize that need to pass down {{repl}} to the reducer.
Latest patch looks good. +1.
Will commit soon., \\

This message was automatically generated., Just before committing, got this.

After this change, masterIndex and index, by default will have replication of 10, earlier it was 5.
Can we keep it back to 5 in reducer, only if '-r' not provided in args?
, [~vinayrpet] Thank you for review.

In the default value for {{repl}} was 10 i made {{replication}} consistent with {{repl}}
{code}
  short repl = 10;
{code}
Hope that is fine ? Or in all location will change the default to 5 .


, Hi, [~szetszwo]. What you feel? Whether its okay to update the replication everywhere as 10 by default?
Earlier masterIndex and index files were having 5, and src files were having 10 by default. , I still don't understand -- why using source file replication factor to set index files?, [~szetszwo] because the value of 5 is hardcoded for master and index and we don’t have an option to change that.
So can we use *dfs.replication* to set the replication factor for Master and index files since we are running a job?? And also if  *"-r"* argument is not given *why for source file the replication factor is 10* ? 

Could you please provide what all values we can give for replication and finalize on the same.
# src_file=?  dfs.replication or -r argument value
# master and index=? dfs.replication or -r argument value
, > ... because the value of 5 is hardcoded for master and index and we don’t have an option to change that.

I understand that you want some way to set the replication of the index files.  But why the source file replication factor and the destination index file replication factor have to be the same?, So dfs.replication from conf can we use? Tht is one option.Can we use for master and index. No need to be same., bq. I understand that you want some way to set the replication of the index files. But why the source file replication factor and the destination index file replication factor have to be the same?
{{jobfs.setReplication(srcFiles, repl);}}, The {{repl}} used to set the replication of {{srcFiles}}. But this {{srcFiles}} is not the actual source files which contains data, this is just an intermediate list of filestatuses, written as sequencefile, which will be read to generate the MR job splits, immediately after this file is created. First, HDFS will not have any time to replicate, second,  there is no use of increasing the replication since it will be read in the same client and only once as part of split generation. Also {{srcFiles}} will be deleted once the Job is done.

On the other hand, actual data files, which are created from mappers as part files, have the default replication. Still the proposed patch didn't change this. Need to change this these also.

So, IMO, user specified 'replication' should be used for the resultant archive (both content and indexes), not for the intermediate file.
Also, since default replication 10, is not really used, we can change this to default replication 3 itself. and update in docs also.

Any thoughts?, Hi [~szetszwo] and [~vinayrpet] thnks for review comments.

The below are my understanding 
# In Har filesystem for index and master we are currently using harcoded value 5.
# For Part files the replication value will be default 3 always rt?

Wanted to make replication for {{part,index,masterindex}} to be configurable.The only parameter available 
for replication  was {{-r}}. The same parameter used for {{srcfiles}}. I didn't want to add one more parameters.
Thts the reason have used the same parameter for index and master.

*To implement patch* 

{{option 1}} could be define a new parameter.
For part,master and index new parameter {{-hr}} short for har replication??

[~vinayrpet] sorry missed part files earlier will set replication for that too.About not setting replication for {{srcfiles}}
But for source file and output files(part,index,master) if someone want to set different replication values?

{{option 2}} could be user defined replication {{-r}} for {{master,index,part}}
and parameter {{-sr}} for source file replication . Default value for both set as 3.

[~szetszwo] and [~vinayrpet] Does this sound good ?? Please correct me if i am wrong.
My choice {{option 2}}, bq. parameter -sr for source file replication . Default value for both set as 3.
IMO, no need to change replication for {{srcFiles}}, not even need to use {{repl}}, as this is intermediate file, Will be read only once and will be deleted after Job is complete.
{{-r}} only can be used for all {{master,index,part}} as these are the files related to archive and will stay., [~vinayrpet] Thnk you for super quick reply. I agree to you completely. Lets wait for [~szetszwo] opinion too. , [~vinayrpet] Have updated patch as per our discussion.
Please review., \\

Have updated patch again to avoid that too., Hope {{VersionInfo.java}} change is not intended to add in this patch., Hi [~vinayrpet] Sorry my mistake updated patch again, Sorry for bringing this late, document also needs update in the following line for Hadoop Archives page. Default replication needs to change as 3.

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~vinayrpet] Attaching patch again after updating document, > IMO, no need to change replication for srcFiles, ...

This is a good idea.  The -r option was newly added by HADOOP-11021.  It seemed mistakenly changed the srcFiles replication to be configurable.

+1 The new patch looks good.  Thanks, Bibin and Vinay., \\
