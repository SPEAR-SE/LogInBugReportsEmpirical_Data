[It must expose the case sensitivity model of the underlying FS; trying to be clever will only fail in ways we can't imagine.

If you look at the Local FS tests, the test contract logic explicitily decides the case sensitivity logic for the test FS based on the platform on which it is running. RawLocal will need to do the same., Can you help me which test does it exactly? I would stole that logic but I do not find it., Based on the following code I will set case sensitivity to false on Windows and Mac:

{code:title=LocalFSContract.java}
protected void adjustContractToLocalEnvironment() {
    if (Shell.WINDOWS) {
      //NTFS doesn't do case sensitivity, and its permissions are ACL-based
      getConf().setBoolean(getConfKey(ContractOptions.IS_CASE_SENSITIVE), false);
      getConf().setBoolean(getConfKey(ContractOptions.SUPPORTS_UNIX_PERMISSIONS), false);
    } else if (ContractTestUtils.isOSX()) {
      //OSX HFS+ is not case sensitive
      getConf().setBoolean(getConfKey(ContractOptions.IS_CASE_SENSITIVE),
                           false);
    }
  }
{code}, [~stevel@apache.org] if you agree with this I will close this issue. No patch required since it is not an issue and the new code will come as part of HADOOP-7363.
My method will:
{code}
protected boolean filesystemIsCaseSensitive() {
    boolean isFileSystemCaseSensivive = true;
    
    if (Shell.WINDOWS || Shell.MAC) {
      isFileSystemCaseSensivive = false;
    }
    
    return isFileSystemCaseSensivive;
  }
{code}]
