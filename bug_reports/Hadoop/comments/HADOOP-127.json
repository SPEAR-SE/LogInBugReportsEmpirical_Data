[I think you have it right.  Some guidelines:

Folks should only define things in the -site files if they want to force them for all code.

Folks should not edit the -default files.

Non-default settings that may be overridden by application code should be put in mapred-default.xml.

Application settings are set in the job.

Strictly speaking, it doesn't much matter whether you put something in a nutch- or hadoop- file, although the intent is to keep things that are specific to Hadoop in hadoop- files and things specific to Nutch in nutch- files.

I should have read this earlier, it would have saved me some time.

Actually, the fact that properties defined in hadoop-final.xml override EVERYTHING, included properties defined in job config files, is something very important that should be well documented, because it's not the intuitively expected behaviour (which, to me, was:
 - hadoop-default.xml, mapred-default.xml overrided by
 - hadoop-final.xml, overrided by
 - job config files

I've searched the wiki (afterwards, unfortunately) and it's very well documented there. However, the comments included in hadoop-default.xml and other delivered config files are not clear about this. Maybe they should be detailed, or just link to the wiki page.

, I believe this was fixed by HADOOP-785.]
