[HADOOP-2808 didn't introduce a new signature for copy; it enforced the existing one. As indicated in the JIRA, setting the "overwrite" parameter had no effect on the copy. This isn't an API change; the overwrite formal was added to a private, static function. The former behavior can be restored by setting overwrite to false.]
