[The issue went away after {{mvn clean}} and {{git clean -f -d}}. Not sure which one did the trick., I'm hitting this fairly often in my vagrant setup when building 3.0.0-alpha2. Rerunning the build (I'm using {{mvn clean install package -Pnative,dist -Dtar -Dcontainer-executor.conf.dir=../etc/hadoop -Dcontainer-executor.additional_cflags="-DDEBUG" -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true}}) a time or two allows the build to complete, but it results in quite a bit of wasted time. I started to look into why this occurs, but the intermittent nature of the failure is making it difficult. If anyone has thoughts on potential causes, I'd be happy to assist in testing., I've noticed that you are both doing 'mvn clean install package'.  My understanding of the maven lifecycle (https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html) means that 'mvn install' already does a 'mvn package'.  Perhaps the command line being given is causing double code execution?, Thanks [~aw], I'll try removing 'package' from the mvn invocation and see if it helps., While not 100% conclusive given the small sample size, I can report after 20 builds with and without the extra package goal, there does appear to be a correlation. I encountered the error 0/20 without package, and 3/20 with package. Also, without package the build time decreased by ~1/3. I'm a bit surprised by this behavior, but thank you [~aw] for the tip! I'll close this issue., Thanks [~aw] for the suggestion and [~shanekumpf@gmail.com] for the verification.

My command was {{mvn package install}} different from Shane's {{mvn install package}}, but could suffer the same issue pointed out by Allen.]
