[Raghu could you please see whether this is related to hadoop-4499?
Thanks,
Devaraj




, Hairong will take the lead investigating this.

Devaraj, thanks for the clue!




, The error message was introduced by HADOOP-3914 in 0.19 mainly for the debugging purpose. So Suman, please no panic! Every of your jobs should still be successfully finished. Raghu has already found out the cause of multiple checksum Ok messages. He is going to fix the problem and remove the logging in HADOOP-4499. I will close this jira and mark it as a duplicate of HADOOP-4499. Thanks Surman and please follow jira 4499.]
