[The reason is that hftp / hsftp / webhdfs / swebhdfs file system requires an instance of {{URLConnectionFactory}} to create HTTP / HTTPS connection. {{URLConnectionFactory}} loads all SSL certificates if there are any. Since there is no certificate in this case, it leads to this warning message.

This log message is benign but confusing. I propose to change the log level from warn to debug., Reopen the issue to change the state from in progress to submit patch, so that it can run through jenkins., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
