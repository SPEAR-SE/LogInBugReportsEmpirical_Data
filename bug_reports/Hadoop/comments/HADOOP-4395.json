This message is automatically generated., The failed core test, TestJobQueueInformation, is not related to this issue.  See HADOOP-4378., +1 Patch looks good, 4395_20081011_0.18.patch: for 0.18, I just committed this., I think a considerable part of the reason why this bug got in is lack of javadoc contract for setOwner() methods. Though these are supposed to be hdfs internal, javadoc should have been there. But this comment is too late for this jira I guess.
