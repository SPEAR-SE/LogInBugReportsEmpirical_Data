{noformat}, I reverted this [commit|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/6b53802cba97b5fe354792b34cdc5e5cd1741898], then the failure is gone. [~andrew.wang] can you take a look to see if it's related? And also why there's no JIRA to track the change/commit? Thank you., Yea, my bad for not running a smoke. We haven't done any version changes via JIRA for any prior releases, so I didn't do it for this one either.

I'll go through a new JIRA to update the version code, we can close this one., Hit the same issue too. I think we have to change the default dfs.datanode.min.supported.namenode.version and dfs.namenode.min.supported.datanode.version to match any new project version change if this is what it is designed for. , Why this jira resolved as fixed? Can we still use this jira to fix the issue?, [~andrew.wang] Is it confirmed the failure is as a result of this commit? If so, can you mark it as Won't fix or Duplicate if you plan to address it in a different JIRA? Thanks., Sorry, I thought that Xiaobing meant that he already reverted it from upstream. I've done so, and I'll revisit the version change in a different JIRA. There are a bunch of "3.0.0"s hardcoded in java files which need to be changed., My bad, I should say 'locally reverted...' instead., I filed HADOOP-13142 to do this change, I think I found the issue and ran some basic checks, but let's go through precommit to be careful. Apologies again for the breakage.]
