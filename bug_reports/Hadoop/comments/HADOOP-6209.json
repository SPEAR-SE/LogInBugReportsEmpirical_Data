[Patch to fix the problem., +1 patch looks good.

We should move this issue to Hadoop Common, where the RawLocalFileSystem belongs to.  Would you mind also create a patch for trunk?, A quick look at DF.java and DU.java shows that they may also result in this same exception. Can you check it by running the DF and DU classes directly?, HDFS-197 addresses the DU/DF problem., Please revive this effort.

Thanks!, cygwin no longer supported.]
