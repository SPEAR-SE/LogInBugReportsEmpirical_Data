[Thanks a lot for filing this issue, Roman.

In the future, please only set the "fix version" field once the patch has been committed. To indicate what branch you'd like to see this issue fixed on, please use the "target version" field., The link to HDFS User Guide is also broken. See attached screenshot., The link will be fixed once the old Forrest docs are converted to APT and the website is regenerated. So, this is related to HADOOP-8427., Is this still needed?, The the docs look now this seems to no longer apply., [~rvs] Sorry I did not understand the comment. Should this be marked resolved?, Yup.What I was meant to say is this: "Given the way docs look now this seems to no longer apply.", Resolving the bug as "Not A Problem".]
