[This was fixed in trunk and current versions (2.x): http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/util/Tool.html, [~qwertymaniac] why always return 0, regardless of the job status?

RunningJob runningJob = JobClient.runJob(job);
if (runningJob.isSuccessful()) {
  return 0;
} else {
  return -1;
}, Good point, I suppose that can be fixed. Would you like to submit a docs patch for this?, [~qwertymaniac] OK, I will submit a patch later..
