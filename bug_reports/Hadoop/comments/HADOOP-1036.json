[There are two reasons, which combined, result in this scenario:

a) TaskTracker.startNewTask() doesn't catch the 'RuntimeException' (only catches IOException) which results in a failure to kill the task via TaskInProgress.killAndCleanup()

b) TaskTracker.startNewTask() adds the taskid & tip to 'runningTasks' before localizeJob (which fails as function right as above) and thus the JobTracker gets the 'status' for the non-existent task, removes it from ExpireLaunchingTasks's queue and is generally in a state of bliss...

This issue can be solved either by fixing a) or b), I'd guess we want to fix the exception part since it doesn't make sense to wait for the 10minute timeout for a task we already know has failed to init...
, Attached fix - better exception handling in TaskTracker.startNewTask., +1, I just committed this.
