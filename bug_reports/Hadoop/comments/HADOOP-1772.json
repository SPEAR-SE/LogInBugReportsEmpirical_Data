http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12364454/1772-20070823.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r569063.

Test results:   http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/606/testReport/
Console output: http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/606/console, If HOSTNAME is not set (for any reason), Hadoop should probably set it to `hostname`., I think bash always sets HOSTNAME, so I don't think that's a concern., Correct me if I am wrong: $HOSTNAME is a standard environment variable like $USER, so we can safely use it.

If we don't want to assume $HOSTNAME is set properly, we probably should not assume some commands like hostname are always there.

On the other hand, if $HOSTNAME is not set (say, is "") then the script still works in both Linux and Cygwin.  However, it won't work in Cygwin if we use `hostname`.

The problem actually is that `hostname` in Cygwin has an extra <eol>. Is there any standard method to remove it?  I tried sed but cannot fix it.

Of course, we can write a Java program to return information like username, hostname, etc. .  Then, we don't have to assume anything., Yes, I do think $HOSTNAME is fine and probably an improvement. Nothing wrong with that. Also this is used only for log file name. These scripts are executed with /bin/sh and not with bash. Of course sh == bash on linux and cygwing, but not on solaris (at least on one solaris machine I could login to). I guess what I am saying is that we are probably replacing one problem with another. I could be fixed if hostname could be used if $HOSTNAME is not defined.

Since HADOOP-1689, all scripts specify bash.
, I just committed this.  Thanks, Nicholas!]
