[Suggested patch that  makes localhost and DFS the default.  Local filesystem might be better as default but looks like more work needed making 'local' work again., I don't think we want things to use DFS and TaskTracker/JobTracker by default, since this slows things down and uses more resources than needed when running on a single node.

The javadoc provides a recommended configuration for "pseudo-distributed" use:

http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/docs/api/overview-summary.html

With that in place, bin/start-all.sh works fine, no?, Feels like the 'pseudo-distributed' additions to hadoop-site.xml should be default config. in hadoop-default.xml but then I suppose that would preclude 'standalone operation'.

Thanks for pointer to the doc. It clarifies how things are meant to work.

Please close this issue., I'm closing this.  The default configuration supports standalone, in-process operation, and there's a well-documented way to achieve standalone multi-process operation (aka "pseudo distributed').]
