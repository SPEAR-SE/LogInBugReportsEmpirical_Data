[One line fix to include the ant jar.  This renames the ant jar file from ant-${final.name}.jar to ${final.name}-ant.jar which makes is consistent with the rest and will get it included into the tar file., +1 This looks right to me., I just committed this to trunk, branch-0.19 and branch-0.18., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #640 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/640/])
