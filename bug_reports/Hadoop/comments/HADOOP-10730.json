[Out of curiosity, what bug are you seeing?  It's not a bad change, but the option should just force a re-read of the /etc/krb5.conf so I'm not sure how it fixed HADOOP-6947., Thanks for your reply very much!
In fact we created a desktop application which is implemented by eclipse rcp. In our tools we need to connect to HDFS with kerberos. I will explain what's the problem we face and how to reproduce it now. First we get the kerberos ticket with "kinit" by kfw in windows system, second start our tool, it's ok we can connect to HDFS successfully. But if the ticket is expired and we regenerate a new one it will not be updated in our tool means we cannot connect to HDFS although there is a available ticket . we have to restart our tool to make it work.  ]
