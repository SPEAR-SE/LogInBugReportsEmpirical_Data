[This is due to annoying more-or-less non-deterministic Maven plugin execution order - in hadoop-project-dist/pom.xml (the parent for the failing modules), in the docs profile, there are a bunch of plugins running in the "prepare-package" phase, and based on some factors that are not at all obvious, Maven decides the order they get run in. For whatever reason, the findbugs execution isn't happening before the antrun execution, and so the antrun is failing (since it needs the findbugs execution to have already run).

What I've done in a local test is switched the phase for the docs profile plugin executions other than antrun from "prepare-package" to "process-test-classes", which will have run by the time "prepare-package" is reached. That seems to do the trick., Also, side note - https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/ currently calls "mvn clean install package (etc)" - the package there is redundant, since package gets run as part of install, and so everything up through packages gets re-run a second time for no benefit. Ends up adding like 2-3 minutes to the build., Per my understanding, plugins wired explicitly are executed in their order of appearance in the POM. The tricky thing is, and this may be what you are seeing, when you having profiles that add executions to plugins wired in the main section of the POM; in this case, the order of execution is determined by the position of the plugin in the main section of the POM. , Yeah, that's what seems to be the case. Given that, I'm not sure we have a real alternative to juggling the phase for at least the findbugs call., Actually, I would love to remove all this overloading of phases with plugins for reporting/javadocs/sitegen. It makes the POMs much more complicated and it runs tons of additional stuff in different phase. 

Maybe invoking those plugin goals directly (and have a helper script so you don't need to type 10 goals)?, I'm not sure if that's the right way to go - how often are those going to be called? If regularly, profile+overloading seems the right way to go over having to specify a bunch of goals, even with helper scripts., This is a regression, right? Any chance we could revert the commit that introduced it while we figure out the solution? Or introduce a workaround even if it's temporary and slows the build? It's bad to not get the nightly test results anymore., This should work for now - it's not ideal, but it guarantees the steps are run in the right order., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., New patch - rather than messing with phases, I'm instead adding a declaration of the findbugs plugin at the top of the plugins list in hadoop-project/pom.xml, so that it'll run before any other plugin in a given phase, so long as that plugin is declared for the first time in hadoop-project or anything inheriting from hadoop-project. Seems to do the trick, and doesn't result in executing findbugs normally, since no execution is specified., The new patch, btw, is instead of the original., -1 overall.
