This message is automatically generated., This bug is branch-0.23 specific. I just tested branch-2 and trunk and they are fine., +1 change looks good to make it compile. I would recommend using trunk or branch-2 if you are actually going to run gridmix as there are jiras not pulled into 0.23., I committed this to branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #285 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/285/])
