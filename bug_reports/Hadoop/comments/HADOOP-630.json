[This bug makes it difficult to debug jobs after the JT has been taken down.  Starting up the JT to analyse jobs through the JT web UI is only possible if you also bring up the HDFS used by the job.  Given all the tests I run, with different HDFS instances, etc, I find this restriction very inconvenient., This was fixed by HADOOP-1819.]
