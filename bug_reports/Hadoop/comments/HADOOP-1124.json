[Possible blocker for 0.13 release. Investigation in progress., The problems 2 and 3 described above is not critical. But problem 1 causes a  job to fail on ChecksumException when a task gets a ChecksumError when read after seeking to a position which is not at the checksum chunk boundary althogh there are non-corrupted replicas available.

I plan to create a separate issue dealing with problem 1 and mark it as a Blocker, then I will mark this issue as a non-blocker., Resolved by HADOOP-1470.]
