[create-release only supports oracle JDK:

https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/ccd2ac60ecc5fccce56debf21a068e663c1d5f11/dev-support/bin/create-release#L492

I started to undo that in HADOOP-14816., Thanks for update, [~aw]. I will try your patch in HADOOP-14816 and provide update., Just in case it isn't obvioius: you'll need to pull it apart for 2.8.2.  It also needs some documentation, etc.

, I tried to apply HADOOP-14816 but hitting with many conflicts -almost all for Dockerfile. Sounds like we are missing many patches in branch-2 and 2.8. Do we need to backport all/most of them back to branch-2/2.8? I saw we were upgrading cmake, maven, etc. Some patch like remove JDK 7 should definitely be ignored. Will backport rest of them can cause incompatible issues?
If backport is a risky option, It would be nice if we can have a fix for branch-2/branch-2.8 only., Attach a patch to fix java issue I met. Mostly refer from HADOOP-14816 but cut off other update on cmake, maven related upgrade. Tried locally successful., (!) A patch to the testing environment has been detected. 
Re-executing against the patched versions to perform further tests.
