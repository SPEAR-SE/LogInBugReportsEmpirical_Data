[I'm attaching a patch that changes the assertion to poll every 500 ms for the expired entry, up to a maximum of 5 seconds.  With this patch, the test passes for me consistently in multiple environments.

This is basically the same logic as {{GenericTestUtils#waitFor}}, but I wanted to avoid introducing a test dependency from hadoop-nfs to hadoop-common just for one call to that method.
