[An approach to the above problem is to make the value in the map (used to implement the cache) a soft reference. Then when no one is referencing a particular FileSystem instance, and the memory is under pressure, the GC can delete the entry (and unless the Configuration object is referenced from elsewhere, that would go away too). 

Patch for Y20S (not for commit)., TestFileSystemCache.java: file system cache test , This is not a problem anymore.]
