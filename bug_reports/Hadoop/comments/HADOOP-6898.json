[Is there no umask set for the corresponding user?

(Even if the default permissions are 777, the umask setting should have stripped some of them out upon file-creation.), The umask is set, but create() actually specifically chmods the file to 777 after it's created., Solution to this issue is to use: 

FsPermission.getUMask(this.getConf()) !=null?FsPermission.getUMask(this.getConf()):FsPermission.getDefault().

Please suggest., Marking it as a blocker for now.  Not, however, a regression., Aaron, any update on this for 0.22?, Sorry for the delay, Nigel. Patch attached., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
