[This patch adds catches around each of the routines that may throw in the offerService loop, with the exception of the emitHeartbeat. (I left one of them unguarded so that if the connection was down, it will get back to TaskTracker.run().) It also moves the time of the previous heartbeat to the top of the cycle rather than the bottom, which means that under load the task tracker stays much closer to a 10 second cycle than before., I should add that there are other, as yet undiscovered sources of long latency in the TaskTracker. We've seen pings and progress calls that take 5 minutes to complete. This patch does not solve that problem at all., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
