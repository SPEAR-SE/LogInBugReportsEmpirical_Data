This message is automatically generated., Hi, [~jira.shegalov].  Thanks for the patch.  This change makes sense to me.  Tomorrow morning, I'll put it through some additional testing and give it the final review., [~jira.shegalov], the patch looks great.  I just have one question.

All HDFS symlinks have their permissions set to 777.  Conceptually, symlinks don't really have permissions of their own.  Instead, permission enforcement checks are done using the permissions of the symlink target.

For consistency, I'm wondering if we should change this patch so that viewfs internal dirs are set to 555 (as you have already done) and the mount link is set to 777.  From what I understand, this would still meet your needs for the YARN localizer.  What do you think?, Chris, 0555 is more correct since the mount links are not writable (like other internal dirs)., That seems inconsistent with the existing 777 symlinks, but I also don't think it's important enough to hold up a blocker fix for further debate.

+1 for the current patch.  I'll get this committed later today., Thanks for your comments, Chris, Sanjay!

[~sanjay.radia], I think [~cnauroth] points out that mount links per se are like symlinks, are not real files nor directories and therefore always have 777. Unfortunately, I don't have much time right now to verify the usefulness of this modification, i.e., are you ever able to see the file status of an unresolved mount link. , bq. are you ever able to see the file status of an unresolved mount link.

Theoretically, yes, this is possible via things like the {{FileSystem#getFileLinkStatus}} API.  I don't see this overridden in {{ViewFileSystem}} though, which is possibly a distinct bug.  {{ViewFs}} appears to do it correctly.

Anyway, I'm still +1 for this patch.  I'll plan to commit later, and we can revisit discussion on some of these less critical aspects later if needed.

Thanks [~jira.shegalov]!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5382 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5382/])
