[Here is a patch that fixes the above issue.

 Note that, even with this patch, it is not possible to use different hars for input and output for the SortValidator as the Cache that stores the different file systems is based only on the scheme, authority and user information and does not use the entire har name. So,

 bin/hadoop jar hadoop-0.19.0-dev-test.jar testmapredsort -sortInput har:///user/jothipn/foo.har/user/jothipn/input -sortOutput  ouput              -->works
 bin/hadoop jar hadoop-0.19.0-dev-test.jar testmapredsort -sortInput  input -sortOutput  har:///user/jothipn/foo1.har/user/jothipn/output           -->works
 bin/hadoop jar hadoop-0.19.0-dev-test.jar testmapredsort -sortInput har:///user/jothipn/foo.har/user/jothipn/input -sortOutput  har:///user/jothipn/foo1.har/user/jothipn/output  -->does not work., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
