[The line of "+" with a number of following whilespace characters needs to be skipped, such that the context @Test will not be regarded as a newly added test by mistake., We could just use the -1 posted, as currently done, to cleanup the other tests without timeout. Any reasons not to do that?, I agree it's good to cleanup the existing tests without timeout, but my concern is that this issue is to mislead people to thinking there're missed timeouts in their newly added tests. Hence people should be aware of this issue., Ultimately what we really need is HADOOP-9330, and then we can remove all of the code that is checking for timeouts., It seems that nontimeoutTests is no longer checked.]
