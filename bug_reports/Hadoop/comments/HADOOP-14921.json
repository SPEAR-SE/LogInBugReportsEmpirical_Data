[[~aw], you have been working on the shell script part. What are your thoughts on this?, A few thoughts:

a) In production systems, the user part of the string likely won't be the same, much less running on the same system.

b) If people REALLY want to run the two daemons on the same node as the same user, then HADOOP_IDENT_STRING is already available to provide a way for users to do their own differentiation, just like they can with running e.g., two DataNode processes on the same node.

c) Or, custom entries in hadoop-user-function to do exactly what you're proposing.  

d) Having multiple, different daemons called the same thing is awful.  jps, logs, pids, documentation ... it's going to be terrible for admins. ("No, I meant the YARN router." "No, I meant the HFDS router.")  I'd HIGHLY recommend renaming it to something else.
, Thanks for the thoughts [~aw].
At this point, I think it may make sense to rename the {{Router}} from the HDFS side.
Before I move this question to another JIRA, do you have any suggestion for this renaming?
, hdfs-router?, That would be for the command line?
It might be a little redundant to start as {{hdfs hdfs-router}}.
I would need to change the class name anyway.
I added more details in HDFS-12577., hdfs dfsrouter 

This is consistent with hdfs dfsadmin, etc.]
