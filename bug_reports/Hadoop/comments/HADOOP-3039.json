[We're running into this too (in streaming jobs).

Another workaround is to add a {{FileSystem.closeAll()}} to TaskTracker.java just after closing the {{metricsContext}}.

That said, my take from reading FileSystem.java is that the shutdown hook (ClientFinalizer) was intended to do this, but it isn't running because the DataStreamer is a non-daemon thread. This would imply that adding {{streamer.setDaemon(true)}} is a better solution., patch adding streamer.setDaemon(true) in DFSClient., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., +1 Code looks good., This shouldn't require a testcase (it does a dfsclient thread change) and involves timing issues to do with detecting job failures. , I just committed this.
