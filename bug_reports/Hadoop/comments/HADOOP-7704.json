It looks like test-patch is not applying the change because the code changed is in common and not under hadoop-mapreduce-project.  You may want to close this JIRA and file a new one in HADOOP with the patch in it., Thanks Bobby for reviewing.

I have moved it to hadoop common and attached the same patch., I am always happy to look at a patch that makes the bad code I wrote better.  Thanks for seeing these issues and fixing them., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
