This message is automatically generated., The failing tests seem to be scheduler-related:

org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestQueueCapacities.testSingleQueue
org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestQueueCapacities.testSingleQueueMultipleJobs
org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestQueueCapacities.testMultipleQueues, Upping this to critical priority since does-not-build-from-source is pretty serious in my opinion., I've just committed this. Thanks Todd!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #824 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/824/])
    , This should be committed to branch-0.20 as well, since it causes a fail to build from release source on many systems. , I committed this to the 0.20 branch.

The C++ code should probably make use of the std namespace instead of using global imports, but that is a broader, more pervasive issue that can be dealt with separately., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #163 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/163/])
    . Commit to branch 0.20
, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk #247 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk/247/])
    . Commit to branch 0.20
, This is not Debian specific. The same happens on RHEL6.
The root cause is a cleanup of header files in Gcc 4.3 which exposes missing includes.
As Sreekanth pointed out in HADOOP-5678, this is documented in http://www.cyrius.com/journal/2007/05/10#gcc-4.3-include

RHEL5 uses gcc 4.1.2
RHEL6 uses gcc 4.4.5
Ubuntu Natty Narwhal uses gcc 4.5.2

This should be applied to branch-0.20-security and the 0.20.205 branch.

Note that HADOOP-5611 must also be applied after this patch., Uhm, the note should read:

MAPREDUCE-1251 must also be applied after this patch.]
