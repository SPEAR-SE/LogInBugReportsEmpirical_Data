[I presume you mean the cluster directory, or hadoop config directory. Just FYI, Hadoop 0.18 version of HOD will auto-create this if it doesn't exist., Yes.
I am aware of that.
The problem is that the HOD still requires the user to explicitly specify a UNIQUE cluster directory for each hod ob, even though it runs a given script.

 , +1 overall, but why the change to maxentToSameCluster? This looks like it's reverting HADOOP-3435.
