This message is automatically generated., A few comments:

* StackServlet shouldn't use HtmlQuoting since it is serving plain text.
* We need to be sure that StackServlet is serving UTF8-encoded text. Currently it is using the default platform encoding since it is using a writer constructed with new PrintWriter(response.getOutputStream()), see http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html#PrintWriter%28java.io.OutputStream%29. Rather we might use response.getWriter(), which uses the character encoding returned by ServletResponse#getCharacterEncoding(), which should pick it up from our earlier call to ServletResponse#setContentType, according to http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/ServletResponse.html#getWriter%28%29. The other servlets need checking for this too.
* For JSON, MetricsServlet should set the content type to "application/json; charset=utf-8". It's not currently setting the content type.
* ConfServlet should set the charset explicitly too., Canceling patch to address Tom's comments. Thanks Tom, Updated based on review comments. I tested /stacks, /metrics, and /conf on a running NN and looks good:

todd@todd-w510:~$ curl -s -I 'http://localhost:50070/metrics?format=json' | grep 'Content-Type'
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
todd@todd-w510:~$ curl -s -I 'http://localhost:50070/metrics' | grep 'Content-Type'
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
todd@todd-w510:~$ curl -s -I 'http://localhost:50070/conf' | grep 'Content-Type'
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
todd@todd-w510:~$ curl -s -I 'http://localhost:50070/stacks' | grep 'Content-Type'
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Nit: with this patch there are two mimetypes for JSON; we should use "application/json" in both cases (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627)., Fixed the JSON content type nit that Tom pointed out, also fixed release audit warning., Oops, missed test.jsp in the previous patch, +1 overall.
