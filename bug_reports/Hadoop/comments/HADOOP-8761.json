This message is automatically generated., I think the correct behavior should be to match the usage.  The unix stat uses %b for blocks, and %s for size in bytes., bq. I think the correct behavior should be to match the usage. The unix stat uses %b for blocks, and %s for size in bytes.

I agree that adding %s for size in bytes is a good idea, but changing the semantics of %b is an incompatible change, which seems risky.  OTOH, I think it would be potentially very useful to expose "number of blocks in this file".

Tangentially, the documentation also fails to describe %F., Targeting for 2.2.0.

Philip, it looks like the TestCLI failure is related, probably because it's expecting some specific help text., True, it's incompatible yet correct behavior.  I guess our options are codify the bad behavior forever, or fix it now.  I lean toward the latter since there's enough churn in 2.x that this will be a minor inconvenience for people to adjust.  What do the other watchers/lurkers think?, bq. True, it's incompatible yet correct behavior. I guess our options are codify the bad behavior forever, or fix it now.

Since this is client-side code, we could do something like
# in 2.1.0, add %s and leave %b giving bytes, with a stderr message that %b will change in a future release.
# in 2.2.0, change %b to give blocks and remove the stderr message.

bq. True, it's incompatible yet correct behavior.

I'm a little skeptical that "correct" with respect to POSIX stat(2) is significant here. The "blocks" used in {{struct stat}} are very different from the "blocks" in HDFS; POSIX blocks are fixed size, atomically written [1], and the block size is a legacy feature (hardcoded to 512 bytes which is not the underlying size of anything anymore). By contrast HDFS blocks are variable size, nonatomic, and are much larger than POSIX blocks.

I agree that exposing the blocksize (and the blockcount) is a pretty valuable feature, but there's a lot of caveats.  Just off the top of my head: a single file can have multiple blocksizes.

[1] blocks aren't guaranteed to be atomic by the POSIX spec AFAIK, but as a practical matter modern implementations are atomic at some blocksize between 512 and 4096 bytes., This patch has been rebased and renamed for test-patch process for the bug bash., \\
