This message was automatically generated., The release audit is not related to my change. I looked at Console output, and the issue seems to be no test cases. Since this change is in cmd file, there are no tests., Thanks [~radhey] for taking this up. The patch LGTM. 
Just a minor comment, can you check if %JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH% is not empty before prep-ending it., Added suggestion by Subru, \\
