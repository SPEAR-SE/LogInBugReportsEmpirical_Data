[Any idea which change caused this issue and if you know it can you link it to this jira?, patch cleaning up all unnecessary dependencies from hadoop-client.

Suresh, answering your question, no idea. the root problem is that hadoop and (its 3rd party deps) do a lousy job declaring what is exactly needed. because of that, we need to curate deps regularly, ideally we should do that as part of the release checklist., It might be related to the attempts to fix/workaround MAPREDUCE-2980, not 100% sure though. The only repo where this dependency is presented is {{https://repository.cloudera.com/artifactory/cloudera-repos}}, meaning that somewhere the dependencies are contaminated with non-ASF repositories, which is pretty awful, in my opinion., I guess, I missed the point, because the description was ran on non-ASF Hadoop environment., I see the jetty dependency propagated through {{hadoop-hdfs}}.
Alejandro, wouldn't it be a better way to solve the problem in downstream project by disabling transitive dependencies download?, The patch I'm working on (more on that after in the next paragraph) disables transitive dependencies that are not required, we have to do that one by one when we verify that they are not needed on the client side.

I've spent a good chunk of the day trying to validate my patch (using the resulting hadoop-client JARs in Oozie) but I'm running into other issues between Hadoop trunk and Oozie 3.3.1, thus have to diagnose that too.
, Feel free to pop a ticket at BigTop project if you feel that we might help with the integration issue somehow., I've done some limited testing in Oozie (due to other issues popping out) and the new hadoop-client seem to be right., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
