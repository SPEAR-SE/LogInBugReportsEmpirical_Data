[I'm trying to reproduce, could you please paste the info from the log file  */home/tsz/tmp/trunkJavacWarnings.txt*

Thanks,
Giri, I'm able to reproduce the failure.

After the the fix for HADOOP-4920, the package target depends on docs target, with inturn depends on forrest.home and java5.home

When we call the test-patch target through ant though, we pass the forrest.home & java5.home the test-patch.sh
script doesn't seem to pass the 2 env variables while calling the tar and findbugs target, which is causing the ant test-pach failure.

This patch *HADOOP-4849.patch cannot be tested, as it modifies the test-patch.sh itself.*

This patch is tested manually , here is the test-patch result:

+1 overall.

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 3 new or modified tests.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs warnings.

    +1 Eclipse classpath. The patch retains Eclipse classpath integrity.


Thanks,
Giri, +1 patch looks good., I just committed this to trunk.  Thanks, Giri!

If HADOOP-4920 is committed to 0.20, this one also should be., I still see the issue on the trunk, even with empty patch., Looks like problem was with the environment variables on my machine. Thanks Giri for helping it out., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #703 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/703/])
    . Add parameters java5.home and forrest.home to the ant commands in test-patch.sh.  (Giridharan Kesavan via szetszwo)
