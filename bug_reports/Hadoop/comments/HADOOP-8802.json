[This is a bug in hadoop testcase, order of hostname saved should be irrelevant. Testcase should not assume hostname order, in this case. 

Solution: validate stored host name without inforcing the order:

for(int i=0; i < gi.length; i++) {
      assertEquals(groups.get(i), gi[i]);  <==== check based on order, removed..
      assertTrue(groups.contains(gi[i])); <==== solution
     }
Note: this solution will work both on IBM JAVA and SUN JAVA, This was fixed on trunk with HADOOP-7290, just FYI.  Probably best to backport that patch wholesale., thanks Andy, done.
, the patch is roughly the same as is in trunk, which came in with HADOOP-7290]
