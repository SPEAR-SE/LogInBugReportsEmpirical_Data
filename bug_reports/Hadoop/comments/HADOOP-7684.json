Thanks, Eric!, +1 verified the patch with rpm installation on a single node cluster.

singlenode setup script requires a fix to create the required mapred dirs in the hdfs fs. Will file a separate jira for that. filed jira - HADOOP-7692

deb pkg installation fails on ubuntu as the groupid 114 is used by gdm. jira: HADOOP-7691, I just committed this to trunk and branch 0.23, thanks Matt and Giri., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1006 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1006/])
