[Usename is in the log entries right. Can you describe the problem better?, Hi Suresh,

Thanks for looking into this. 

The problem we came across was -- at times, multiple (2 in our case) users might write to the same file (at least attempt to open the file) simultaneously, because the hadoop.security.log.file is set to the same value. 

Please let me know if I am missing something here.

Thanks, I am uploading patches for branch-1 and branch-2., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1, Hi Karthik, is this on the client or on the server side? (Guessing its on client.. please confirm). In general, the audit log stuff doesn't make sense on the client side. It's meant to be used on the server side only (and in deployments I know about, the security audit logging is turned off on the client side). 
Your patch will work though. But I'll note that it might be introducing compatibility issues due to the filename change of the log file (if someone is collecting logs based on file names, etc.)., Devaraj, thanks for the feedback.

It is both on the client/server side. By server side, I mean for the jobtracker/namenode. Thanks for pointing the potential compatibility issue, I agree we need to note the incompatibility in log file change., Devaraj, are you OK with this patch after Karthik's clarifications?, Yes., Thanks Karthik.
