[Patch for asf-mailer.conf - I've fixed this to ensure it works for either trunk and branch-0.22.

I believe the existing pattern for hadoop/ should cover changes to the common maven infrastructure in hadoop/ too... 

Can someone please review this? Thanks., +1, looks good. I see you've added back the common/hdfs/mapreduce patterns for earlier branches, which I think is correct., Thanks for the review Tom.

I just committed it., Uh, doesn't look like I have commit access to asf-mailer.conf., +Doug, Ian

Can one of you pls commit this? Thanks., Committed revision 794904., Thanks for committing this Ian.]
