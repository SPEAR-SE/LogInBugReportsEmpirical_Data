[I am successfully able to start the yarn services if I run "$mvn install -DskipTests" before running "$mvn package -Pdist -DskipTests".

The contents of the modules directory in this case:

$ls -la modules/

, The problem seems to be these missing jars in the modules directory., Ahmed,
 Is this the issue with 0.23 as well? I think it might just be an issue with 0.24?, Mahadev, I faced this issue after I pulled the patch for HADOOP-7642, and this is why I used it's same "affects versions". Based on Tucu's advice, I'll pull also the latest changes from trunk including the MAPREDUCE-3003 patch. I'll retest to make see if the problem persists., The problem seemed to disappear after pulling the new patches.]
