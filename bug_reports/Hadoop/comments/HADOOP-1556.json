[I did some analysis but couldn't pinpoint the exact cause of this issue. I did notice that all the failures emanate out of the LocalJobRunner. What seems to happen is that files are left over from a previous job (test) and hence rename fails for the current test, and all tests thereafter. 
I have attached a patch that makes sure that files are deleted at the end of a LocalJob run. It also handles the case of #reduces=0., By the way, couldn't reproduce this problem at my end., +1
