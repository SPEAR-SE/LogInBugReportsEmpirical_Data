{code}
...
    "MaxFileDescriptorCount" : 32768,
    "OpenFileDescriptorCount" : null,
...
{code}

I'm not completely sure that "null" appearing here is kosher.  Any feedback appreciated.

This message is automatically generated., Andy, The patch looks good and I would like to commit it, but I need you to upload the patch again, and this time click the button marked "Grant license to ASF for inclusion in ASF works..."  Otherwise I cannot check it in. , Re-uploading patch with license grant ticked., Robert,

Thanks for offering to commit the patch!  I've reuploaded it with the license grant checked.

Also, just to be completely clear -- the TestViewFsTrash regression does not appear to be related to my patch; and I didn't add a regression test due to the difficulty of testing a kernel-dependent failure., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
