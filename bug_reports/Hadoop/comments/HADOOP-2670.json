[This is likely an error from kernel (ENOMEM). If it is JVM, the actual error message might be different. You can check number of threads/processes on the machine and how much memory is left for kernel., you're probably right - most comments on the web on this stack dump seem to say the same thing. we will have to lower our heap settings.

thanks!]
