[This is not a windows error - this is bad HTML in the javadoc.

Try {{mvn clean package -Pdist -Dtar -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -fail-at-end -Pnative}} as a workaround.

And if you feel like contributing, the doc HTML patches should be an easy one., it's in branch-2/trunk; for some reason this specific java8 compiler is catching and failing.

not a windows problem; java8 -marking as such, HADOOP-10320 fixed this in trunk; the backporting of this (via a cherry pick) actually introduced the bug back into 2.6; commit 6cda3a7. 

I propose to fix this by reverting the HADOP-10320 patch from branch-2. trunk does not have the problem, [~stevel@apache.org], thank you for catching this.  The other alternative is to backport HADOOP-8059, which made these Javadoc enhancements in trunk only, to branch-2.  That would keep the code in sync between the 2 branches, which is easier for maintenance.  What do you think?, I did the rollback as that avoided me having the prepare a patch. If you want to backport, I'm happy, I merged HADOOP-8059 to get this code consistent across the branches.]
