[You have a leak, but the screenshot isn't showing the leak.  The highlighted strings are both in the same UGI instance.

Screenshot-1 shows a {{HashMap.Node}} from the {{FileSystem.Cache}}.  The {{HashMap.Node.key}} field above it is a {{FileSystem.Cache.Key}} which references a {{UserGroupInformation}}.  The {{HashMap.Node.value}} field shown is a {{DistributedFileSystem}} instance, which references the same {{FileSystem.Cache.Key}}.  You can see from the hashcodes that the ugi  is identical.

The problem is you have ~20k {{Subject}} instances.  Are you repeatedly invoking {{UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser}}?, Can you give more details on where the heap dump is from?  It looks like you are running Spark.  Are you using the --keytab option?]
