Patch looks good, but I have one nit on the unit test.  Rather than unit testing not() just for the behavior of the lone bit, I think it would be better to test the other bits as well to ensure the not() method really behaves as expected.  If there had been a proper not() unit test previously then it would have caught this error and other types of errors that could occur in an implementation of not()., Thanks, [~jlowe], for the review and comments.

I have updated the test case in version 2 of the patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
