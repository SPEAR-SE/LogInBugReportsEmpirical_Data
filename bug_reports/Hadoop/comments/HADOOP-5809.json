This message is automatically generated., +1. Patch looks good to me, and I just ran into the same issue., Can someone plz take this forward and commit it., The issue cannot be unit tested as it is invoked when job client is called thro' mapred command. I have manually tested and verified the fix works., Could you add a testcase that would test this please. Thanks!, Attaching the patch which incorporates the fix and has added a new test case.

Test case does following:

- Writes out a Java program which would create a file in {{test.data.dir}}.
- Use Compiler api to compile the java file.
- Create a runnable jar file from compiled class file.
- Use {{RunJar}} to execute the jar. If {{RunJar}} throws exception or VM exits, the test case reports a Failure/Error., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
