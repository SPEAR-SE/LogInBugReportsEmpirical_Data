[Note, we have 
{code}
log4j.logger.com.sun.jersey.server.wadl.generators.WadlGeneratorJAXBGrammarGenerator=OFF
{code}
in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-kms/src/main/conf/kms-log4j.properties
in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-kms/src/test/resources/log4j.properties

I think we just need to update WadlGeneratorJAXBGrammarGenerator to AbstractWadlGeneratorGrammarGenerator, Disregard my last comment. Changed that andÂ doesn't seem to work. I know for a fact that these bogus messages go into stderr though, it'll be the java logging API, so not log4j

I don't see why WADL generation should be enabled at all; if that can be turned off, the traces will go away.]
