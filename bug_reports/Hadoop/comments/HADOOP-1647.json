[This patch returns "/" as the name of rootDir. , Well, i had also fixed this, but haven't time to upload it *smile*
dhruba, why not we change only,  in {{INode#computeName()}}
{code}
       if (parent != null) {
         return parent.computeName() + "/" + name;
       } else {
-        return name;
+        return "/";
       }
     }
{code}, It will be good if this patch is applied to 0.14 also. , One line patch for slightly annoying javadoc. , It seems that my version of the patch {{INode#computeName()}} fails other unit tests. I guess the root node is not the only one with parent being null. , Hi Enis, i think ur patch might cause problems in some other areas. Especially if u rin the unit tests. Please let me know if my patch fixes your problem., I am marking this as a blocker so that it gets into 0.14. , I am curious how Enis' patch above is functionally different? Is there any case where rootDir has non null parent?, +1. As Dhruba pointed on hadoop-dev, Enis' patch results in "//root/dir1/dir2" (extra '/').
, Attach patch merged with latest trunk., 
This jira is marked to be in 0.14. Are you going to have another patch for 14?
, oops! HADOOP-1653 also went into 0.14.
, This patch is needed for 0.14. This patch depends on HADOOP-1653. So, HADOOP-1653 also went into 0.14., Raghu had an excellent review comment saying that the rootInode can be detected by comparing inode->parent == NULL rather than comparing an inode with FSDirectory.rootDir. Incorporated this change., +1.
, I just committed this. ]
