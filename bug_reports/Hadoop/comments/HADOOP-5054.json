[Moved date generation into the shell script while loop., Automatic partition expiration is also not working correctly., - Fixed shell script with date generation.
- Fixed data expiration for partition smaller than positive number.
- Added debug statement for Table Creation.
, Looks okay.  I'm a bit nervous about the lack of tests, though I understand that it's hard to unit-test this sort of thing. Has it been tried out in production?, Yes, have been running this in our deployment., It looks like this patch hardcodes the number of partitions to keep.  Can we push this into config?  Should we?, The number of partitions to keep is hard coded for now.  If more people show interest that "the number of partitions to keep" should be configurable, then we move this to config file., I put a +1 even if the number of partition is hardcoded since it fixes some critical bugs.
Adding the number of partitions to the config requires to revalidate the current logic so it's better to open a Jira request just for it if needed.
, Okiedoke, I'm convinced., I just committed this.  Thanks guys., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #778 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/778/])
