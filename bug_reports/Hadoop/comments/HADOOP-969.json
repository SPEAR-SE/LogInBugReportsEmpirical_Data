[This code has gotten pretty hairy, but this patch goes through the list of jobs to find ones that need to be retired. It then locks everything including the JobTracker first and does the mutations to all of the maps. We really need to refactor the datastructures at some point soon..., + 1 the patch fixes the problem., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!, -1, because the patch command could not apply the latest attachment (http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12350238/jt-dead.patch) as a patch to trunk revision r502726. Please note that this message is automatically generated and may represent a problem with the automation system and not the patch.]
