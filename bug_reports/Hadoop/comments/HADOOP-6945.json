[+1.  And this is a big enough annoyance to back-port to 0.20.   It clearly has very small scope of breaking things (HADOOP-6184).  I currently remove the jackson jar from the hadoop lib dir on all my nodes (CDH3 0.20).

As long as so many hadoop jars come first in a task's path, any feature that creates a new jar dependency should be _heavily_ scrutinized before inclusion. , +1 It's a pain in the butt to have to strip this out of all the nodes in our cluster. Please either remove it or bump the version to a much more recent one. , given that Jackson is only used to serialize the config, and also that generating valid JSON is fairly straightforward, why not get rid of the jackson dependency at all and just have a json serializer class? jackson (or something like json-lib or gson) could just be used to validate the content in the unit tests., Which is the status of that ticket? We are having the same trouble. For example, Avro depends on a higher Jackson version, so there are troubles when using it., This was fixed as part of HADOOP-7606 and HADOOP-7470.  , Both CDH3 and 1.0 break if using Avro 1.6.2.  Avro 1.6.3 (currently a release candidate) avoids using the Jackson bits that cause the issue when a Jackson library between 1.3.x and 1.5.x is on the classpath (as with CDH3).

In our cluster we removed Jackson from all task tracker nodes (yet again, it was OK for a while).  One day Hadoop won't put a bunch of unnecessary crap on M/R app classpaths and clearly distinguish libraries that are needed in this context from things that are needed only for the framework.  Jackson is one of several libraries with similar issues.]
