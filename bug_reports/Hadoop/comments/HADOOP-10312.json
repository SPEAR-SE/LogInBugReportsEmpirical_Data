it failed, but it's not obvious why, I've always wanted it to be easier to capture stdout/stderr from failed external commands too.  It could be potentially spammy though, so maybe it would need to go behind debug log level somehow.

If you want to keep the scope of this issue to just the exit code, please go ahead, and I'll file a separate issue related to capturing stdout/stderr., adds a toString operator with the exit code and marks the exit code as final. 

The exit code field is still left as protected -there's no direct accessors and we could make it private, I'm in favor of making {{exitCode}} private.  I looked back on HADOOP-2512, which introduced this exception class.  There doesn't appear to be any historical reason that it needs to be package-private., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
