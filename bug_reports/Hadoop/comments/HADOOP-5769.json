[In [HDFS Permissions Guide |http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/r0.20.0/hdfs_permissions_guide.html#Overview], it says,
"... When a file or directory is created, its owner is the user identity of the client process, and its group is the group of the parent directory (the BSD rule)."

Thus, this is not a bug., Gotcha - I didn't realize that BSD and Linux differed in this respect, or that HDFS had BSD semantics rather than Linux semantics, since most people deploy on Linux. Thanks., I would vote for changing it to POSIX/Linux.  Only BSD seems to be the odd one on this., Is this worth making a configuration option?]
