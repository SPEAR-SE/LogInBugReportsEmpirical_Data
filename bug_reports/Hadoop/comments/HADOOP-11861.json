[[~aw] would you like to take a look at this to see if this is related to the new changes to build ?, On this line, {{NATIVE_PROFILE}} would be undefined.

{code}
  echo_and_redirect "${PATCH_DIR}/patchJavacWarnings.txt" "${MVN}" clean test -DskipTests -D${PROJECT_NAME}PatchProcess "${NATIVE_PROFILE}" -Ptest-patch
{code}

It seems like we end up passing an extra empty string argument to the mvn call, and mvn interprets that as an extra goal to run, which of course doesn't exist.

* better branch detection, esp for Jenkins and reexec mode
* add --branch command line option
* add better debugging for branch detection
* force a pull after switching branches to make sure that branch is up-to-date
, [~cnauroth], please review and commit when you get a chance.  It'd be better for this to go in sooner rather than later given the broken workspace bug that pops up on the Jenkins environment.

Thanks., (!) A patch to test-patch or smart-apply-patch has been detected.
