[Paths without schemes were being used in MapTask.java. So the local split file was being written into dfs by mistake. This patch fixes that problem, makes the dfs client reject illegal names immediately, and adds a new static method to get the local file system., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12347526/dos-dfs.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r488444., I just committed this.  I made two minor changes.  I used LocalFileSystem.NAME instead of new URI("file:///") to name the LocalFileSystem, and I replaced calls to FileSystem.getNamed("local",...) with FileSystem.getLocal(...).

Thanks, Owen!]
