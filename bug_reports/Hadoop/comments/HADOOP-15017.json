[The invalid pathname is the enire string begging d://Repositories
{code}
Pathname /D:/Repositories/Maven/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.39/mysql-connector-java-5.1.39.jar from hdfs://10.162.3.171:8020/D:/Repositories/Maven/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.39/mysql-connector-java-5.1.39.jar is not a valid DFS filename.

There's some error in your environment, classpath setup, command line, etc. 

Closing as invalid, also deleting your password from the bug report. Safest to change it anyway, especially if you've used it anywhere else., Thanks for your answer and reminding :)
I have solved this problem by updating my Hadoop version in Maven.]
