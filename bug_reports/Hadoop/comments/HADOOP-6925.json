[Patch fixes the read() implementation to correctly mask with 0xff before upcasting to int. Also augments the unit test to check the single-byte read() function - the new test fails before this patch., This may fix HADOOP-6852, as well.  (The unit test in question is available as a standalone patch in MAPREDUCE-1927, which is awaiting review.)  If so, I can update the unit test to uncomment the relevant bzip2 test.

I'll make a note to check this soon..., +1

Looks good. Nice find., +1

*sigh* This was introduced between v9 of the patch and v11. Good catch, Committed to trunk and branch-0.20.  Thanks Todd., Forgot to mention that I verified TestCodec passed on trunk and the merge to branch-0.21. Previous comment has a typo, meant *branch-0.21* not branch-0.20., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #365 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/365/])

Nope, concatenation is still broken.  Ah, well., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk #433 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk/433/])
