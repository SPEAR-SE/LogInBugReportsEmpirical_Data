[The error message for non existing files is normal. Appears that the only failed test is the chgrp. Is the user id jenkins  a member of the group admin? , Current test case assumes jenkins (or the test runner) is part of the "admin" group.
Suggest to change test case to add 
1) positive test scenario that includes the users' group
2) and negative scenario that includes none-existing-group. (invalid group)

something like:
+    String[] groups = UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser().getGroupNames();
-    String argv[] = { "-chgrp", "admin", f1 };
-    verify(fs, "-chgrp", argv, 1, fsShell, 0);
+    for (String member : groups)
+    {
+      String argv[] = { "-chgrp", member, f1 };
+      verify(fs, "-chgrp", argv, 1, fsShell, 0);
+    }
-    // Test 2: exit code for chgrp on non existing path is 1
+    // Test 2: exit code for non-existing group on existing file
+    String argv1[] = { "-chgrp", "groupdoesnotexist", f1 };
+    verify(fs, "-chgrp", argv1, 1, fsShell, 1);
