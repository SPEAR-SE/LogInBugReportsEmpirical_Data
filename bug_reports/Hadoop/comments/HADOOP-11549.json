[Hi [~ozawa] and [~ajisakaa],

Thank you guys for the help with HADOOP-11045 earlier. 

I was testing the hadoop-common side earlier, and tried hdfs today and saw this problem. I found a solution here and tested it against python 2.x and 3.x.

Another side problem I observed is what Akira pointed out in earlier review about permission bits. I did set the permission bits per Akira's comments. When I synced in the latest trunk, I saw that the tool script doesn't have exe permission.

Let's see if my patch here can address both issues.

Thanks a lot for following up.
