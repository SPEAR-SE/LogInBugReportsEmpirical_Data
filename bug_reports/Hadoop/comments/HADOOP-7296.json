[Patch., Hi Siddarth,

The patch looks pretty good, though it looks to me like your patch introduces a tab character in {{src/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/permission/FsPermission.java}}. Our convention is to expand these into spaces. Would you mind uploading a new version without the tab?

Also, what version of Hadoop is this patch for? Please fill in the affects version field as appropriate., Thanks for looking at it. Fixed the tab. This exists in 0.21 and subsequent versions. Will mark that., +1, the patch looks good to me., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
