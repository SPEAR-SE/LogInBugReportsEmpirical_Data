[Have you tried this with later versions of Hadoop artifacts?, http://www.us.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/

1.1.2 is the only release that appears to have an RPM option.

Where can I find a later version in RPM form?, This is still an issue in the recently released 1.2.1 RPMs -

Transaction check error:
  file /usr/bin from install of hadoop-1.2.1-1.x86_64 conflicts with file from package filesystem-3.2-13.fc19.x86_64
  file /usr/lib from install of hadoop-1.2.1-1.x86_64 conflicts with file from package filesystem-3.2-13.fc19.x86_64
  file /usr/lib64 from install of hadoop-1.2.1-1.x86_64 conflicts with file from package filesystem-3.2-13.fc19.x86_64
  file /usr/sbin from install of hadoop-1.2.1-1.x86_64 conflicts with file from package filesystem-3.2-13.fc19.x86_64
, Closing as won't fix, since we no longer build RPMs as part of the main Hadoop project.]
