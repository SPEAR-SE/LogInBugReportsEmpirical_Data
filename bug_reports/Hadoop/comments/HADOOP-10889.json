[I looked at a few and they seem to be okay. If we find any that are broken we could fix them under this Jira.

We need to check that every test uses a unique sub-directory for its test files and contents of test.build.data are not deleted at the root level. I'll do a quick pass over the tests later today., Thanks Arpit! I totally agree. Let's try to fix all in this jira. Like you said, we need to find testcases that don't set the test root of their own. I actually did some search earlier, saw "target/test/data", "build/test/data" and "/tmp" are used at different places. We can standardize on it too. I prefer "build/test/data".

BTW, thanks for changing the title of this jira, it's certainly much better one.
