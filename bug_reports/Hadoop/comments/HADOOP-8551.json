, This is an incompatible change right?, Yes., We should update the release notes to indicate that this is an incompatible change. Please add in release notes details about incompatibility and how to work around it. Also we need to move the change description of this jira to incompatible section in CHANGES.txt.

Does this not cause issues at Yahoo?, Checked the Incompatible change checkbox. , No, this doesn't affect yahoo.  Our customers have already updated their jobs that require multi-level directory creation., bq. Also we need to move the change description of this jira to incompatible section in CHANGES.txt.
Can you please take care of this as well for all the relevant releases?, I think it's actually worth considering reverting this from branch-2 and having a warning there about it being deprecated in 2.x. I reverted this change from CDH because it broke some many internal users and tests., By adopting better posix compliance, there are a number of other "incompatible" changes in the shell.  Such as nothing auto-magically creates parent dirs anymore.  It was an oversight that mkdir did since the -p flag was there.  It seems like a minor change for users to add "-p", but that's just my $.02., That's what I thought as well, however w/in a couple week of pulling it in there were enough tests/programs failing and people complaining that I reverted it. Apparently a lot of people depend on this behavior. People have been fine with all the other incompatible shell changes, have left all those in., If the community feels that it should be reverted in branch-2 then I am fine with reverting it in branch-0.23 as well.  We just want to be sure that there is a deprecation warning, and preferably that it only prints out when a -p would be required in the future, but was not given.  , If it's too much of a problem to s/mkdir /mkdir -p /, rather than reverting I'd suggest a config option (I know, I know) that in generally can be used to enable/disable deprecated behavior in the shell., please no new config.  I know you don't want to revert this, but a config is not going to make it any easier to get people off of the old behavior, it will just give them a crutch they they will start to rely on., We'll disable and mark it final so they can't use deprecated behavior. ;)  Cloudera won't., bq. If it's too much of a problem to s/mkdir /mkdir -p /

Just replacing mkdir with "mkdir -p" doesn't fix things because Hadoop 1.x doesn't support the "-p" option so if you just add "-p" everywhere your programs break on old releases. I'm surprised you haven't hit this trying to deploy 0.23., Our customers all updated their jobs., And I guess those jobs will never run on older 205 clusters. We have to worry about jobs (and tests) that run on multiple versions and didn't want to require people update their jobs (most of the other shell changes that were incompatible didn't actually require people update their jobs)., A major boundary (2.x) seems like the right time to 'fix' this.

Eli - we could add 'mkdir -p' to branch-1 too., That's a good idea, filed HADOOP-8873.

Even with this change it's still somewhat of an issue because while the command will now work on both a 1.x and 2.x release, it will still fail on the bulk of the 1.x install base.]
