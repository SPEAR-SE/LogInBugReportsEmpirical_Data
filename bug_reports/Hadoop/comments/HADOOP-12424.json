This message was automatically generated., [~owen.omalley] can you also review it? Thanks. This is actual separation of patch of HDFS-8855 that fails the build since it doesn't compile hadoop common changes., Jenkins passed build for the parent work HDFS-8855. Marked this as not a problem any more.]
