[same issue on m2.4xlarge ... so certainly it is not related to instance type 
any clue/pointers would be appreciated. 
Thanks, What is the (max) number of M-R child processes running on the machine ? 

What does 'jps' say , in terms of other java processes running on the machine ? 

, Okay, It turns out that ulimit was the problem.
Setting mapred.child.ulimit=unlimited (mapred-site.xml) solves the problem for me.
In whirr.properties, you can set it as following.
hadoop-mapreduce.mapred.child.ulimit=unlimited, It was a setting problem. (by whirr) ulimit was not set to unlimited which was causing jvm to fail.
