[You shouldn't be editing core-site.xml: if that is where you are putting login details for an object store, and you've committed that to some form of SCM: stop, revert, change the login credentials.

The JUnit tests in swift are designed to pick up details in auth-keys.xml. Not only can you have different ones for each machine, if you have an absolute XML include reference you can pick up hard values. And you can then set up a separate s3 bucket for each machine.

I would recommend you isolate with a separate bucket per host, not path underneath. things like test cleanup may interfere ... it's designed to purge everything to ensure you don't run up storage bills.

, Thank you for the reply, [~stevel@apache.org]. I agree with you. However, there could be corner case such as JVM crashes or unit tests terminated in outage. Even we set different value for each machine, for example, machine A has its own bucket. Because of previous outage, there is some leftover directories or files. The next unit test run incline to report error. 

I propose we use some timestamp for those hard values. Combining your suggest, we can guarantee that in every time unit test runs on every machine, they are using different hard values. Then, we may be little bit safer than current solution., I'd recommend that the tests clean up before as well as after then, then do a bit of spin to verify the path is gone. That way they can recover.

I have to do something simiilar with yarn functional tests: clean up any previous app instances in case they were left around, Thank you for the quick reply, [~steve_l]. I agree, we need to clean before and after tests. I will update the patch.]
