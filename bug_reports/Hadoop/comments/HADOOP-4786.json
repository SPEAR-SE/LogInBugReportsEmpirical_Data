[Trivial patch to fix the compilation issue., +1 for the patch, +1., I ran the test manually as a sanity test, and found that it sometimes is failing. Speaking with Amarsri, we found the testcase may need fixing. But since that is not related to the compilation failure, and could take longer to fix correctly, I am going to commit this patch in the interest of stabilizing compilation again. Apologize for the mix up., I committed this., Filed HADOOP-4787 to fail the random failing in TestTrackerBlacklistAcrossJobs., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #680 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/680/])
