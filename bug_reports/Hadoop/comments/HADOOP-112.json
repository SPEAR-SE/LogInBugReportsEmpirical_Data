[I just committed a fix for this.  DistributedFileSystem.copyFromLocal() no longer attempts to copy CRC files., I cannot see what exactly was committed here, but now regular dfs -cp doesn't
copy crc files, which causes e.g. dfs -cat complain about it.
I presume that changes were made to FileUtil.copyContents() which is called in
several places, which sometimes do and sometimes do not need crc files.
In case of dfs copy the crc files are needed., The changes made are listed at:

http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=390218&view=rev

The described problem was fixed: a -copyToLocal (a.k.a -get) followed by a -copyFromLocal (a.k.a. -put) no longer fails complaining about a .crc file.  If this is failing again then this bug should be re-opened.  Otherwise I think it should remain closed.

If there is a problem with 'dfs -cp' then I think that is a separate bug, no?
, Given the lack of further comments, I will re-close this.  If there are other, related bugs, please report them as new bugs rather than re-opening this again.]
