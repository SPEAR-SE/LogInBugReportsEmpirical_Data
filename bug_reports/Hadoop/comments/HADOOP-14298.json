, Hi [~andrew.wang], would you review this patch?, Before rushing to apply the patch: what's happened here to cause it? Because if it's a POM dependency change, it's going to surface downstream. We should make sure that the root cause is fixed, rather than fixing here what's going to surface everywhere, This goes back to HDFS-11596, where hadoop-hdfs no longer pulls in hadoop-hdfs-client as a compile-scoped dependency. This affects apps that use hadoop-hdfs directly (and there are a lot of them). We'd like them to use hadoop-hdfs-client instead, but maybe this is too big a shift. The bug being fixed in HDFS-11596 is minor overall.

[~stevel@apache.org], additional thoughts? I'm fine reverting HDFS-11596 and related., bq. The scope of hadoop-hdfs's dependency on hadoop-hdfs-client has changed from "compile" to "provided". This may affect users who directly consume hadoop-hdfs, which is a private API. These users need to add a new dependency on hadoop-hdfs-client, or better yet, switch from hadoop-hdfs to hadoop-hdfs-client.

Now I'm -0 for reverting this because the change is useful for users to avoid consuming hadoop-hdfs (i.e. private API) directly in Hadoop 3., I did a test compile of CDH with HDFS-11596 and related, and it breaks Hive compilation, but everything else succeeded.

Overall I think this is okay. The compilation errors are all for missing private APIs like DFSClient and DistributedFileSystem, which Hive shouldn't be using directly. Hive already requires a number of other fixes for Hadoop 3 as it is. I can post my WIP fix over on a Hive JIRA.

+1 thanks for the discussion Akira and Steve!, Committed to trunk, thanks for the patch Akira, and for discussion Steve!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #11694 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/11694/])
