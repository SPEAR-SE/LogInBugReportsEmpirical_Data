[Verified that, this does not happen in 0.20, What exactly is the problem here? Is it that hadoop-site.xml shadows mapred-site and co.? Are there straightforward steps to reproduce the problem?, If I have configuration specified for "mapred.job.tracker" or "fs.default.name" or any other in $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-site.xml, and run a test, the configuration from  $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-site.xml is picked up. But, the tests are expected to pickup configuration from src/test/*-site.xml, not from $HADOOP_HOME/conf/*-site.xml.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Specify fs.default.name as hdfs://localhost:19000 in $HADOOP-HOME/conf/hadoop-site.xml
2. Run TestMiniMRLocalFS using ant test -Dtestcase=TestMiniMRLocalFS. The test would fail., Attaching the test failure log, reproduced by above steps., This issue has been fixed by HADOOP-6374 and MAPREDUCE-1369]
