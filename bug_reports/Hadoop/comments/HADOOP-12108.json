[you are escaping the * on the CLI, right? so the shell isn't getting in there first?, no , I am not escaping * . 

do you mean I should be running it like hdfs dfs -ls -R /data/hadoop/sample/\* ?, hdfs dfs -ls -R /data/hadoop/sample/"\*" ?, that worked. escaping * with \ worked. it now shows only hdfs results.
Thanks !, that worked. escaping * with \ worked. it now shows only hdfs results.
Thanks !, Thanks Aman! Steve is right. You do need to use quotes when there is already a file on the local file system which would match the wildcard]
