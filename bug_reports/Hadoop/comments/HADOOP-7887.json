[The attached patch configures the name rules as part of the configuration of the KerberosAuthenticatorHandler.

Verified Kerberos testcases pass and added a new test to test this setting happens.

The UGI on initialization (first call to *isSecurityEnabled()* ) reads the name rules for Hadoop configuration files (-site.xml). It is not possible to se a different name rule directly. 

So, the trick is, if using hadoop-auth outside of Hadoop (ie by Oozie) set the name rules in the hadoop-auth configuration properties and call UGI.isSecurityEnabled() before the KerberosAuthenticationHandler is initialized. If using it from Hadoop no need to set it in the hadoop-auth configuration, it will use the one set by UGI, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., As a side comment, I'm not that happy with this fix. The main issue here is that hadoop-auth does not depend on hadoop-common and because of that UGI cannot be initialized from here. A more correct way of fixing this would be to decouple the setRules() from UGI initialization. Or ... if a namerules has been explicitly set, UGI should not override it.

The later approach seems cleaner, thoughts? I could add that to the patch and then the init first UGI caveat would disappear., Updated patch that does not requires UGI initialization in advance.

The UGI initialization will set the name rules only if they have not been already set.
