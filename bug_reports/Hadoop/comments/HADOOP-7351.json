This message is automatically generated., We should figure out what the intended interface audience and classification is for HttpServer... I'm thinking:
@InterfaceAudience.LimitedPrivate({"HDFS", "MapReduce", "HBase"})
@InterfaceStability.Evolving

does that sound right?, Sounds fine to me.  Want me to add this to patch?, Though, Todd, your suggestions are a little out of scope for this JIRA?  Should I do annotations in new issue?, Yea, other issue is fine. +1 for this issue, but let's try to get the annotations in 0.22 as well. Maintaining APIs that allow subclassing by other projects is tough., Added HADOOP-7355 to add annotations., Committed to 0.22 branch and to TRUNK.  Thanks for review Todd.

This small change makes it so HBase does not have to redo how it does its UI when it runs against hadoop 0.22; we subclass HttpServer so we can have the 'log level', 'thread dump', etc., servlets available in HBase UI. , Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #633 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/633/])
