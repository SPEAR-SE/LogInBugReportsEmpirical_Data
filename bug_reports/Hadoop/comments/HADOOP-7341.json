[Now seems like a great time to scrap {{CommandFormat}} altogether, in favor of the capabilities provided by Commons CLI, a dependency which Hadoop already includes for use in the {{GenericOptionsParser}}.

Thoughts?, hmm -- do you think it's correct behavior that we only support flags at the front of the args? Linux "ls" for example is fine with "ls / -l", Aaron:
I completely agree the parser needs to be changed, but I don't currently have the time available.  My goal here is a very small/quick change to revert how every FsShell command (except count) to how it used to work.  If you're ok with that, I think another jira should switch the parser.

Todd:
I suppose it comes down to whether hadoop should favor posix or gnu extensions?

{noformat}
$ mkdir a b

$ ls a -l b
a:
total 0
b:
total 0

$ POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 ls a -l b
ls: -l: No such file or directory
a:
b:
{noformat}

I was just planning to restore the prior behavior., ah, ok. I'm fine with just restoring the old behavior., Stop at first non-option, like before.
Also stop at opt/arg demarcation "--".

One nit: I'd recommend either removing the "@deprecated name is never used" from the comment, or changing the name of the parameter from "n" to "name". Outside of the context of this patch, the comment doesn't make much sense., Per Aaron, alter text related to deprecation., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
