[adds svn:executable properties to the files in chukwa bin dir that end in .sh (i.e. are shell scripts), This patch adds svn properties to make bin/*.sh files executable by default when checking chukwa out from svn repository., Looks sensible.  I don't know if the patch will roll on properly, but it's certainly a good thing to do.  +1, Updated patch, generated from HADOOP_HOME, instead of from CHUKWA_HOME, Usually property changes are posted as a script, since the patch is useless. I set everything in bin to be svn:executable (other than README and VERSION; do those really belong in bin?)

I committed these changes. Thanks, Andy]
