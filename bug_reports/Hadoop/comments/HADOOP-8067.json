[May be this will work better: https://github.com/hortonworks/hadoop-lzo, Using the link and downloading the hadoop-lzo.tar, we were able to successfully build it without relying on the hadoop-core-0.20.2.jar. After copying the necessary built files to the HBase library, LZO functions as expect and without any errors. Thanks, Using the hadoop-lzo-0.4.15.jar and native files from the build provided from https://github.com/hortonworks/hadoop-lzo we were able to enable LZO and get it functioning with Hadoop 1.0.0 and HBase 0.92.0 without any errors.]
