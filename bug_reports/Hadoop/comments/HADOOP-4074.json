[How about in lib/excluded like the checkstyle jar? This directory is not on the normal classpath, and isn't in subversion. We need to exclude it from being packaged too., If we're going to move to Ivy for dependency mgmt, then I think Ivy will solve this problem, yes?, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #595 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/595/]), Now that findbugs dependencies are resolved by ivy and hive is no more a contrib component 

closing this as wont fix

-Giri, What should we do for the following comments found in 0.20 test-patch.sh?
{code}
  ### DISABLE RELEASE AUDIT UNTIL HADOOP-4074 IS FIXED
  ### Do not call releaseaudit when run by a developer
  ### if [[ $HUDSON == "true" ]] ; then
    ### echo "$ANT_HOME/bin/ant -Dversion="${VERSION}" -DHadoopPatchProcess= releaseaudit > $PATCH_DIR/trunkReleaseAuditWarnings.txt 2>&1"
    ### $ANT_HOME/bin/ant -Dversion="${VERSION}" -DHadoopPatchProcess= releaseaudit > $PATCH_DIR/trunkReleaseAuditWarnings.txt 2>&1
  ### fi
{code}, releaseaudit target is executed as part of hudson test-patch execution, and we don't run test-patch for 20 branch on hudson.
Also, the developers can continue using test-patch if they want to test their patch against 20-branch.
