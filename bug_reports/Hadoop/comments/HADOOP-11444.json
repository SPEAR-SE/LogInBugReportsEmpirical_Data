[we can update the {{AbstractContractCreateTest}} tests to catch for these cases, and confirm that they test for this case.  Thanks for reporting [~eshioji].    from above, the reproducer is simply {{fs.create("s3://fake-test/1234")}}, right ? , Not sure, but it's being initialised as `fs.initialize(uri, conf)` where uri is "s3://fake-test/1234" in org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem#createFileSystem , \\
