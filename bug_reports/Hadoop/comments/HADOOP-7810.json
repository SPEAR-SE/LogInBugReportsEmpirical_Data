This message is automatically generated., How this affects 0.23 and 0.24 which they don't produce a hadoop-tools JAR?, I forgot that har was part of the hadoop-mapreduce-tools.jar in 0.23 and 0.24. 

I was looking at the hadoop script in 0.23 and saw the following and assumed that "TOOL_PATH needs to be exported in 0.23 as well".

{code}
    elif [ "$COMMAND" = "archive" ] ; then
      CLASS=org.apache.hadoop.tools.HadoopArchives
      CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:${TOOL_PATH}
{code}

Updating the JIRA with branch-0.20-security as the version expected., This has implications for modularity, in particular, it will make it more difficult to use a different version of any of the tools., Owen you have a point. However, this is a bit difficult for any of the tools bundled with Hadoop itself. One option would be to have a separate hadoop-tools project., Alejandro, Owen - thanks for taking a look. 
@Owen - Could you help me understand how it will be more difficult than it is today? Also, do you have an alternative recommendation?, Marking as a blocker for 0.20.205.1, When targeting a patch for a given release, please list that release in the "Target Version" field.  Thank you., The tools jar was pulled out of hadoop's jar, because they are user-facing components that often need to be updated by users. Until we have a better story for how to get modules onto the bin/hadoop classpath, I'd propose that instead of this that you move the HarFileSystem (and only the HarFileSystem) into the hadoop-core jar., Thanks for your response Owen. Attaching a patch for preliminary review ..., I am attaching a patch which moves HadoopArchives.java as part of core. I ran some basic tests, but I need to run more tests before I can 'Submit Patch'. Also, the patch format is not "apply-able". But, I am hoping that you could take a look and confirm that this is the direction you meant in your previous comment., @Todd - Bringing the discussion about this JIRA from 'common-dev' to here.
Quoting Todd: "This seems like an incompatible change - probably a bad idea for a dot
release of a dot release of a maintenance series...."

Todd - Most of the HAR features never really worked in branch-0.20 before 0.20.205. Since 205 is probably the first branch-0.20 release with full fledged HAR, do you still consider it an incompatible change?
, Completed the testing I was planning to do:
1. Created HAR 
2. listed files
3. sorted a HAR file
4. wc on a HAR file, I'm sorry, I'm confused. I thought the point of this jira was to fix the HarFileSystem into the classpath, but I see that it already there. I don't think we should move the tool to the mapreduce jar. What is the use case that requires the har tool to be on the classpath?, @Owen - The use case is for a storing from a Pig script using HCatalog's dynamic partitioning and with HAR enabled.

Correct, the HarFileSystem is in the classpath.
But a call like the above fails with a ClassNotFoundException on org.apache.hadoop.tools.HadoopArchives$HArchiveInputFormat.

Therefore the suggestion to move the HadoopArchieves classes from hadoop_tools jar, which is not in `hadoop classpath`, into the hadoop-core jar. (The same jar that holds the HarFileSystem class.)
, In that case, why doesn't HCatalog put hadoop-tools.jar on its classpath? Why should hadoop-tools be any different than any of its other dependencies?, Every downstream project would need to modify its class path to make this happen (Pig, HCatalog etc.). This would be necessary for any other dependency, but here we deal with a component that is already deployed with Hadoop and we would like to be able to configure it as part of Hadoop. We would prefer a solution that involves a single stop?
, Looking ahead .23 already has HadoopArchives in the path. So why can we not have the same setup for .20?

, I think that is a characteristic of how Yahoo is packaging and installing Hadoop rather than the project. I guess for now just add the tools jar to the end of the classpath after the user's jars. You'll need to make the change in trunk, 0.23 and 0.20.2xx.

We really should also fix the tools jar back to its old name (hadoop-tools-$version.jar), because otherwise upstream users can't find it., Adding trunk and 0.23 in the 'Affects version' since we need to make sure the behavior is similar in these as well., Thanks for your recommendation Owen.
Making the change as per Owen's suggestion - that is adding TOOLS_JAR to the end of CLASSPATH so that the current behavior is preserved and the TOOLS_JAR is in the classpath as well., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1, We need a patch for trunk. If I'm reading the code right, TOOL_PATH isn't defined in trunk. *sigh*, I did not see it defined either, but since mavenization is going on, some of the jar files might move around. As of now, har/distcp are part of hadoop-mapreduce-tools jar. I believe it will move out of there to hadoop-tools (MAPREDUCE-2765). So, I think it might be better to wait till those changes are in before putting out a trunk patch - what do you say? , Let's not assume that it will move to a new jar, since that isn't very backwards compatible. I've committed the change to 205 + security. If you can make a patch for trunk (actually defining the TOOL_PATH), that would be great., I am a little confused - AFAIK as of now har is in a new jar (hadoop-mapreduce-tools) compared to 205 (hadoop-tools/hadoop-core). Are you saying that we should assume it will continue in hadoop-mapreduce-tools? 

There are two JIRAs where discussions are ongoing about mavenization and location (MAPREDUCE-2765 and MAPREDUCE-3467)., bq. @John George: Adding trunk and 0.23 in the 'Affects version' since we need to make sure the behavior is similar in these as well.

I think this was intended to be added to the "Target Versions" list.
Only adding 0.23.1 since also adding it to trunk is implicit., We found that we have different users use their own versions of distcp and with this change, we break their usecase. Those users are expecting the behavior to not change in sustaining releases. While this behavior from our users will go away soon, making this change in a sustaining release seems to be too risky. Could we revert this change and move this to the 0.23/trunk? I was the one who was trying to push this change, but I did not forsee something like this happening and hence the request. , Reverted from 1.0.0 and branch-1, per contributor's request., Thank you Matt., [PATCH for trunk and branch-0.23]

Attached there is script and patch that moves HARFileSystem to hadoop-common and HadoopArchives to tools.

A small tweak in HadoopArchives and its testclass was required to run with the new MiniMR.

Regarding on how this new JAR ends up in the distro, there is another JIRA for that, HADOOP-7907 .

, +1 for the trunk patch., Thanks Alejandro. I will try this out today and let you know., Hi Alejandro,
I just finished looking into the patch. This patch seems to do two things.
1. Move hadoop archives into hadoop-tools and harfilesystem into common. This seems fine to me. 
2. Add TOOL_PATH to the classpath by default. I have two comments in this case. 
* TOOL_PATH is not defined yet. What will this be defined to?
* Adding TOOL_PATH to the classpath by default did break 0.20 as mentioned, but that was because of a separate distcp being used by the user. While I dont anticipate that to be the case in 0.23, I just dint know if that was going to be an issue for anyone else?, John,

Thanks for looking at it. I'm a bit confused, the trunk patch does only #1. For #2 HADOOP_7907 will take care of packaging the tools jars and making them avail to the hadoop scripts., {quote}
Thanks for looking at it. I'm a bit confused, the trunk patch does only #1.
{quote}
I was looking at my own patch instead of the one you submitted! Sorry for the confusion., :), so we are good with the patch for trunk/0.23, right?
, Please give me till EOD today to test this out. I will get back to you after., I just finished testing this change on 0.23. All looks good. I did a simple 'create har' and then 'list har' test, just to ensure that the move to separate hars did work fine for each of the functionalities in those jars. 
The only minor issue I saw was that I had to change hadoop-tools/pom.xml to reflect that it was '0.23.1-SNAPSHOT' and not '0.24'. 
I am +1 pending the change to get it compiled on 0.23.

Good work Alejandro! Thanks a lot for doing this., John, the change you indicate is what has to be done for integrating it to 0.23.1, the patch works cleanly in trunk.

I'll commit both shortly
