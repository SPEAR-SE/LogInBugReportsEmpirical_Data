[Attaching patch on behalf of Chris. Contains Common only changes from YARN-493.

Going to commit this as part of YARN-493 to trunk., I just committed this trunk together with YARN-493. Closing this as resolved.

Apologies for the small time delta between issue-creation and closure. Let me know if anyone finds any issues. Thanks., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3634 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3634/])
