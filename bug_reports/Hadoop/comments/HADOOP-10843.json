[Attached patch checks if it's running on PPC then use the lexicographical comparer., What do you mean by "not supported correctly"?  Are you talking about alignment restrictions (i.e. address must be a multiple of 8).  Or something else?  If it is something else, I would expect there to be a Sun/Oracle problem report open for this?, The problem was found long before filing this JIRA, so the information was incorrect.  I have updated the information., Attached a new patch that fixes the unit tests., Would this be clearer?

{code}
-      assertEquals(chk, x.compareTo(y));
+      assertEquals(Math.signum(chk), Math.signum(x.compareTo(y)));
{code}

etc., Hi Colin, 

Thanks for the suggestion. I have attached a new patch. Yes, using Math.signum is much clearer. Only thing is that had to cast floats to ints (precision should not cause problems though) since assertEquals(float a, float b) was deprecated and causing run time errors. , How about {{Integer.signum}}, to avoid the cast?  +1 once that's addressed (and pending jenkins), Thanks.
