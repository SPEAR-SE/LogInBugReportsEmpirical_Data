[[~jianhe] I would like to work on this.. I am not able to reproduce this .. can you please give scenario ..?, [~brahmareddy],  I'm also not able to repro.. I wondered if any other folks have seen this issue before.
we found this while doing ambari integration testing. I added one more stack trace for the blocking thread in the description. 

, Very interesting bug!!  Going back to Java basics, Thread.interrupt() does not guarentee the interrupt for running thread unless thread is waintig/sleeping for something. 
In this issue I think {{queue.consumeAll(this);}} processing something which never given chance to interrupt it.

Just to reproduce this, small program wrote below code. If we run below code withoug commenting Thread.sleep, thread never get interrupted. Adding small sleep , result in thread get interrupted.
{code}
package com.test.basic;

public class Test1 {
  Thread sinkThread;
  private volatile boolean stopping = false;

  public void start() {
    sinkThread = new Thread() {
      public void run() {
        while (!stopping) {
          try {
            while (true) {
              // Thread.sleep(1);
            }
          } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Interuppted..");
          }
        }
      };
    };
    sinkThread.setDaemon(true);
    sinkThread.start();
  }

  public void stop() {
    stopping = true;
    System.out.println("Interrupting.. ");
    sinkThread.interrupt();
    try {
      System.out.println("Joining.. ");
      sinkThread.join();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      System.out.println("Stop interrupted " + e);
    }
    System.out.println("Stopped successfully");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    Test1 t1 = new Test1();
    t1.start();
    Thread.sleep(2000);
    t1.stop();
  }
}
{code}, Done some more investigation on this modifying the above program that start ServerSocket. It is found that SocketInputStream.read() is NOT Interruptible!!
{code}
package com.rohith;

import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.UnknownHostException;

public class Test {
  Thread sinkThread;
  Socket socket = null;
  InputStream in = null;
  private volatile boolean stopping = false;

  public void start() {
    sinkThread = new Thread() {
      public void run() {

        try {
          socket = new Socket("localhost", 4444);
        } catch (UnknownHostException e2) {
          e2.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e2) {
          e2.printStackTrace();
        }


        try {
          in = socket.getInputStream();
        } catch (IOException e1) {
          e1.printStackTrace();
        }
        while (!stopping) {
          try {
            System.out.println("in.read");
            in.read();
          } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
          }
        }
      };
    };
    sinkThread.setDaemon(true);
    sinkThread.start();
  }

  public void stop() {
    stopping = true;

    try {
      socket.close();
    } catch (IOException e1) {
      e1.printStackTrace();
    }

    System.out.println("Interrupting.. ");
    System.out.println(sinkThread.getState());
    sinkThread.interrupt();
    try {
      System.out.println("Joining.. ");
      sinkThread.join();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      System.out.println("Stop interrupted " + e);
    }
    System.out.println("Stopped successfully");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    try {
      ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(4444);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }

    System.out.println("Made socket, now reading from socket");

    Test t1 = new Test();
    t1.start();
    Thread.sleep(2000);
    t1.stop();
  }

}
{code}, Thanks [~rohithsharma] for the investigation  !

Maybe in MetricsSinkAdapter#stop, we can do  the {{IOUtils.cleanup}}  first and then interrupt. 
{code}
  void stop() {
    stopping = true;
    sinkThread.interrupt();
    try {
      sinkThread.join();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      LOG.warn("Stop interrupted", e);
    }
    if (sink instanceof Closeable) {
      IOUtils.cleanup(LOG, (Closeable)sink);
    }
  }
{code}

converting this to hadoop-common ticket, Thanks a lot [~rohithsharma] and [~jianhe] for investigation on this issue...

Moving {{IOUtils.cleanup}} before {{sinkThread.join();}} , should be fine I think.., bq.  It is found that SocketInputStream.read() is NOT Interruptible!!
Right. Once the call comes out from this after closing socket,  next call to sleep/wait will get interrupt signal., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~brahmareddy], thanks for the patch !
Do you think we can have a test case to prove this ? 
In the TestMetricsSystemImpl.java, there are a few sink implementation for testing only. We may follow that and write a custom sink which blocks on socket read and also take some input from Rohith's program above. , Sure, I will update.., Hi [~brahmareddy], are you still working on this ?, [~jianhe] sorry for delay, will upload the patch soon., [~jianhe] Attached patch kindly Review!! Thanks, \\
