This message is automatically generated., Looks good. The code needs to add a flag to indicate that the provider has created the filter so that the provider won't be destroyed by both the filter and httpserver2., Thanks [~wheat9]   for the quick review.   Not sure I understand your comment.   HttpServer2 creates a new instance of the signer provider using constructSecretProvider and will destroy that object.   AuthenticationFilter instance is not exposed to others.   Why would you need a flag to protect the private instance in the destroy method., There are two use cases here:

* HttpServer2 creates and owns the SignerSecretProvider, meaning that the SignerSecretProvider will be destroyed by the HttpServer2. {{AuthenticationFilter}} should not call {{destroy()}}.
* The Tomcat server initializes {{AuthenticationFilter}} through {{AuthenticationFilterInitializer}}. This is the use case of Oozie. In this case the AuthenticationFilter should call the {{destroy()}} method of the {{SignerSecretProvider}} when its life cycle ends., LGTM. Minor nits:

Change
{code}
+  private boolean isInitializedByTomcat = false;
{code}

to

{code}
+  private boolean isInitializedByTomcat;
{code}
