This message is automatically generated., This issue seems largely addressed by the current LICENSE.txt file, except for the BSD license on the CRC code.  From LICENSE.txt:

{noformat}
For portions of the native implementation of slicing-by-8 CRC calculation
in src/main/native/src/org/apache/hadoop/util:

/**

 *   All rights reserved. Use of this source code is governed by a
 *   BSD-style license that can be found in the LICENSE file.
 */
{noformat}

There is no "LICENSE file" included that contains the appropriate BSD license.  That segment of text looks like it was just copied from the header of the CRC files themselves.  Bumping the priority, because licensing is important., I dug up the original code from this link and pasted in the included LICENSE file to our LICENSE.txt:

http://www.evanjones.ca/crc32c.tar.bz2

[~templedf] could you review? I think this applies to all the branch-2's as well, since this is old code., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
