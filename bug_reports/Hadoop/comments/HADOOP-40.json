[I don't think we should modify the configuration in this case, since that will affect code which uses this configuration that runs later.  SequenceFile uses very large buffers when sorting and merging, in order to minimize disk seeks, and we don't want everything to start using such large buffers.

So why not just pass the missing parameter down?  I've attached a patch that does this.  Does this look good to you?, I just committed my patch for this., Yes. This is the right way of doing it.
It particularly makes sense, since the main file and the checksum file
do not necessarily need to share the same buffer size.
With the file buffer large the checksum buffer doesn't need to be large at all.]
