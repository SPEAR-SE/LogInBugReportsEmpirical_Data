  OK, the above comment is a little misleading.

  We used to have a difference space-management system in place, which would set
certain nodes off-limits if they didn't have enough space.  Now we choose nodes probabilistically,
with more weight given to nodes with more space.

  That's probably a little too cute than is necessary.  We should just have hard limits on how
much a given node will take before it complains and never receives further node allocations., 
  Patch for this problem.
