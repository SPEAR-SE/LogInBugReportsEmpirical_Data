[In a similar fashion to the existing Hadoop distributions Wiki page, I propose that we create a new "Java Distributions for Hadoop" Wiki page that describes and links to the available Java distributions. This page would initially point to a few distributions, and the list would be updated by user-feedback. Additionally, in each place on the Hadoop web site, Wiki and Download pages where a JRE/JVM download is mentioned, it would link back to the consolidated "Java Distributions for Hadoop" Wiki page.]
