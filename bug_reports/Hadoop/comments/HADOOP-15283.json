, Unfortunately 3.0.1 release binary tarball cannot be downloaded from GitHub, so I think it's time to upgrade this.
In Apache Hadoop, the findbugs binary itself is only used for running some tools such as {{bin/convertXmlToText}}, so upgrading findbugs seems easy., Attaching a patch to upgrade from findbugs 3.0.1 to spotbugs 3.1.2.
In Hadoop 3.x, this is not an issue because the docker image is Xenial, so findbugs can be installed via apt-get., (!) A patch to the testing environment has been detected. 
Re-executing against the patched versions to perform further tests. 
The console is at https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/14241/console in case of problems.

, Thanks [~ajisakaa]!

I didn't even know about spotbugs, but looking yea that looks promising :) . +1

{quote}

SpotBugs is the spiritual successor of [FindBugs|http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/], carrying on from the point where it left off with support of its community.

{quote}, Not sure if there's a way to test a sample patch from pre-commit? (Just in case it reports different failures than findbugs) But given pre-commit is completely broken, I'm also ok to first commit this., Thank you for your review, [~xiaochen]!

bq. Not sure if there's a way to test a sample patch from pre-commit?
Attached a patch to generate findbugs warnings., (!) A patch to the testing environment has been detected. 
Re-executing against the patched versions to perform further tests.

, Umm. It took long time to run unit tests and the precommit job aborted. https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/14244/console
Given Xiao's +1, I'll commit the 002 patch., Committed to branch-2, branch-2.9, branch-2.8, and branch-2.7. Let's see what happens.]
