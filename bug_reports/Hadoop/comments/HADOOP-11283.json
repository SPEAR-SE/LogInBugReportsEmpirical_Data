This message is automatically generated., lgtm, Sure, taking a look at the latest patch., [~varun_saxena] Overall latest patch looks good to me. Minor nits:

1. These lines exceed 80 LOC. Could you fix them?
{code}
+    try (SequenceFile.Writer src_writer = SequenceFile.createWriter(jobfs, jobConf,
+            srcfilelist, LongWritable.class, FilePair.class, SequenceFile.CompressionType.NONE);
+         SequenceFile.Writer dst_writer = SequenceFile.createWriter(jobfs, jobConf,
+            dstfilelist, Text.class, Text.class, SequenceFile.CompressionType.NONE);
+         SequenceFile.Writer dir_writer = SequenceFile.createWriter(jobfs, jobConf,
+            dstdirlist, Text.class, FilePair.class, SequenceFile.CompressionType.NONE);) {
{code}

I prefer to fix these lines like this:
{code}
    try (
        SequenceFile.Writer src_writer = SequenceFile.createWriter(jobfs,
            jobConf, srcfilelist, LongWritable.class, FilePair.class,
            SequenceFile.CompressionType.NONE);
        SequenceFile.Writer dst_writer = SequenceFile.createWriter(jobfs,
            jobConf, dstfilelist, Text.class, Text.class,
            SequenceFile.CompressionType.NONE);
        SequenceFile.Writer dir_writer = SequenceFile.createWriter(jobfs,
            jobConf, dstdirlist, Text.class, FilePair.class,
            SequenceFile.CompressionType.NONE)
    ) {
{code}

2. A following line includes trailing space.
{code}
+      HashSet<Path> parentDirsToCopy = new HashSet<Path>(); 
{code}

Once these comments are addressed, I'll commit it., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
