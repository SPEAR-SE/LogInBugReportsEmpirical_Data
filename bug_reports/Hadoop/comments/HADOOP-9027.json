[Attaching the patch. Tested on Ubuntu and Windows., Ivan, this looks good.  In your testing on Ubuntu, did you also verify a build that bundles snappy?  I have a VM ready with snappy installed if you want my help testing that.

Can we delete fixFontsPath.sh and packageNativeHadoop.sh in this changeset?
, Thanks for reviewing Chris!

bq. In your testing on Ubuntu, did you also verify a build that bundles snappy? I have a VM ready with snappy installed if you want my help testing that.
I just verified that the files are binplaced properly and that permissions are carried over. If you could test this on your VM that would be great!

bq. Can we delete fixFontsPath.sh and packageNativeHadoop.sh in this changeset?
I did not want to delete those since {{src\saveVersion.sh}} was also not deleted in the branch. Will delete all 3 now., Attaching updated patch where I deleted the no longer needed files., +1 for the patch, +1. Committed the patch to branch-1-win.

Thank you Ivan., This is great for folks trying to build on Windows!
Perhaps we should have left behind the shell scripts for folks on Linux who are doing just fine currently without python. This forces them to changes existing setups to include python., bq.

Thanks Bikas. These sh scripts were used as part of the ant tasks. Ant task would setup the environment for them, so I wouldn't imagine people having a dependency on the actual script. I might be wrong though. IMO, let's keep this as as, we can revisit if needed for the merge.
