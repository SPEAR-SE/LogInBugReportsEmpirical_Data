This message is automatically generated., Amareshwari, can u please regenerate this patch - it won't apply to trunk anymore.

Also, rather than all the non-null checks in jobhistory.jsp it will be simpler to use the string 'null' for jobname/username if they are null in JobHistory.java... then we won't have to change jobhistory.jsp at all., Doing not-null check in jobhistory.jsp makes more sense than jobHistory.java, since jobHistory.java can truncate the filename (if it exceeds max_file_name_size) and jsp file should take care of that., Sigh, I guess you are right.

However, i just checked: the filename is around 80 characters not including the jobname, so please get rid of the truncation too in JobHistory.java.
