[The 0.9.0 release does not have this problem. I think there was a bugfix from Konstantin in the last few weeks that addressed this issue.

When I tried your steps, the rename command failed (as expected) but the error code returned was 0. I am attaching a one-line patch that returns an error code of -1 when the rename command fails.

We must try our best to weed out the bug like that.
It was actually a well know that when moving files/dirs, we must check the validity of the operation.
Care must be paid there and thorough tests must be done.

, i am pretty sure that this bug cannot be reproduced in 0.9.0 release., +1, http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12346694/renameerrorcode.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r483772, I'm satisfied (and look forward to my next opportunity to integrate the latest Hadoop source)., I just committed this.  Thanks, Dhruba!]
