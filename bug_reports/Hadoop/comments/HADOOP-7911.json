[Hi Arvind. Please contact the hbase-users mailing list or spring support with this issue - it's not a Hadoop bug but rather some problem with your setup or configuration., Hii Todd, I did not know. But if you say...that could really be a problem of configuration. Sorry, If I wasted your time. And If you have any good reference of connecting a grails app to hadoop...please tell me.
Thanks :) ]
