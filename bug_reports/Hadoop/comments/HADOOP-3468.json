[Are you using Java 1.5 or Java 1.6?  If this only happens with Java 1.5, is it time for HADOOP-2325?
, In case it's not obvious, the simple fix for this is to revert HADOOP-3246 (r661473)., It seems that it requires Java 1.6.  Mine is 1.5.

bash-3.2$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_14"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_14-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_14-b03, mixed mode)
{noformat}, Attaching new required Jar files created after compiling Mina FTP server jars with Java 1.5.
Verified that there are no compilation errors when compiling hadoop under Java 1.5 after replacing the required jars for HADOOP-3246 with the one attached here. I have also replaced the required jars in HADOOP-3246.

Sorry for the the compilation problems and inconvenience caused. , I just committed this.  Thanks, Ankur!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #509 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/509/]), Voted out of the release notes list.]
