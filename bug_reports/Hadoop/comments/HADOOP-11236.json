Is the proposed fix a JDK-specific issue?
, Oh I see. It could be. My JAVA_HOME is set to java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64 . I looked up online, found a few similar jiras: HDFS-344, HBASE-7895, GIRAPH-130. 

Thanks for taking a look [~ajisakaa] & [~wheat9]!
, bq. Is the proposed fix a JDK-specific issue?

It is not. Abhiraj was able to see it because he generated the javadoc within the sub-project. The central javadoc command ignores Private-Visibility classes such as the one Abhiraj has touched upon, so it does not get counted.

You can make it appear running the javadoc generation within the hadoop-nfs sub-project regardless of your JVM.

{code}
cd hadoop-common-project/hadoop-nfs/
mvn javadoc:javadoc

[WARNING] Javadoc Warnings
[WARNING] /Users/harshchouraria/Work/code/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-nfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/oncrpc/RpcProgram.java:73: warning - @param argument "DatagramSocket" is not a parameter name.
{code}, The javadoc bug is a valid one, and the patch applies and resolves it cleanly, so I've gone ahead and committed it into branch-2 and trunk.

Many thanks [~abutala] for your contribution, and [~ajisakaa] and [~wheat9] for reviews and comments!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6350 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6350/])
