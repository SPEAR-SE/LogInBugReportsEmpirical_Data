[I tried both scenarios. All worked. Did the error message you saw come from the local file system? Please try using "cat" instead of "get"., "cat" definitely works but since the permissions is set to 770 in case 1 and permissions is turned OFF in case 2, a user in the same group should be able to read, write and execute the file. So in that case, shouldn't "get " also be supported? Why is "get"not supported in the above two cases?, Get writes the dfs file to your local disk. Could you please check if the user has the permission to write to the local disk in both scenarios?, The user did not have permission to write to the local disk in both scenarios. Thats the reason why it was unable to "get:" the file. Thanks Hairong.
