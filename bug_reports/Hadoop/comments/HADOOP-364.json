[This patch:
  1. adds IOException to the getProtocolVersion method. All RPC methods need to declare this exception so that the proxy object can throw IOException if there are communication problems.
  2. creates a RPC.VersionMismatch exception that can be caught and dealt with in a user friendly way.
  3. adds IOException to the signature for getProxy.
  4. adds RPC.waitForProxy that will loop waiting for the server to come up.
  5. make the TaskTracker and DataNode wait for their masters to come up., The patch also extends the mini-mr cluster and mini-dfs cluster classes to take a boolean on the constructor saying to bring up the datanode/tasktracker first. I changed one of the junit tests to bring up the servers backwards to make sure that the fix works., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
