[This fixes it, Can we have a unit test for this? Since this is a performance problem, it won't be detected next time something like this happens., Also it does not look like the this config is was ever read by the server., I'm not gonna write a unit test just to make sure a config param is being read, but maybe someone else wants to. (Making the field final helps a bit here)

I don't know how you say "it does not look like the this config is was ever read by the server." It was at least being read in the patch that first introduced it: HADOOP-2232, > I don't know how you say "it does not look like the this config is was ever read by the server."

For some reason, it was not committed properly : http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/core/branches/branch-0.16/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/ipc/Server.java?r1=615093&r2=615098 

i.e. committed patch does not read this config.

, This was my fault. HADOOP-2645 knocked the patch for HADOOP-2232 out of sync and I must not have noticed when applying it. Apologies.

I don't think this needs a unit test., I just committed this. Thanks, Clint, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #645 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/645/])
    . Fix ipc.server.ipcnodelay originally missed in in HADOOP-2232.
