[There are two ways to deal with this particular issue:

1. We pass JAVA_HOME on the command line instantiation
2. User configures SendEnv in the appropriate .ssh/config

#1 isn't really viable because it assumes that nodes are homogeneous in a cluster.  This leaves #2, which, at most, should be a documentation note rather than a code fix., As you told  #1 will not give solution to this problem since cluster might be having homegeneous(I mean, JAVA_HOME variable here)...
Yes, we can document in following.

This message was automatically generated., Lots of problems here:

a) There's a weird character in it.
b) It broke the numbering of the list.
c) It's the wrong place to put this type of note, especially considering the first chunk of 'Prepare' is setting the JAVA_HOME.

, [~aw] Attached the patch to address your comments.Now it's simplified.. Kindly review.., \\
