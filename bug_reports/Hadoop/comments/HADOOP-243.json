[This patch creates a new method in StringUtils for formating percentages and uses it in all of the progress fields in the web/ui. The method displays the percentage as "0.00%" with values rounded down.

To ensure that complete jobs show up as 100.00% instead of 99.99%, I also needed to set the progress to 1.0f explicitly to avoid floating point approximation problems. To avoid the problem with late updates pushing the progress over 1.0, I made the fields private and forced all users to go through the setters, which guarantee progress stays within 0.0 to 1.0., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!,
