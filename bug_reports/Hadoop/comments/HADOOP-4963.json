[Straightforward patch., test-patch and ant test passed, I just committed this. Thanks, Amareshwari!, Can we get a fix for 0.20 as well? I am seeing a lot of these log messages which are garbling up the logs and are quite misleading while debugging other issues., I committed this to the 0.20 branch., patch for hadoop 0.19 branch, I'm ready to merge this modification back to 0.19 (sorry, it took me a bit longer to get there). I'm wondering though what should be done wrt CHANGES.txt file? The 0.19.2 has been released and we are clearly aren't suppose to _add_ anything to its list of fixes. What is the common practice about backport of fixes to already released versions?, I've merged it back to the branch 0.19. CHANGES.txt file has been updated to reflect that this fix was integrated into unrelease 0.19.3 This release actually doesn't exist, so it needs to be created within the JIRA system.]
