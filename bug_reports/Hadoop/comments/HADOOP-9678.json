[The issue is in the test, it's a race condition between threads starting up:
{code}
    final Server server = RPC.getServer(new TestImpl(), ADDRESS,
        0, 5, true, conf);
    server.start();   <--- starts the reader threads asynchronously
{code}
and test asserting that at least one thread started:
{code}
      int threadsRunning = countThreads("Server$Listener$Reader");
      assertTrue(threadsRunning > 0);
{code}

Will attach the patch shortly.
