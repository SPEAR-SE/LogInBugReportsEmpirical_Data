[Maybe already fixed by HADOOP-10618?, The only missing one is replace 'hadoop jar' with 'yarn jar'. The rest looks fixed to me., I'm thinking 'hadoop jar' is still valid because users may execute MapReduce jobs in local mode, not on YARN., When I read Hadoop 2.6 documentation Single Node Cluster, I think this bug can be closed., The document was removed by HADOOP-10618. Closing.]
