[This patch fixes this problem by maintaining a set of intermediate evaluated expressions to test if there is a cycle detected during the resolution loop. If a cycle is detected, the then intermediate form is returned instead of raising any exception.

Note that since my formatter setting is such that it substitutes all tabs with spaces, there appear to be a lot of changes - most of which are only white-space related. If there is a need to preserve the current tab/space format, I can regenerate the patch with this disabled.

, We hit an issue during testing involving multiple specifications of the same variable, for which I posted a patch at HADOOP-13699.

This slims down the cycle detection significantly, and doesn't try to find multi-variable loops. This is because doing this accurately is a lot more work in performance sensitive code, and is overkill for the usecase mentioned here of a variable pointing at itself.

Please comment over at HADOOP-13699 if you feel differently, thanks!]
