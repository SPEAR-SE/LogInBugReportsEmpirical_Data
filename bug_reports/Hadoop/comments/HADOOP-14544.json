[I believe the problem is specific to the 2.7 line, though I haven't reviewed comprehensively.

, Hi [~cnauroth],
Till 2.7.2 we don't have {{-diff}} and {{-skipcrccheck}} flag in DistCp document, and in 2.8 it's fixed by HDFS-10298. So the problem is only with 2.7.3.
If we cannot use HDFS-10298 patch for 2.7.3, I can upload a patch here.

Note: Even after HDFS-10298, {{-skipcrccheck}} flag doesn't have any content in Notes column., Moving target version to 2.7.5 due to 2.7.4 release., Moving target version to 2.7.6 due to 2.7.5 release.]
