[1) Took out  logprintln(lineStr);
2) Always System.err.println(lineStr);
3) Replaced  reporter.setStatus(hline)  with reporter.progress().  (since it'll be overwritten by MROutputThread anyway)

If the timeout is set to 0 (HADOOP-491),  we don't need a call from the reporter (3). 
But since it's configurable, I left the reporter call.
