This message is automatically generated., Todd, this looks like the right direction. In the future, you should copy the issue into Hadoop's jira instead of just posting a link to Cloudera's jira. 

About the patch, it seems like if you are setting up this kind of chaining, you should have a way of unregistering the configuration when the app is unloaded. (Although I don't have any experience with Glassfish...), Hi Owen. I don't think there is any real way to hook into unloading here - there is no "static finalizer" concept, and I also don't know enough about J2EE to know if there are any other hooks available.

The patch here addresses a critical bug and is simple. If we run into problems with unloading in the future we can address that separately?
, How about a simple check to see if it is already a Hadoop configuration and skip the install in that case?, Sure, here's an updated patch., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
