[This patch will use InetAddress.getByName(String) to judge if a string is a numeric IP address or symbolic address(hostname). However, this JAVA api will also take trouble that it will translate some numeric hostname like: 1.2.3 to 1.2.0.3 (or 1.2 to 1.0.0.2) as it assume this patent of numeric string is IP address. It will break some current hadoop tests with "1.2.3" as hostname (like in TestTableMapping). Thoughts?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Like said above, this change will break some current hadoop tests with "1.2.3" as hostname (like in TestTableMapping), as  InetAddress.getByName(String) will translate 1.2.3 to 1.2.0.3. May be checking full numeric host name (with dot) is a better way?, {noformat}
A host name (label) MUST NOT consist of all numeric values.
{noformat}

They are invalid host names, so the tests need to be fixed. I suggest you keep the patch as is and fix the broken tests.

If a user puts an invalid host name in config, it will fail eventually. If this method were to return the string as is in such cases, it would get "translated" the same way somewhere down the road. We could add a full validation and make it blow up in this method, but I don't think the gain is worth the complexity of the check.
, I was concerned about performance implication of this change. However, in sun jdk, IPAddressUtil#isIPv4LiteralAddress() is called, which is doing more complete check for ip address before doing a look up.

Please fix the tests. While at it, please indent the the code in the test correctly. Also, optionaly, you reduce a line by {{ return InetAddress.getByName(name).getHostAddress(); }}, BTW can you describe the test better, especially cases "3w.org -> xx.xx.xx.xx" and "UnknownHost -> UnknownHost" better., Thanks all for the good comments. Will fix the tests and description soon., Hey Suresh, For "3w.org -> xx.xx.xx.xx", it is a public website start with numeric that can be resolved by DNS. So this test require DNS resolving, do you think this is an issue for hadoop unit test?
, bq. "3w.org -> xx.xx.xx.xx", it is a public website start with numeric that can be resolved by DNS.
This could become an issue. But we could fix it later.

Sorry I was not clear. What I meant in my previous comment was, you could add comments to make the test easier to understand. For example, you could method level comment to say {{ /** Test for {@link NetUtils#normalizeHostNames }}. Also you could add a comment saying, when ipaddress is normalized, same address is expected in return and for a resolvable hostname, ipaddress it resolved is expected in return.

The reason why I am suggesting this is - our tests are poorly documented. When adding new features, lot more time goes into understanding tests and fixing them than implementing the feature itself., bq. This could become an issue. But we could fix it later.
By this, I mean, if resolving the address using DNS fails for some reason, we could fix the test. So the code that you have added seems fine to me., Hi Suresh, That's very nicely suggestions. Will update patch soon., Patch is updated with addressing TestTableMapping issue. The failure of TestViewFsTrash seems not relevant.
, Junping, the patch looks good. Could you please remove the TODO comment. Also can you please use two spaces for indenting instead of tab in the tests., Sorry. Just forget to address the indent issue. Here is the latest code., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
