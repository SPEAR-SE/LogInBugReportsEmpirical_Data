[Thanks [~stevel@apache.org]. 
*1.* Now {{EOFException}} is thrown on out of bounds reads.
*2.* Add contract tests for {{CryptoInputStream}} and {{CryptoOutputStream}}

This idea of contract tests for crypto streams is: add _wrapInputStream_ and _wrapOutputStream_ in {{AbstractFSContract}} and Crypto contract will implement them., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The test failure is not related., [~stevel@apache.org], could you help to take a look? Thanks., -sorry for not replying about this; I think I'd missed the patch in my inbox.

Looks good. I was a bit worried about the refactoring but it makes sense -and the way the contract tests are designed, FS-specific subclasses will pick up the changes without any changes needed to their code (I'll do a test run of the s3 and openstack clients just to make sure there before it gets its +1.

# can you switch to using FSExceptionMessages constants for your exception text? With the same text everywhere we can simplify documentation and maybe even add wiki links in future. 
# testRenameFileBeingAppended()` tries to rename a file that is being written to. The patched version doesn't. (to be fair, the expected outcome of that operation isn't defined AFAIK). It may be easiest to leave that as is and in the subclass, just skip it (ie {{Assume.assumeTrue(false)}}), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
