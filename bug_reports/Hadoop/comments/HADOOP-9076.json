[Radim - Vinod and I have been trying to get the automated commit jobs working for YARN. Gavin from Apache Infra kindly fixed it yesterday: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-builds/201211.mbox/%3Ccb6401cdc764%24421a76a0%24c64f63e0%24%4016degrees.com.au%3E, i will test it, i submitted something to YARN but do not see any build activity at https://builds.apache.org/view/Hadoop/ Last pre commit check for YARN is 1 day 22 hours old., this is job collecting tickets from JIRA - https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-Admin/93676/console
