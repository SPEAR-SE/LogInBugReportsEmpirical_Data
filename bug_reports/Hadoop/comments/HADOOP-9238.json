This message is automatically generated., Hi [~sarutak], what's going on this jira? I'd like to take it over., Thank you [~daryn] . I'll watch the bug you mentioned.
[~ajisakaa], I'll continuously watch this issue., [~ajisakaa] or [~sarutak], any update on this issue?, I've attached a rebased patch.
How does that look for you?
I'll also write tests soon., I'm not sure if this change will have subtle impacts.  The code for src and dest path validation has been tricky to get right.

I'm almost inclined to think a safer change that will streamline processing is {{processPath(src, dst)}} might add a special case for a src of "-", I've revised my patch to limit impacts for the case when we designate "-".
And I also add a test case. , Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0.]
