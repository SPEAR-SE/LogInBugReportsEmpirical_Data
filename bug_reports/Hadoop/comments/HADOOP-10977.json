[[~arpitagarwal] Ops usually use curl or run an agent that will collect those metrics such as tcollector. Are you thinking in something else?, Yes ideally ops will have that information however we have seen instances where they don't or where they don't keep sufficient metrics history.

It would be useful to have metrics history available along with the logs.]
