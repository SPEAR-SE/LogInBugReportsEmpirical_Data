[Hello [~aw]
I did not find author tag, "DistCp Version 2" is pressent ,here Version 2 can be removed..Please correct me if I am wrong.., Look at the very bottom of the readme:

{code}
Version 0.1 (2010/08/02 sriksun)
 - Initial Version
{code}

That should be removed., We should also remove all the "DistCp V2" stuff and just make it distcp since there is no distcp v1 anymore..., Hi [~aw]
