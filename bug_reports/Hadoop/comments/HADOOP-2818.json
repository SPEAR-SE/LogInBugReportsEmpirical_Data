[I think we can undeprecate Counters.Group.getCounter(String counterName)), because, if we remove that method,  even if we already know the counterName, there is no other way to get the counter value otherthan iterating again. 
For ex. You may want to know the counter values in 3 groups simultaneously with a given counterName, all three groups have to be iterated if we remove this method., Here is patch removing Counters.Group.getDisplayName(String counter) and Counters.Group.getCounterNames()., -1 overall.
