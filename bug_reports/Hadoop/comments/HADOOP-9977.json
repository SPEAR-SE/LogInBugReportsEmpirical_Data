[The root cause is that {{FileBasedKeyStoresFactory}} does not honor the value of {{ssl.server.keystore.keypassword}} configured in ssl-server.xml.  Instead, it uses the value of {{ssl.server.keystore.password}} as both the keystore password and key retrieval password.  I have a patch in progress to fix this.

My plan is to continue using the value of {{ssl.server.keystore.password}} as the default if {{ssl.server.keystore.keypassword}} is not configured.  This is for backwards-compatibility in case any existing deployments had been omitting keypassword and relying on the old behavior., I'm attaching a patch.  I've also done some refactoring in {{KeyStoreTestUtil}} to enable writing tests for this., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
