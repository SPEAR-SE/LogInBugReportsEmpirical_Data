[In IdUserGroup.java: 
{noformat}
  synchronized private boolean isExpired() {
    return lastUpdateTime - System.currentTimeMillis() > timeout;

should be :
{noformat}
  synchronized private boolean isExpired() {
    return  System.currentTimeMillis() - lastUpdateTime > timeout;
  }
{noformat}, Hi, Brandon.  The change looks good.  Two questions:

# Is changing this config property name backwards-incompatible with existing configs that are already deployed?
# Do you think it's worthwhile to switch to {{Time#monotonicNow}} so that this isn't subject to system clock bugs?  (i.e. Someone resets the clock to a time in the past, and then updates don't happen for a long time.), Thank you, Chris.
You are right that it's a incompatible change. I've updated the JIRA. This property is a hidden property for development/test and not visible in user guide or configuration files. 

I've switched to Time#monotonicNow in the new patch and will also file a JIRA to update the related code in HDFS project. Thanks for the suggestion.

 , Hey folks, why not just add a config deprecation so that the change can be done compatibly?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

That sounds like a good plan to me.  I'll be +1 for the patch after removal of the configuration property name change., Uploaded a new patch to address the comments., +1 for patch v3 pending Jenkins.  Thank you, Brandon!, Sure, that sounds fine.

This message is automatically generated., It's not straightforward to add a meaningful unit test. The existing test TestIdUserGroup#testUserUpdateSetting() can cover the configuration setting and I've manually tested the table update on a local machine., Thank you, [~cnauroth] and [~atm].
