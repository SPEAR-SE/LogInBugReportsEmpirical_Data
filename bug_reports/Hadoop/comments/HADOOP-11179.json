[Some tar files do not have directory entries before files contained in that directory (this doesn't happen with command line tar tool on mac...), I suspect it's an issue with how ant/gradle/mvn/whatnot is generating the file, that it is failing to include the directory entries.  In any case, this change checks for the existence of a parent directory and creates it if it is missing before attempting to write a file.  (prevously, only the top level directory was checked for, now the parent of any file is checked for), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
