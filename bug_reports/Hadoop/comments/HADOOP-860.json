[Change the /bin/sh symlink on Ubuntu systems to point to the bash shell instead of the default dash shell.

It should be closed since it is not a hadoop bug., I just closed this issue. If it's asked frequently enough, let's add to Frequently Asked Questions., So on Ubuntu 8.10 any script that goes
#!/bin/sh
at the front is going to break? That's an Ubuntu regression, which could break a lot of things, who end up fielding the support calls

yes, they've noticed: http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/2225/

but if you follow through, it's a WONTFIX

"all scripts are expected to say #!/bin/bash ; because if you want bash, you had better ask for it explicitly."

Looking at the ubuntu discussion, their view is code that assumes that /bin/sh -> bash contains the bug; not Ubuntu, which is only required to link to a POSIX-compliant version of sh, not bash. From that point of view, if the hadoop scripts conatin bash-isms, then, yes, it is the hadoop shell scripts that are at fault. This doesn't mean that the Ubuntu changes are acceptable, only that they are defensible. 
, Agreed.

If we use a command that is not supported by a POSIX-compliant version of sh, and make the assumption that /bin/sh = /bin/bash (which is not true), then we ought to explicitly ask for bash...

Looks like a Hadoop bug to me.  Reopen?, Hmm, great !! 

Well, let's re-open it. There is certainly scope for improvement., This has long been fixed.

All bin/* shell scripts use {{#!/usr/bin/env bash}} as their shebangs, and this has been working for a lot of OSes out of the box.]
