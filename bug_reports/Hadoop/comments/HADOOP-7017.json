[in ipc, the data format that Client send request to servers, is:
{noformat}
      data-length:int,data:byte[data-length]
{noformat}

but, Server send response to client, is:
{noformat}
      callid,state,data
{noformat}

i think the problem is happened when client deserialed data.

so, i changed server and client communication that use request format.
and, i found that did not throw ClassNotFoundException.

but, i am not sure that is the problem., after this patch, i has been run about one month successfully.]
