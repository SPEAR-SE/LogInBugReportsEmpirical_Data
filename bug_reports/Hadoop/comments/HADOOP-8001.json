This message is automatically generated., +1 The patch looks good. 
The create() method already overwrites the existing checksum file, so doing this in rename()  should be okay., I actually forgot to check if the dst checksum file exists before trying to delete it., The patch looks good to me too.  It is a bit confusing to have dst refer to the destination in some cases, and the checkfile in others., Clarified variable names.  Also fixed case of moving file with no checksum into a directory that has an existing file with a checksum., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The new patch looks good to me, and all of the HDFS tests passed, except one that appears to be intermittent, and I already filed a JIRA for it.
