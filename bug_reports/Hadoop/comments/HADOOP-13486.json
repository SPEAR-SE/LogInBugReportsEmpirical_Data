[Is it necessary to contain the port? The port of client may change when establishing a new connection, so I don't think we should change this., I think in order to uniquely identify a client connection, we need both the host address and the port number. Plus, the replacement with the toString method makes the code more readable. Please let me know if this makes sense.]
