[John. I was wondering if you really meant 0.23, but then I saw that this really is a piece of S3FileSystem, which we have now deleted entirely as of HADOOP-12609 in 2016.

This going to be wontfix. 

I don't think anyone is going to look at issues filed against 0.23; branch-2 and hadoop-3.1+ are where problems get replicated and fixed, then backported, at best, to hadoop-2.8, or, depending on severity, 2.7

Can you check out the latest hadoop code and see if you can write tests to replicate there?

thanks]
