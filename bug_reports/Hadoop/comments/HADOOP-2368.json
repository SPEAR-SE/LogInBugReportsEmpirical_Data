[The reason might be some Cygwin commands, like "groups", not found in Java runtime if Java is installed in Windows (not in Cygwin)., is there a requirement that java has to be installed in cygwin? I never install java in cygwin. i just use the system wide java installed on Windows , Looks like groups is script on cygwin. We can use {{"bash", "-c", "groups"}} instead of just {{"groups"}} for the command. , 2368_20071206.patch: use "bash -c groups" instead of just "groups", thanks Raghu., It passed all tests in my local Windows machine., +1 overall.
