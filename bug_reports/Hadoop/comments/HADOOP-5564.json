[As Koji suggested, we probably should add -Xmx to limit the memory usage., Setting the heap size to 32MB, +1 patch looks good

Talked to Koji and Suresh offline.  We have considered using -client.  However, the [tool doc|http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/java.html] says that the -client option may be ignored by the jdk., I have tested this manually by making sure {{hadoop}} command takes the patch of changed code and it prints the {{JAVA_PLATFORM}} successfully., Attaching patch for the trunk. Tested the patch manually on trunk., Updated trunk patch, I have committed this to 0.20 and above.  Thanks, Suresh!, has anyone tested that everyting works ok on a 64 bit JVM? one with pointers twice the size?, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #790 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/790/])
    . Limit the JVM heap size in the java command for initializing JAVA_PLATFORM.  (Suresh Srinivas via szetszwo)
, Steve,

You definitely need this patch with java update 14&15. I have 18.3 and u 15. There are no surface errors! but my map tasks produced no output! Good thing I caught it relatively quickly.
