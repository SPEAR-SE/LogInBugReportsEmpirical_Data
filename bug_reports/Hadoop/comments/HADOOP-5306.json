[Tasks that are running on the tracker that is lost move to KILLED_UNCLEAN state. In this state a task level cleanup attempt (with the same id) is launched on a different tracker. Once this (cleanup) attempt returns, the attempt is marked KILLED_CLEAN (i.e KILLED). Once the (cleanup) attempt returns, the jobtracker tries to kill the attempt using the old tracker (lost tracker's) information which got deleted and hence the port information goes missing. Actually the port information is of no use to the jobtracker as the tracker is lost. Hence we can ignore this case. HADOOP-4638 can take care of this., Marking this for 0.20 as a blocker. Because this will cause the recovery to completely fail the job tracker., Attaching a straight forward fix., +1 patch looks good., Test-patch result
