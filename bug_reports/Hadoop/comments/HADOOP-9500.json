[The problem was introduced in HADOOP-9299 with this code:

{code}
    // doesn't matter what it is, but getGroups needs it set...
    System.setProperty("hadoop.home.dir", "/tmp");
{code}

The logic in {{Shell}} for finding the path to winutils.exe first checks the hadoop.home.dir property.  It won't find it in /tmp, so the test fails the first time it tries to run a winutils command.

This is easy to fix: instead of /tmp, use the HADOOP_HOME environment variable, which is guaranteed to be configured to the correct path in maven-surefire-plugin.  I'll provide a patch shortly.
