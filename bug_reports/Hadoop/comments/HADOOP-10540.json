[The "1>NUL" is passed as a parameter to the winutils command instead of the being interpreted by the shell. The simplest fix is to just remove it., +1 for the patch, pending Jenkins run.  Thanks a lot for tracking down this tricky bug!, Initial patch, I will probably add a unit test before its ready for review., Our comments crossed, thanks for the quick review Chris! :-)

I'd also like to add a unit test, will look into it tomorrow., Good point.  :-)  Thanks again., Please also change HardLink.createHardLinkMult so that if the command fails, include hardLinkCommand to the exception message., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Another problem discovered during testing is that the external process launched to make the hardlink can hang.  On Windows, it's important for the launching process to fully consume stdout and stderr.  Otherwise, the process never really exits.  This is a fundamental problem with the JDK {{Process}} class.  Fortunately, our own {{Shell}} class already implements the right workarounds, so it's easy to fix by converting {{HardLink}} to use {{Shell}} instead of {{Process}}.  I'm attaching a patch that combines that fix with Arpit's original fix., +1 from me, however perhaps it will be appropriate for another committer to +1 it too.

I've tested the updated patch on OS X and Windows and it fixes the hang., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1 the patch looks good to me. Thanks for the fix [~cnauroth] and [~arpitagarwal]!, Questions:
- hardLinkMultPrefix uses "cmd" but getLinkMultArgLength uses "cmd.exe".  Do they have to be matched?  If it is a bug, we should use the static variables to construct the string.
- Why there is a trailing space in the line below
{code}
+              + Shell.WINUTILS + " hardlink create \\%f %f ").length();
                                                           ^
{code}
- Do we have a unit test covering this method?

If you are going to update the patch, please add hardLinkCommand to all the exception messages.  It will be much easy to debug.  Otherwise, we may change this in a separated JIRA.

(I also suggest to change winutils for better error messages later on.  Before this patch, it outputs "Usage: hardlink create \[LINKNAME] \[FILENAME] |Incorrect command line arguments." which is created by concatenating the first line of the usage string shown below with "Incorrect command line arguments."  Such concatenation seems arbitrary.  We should change the error message to be more specific, e.g. "Incorrect number of command line arguments, expect 3 or 4 but actually number is 5.  The input command is ...")
{code}
//hardlink.c
void HardlinkUsage()
{
    fwprintf(stdout, L"\
Usage: hardlink create [LINKNAME] [FILENAME] |\n\
       hardlink stat [FILENAME]\n\
Creates a new hardlink on the existing file or displays the number of links\n\
for the given file\n");
}
{code}, > ... expect 3 or 4 but actually number is 5 ...

For hardlink create, it must be 4.  So it should be "... expect 4 but actually number is 5 ...", If there are bugs in getLinkMultArgLength but the bugs do not affect upgrade, we may fix them separately., [~cnauroth]/[~arpitagarwal], any update?, Updated patch to address most of the feedback from [~szetszwo]. I also updated the exception message for createHardLink to include the failed command. Let's address hardlink.c issues in a separate JIRA.

We have existing unit tests but they did not catch this failure. There appears to be some environment/JDK version issue that we were not able to figure out.

Longer term we should just deprecate all this code and use [Files.createLink|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createLink%28java.nio.file.Path,%20java.nio.file.Path%29] if we detect Java 7+. It will be much more efficient than launching a new process for each file., +1 patch looks good., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
