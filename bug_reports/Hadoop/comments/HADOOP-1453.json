{code}, I guess this is not enough. There is an exists() in ChecksumFileSystem.open() as well. Should that be removed as well? :

{code}
  public FSDataInputStream open(Path f, int bufferSize) throws IOException {
    if (!exists(f)) {
      throw new FileNotFoundException(f.toString());
    }
    return new FSDataInputStream(new FSInputChecker(this, f, bufferSize),
                                 bufferSize);
  }
{code}, This implies there are 3 extra RPCs to NameNode for typical DFS file open(). One in ChecksumFS and one each for file and .file.crc in DFS.
 , Attaching an updated patch. I think it is correct and can be checked in if anyone reviews it.
, Both your patches are for DistributedFileSystem whereas your comment says that there are *two* places where a redundant exists()  call is made: DistributedFileSystem and ChecksumFileSystem. Can you pl clarify?, Thanks Dhruba. Now it is fixed. Please review 02.patch., +1 code looks good., -1, build or testing failed
