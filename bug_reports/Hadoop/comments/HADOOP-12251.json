[HADOOP-6796 covered {{FileStatus.hashCode()}} NPE-ing if the path was null at the time of invocation. This issue doesn't look at that, only the adverse consequences of changing the hash code.

As FileStatus has to be writeable, the path value does have to be mutable. Which means it's probably impossible to fix this problem. 

Closing as a WONTFIX; leaving the issue in JIRA for people to find]
