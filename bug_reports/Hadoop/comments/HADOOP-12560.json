[Can I work on this, [~cmccabe]? Thanks for reporting this., Works for me :-), Sorry I missed your discussion in [HADOOP-12344]. I may need more context but obviously you know the {{sprintf}} format best. Feel free to re-assign to me if you're overloaded., Hi [~liuml07], based on [~alanburlison]'s comments on the other JIRA, feel free to assign this one to yourself.

The easiest way to fix this is to remove the compiler warnings by typecasting things to {{long long}} and using {{%lld}}., Yes, please feel free to reassign.

For 32/64 bit portability you will probably need to cast to the appropriate bitness-specific typedef use the PRId64 macro in the format string. There are existing examples in the code you can use as templates, e.g. https://github.com/apache/hadoop/search?q=PRId64, Thanks for your helpful suggestion, [~cmccabe] and [~alanburlison].

According to the [POSIX|http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_12], the {{uid_t}} and {{gid_t}} are Integer type. Should I prefer PRId32 to PRId64 in the format string?, Sorry, I meant "prefer PRId64 to PRId32". Please see the patch., I think you need to be a little careful because "integer type" doesn't necessarily mean "C int type" but it appears both uid_t and gid_t are 32 bits even when the app is LP64, so PRId32 seems like the right one., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for your quick review, [~alanburlison].

 I agree that uid_t and gid_t are opaque types. Their exact type ranges from s32 to u32 to u64 (Solaris until 2007, Linux, Windows64). Is it safer to elevate the type to int64_t in case of u32 on some platform (e.g. on my Gentoo Linux)? I saw another place in Hadoop project that is using the PRId64 for uid_t in {{hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/native/container-executor/impl/configuration.c}} and {{}}., A very good question. Yes, I think if you promote everything to 64 bit it will have the best possible chance of being both cross-platform and future-proof., A very good question. Yes, I think if you promote everything to 64 bit it will have the best possible chance of being both cross-platform and future-proof., Thanks for your confirmation.

, FYI, it doesn't reflect it in the final report, but Yetus did confirm this lowered the warnings:

We've got an open JIRA to expose these numbers so that you can see it drop. :), Thanks for your kind information. I believe those numbers will be very useful when they show up., BTW, I forgot to mention that these numbers *do* show up on the console., Yes, I'm able to find them in console output.
