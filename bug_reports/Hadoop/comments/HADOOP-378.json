[(This one might have gone stale over time, and perhaps does not apply anymore)

This one needs to explain more about what its talking about - deployment of Hadoop via HADOOP_MASTER which uses rsync (and thereby does not pass out incrementals)?

This would be resolved by better packaging, which is gonna be addressed in future via Bigtop and the like, hopefully. A package for examples, a package for test, a package for clients. With mavenized builds, this is very easy to do and is on its way.

Resolving as Incomplete, needs more desc.]
