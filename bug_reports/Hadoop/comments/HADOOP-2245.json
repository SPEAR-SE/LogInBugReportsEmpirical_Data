This message is automatically generated., I just committed this. Thanks, Adrian!, Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #312 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/312/]), I'm reopening this after reverting the patch.

This patch can be significantly improved, especially the test-cases. Specifically it copies code from TestJobControl into JobControlTestUtils, for re-use, and yet doesn't remove the copied code from TestJobControl. It also introduced new compiler warnings, which somehow weren't caught by the patch-process. 

Overall, my bad, I should have been more careful while committing this., I propose we commit the more crucial part of Adrian's patch i.e. the fix to {{LocalJobRunner}} (attached here) since that helps with the existing test-cases seem to fail and Adrian can fix the newer test-cases and submit that as a new patch. Thoughts?, I have already removed the duplicate code from TestJobControl and am working on the compiler warnings as we speak so you can either go ahead with the smaller patch or wait., Sounds good, if you prefer so we can wait for the better patch. , Removed unused code in TestJobControl and made types more specific in TestJobControl to get rid of compiler warnings., Same as previous patch plus the change to LocalJobRunner.java, Now with all discussed changes, tests passing etc. Code review please., New patch now available incoporating Arun's feedback., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., No idea why contrib tests fail on this, ran them a few times here and they go just fine., Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #313 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/313/]), The patch seems to have generated new Findbugs warning(s) but the Findbugs warning-link is not accesible from jira. I am going to resubmit the patch again. Adrian, could you please take a look at the Findbugs warnings., Attempting to get hold of the Findbugs warnings., The findbugs error is probably related to 

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2272

which should now be fixed. So let's see what Hudson says... (all patches submitted since towards the end of last week that generated findbugs errors should also be resubmitted)., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I just committed this. Thanks, Adrian!, Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #317 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/317/]), I think you forgot to commit the newly added class

JobControlTestUtils

The trunk core tests won't compile until you do this...., Done. Thanks for pointing this out., Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #318 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/318/])]
