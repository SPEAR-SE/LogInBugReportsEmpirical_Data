[I'm afraid I'm gong to have to close this as an invalid issue unless you can show that there's a bug in distCP that surfaces on your infrastructure

http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/InvalidJiraIssues

# DistCp works for everybody else, fast enough to bring down network links between sites if you aren't careful.
# It is implemented as an MR job run on the source cluster, where mappers copy files.

If it doesn't work for you, then there's probably something wrong with your cluster or network
* the bandwidth between clusters is lower than you expect
* you are limited by the no. of mappers you can run with distCP (distcp conf or cluster setup)
* you have lots and lots of small files

If you can show that your cluster and the network has the capacity to copy large files (hint: use one of the many linux command line network bandwidth test tools to measure that bandwidth before going near Hadoop), then consider filing a bug. Even there, as nobody else is seeing it, you are going to have to be the person to debug & fix it. , Resolving as invalid per Steve's comment.]
