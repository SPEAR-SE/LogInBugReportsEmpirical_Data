This message is automatically generated., I need to look at this more, but you need to synch the getInstance, and call super in close()., Thanks Daryn. Definitely looking forward for your full review.

Meanwhile, I am uploading a new patch to address Daryn's comments:
# make getInstance() synchronized and make INSTANCE non-volatile
# call super.close() in close() of WebHdfs and Hftp FS

This message is automatically generated., +1 But I'd suggest canceling the token in {{removeRenewAction}}.  Hftp & webhdfs only register tokens for renewal that are implicitly created for internal use.  Since they aren't cancelled, it causes a bunch of defunct tokens to clog the NN until they expire.  If you want to fix it on another jira, I'm fine with that., Hi Daryn,

Thanks for the review.

I have filed HADOOP-9064 to add canceling the token. I feel we should pass a boolean to {{#removeRenewAction(boolean cancel)}} and cancel the token accordingly. The filesystems can call removeRenewAction with cancel set to true.
