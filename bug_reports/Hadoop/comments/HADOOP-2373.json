[This patch provides better reporting of the safe-mode state.
- It prints what is the current ratio of the reported blocks.
- It reports when safe mode enters the extended wait period and says how many seconds remained till the name-node will leave it.
- It logs the name-node state every 20 seconds.

reportStatus() is called by methods that are synchronized, so there is no need to synchronize itself.

> timeInSafemode/1000 => String.format("%0.2d", timeInSafemode/1000.0).
This prints whole number of seconds, I do not think we want microseconds here.

> Similarly, use String.format(...) for other floating point output in getTurnOffTip().
I did that. The threshold is printed up to the fourth digit.
Two digits is probably not enough since the default has three: 0.999f, +1, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
