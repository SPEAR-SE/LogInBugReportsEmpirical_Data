[it's not actually failing, but logging @ error. Note that winutils is needed not just server-side, but if you try to set file permissions or do symlinks in the {{file://}} filesystem, so depending on what you want to do client-side it will be needed.

What could be done is maybe lower the stack trace level to info, and at error print a message that includes a wiki URL to discuss the topic,, This feels like the behavior should be analogous to what we do in {{NativeCodeLoader}}: log once at warn level.  The full stack trace doesn't have much value here IMO., One of the things I keep meaning to do is to wrap that warn with a way to turn it off because on systems that don't have native libs, it's not useful.  So keep that in mind too...., ...I'm starting to think we may want a policy option here
* warn: as today
* fail: refuse to come out to play
* ignore: don't complain
* no-native: don't even look

, What about having a special log category just for "no native libs"; Shell & NativeCodeLoader could share it?, In HADOOP-10775 we're not logging until the path is needed, at which point an exception will be raised with meaningful text. , Closing as fixed. There's still the dependency, but no warning unless/until the winutils path is actually needed]
