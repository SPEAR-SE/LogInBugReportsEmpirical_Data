[Hi [~aw], FYI. Thanks.
, Looks like a duplicate of HADOOP-12312., I've seen this recently on HDFS-8831 Jenkins report as well. Both after HADOOP-12312 is fixed.., Thanks [~jlowe] and [~xyao] for the input, indeed we are seeing this with most recent builds, so may be a different issue than what HADOOP-12312 solved.
, I got the impression HADOOP-12312 was the same issue but only fixed in the HADOOP-12111 branch.  This may be a fix that never made it to trunk and is only in Yetus.  I don't believe Yetus is enabled on all projects yet.  Hopefully [~aw] can clarify., I just enabled for all projects a bit ago., Thanks [~jlowe] and [~aw]. Do we expect this issue to be fixed now with Allen's change?

, The only issue we've seen since the change in yetus is that sometimes convertXml fails to run.  We're still investigating why that happens because we haven't found a reproducible case.  But when it does happen, Yetus is very clear that's what broke., Hi [~aw], thanks for working on this. If you need more data point, please have a look at [this HDFS-9231 build|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-9231?focusedCommentId=14975559&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14975559]., test-patch is no longer being developed inside Hadoop.

Closing as won't fix.
