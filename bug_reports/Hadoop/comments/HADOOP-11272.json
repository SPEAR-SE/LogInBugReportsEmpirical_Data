This message is automatically generated., +1, the latest patch looks good to me. I'm confident that the test failures are unrelated as well - both tend to flake out when run on slower/overloaded machines.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks a lot for the contribution, Arun., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6461 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6461/])
