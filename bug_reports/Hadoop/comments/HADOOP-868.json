[The patch fixes the following:
1) Removes a redundant file "open" method call from mergeParts
2) All index files are not kept open at once. Now, the index file for a spill is opened, the offsets are read after "seek"ing to the correct place, and then the file is immediately closed.
3) The hardcoding of merge factor to the number of spills is not done; merge factor used for the merges is the default (configured via io.sort.factor)., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12348535/868.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r494253., I just committed this.  Thanks, Devaraj!]
