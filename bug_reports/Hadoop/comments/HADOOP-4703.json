[4073_20081120.patch: change waitForProxy(...) to getProxy(...) in creating InterDatanodeProtocol and ClientDatanodeProtocol.

waitForProxy(...) waits forever if there are ConnectException.  It seems not right since if the server in the other side is down, the client cannot detect it but keep waiting., +1 This fixed the hanging TestFileCreationClient problem that we saw while testing the patch to HADOOP-4659., Since the change is simple, no new tests added., {noformat}
