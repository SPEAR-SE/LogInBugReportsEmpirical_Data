[Attaching a patch for the Y20 branch. "Exception" is caught and a relogin is attempted. We were debating whether to have relogin done outside the exception block before doing a saslConnect. But even in that case, we need to be able to handle exceptions since some other thread might be currently using the subject credentials that we are just about to destroy (in relogin) and that thread should retry the connection after a relogin. In any case the exception handling is required., patch looks good., One note on the patch is that this is a stop-gap solution (and is lame, in that it banks on exception handling to do relogins). The ideal solution is to use the Refreshable interface and in that case we don't have to rely on exceptions being thrown before attempting relogins. However, as Owen noted in http://tinyurl.com/y6putxk, the patch that uses the Refreshable interface doesn't seem to be working as expected., Attaching a patch that fixes a bug in the earlier version of the Y20s patch. Not for commit., Updates the relogin behavior even more. Closes the RPC socket on a connection failure. (patch for Y20s)., FIX on top ., addressed comments from Devaraj, removed unneeded imports., Patch for trunk.

This message is automatically generated., javadoc warnings are in KerberosName.java and SecurityUtil.java and are unrelated to this patch.

The patch was manually tested on Y20 branch., Looks like due to the order in which the patches from HADOOP-6706 and HADOOP-6718 got applied, there is a small problem in the part where the exception thrown by setupSaslConnection is handled. handleSaslConnection is not called anymore.
