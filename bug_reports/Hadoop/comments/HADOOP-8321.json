[Attached patch works from my IDE (IntelliJ) but it fails from Maven, it seems that when running from Maven the custom URLStreamHandler is not being invoked.

Thoughts?

Wonder how this worked before, also, when running  the testcases locally before committing I have not seen the error (odd).
, I looked into this problem a bit yesterday.  The loaded config contains keys for {{fs.AbstractFileSystem.$scheme.impl}} instead of the expected {{fs.$scheme.impl}}.  I looked at some of the earlier commits but did not see anything that would appear to cause this issue., correction my patch works correctly when running the testcase from maven. I made a mistake when testing it that i was running the test from hadoop-hdfs/ but I did not push hadoop-common to the m2 cache (where the fix actually is), thus maven was picking up a JAR from m2 without the fix. From the IDE was working because I have whole Hadoop source in it and it was picking up the fix.
, BTW, test-patch wont run the offending testcase because the changes are in common and testcase is in hdfs.

The reviewer should apply the patch locally and run the testcase from trunk/
