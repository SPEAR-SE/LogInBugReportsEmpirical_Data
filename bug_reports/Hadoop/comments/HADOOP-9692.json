This message is automatically generated., Resolve new warning, Should we catch EOFException instead?

{code}
+      } catch (Exception e) {
{code}

Other IOException should be thrown to the callers., There are two kinds of exception can be thrown here: IOException and EOFException, and both of them are because of the file can't be read correctly. Depending on how fine grind we want to go to, we can treat them both as file reading error or only catch EOFException and throws IOException. , IMHO, IOException and EOFException needs to be treated differently. EOFException is a signal that indicate the end of the stream, such that what you're doing helps to surpass the case of reading a zero-length file. In contrast, IOException can be raised according to a number of other reasons. For example, the stream has already been closed before reading. If IOException is caught as well, reading a closed stream of a non-zero-length file is going to be regarded as reaching the end of stream as well. In this specific case, the function will enter the if block, and throw "not a SequenceFile" IOException instead, which I think it is not appropriate., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message was automatically generated., +1, committing this shortly. , Rethinking of this before committing - I think we should re-throw EOFException with a message 'this " not a SequenceFile"' if EOFException is raised.

[~zjshen] what do you think?, [~ozawa] [~zjshen]: Maybe we should quickly revisit the last pending question and reach a conclusion? Thanks!, \\

Thank you for pinging me., Thanks!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8693 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8693/])
