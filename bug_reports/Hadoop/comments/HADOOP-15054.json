, Agree we should upgrade to 1.11. 1.4 was released 8 years ago.
Can you please run the unit test locally? Please note if the patch has only change in pom.xml, it doesn't really run any tests at all.
, Ran hadoop-auth tests and hadoop-hdfs-client tests.
Tests passed locally, few failures I have seen but they have open jiras, but not related to the patch., Thanks
Please also note commons-codec is used in many places within Hadoop codebase (e.g. yarn, mapreduce) so running tests in that two sub components would be not sufficient.

That said, given that Hadoop 3 has client classpath isolation it should be easier to bump up a dependency version now.

I applied this patch and am running our internal test suites against it now. Expect to have results back soon., [~jojochuang]
Thanks for info.

Yes, as we have classpath isolation and having shaded jars, it will not affect downstream clients., +1 will commit after Thanksgiving., Thanks PJ Fanning for proposing the upgrade, and [~bharatviswa] for the patch.

Committed the patch to trunk (3.1.0).
 
I've verified that after the change, Hadoop depends on commons-codec 1.11, and I also subjected the patch against our internal test infrastructure to verify it does not break downstream applications (at least for CDH per se)., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13289 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13289/])
HADOOP-15054. upgrade hadoop dependency on commons-codec to 1.11. (weichiu: rev 3881c9ef7ef811ca5bac6c090cd8d9a8756f81a4)
