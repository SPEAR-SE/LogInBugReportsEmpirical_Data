[Could occur only when server is shutdown. Deferring to 0.14, This was fixed by HADOOP-1390.
It took me a while to find the fix since the Comment to revision 540324 incorrectly says
"HADOOP-1364.  Fix various inconsistent synchronization issues.  Contributed by Devaraj."
1390 should be mentioned instead of 1364.
