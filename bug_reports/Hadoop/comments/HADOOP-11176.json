[Uploading initial patch with testcase to reproduce the issue.., Please do note.. as demonstrated in the testcases, it can fail in the case of SIMPLE auth as well since both the "user.name" and "doAs" parameters sent by KMSClientProvider to the KMS server would always be the same... this patch fixes that.., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

Just two nits.

This change:

{noformat}
      final String doAsUser = (currentUgi.getAuthenticationMethod() ==
          UserGroupInformation.AuthenticationMethod.PROXY) 
                              ? currentUgi.getShortUserName() : null;
{noformat}

seems to be a whitespace only change.

This change:

{noformat}
          return authUrl.openConnection(
              url,
              authToken, doAsUser);
{noformat}

seems to be an extraneous reformatting., Reverting whitespace and formatting changes.. thanks for the review [~clamb], {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks pretty good to me, and it's a good catch. I have one nit and a few small comments:

Comments:

# The variable name "{{loginUgi}}" is now a bit misleading, since it's not necessarily actually attempting to refer to the login UGI of the process where this {{KMSClientProvider}} is running. Suggest renaming it to something like "serverUgi" or something more clear.
# I'm not crazy about re-assigning the {{loginUgi}} instance variable in the {{createConnection}} method. What if at some point later in the life of this {{KMSClientProvider}} some authentication method other than PROXY is used? I suggest making that instance var final, maybe renaming it to "{{ugiAtCreate}}" or something, and then setting a local var appropriately in {{createConnection}} to the correct UGI and using that.

Nit:

# There's two semicolons at the end of this line:
{code}
+        loginUgi = UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser().getRealUser();;
{code}

+1 once these are addressed.

Thanks a lot, Arun., Uploading updated patch

Thanks for the review [~atm],
* changed name of *loginUgi* to *actualUgi* (felt it might be better than serverUgi)
* *actualUgi* is now a final field initialized to either currentUgi or realUgi if currentUgi is a Proxy. This way, we wont need to create a new variable at the time of {{createConnection()}}, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., * The findBugs warnings are actually unrelated to the patch.. they will start to show up since HADOOP-11178 (which fixes the findBugs exclusion file) is resolved. They should go away once HADOOP-11122 is fixed and committed
* The release audit warning also looks unrelated, +1, the latest patch looks good to me. The change seems much clearer to me now, and I agree that the RAT and findbugs warnings are unrelated.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.6.
