This message was automatically generated., Since the changes are only in common module file, hdfs tests are not running.

To Verify, I suggest to add one more test in common itself, with LocalFileSystem may be {{TestLocalFileSystemContract}}. And move this Jira to common.

Coming to patch, 
patch just reverts the earlier change done in HADOOP-12009.
Instead, it can be fixed as below, by keeping intention of HADOOP-12009 intact.
{code}
     paths = fs.listStatus(path("/test/hadoop"));
     assertEquals(3, paths.length);
-    ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
+    ArrayList<Path> list = new ArrayList<Path>();
     for (FileStatus fileState : paths) {
-      list.add(fileState.getPath().toString());
+      list.add(fileState.getPath());
     }
     assertTrue(list.contains(path("/test/hadoop/a")));
     assertTrue(list.contains(path("/test/hadoop/b")));
{code}, \\

This message was automatically generated., [~brahmareddy], thanks for the update.

Also please add one test {{TestLocalFileSystemContract}} similar to {{TestHDFSFileSystemContract}} in common. 
otherwise changes will not be really tested., Original issue HADOOP-12009 itself is reverted.  Issue will be fixed there itself.

Thanks [~brahmareddy].]
