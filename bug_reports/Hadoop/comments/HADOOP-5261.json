[Patch:
  * Synchronizes access to getHosts() and getExcludedHosts() methods
  * Returns a copy of the hosts and excluded hosts sets, rather than the actual reference to them.  This prevents concurrency problems if later a process is trying to enumerate over the sets while HostsFileReader is updating/deleting, etc.

Patch passes all unit tests except known-bad HADOOP-4907.
