[I have copied the interface classification stuff from HADOOP-5073 in the attached html.
I plan to add this Overview.html in the package o.a.h.classification.
I have added a couple of FAQs and minor edits but the text is mostly unchanged from HADOOP-5073, Update document, Also: {{@VisibleForTesting}}, "this is for testing only; you should not be using this at all except while writing unit tests for the specific Hadoop project". Package-scoped classes and methods often also used for this purpose., Uploading a patch that copies Sanjay's html file to apt.vm format verbatim.


, The patches do a brilliant job of summarizing the discussion on HADOOP-5073. 

I have a few minor comments on the patch that I intend to incorporate in the next version:
# Move the sections around a little bit. e.g. FAQ should probably be towards the end
# As this is specific to Hadoop, may be we need not mention company-private as a bullet, but may be can include a note on it later in the text.
# Few other cosmetic changes., Updated patch with the changes mentioned above. The content is almost identical to the previous patch. 

[~sanjay.radia], please feel free to revert my changes as you see fit. Just thought it might be simpler to put them in there.

Need to address one more point:

bq. APIs of private audience will not be part of the public javadoc generated by ant (i.e. by the mvn target javadoc:javadoc); they will only be generated for the developer javadoc (generated by ant target "javadoc-dev")

I am not aware of a way to generate dev-specific javadoc using mvn.
, Including a blurb on APIs with VisibleForTesting., Updated patch addresses javadoc. I believe this is ready for review., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
