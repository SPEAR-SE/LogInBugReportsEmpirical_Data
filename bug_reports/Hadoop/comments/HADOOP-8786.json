[Tested this patch with a new unit test, and also verified that it solved the symptoms seen in HDFS-3904., +1 pending jenkins and assuming that that the jetty server start() method is synchronous/blocking regarding the contexts initialization (this is, until all contexts are initialized, start() does not complete)., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., is this Dupe of HADOOP-7688?, It's very similar to HADOOP-7688, but depends on the way in which the filter is initialized. I'm not super familiar with the Jetty internals, but it looks like this API call is using FilterHolders instead of FilterInitializers, which perhaps is what causes the difference.

As for whether the start call is synchronous/blocking, it does appear to be. The stack trace shown in the exception shows the "HttpServer.start()" call on its backtrace, implying that it's on the same thread., Committed to trunk.

Should we backport both this and HADOOP-7688 to branch-2 and branch-1? What do you think, Uma/Alejandro?, Yes, IMO, we should backport this to branch-2 also. I have put the same question for backport in HADOOP-7688. It should be fine to port it to branch-1 as well.
