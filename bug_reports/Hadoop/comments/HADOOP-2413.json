[The use of this static varible FSNamesystem.fsNamesystemObject induces the following Findbugs warning:

- FSNamesystem:365
[ST] Write to static field from instance method [ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD]
This instance method writes to a static field. This is tricky to get correct if multiple instances are being manipulated, and generally bad practice. 
, You probably want to deprecate the {{static fsNamesystemObject}} member somewhere along the lines., Here is a patch, which finally removes the static {{FSNamesystem.fsNamesystemObject}} field and the respective method to access it.
The trick was to eliminate static methods like {{FSEditsLog.loadFSEdits()}}.
I also had to change {{TestEditLog}}, which was starting {{MiniDFSCluster}} only to obtain name directories and then worked directly with {{FSImage}}. Now it uses {{FSImage}} through teh {{cluster}} variable.
I removed {{FSDirectory.namesystem}} member because namesystem is accessible via {{FSImage}} now., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
