[Attaching the patch., Personally I would've used something even more unlikely, such as "ThisIsNotARealHostName-ItJustCant", but I guess UnknownHost123 is not very likely to exist :).

+1 (non-binding)., TestNetUtils in branch-1-win does not fail in my machine.  Is there any special setting in your machine/network?

BTW, I just have a quick check of the InetAddress source code (http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/net/InetAddress.java.html).  It seems that it won't do any lookup if the input string is already an numerical IP address.  However, it is probably jdk dependent., I understand the problem after looked at Ivan's patch - "UnknownHost" was resolved to an IP in your setting., +1 patch looks good., I have committed this.  Thanks, Ivan!, Thanks Mostafa and Nicholas for the review!, Run into the same failure in trunk (branch-trunk-win). Attaching the trunk compatible patch. 

Nicholas, can we please commit this to trunk as well?, Reopening for trunk., Ivan, your thinking pattern will influence someone to use UnknownHost123 :-) I am sure this jira will be opened many more times to come up with creative non existent host names :-)
