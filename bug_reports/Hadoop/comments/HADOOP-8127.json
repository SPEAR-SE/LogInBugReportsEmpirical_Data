[Hi,
we are facing this problem too, but upgrading to commons-net 2.0 doesn't seem to solve this problem.
Have you tested it on file with creation time set to something different from 0:00?

File with timestamp 2012-02-29 00:00:00.000000000 +0100 works fine, but I am not able download file with timestamp for example 2012-02-29 12:30:00.000000000 +0100., We had files and directories created all day long every hour without any trouble using commons-net-2.0.jar (that we put in /usr/lib/hadoop/lib).
We are using the FTPFileSystem as a distcp source for some data like this:

{code}
hadoop distcp ftp://ftpserver/data/ hdfs://hadoop/data2/
{code}, # poignant that the NET-188 bug got filed the last time there was a leap year.
# it should be fairly straightforward to add a test for this if we can serve up some files
# what platform was the FTP server? , The FTP server is an isilon cluster using vsftp (http://www.isilon.com/)

I didn't do more testing to see if the problem comes up with other FTP servers, but from the NET-188 bug I can tell it happened to a lot of people.]
