[simple null check., I think this needs to be in 0.16.2., +1 for 16.2

I would also add a catch at the outer level of the run method to catch runtime exceptions., Thanks for the patch Koji.  This patch needs a test case in TestTrash.java.  As well, can someone code review the HADOOP-2514 patch that implemented this feature to see if there are other issues with it?  It was committed without a code review.  Sigh., Owen, added a try-catch for RuntimeException. 
I wasn't sure where I should put.

Nigel, added one test for -expunge on an empty user dir. , I just committed this. Thanks, Koji., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #443 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/443/])]
