[Hey Todd, I noticed that too before, and I don't get why OpenSSLCodec uses OsSecureRandom by default. Should we simply default OpenSSLCodec to to use OpensslSecureRandom?Â , I think that would probably make sense. I didn't get a chance to benchmark that implementation but I would guess it is much faster!]
