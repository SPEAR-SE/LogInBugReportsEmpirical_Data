This message is automatically generated., Patch looks pretty good to me, and I agree that the fix is sufficiently obvious/difficult to test that a test isn't necessary.

My only suggestion is to change the comment to say that the exception "can bring down *the daemon running this SecretManager*" instead of "the node." As it stands, you're using the word "node" twice in the same comment to refer to very different things - one in ZK, one the daemon.

I'll be +1 once this is addressed., Thanks for the review [~atm].

This message is automatically generated., +1, the latest patch looks good to me. I'm confident the test failure is unrelated, and as mentioned before I don't think this change warrants a new test.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
