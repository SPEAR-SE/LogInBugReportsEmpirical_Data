[The original design had all adaptors execute inside a loop.  For this reason, removing adaptor from the adaptor hash would be sufficient.  However, new adapators may be multi-threaded, hence, adding "adaptor.hardStop()" is ideal.  There might be some changes required for the adaptor to stop itself, and remove the code for removing from the adaptor hash., This got fixed by HADOOP-4893.]
