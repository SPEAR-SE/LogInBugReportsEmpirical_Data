This message is automatically generated., HADOOP-6671 (mavenization) bumped jetty to 6.1.26., Patch for 0.22, This issue needs to be fixed in 0.22 separately., Just FYI. After jetty 6.1.26 upgrade, we(yahoo) are seeing many fetch failures issues on our grids. MAPREDUCE-2980, Koji, yes this is correct. We also see many fetch failures, but with jetty 6.1.14 tasks hang forever. Both is bad, but with fetch failures you get them fail fast and re-executed automatically. which is better than killing attempts manually.

https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Common-22-branch/94/console, There was an extra removal in the library.properties file - I have fixed it as a separate commit. Here's new combined patch.

Common build was successful and all artifacts were pushed correctly., everything is properly committed and works now.]
