test failures are HADOOP-11486 & something else with no IPC-related code, Hi [~varun_saxena], thanks for taking this up.

It looks like the new test case passes even after reverting the change to RetryPolicies.java. I did not spend any time debugging it though. Do you see the same?, Yes you are correct. The test case would require some change. Will look into it., [~arpitagarwal] / [~stevel@apache.org], fixed the test case. Kindly review., \\

This message was automatically generated., +1 for the updated patch and test case. I will commit it shortly., Committed for 2.8.0.

Thanks for the contribution Varun and thanks Steve for the code review., The Target Version was set to 2.7.1 but I am not sure this meets the bar.

[~daryn], if you think this needs to be in 2.7.1 let me know or feel free to cherry-pick. Thanks., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7991 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7991/])
