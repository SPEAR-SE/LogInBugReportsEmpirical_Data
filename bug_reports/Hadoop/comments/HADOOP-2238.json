This message is automatically generated., Paul, if you can confirm that Safari displays the graph correctly, then I'm +1 for this. No need to rerun the tests for this trivial one. If 0.15.1 is to be delayed for some reason we will include this in 0.15, otherwise we will stick with 0.16. , It does work with Safari 3.0 (Safari 2.x does not support svg).  Before this patch Safari 3.0 would download files over and over again instead of displaying the graphic., Committed to be included in 0.15.1. Thanks Paul !, Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #313 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/313/]), Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #317 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/317/])]
