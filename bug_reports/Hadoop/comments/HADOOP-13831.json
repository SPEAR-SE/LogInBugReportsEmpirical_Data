[can you tag which version this surfaces on, component as fs/azure. thanks, yes tagged the component; not sure I understand exactly what is meant by which version this 'surfaces' on - is it affects version or fix version ?, generally, which shipping/not yet shipping version of Hadoop has the issue being addressed? Such as 2.7.3, 2.8.0, etc. Target version is the one you hope to get it into, 2.9 and 3.0 being what you should be looking at, earlier versions being selective backports. thanks, [~stevel@apache.org] can someone assign this issue to me ? thx, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

# Because yetus/jenkins doesn't test them, we try to keep a strict policy of "submitter must attest to having passed tests for the relevant object store", : https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute#Submitting_patches_against_object_stores_such_as_Amazon_S3.2C_OpenStack_Swift_and_Microsoft_Azure . Can you confirm that you have done so., Thanks [~stevel@apache.org] ! So I have run all relevant tests during package compilation (number of tests passing before and after the patch is the same). In addition, I have created a custom jar with the same patch on my hdp cluster and did basic sanity testing. This works. The specific case of testing the functionality of the patch pertains to detecting server failure condition which is hard to simulate without long running test, hence as such this is not particularly tested. I believe we have had similar patches in the past such as HADOOP-12334 and HADOOP-11693 which followed a similar template. If there is any additional testing that needs to / can be done please give me some idea and I will explore it. The patch is fairly straightforward - a simple change in conditional check - test for http status code 503 instead of relying on storage error code - and was recommended by azure storage team.

Now adding [~dchickabasapa], [~onpduo] [~liuml07] and [~nitinverma] for review and further input, +1, +1, +1

Will committed in one second., I have committed this patch to {{trunk}} and {{branch-2}} branches. Thanks for the contribution, [~gouravk]. Thanks for reviewing this, [~stevel@apache.org], [~antiwari@microsoft.com] and [~nitin.verma@gmail.com], SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #11002 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/11002/])
