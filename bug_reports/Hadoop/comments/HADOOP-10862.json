[* Changed all log messages to use String.format()
* Moved all KMS Operations from a string to an enum
* Changed KEY_OP to KEY
* Added {{@InterfaceAudience.Private}} to all KMS classes, [~tucu00], apparently, making the {{KMS}} class a Singleton required some extra code changes. as per [this link|https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/jaxrs-resources.html#d0e2323], we would need to Create an instance of an {{Application}} and register the Singleton with it.

Also, considering the fact that the {{KMS}} class does'nt really hold state (the provider and kmsaudit references are passed to it by {{KMSWebApp}}) I feel it is lightweight enough to be instantiated for every call., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., *KMS.java*:
* On the message template constants, we were using 2 single quotes because the single quote has a special meaning (take {} as literal) and you have to escape it using 2 single quotes. Now that we are using {{String.format()}}, I believe we should be just 1 single quote.
* The {{KMSOps}} enum seems identical to the {{KMSACLs.Type}} enum, would make sense to bubble up KMSOps enum to top level class and use that in both places?

*KMSAudit.java*:
* I was not suggesting changing the slf4j message templates using {} to String.format(), we should not use {{String.format()}} here, so the message is resolved only if the log level is enabled (using {{String.format()}}, the message is always resolved).

, @tucu, thanks for the feedback

bq. The KMSOps enum seems identical to the KMSACLs.Type enum..
I was considering that initially, but realized that there are ACLs such as SET_KEY_VERSION, which is not a KMS operation. Also, multiple KMS ops might map to a single ACL (for eg. GET) which is the reason I felt we could keep them separate., Updating patch with [~tucu00]'s feedback, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
