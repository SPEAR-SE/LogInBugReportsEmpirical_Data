[I disagree on this one. There is a lot of value in having semantics behind the key version. For example, the MapReduce task ids used to be randomly generated. That was easy, but it was a pain in the tail to figure out which tasks were related to which job. , Owen, I'm ok with some implementations choosing to use <NAME>@<COUNTER> as the version ID. However, I don' think we can mandate that, specially when integrating with 3rd party key management solutions which generate their own opaque key version IDs.

The purpose of this JIRA is to ensure that KeyProvider/KeyShell/KMS don't assume the version ID is <NAME>@<COUNTER>, rather threat it as an opaque value.

Regarding the existing methods in the public API, such as {{buildVersionName()}}, I would propose moving them to a {{KeyProviderUtils}} class for KeyProvider implementations that choose to use the <NAME>@<COUNTER> version ID format., Changed the scope of this JIRA to the KMS classes., I'd like if we tackled this for the common classes too for consistency. It'd be nice to do something like make {{buildVersionName}} abstract and provide the current impl as a static helper in e.g. {{KeyProviderUtils}} as Tucu proposed. I'm not sure exactly what method signature these third-party key providers need though. Is there a JIRA for this?

+1 for the KMS side stuff though, this part at least looks good., [~andrew.wang], how about tackling that in a diff JIRA?, Yea totally, I think we're good on this one as soon as Jenkins come back. If you can file a follow-on that'd be swell., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., the failure is unrelated to this JIRA, is  because a race condition in the testcase while modifying a hot-reloadable config file, opened HADOOP-10645 to fix it., Created HADOOP-10646 to move buildVersionName() to a util class., committed to trunk., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5636 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5636/])
