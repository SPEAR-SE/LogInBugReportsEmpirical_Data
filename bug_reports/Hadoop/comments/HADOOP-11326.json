[Where did you find this..? can you please give me path..?, I had tried to configure org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.BlockPlacementPolicyWithNodeGroup in my hdfs setup, but got a class not found error on service startup.  So i looked in my distribution (cdh) fro the class, and didn't find it, but did find:

{code}
 jar tvf /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-5.4.0-1.cdh5.4.0.p0.799/lib/hadoop-hdfs/hadoop-hdfs.jar | grep org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.BlockPlacementPolicyWithNodeGroup
{code}, Can I close this issue.? I think, you need to  file this jira in Cloudera, [~ejohansen] I am closing this issue...can you raise in CDH jira..? Correct me If I am wrong.., I'm not sure why this simple typo isn't being fixed in the HVE User Guide. The configuration in core-site.xml won't work with the wrong class name. , bq. 'm not sure why this simple typo isn't being fixed in the HVE User Guide. 

HADOOP-8468 has never been committed to the source tree so there's nothing for anyone to fix upstream from Cloudera's source tree., Actually  HADOOP-10512  is a better JIRA to look at, since it effectively says "This feature isn't officially documented.", [~djp]: Is this something you can fix? It is not a Cloudera document as far as I can tell. Is it in Hortonworks source tree?, Hi [~mcudahy] and [~aw], NodeGroup layer topology (HADOOP-8468) is committed into branch-1 (since 1.2) and branch-2 (since 2.1.0-beta) and get used by users in virtualization world. I still owe document there (tracked by HADOOP-10512), but haven't get cycles to do the work (due to other priority work recently).
I will continue the work if get bandwidth., Not Hortonworks .. JP did this @ VMWare...]
