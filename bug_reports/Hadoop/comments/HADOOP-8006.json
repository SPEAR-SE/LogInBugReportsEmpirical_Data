[looks this test is broken by HADOOP-7998. Reverting HADOOP-7998, test passing., I think now the filesystem's wrapped stream apis( skip() ) will have inconsistencies when enabling the verifyChecksum flag and disabling this flag.
Whether we will allow this inconsistencies?, This is actually a bug in {{FSInputChecker}}.  The return value of {{skip(n)}} is supposed to be the number of bytes skipped.  {{FSInputChecker#skip}} is returning whatever value the user supplied.  I don't think the test needs to be updated, but {{FSInputChecker}} needs to be fixed.

BTW, I'm not sure why this test is in hdfs.  It appears to only include files from hadoop-common-project.  Should it be moved?, Nevermind the question regarding the test location.  It's using a {{MiniDFSCluster}}., yes , i have seen it. Some tests are using MiniDFSCluster.

Thanks Daryn for your time.
Actually test failure is not because of bug in FSInputChecker. It is actually failing when we disable the verifyChecksum flag. Because when we disable the flag, it use RawLocalFileystem. Here it won't use FSInputChecker. It will use BufferedFSInputStream. Since skip implementation is not consistent with ChecksumFileSystem, it is failing.

This message is automatically generated., For my own knowledge, how does {{markSupported}} related to this bug?  Maybe you could just {{return super.skip(nn)}}?  Or {{return super.skip(Math.min(n, in.available()));}}?

how does markSupported related to this bug?
{quote}
After fixing the skip api issue, there another assertion failure. i.e, related to markSupported API. Since BufferredFSInputStream extends BufferedInputStream, that was returning true.

Maybe you could just return super.skip(nn)? Or return super.skip(Math.min(n, in.available()));?
{quote}
super.skip(nn) ---> i am not sure, this will work. Looks had the same effect.

super.skip(Math.min(n, in.available())); ---> This should work equally.

This message is automatically generated., Change looks good!  Final question though...  Is the sanity check on the skip bytes, at this level, masking another bug in the wrapped stream?, Oops...mistakenly forgot that sanity check back in previous patch.
Yes, that will be required, if n is negative, then underlying stream can throw IOE., Updated the correct one. thanks., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Ug, the patch is masking that the underlying stream will seek past the end of the file with no exception.  And it reports the position as past the end of the file., We've got a case of inconsistent semantics between {{ChecksumFileSystem}} and other filesystems. -- there's probably even more inconsistency within those other filesystems.  The issue is whether it's legitimate to seek and/or skip past EOF on a *read-only* file.  It's completely valid to seek/skip past EOF for a writable stream, but I struggle to see the value in a read-only stream going beyond EOF.

However, POSIX does say it's ok to seek off the end of any stream.  However, java's skip is supposed to return the actual number of bytes skipped.  Perhaps we should modify {{FSDataInputStream#skip}} to enforce consistency of not skipping past EOF?, I agreed with you. As this is to fix the test failures lets move this.
Can we please file separate JIRA to address complete consistency between ChecksumFileSystem and others.?
perhaps as that will be behavior change, we can continue discussion for long in that?, Else we have to revert the HADOOP-7998 until we finalize the behaviours correctly between the FileSystems.
With current behaviour, users will end up putting the checks whether fs is type of checksumfs or not.:(
Do you agree with me?, Let me take a stab at making a patch with only changes to {{ChecksumFileSystem}} that will not introduce behavioral changes., Sure. that's great!, Wrap a checksum stream, or real stream, with the existing skip/seek semantics.  This preserves the inconsistent behavior and should be completely backwards-compatible., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., There are no tests because it fixes broken tests., From looking at the patch it looks good, but since I am the one that reviewed and checked in the broken patch from HADOOP-7998 I am going to hold off giving it a +1 until I run all of the tests on common, HDFS, and mapreduce., When I ran all of the tests I got a couple of test failures. (Tests are still running but should be done soon).  All of them appear to be tests that fail intermittently, but I could not find any JIRAs for them.  Once the tests finish I will try to rerun them by themselves and if they pass I will check the code in and file JIRAs for these intermittent failures.
