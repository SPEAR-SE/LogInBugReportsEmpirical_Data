[Check for null value after looking up blocks (ie, no known node has the block). Should prevent the NPE. The correct value (no hints for unfound blocks) is returned., Bump: Any reason this patch hasn't been applied? It looks like it's still possible for non-found blocks to return null, causing an NPE in this function, rather than a more graceful recovery., Committed.  Sorry, this fell off my radar.  Thanks for the reminder.  I fixed something related in:

http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/hadoop/trunk/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/dfs/FSNamesystem.java?rev=382545&r1=377317&r2=382545

so I hadn't seen this problem.
