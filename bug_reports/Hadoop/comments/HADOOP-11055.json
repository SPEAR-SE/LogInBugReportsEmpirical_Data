[OK, this appears to be fairly easy to solve.  The big thing is that the pid file var needs to get sent to start_daemon so that it can write the pid file *before* launching java.  The exec will replace the running process with the java, but the pid should not change.  

This, however, means breaking/updating the params that get sent to start_daemon. Since this is an unreleased version, not a big deal., It's worth noting that _wrapper should keep its pid code since we are forking the java bit. This will replace that pid with the forked one., Isn't it safe to write the pid file inside the hadoop_start_daemon function since that is the process id of the pid file?, Yup, you are absolutely correct.  There's no point in keeping the pid write after the fork since it should write the exact same info anyway., * Fixes the error in secure_prereq to resemble English
* _daemon functions now write the pidfile on execution
* _wrapper functions now overwrite the pidfile with the proper post-fork pid
* Counter put in place to avoid a race condition with pid file creation vs. fork pid
* Cleaned up daemon related error messages
* Fixed disown to actually operate on the correct pid, Playing around, the $$ inside the &'d process is wrong for the daemonization case during the pid write. So [~pocky], we were both wrong after some experimentation! :D
