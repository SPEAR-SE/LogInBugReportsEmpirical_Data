[Attached patch introduced a JNI method being used by DataChecksum when running on Power PC. Also, variable buf is always converted to little endian in method crc32c_sb8 in bulk_crc32.c , Just hitted the same issue with ibm jdk.
Your patch seem to work ! Many thanks !

I was testing with pi / teragen on a single node cluster, hitting a checksum error at the launch of the job.
Now it runs fine., This patch resolves so many testcase errors and failures in PPC. This patch needs to be included in the upcoming release., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This patch resolves checksum errors in the existing tests. So no new tests are needed for this patch., Native code tends to get neglected as too few of us are up to date with any more. I'm correct in assuming that the {{htoleXX()}} operations are just no-op macros on x86? So do nothing whatsoever to the existing x86 code path?, -1

Looking at [http://code.metager.de/source/xref/gnu/glibc/bits/byteswap.h] to answer my own question.

with the transform defined in the hadoop code, {{htole32()}} is doing something on all platforms.

{code}
#define htole32(x)      (bswap_32(htonl(x)))
{code}

Yet I don't see it being needed on x86: after all, it's not there until then. So the patch is adding a fair amount of needless byteswapping.

The transform should go away entirely on a little endian part, with something like:

{code}
#if defined __LITTLE_ENDIAN
#  define htole32(x) (x)
#else
#  define htole32(x) (bswap_32(htonl(x)))
#endif
{code}
, also, {{byteswap.h}} isn't on windows ... which doesn't matter as it can use the no-op feature. the #ifdef logic is going to have to only include the file if it exists.

, Hi Steve,

   I agree with your comments. Modified the patch like you mentioned above., Hi Steve,
       I attached a new patch which deals with the windows env ( which is always Little Endian or atleast now ), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The Testcase failure seems to be unrelated to this patch., tests do appear unrelated.

# the patch looks good to me: specifically it's a no-op on x86
# I'd like one of the people who does more of the native code to review it; It's been too long since I did low-level C/C++ code to be trusted as a reviewer., Any update on this ?, I don't see anyone else looking at this.

I'll bring up my windows build setup in sync to verify this doesn't trigger regressions there. That's unlikely to be this week, Thank you Steve, Hi Ayappan, thanks for the patch, when validating on macosx, got compile error like:

{code}
     [exec] Building C object CMakeFiles/hadoop.dir/main/native/src/org/apache/hadoop/util/bulk_crc32.c.o

     [exec] 1 error generated.

     [exec] make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/hadoop.dir/all] Error 2
     [exec] make: *** [all] Error 2
{code}

I think a more standard way of handling byteorder stuff is needed(not only in this jira), like google did in many open sourced code bases:

https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/include/flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h

 , A new jira ( HADOOP-11665 ) has been opened to fix this issue in a more standard way., Not down as a blocker for 2.7, Not a blocker but it will be good if HADOOP-11665 make it to the 2.7 release. Thank You, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
