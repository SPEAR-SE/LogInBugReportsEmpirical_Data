This message is automatically generated., +1. I'll commit it shortly., Actually, [~chrili], can you move the test from hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/security to hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop? +1 once it is addressed., [~wheat9] is this what you mean? The test is now under the package org.apache.hadoop instead of org.apache.hadoop.security, Yes. It looks good to me. I'll commit it shortly., I've committed the patch to trunk and branch-2.
