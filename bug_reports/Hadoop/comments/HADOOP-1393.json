[replaces Math.abs(Random.nextInt()) with Random.nextInt(Integer.MAX_VALUE), Good fix. I am fixing 3 of these. I had replaced {{nextInt()}} with {{nextInt() & 0x7FFFFFFF}}.  But {{nextInt(Integer.MAX_VALUE)}} looks better.

I suggest we wait for couple of days before committing the findbugs fixes so that if different people are fixing similar issues, the fixes can be more consistent.
