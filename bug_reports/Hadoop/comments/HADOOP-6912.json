[Attaching a trivial patch. This change is already present in Y20S branch. Somehow it got left out during forward porting. , Could you please check whether the HDFS or MR builds break since you changed the signature of a public method that's probably used by these other projects... (I am guessing it shouldn't but do check)., I checked. This method is currently not used in either HDFS or MR trunk., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
