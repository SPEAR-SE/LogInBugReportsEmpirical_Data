[I hear you, but I'm afraid this is a huge incompatible change in behavior that would break things within Hadoop and outside that rely on this behavior. Given that I would close as WONT FIX., Agreed, it may be less cumbersome to change the API doc so that it documents the real behaviour. , I agree with tucu.  Let's change the documentation to reflect the current behavior.

It's not really clear that the new behavior being proposed here is better, anyway.  Given that you can specify system properties on the command-line, one nice use for the current behavior is being able to override things in the configuration file with a -Pfoo=bar switch on the command line.  If the configuration file took precedence, this would not be possible.

It's always going to be messy supporting overrides, and it's not clear why the configuration file "winning" is any more unintuitive than the other way around., er, that should read "it's not clear why the system property winning is any more unintuitive than the other way around"]
