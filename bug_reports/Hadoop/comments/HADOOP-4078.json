[Lohit, you modified this test yesterday. Can you look at this? Thanks!, I am unable to reproduce this on MAC.

    [junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.fs.kfs.TestKosmosFileSystem
    [junit] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.804 sec

Will try to get hold of some other box to test this out., I also cannot reproduce it in Windows and Linux., TestKosmosFileSystem fails in Hudson build #3190.
See http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/3190/testReport/, When the full test suite is run, this fails becuase of some previous test cases not cleaning up test.build.data.
Fixed to use its own directory which will be deleted after testing., Thanks Nicholas for testing this on windows and linux, Should the patch be
{code}
+        baseDir = new Path(System.getProperty("test.build.data", "/tmp"), "kfs-test");
