[Small test case to interrupt a thread, catch the Exception and perform an HDFS file open.

$ hadoop jar target/*.jar -i <hdfs-file>, This backtrace was observed with hive+hdfs & derby throwing interrupted exceptions., Actually, it would also be great to actually propagate the interrupt.  It's very annoying right now that the client cannot be interrupted.  For example, if you run a FsShell command while the NN is down, you can pound on control-c but the client ignores the exception and keeps retrying the connect.]
