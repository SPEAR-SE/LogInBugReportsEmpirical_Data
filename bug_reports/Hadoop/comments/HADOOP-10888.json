This message is automatically generated., This failure is most likely a test machine misconfiguration. The callstack shows a timeout in getLocalHostName.

{code}, I started a mail thread on commons-dev. Hopefully someone with Jenkins admin access will take a look., Thanks Arpit!

My two attempts here indicated that even increasing timeout to 5 minutes still get stuck at the same method means something to look at 
java.net.Inet4AddressImpl.getLocalHostName (see my comments in HDFS-6588 {{Yongjun Zhang added a comment - Today 16:11}}.

I did some search earlier and found an old post (2003-10-17)
http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4939977
it's pretty old but also points to some possible OS (config) issue. Unfortunately there is no follow-up there.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Arpit,

I posted the following message to the discussion thread you started. I wonder if you have insight here, thanks a lot.
{quote}
I did a test run which dumped /etc/hosts and reported hostname info:

YJD /etc/hosts contents:

  127.0.0.1	localhost
     asf900.ygridcore.net       asf900
  # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
  ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
  ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
  ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

YJD hostname contents:
  asf900

(see HADOOP-10888 
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/4362//testReport/, 
the host is Slave H0 (Build slave for Hadoop project builds : asf900.gq1.ygridcore.net)
)

I see hostname "asf900" in "127.0.0.1" row for IPv4  but I don't see it in the "::1" row for IPv6 in /etc/hosts file. I wonder if adding "asf900" as an entry to "::1" row would make it work. The method stuck at is java.net.Inet4AddressImpl.getLocalHostName (IPv4) though.

, Somehow I got a typo in the paste, repaste the dump from the debug run:
{code}
YJD /etc/hosts contents:
127.0.0.1	localhost
   asf900.ygridcore.net       asf900

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

YJD hostname contents:
asf900
{code}
where "asf900" is the result of "hostname" command. 
, Is there a newline here in the hosts file? That looks wrong.

{code}
127.0.0.1	localhost
   asf900.ygridcore.net       asf900
{code}, Thanks Arpit, very good catch! that newline is from the file!



, HI [~gkesavan], 

The host that has the extra newline in /etc/hosts has your signature, 
{code}
 Slave H0 (Build slave for Hadoop project builds : asf900.gq1.ygridcore.net)
Created by gkesavan
{code}
would you please take a look? 

BTW, I checked hosts H0-H<x>, seems all created by you, so doing the same check for all of them is necessary because the test failed on different slaves before and they may have the same problem.

Thanks a lot.
, Filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-8097 per [~ted_yu]'s suggestion in email discussion thread. Thanks., Thanks [~gkesavan] for fixing INFRA-8097, uploaded the test patch to verify.

This message is automatically generated., The latest test is run on the same Slave H0 (Build slave for Hadoop project builds : asf900.gq1.ygridcore.net), and it's passing. I'm closing this jira.

Thanks both [~arpitagarwal] and [~gkesavan]  for the help!
