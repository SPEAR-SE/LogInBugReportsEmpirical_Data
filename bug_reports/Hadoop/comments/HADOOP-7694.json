[We might consider either special casing calls to {{toString}}, since it is probably the most likely non-interface method to be called, or doing something to transparently pass through invocations to the underlying object if the method isn't declared as part of the interface which is implemented by this RPC proxy., It crops up a lot in debuggers that auto toString() things...these should never fail. FWIW SmartFrog's toString() code splits up into a local (proxy side, should not fail) and a remote operation that provides whatever real string stuff that the endpoint choses to provide, and which can throw RemoteExceptions when called. The former gives you a hint about the endpoint, the latter about remote state -with the caveat that you are doing an RPC round trip that may fail]
