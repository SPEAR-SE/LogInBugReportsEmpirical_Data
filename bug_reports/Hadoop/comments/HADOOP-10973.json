Thanks for adding me as a contributor, I appreciate it. Is there any further involvement required from me as the reporter in the issue management process? I have confirmed that the source code has been updated in trunk and branch-2, I just canâ€™t see any documentation advising me as to whether there is any further step I should take as the reporter, e.g., close the issue.

 

Regards,

 

Peter
