[changing script that compiles proto files to handle cywin and windows version of protoc which does not handle UNIX style paths.

Note that hadoop-yarn-common is failing in windows but this is not related to the proto compilation but to the saveVersion.sh script, MAPREDUCE-3540 ., patch tested on win7, osx, ubuntu, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Just verified the patch, it works fine for me except mapred compilation failure due to saveVersion.sh problem.
mvn eclipse:eclipse also works fine for common and hdfs. Also imported into eclipse. 

Thanks Alejandro, for the patch. Looks good to me.

+1 from my side.

Why patch command failed in Jenkins? do you have idea? ( is it because of cross projects? ), +1 the patch looks good., Thanks for the patch Alejandro, it works. , committed to trunk and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #283 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/283/])

, Hi Alejandro,

looks CHANGES.txt has typo mistake.

{quote}HADOOP_7917. compilation of protobuf files fails in windows/cygwin. (tucu){quote}

issue id should have "-" instead of "_".

Thanks
Uma, Uma,

Thanks for pointing this out, I'll piggyback on the next commit I do to fix the typo.

Alejandro, Hello, I downloaded 0.24.0 and tried to build under Windows/Cygwin.
Proto file compilation still seems to fail.  I'm running mvn from within Cygwin though, not windows command prompt.
And if I switch around the true and false logic for IS_WIN variable, it works fine.

Is this by design??  Your clarification would be much helpful!!  :)]
