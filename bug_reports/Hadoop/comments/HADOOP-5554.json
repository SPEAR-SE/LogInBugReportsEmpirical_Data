[This patch makes both CreateEditsLog and DataNodeCluster to create blocks with generation stamp GenerationStamp#FIRST_VALID_STAMP., +1, This patch changes tools for manual tests.  I think we don't have junit for these test tools.  So, I suggest to do some manual tests instead of waiting for Hudson., I have tested the patch manually., This is a patch for 0.19., I have committed this to 0.19 and above.  Thanks, Hairong!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #789 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/789/])
    . DataNodeCluster and CreateEditsLog should create blocks with the same generation stamp value. (hairong via szetszwo)
