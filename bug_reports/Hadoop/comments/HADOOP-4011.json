[To prevent premature re-execution of maps, the back off between two retries is currently set to MAP_RUN_TIME/2 and the reducer will intimate JT of failure on three READ_TIME_OUT FAILURES. The back off logic, as it exists now,  unfortunately does not take the load of the system into consideration. , This should no longer be seen as we reverted back HADOOP-3327. 
Runping, can you confirm if you have observed similar behavior in recent times? As per the current code, the retry should be almost immediate (4 seconds), This is no longer an issue]
