[I dont think mapred.jobtracker.retirejob.interval is killing long running reduce task, since mapred.jobtracker.retirejob.interval retires only completed jobs. It is mapred.userlog.retain.hours configuration, whose default is set to 24 hours, killing long running task. I could reproduce the scenario you explained, by configuring mapred.userlog.retain.hours to 1hr, and running tasks more than an hour. , thanks for that I forgot that I did change that setting too should I create a new issue or edit this one?
