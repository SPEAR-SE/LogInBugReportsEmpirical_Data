[The license is in NOTICE.txt, It seems the license of Bouncy Castle changed from MIT License to Bouncy Castle License some time ago. The license mentioned in NOTICE.txt states Bouncy Castle is licensed under MIT License., It looks like the license was the same in the previous (really really old) version of BouncyCastle that we were using:
https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk16/1.46/jar

HADOOP-15832 added the bcpkix artifact (we used to only have the bcprov artifact) and maybe that's what triggered this?  It looks like it's only complaining about that artifact.  

As [~stevel@apache.org] said, the license, which applies to both artifacts, is mentioned in the NOTICE.txt.  
And as for ASF compatibility, the Bouncy Castle License is identical to the MIT license (not sure why they didn't just use MIT), so it should be fine.

https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT, I checked the so called "Bouncy Castle License" is literally the same as MIT license â€“ character by character.]
