This message is automatically generated., Patch looks pretty good to me. One suggestion: In the places in the test where you catch expected exceptions, use {{GenericTestUtils#assertExceptionContains}} to ensure that you're catching the exception you expect., I should've said: +1 once this is addressed., Thanks for the review Aaron!

I added the checks on the expected exceptions, and reran {{TestDFVariation}} and {{TestNamenodeCapacityReport}} successfully., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
