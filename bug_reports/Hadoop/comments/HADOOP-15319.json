[First of all 2.5 _is not_ a recent hadoop version.
It was released approximately 4 years ago.

Below results are from cluster running almost recent 2.8 release.
bq. When we execute "hadoop fs -rm /a/b/c/*" or "hdfs dfs -rm /a/b/c/*"
It deleted only the files directly under {{c directory}} and didn't delete any directories underneath {{c directory}}.

Sorry, My bad - It is related to 2.8.2 version.

When we are using {color:#14892c}*"hadoop fs -rm /a/b/c/" or "hdfs dfs -rm /a/b/c/*{color}{color:#14892c}*"*{color} it gives error - ''{color:#d04437}c is a directory{color}"

But when we tried to execute

*"hadoop fs -rm /a/b/c/*" or "hdfs dfs -rm /a/b/c/*"* the 'c' directory also gets deleted

Whereas in 2.4.x version it was not deleting 'c' instead of it was only deleting the files inside c., We have seen several cases where our customer don't quote the path and uses glob in the path.
We always ask our customer to put quote around the path.
Can you please see what happens if you run the following command.
{noformat}
hadoop fs -rm "/a/b/c/*"
{noformat}
Please note that the above line is in noformat tag. , [~shahrs87]

We execute the command 

 
{noformat}
hadoop fs -rm "/a/b/c/*"
{noformat}
Still facing the similar issues in the 2.8.2 version. But in case of "/a/b/c/" It is unable to remove the files. That's the reason we use "/*" which removes everything inside the directory.

 , {noformat}hadoop fs -rm -r /a/b/c/{noformat} can remove the directory., [~saurabhpadhy]: Can you create some sample files and directories and post the result of {{hadoop fs -ls}} before and after the rm command.
 Also post the {{out stream}} after you run the {{rm}} command.

I am not able to reproduce the error that you are seeing.
That way I will replicate the same directory structure on my side and will run the exact same commands that you will run.
Please don't forget to quote the path on {{ls}} and {{rm}} commands.
