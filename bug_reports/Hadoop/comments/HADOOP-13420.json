[Had the same problem with Ubuntu 16.04, I have downgraded to 14.04. Was working for me. Please check the following link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38548004/hadoop-standalone-instance-exits-during-executing-an-mr-job-with-expiredtokenrem, Yes, I noticed the issue is with only Ubuntu 16.04, not with Ubuntu 14.04.
Thanks.]
