[My NameNode is running at simon:8020. I have the following in my core-site.xml:

Whereas trying to make a directory directly via HDFS works as expected., Here's a patch which addresses the issue. The crux of the problem was two separate off-by-one errors in ChRootedFileSystem. Since to test this requires that we be able to mount and futz with files/directories at the root of the target file system, I put the test to exercise this in HDFS., Mind uploading a HADOOP-only patch so test-patch can run? I'll review the combined patch., Patch looks reasonable. Can you add some comments to the new test that explain what exactly it's doing? It's really hard to follow, what with the test inheritance going on., Thanks a lot for the review, Todd. Here's an updated patch which adds some comments to the new test., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Aaron - Do you mind either filing a JIRA to fix the corresponding AbstractFileSystem based filesystems (ChRootedFs, ViewFs etc) for the same issue, or if its easy, fixing it in this patch? 
I will review this patch and post my comments shortly., The current patch looks reasonable to me. +1 as long as the ChRootedFs concern is addressed. Thanks for fixing this Aaron., Thanks a lot for the review, John. I'm not actually sure that ChRootedFs has the same issue, but I'm happy to look into that possibility later today. At a minimum, it would be good to add a test similar to the one added here for ChRootedFs/ViewFs., Just trying to understand the patch overall.  I'm a bit confused by this code that's not in your patch, but related to it:
{code}
chRootPathPart = new Path(uri.getPath());
chRootPathPartString = chRootPathPart.toUri().getPath();
{code}

Why is it running a uri path through {{Path}} just to get the path again?, Here's an updated patch which makes all the same changes to the FileContext side of the house. Indeed, the same two off-by-one errors were present in ChRootedFs as well.

bq. Why is it running a uri path through Path just to get the path again?

Because {{URI#getPath()}} returns a {{String}}, not a {{Path}} object. We probably could just assign {{chRootPathPartString}} to {{uir.getPath()}}, but that might drop any mangling that the {{Path}} constructor is doing., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Despite being in a related part of the code, I'm fairly confident that the test failure is unrelated. The two Javadoc warnings are known issues, and I believe the findbugs warning is spurious: HADOOP-8354, Appreciate you fixing this in the same JIRA Aaron. +1, +1 The handling still feels a bit cluttered, but at least it works!, +1, Thanks a lot for the reviews, John, Daryn, and Todd.
