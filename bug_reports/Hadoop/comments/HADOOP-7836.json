[Patch to disable this case for the time being.

Looks like the branch-1 test for hose-based tokens wasn't forward ported to trunk so no need to update anything there., This appears to be indicative of a bug that will affect host-based tokens.  I'll look into it today, but if we can't fix it quickly then I guess we can disable and file a followup jira.  Do you know if this issue only occurs in 1.1, or earlier 1.x releases too?, Actually, the test is flawed.  It's using the address the rpc server is reporting to set the service.  However, it is the client's responsibility to set the token service since the server has no way to know exactly what hostname/ip the client used.

Eli, please see if this fixes the issue for you., +1  looks good, I've committed this, thanks Daryn!

Do we need a jira for the same test forward ported to trunk?, I haven't checked but if trunk is indeed missing these tests -- and it's not that they moved? -- then yes we need to port to trunk., I looked at the trunk test and the forward port didn't add any new tests to this class, couldn't tell if that was on purpose (ie they're covered elsewhere)., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
