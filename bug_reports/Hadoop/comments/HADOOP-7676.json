[this patch adds rule for hm and rs to the core-site template, +1 looks good.  This patch enables to run HBase as HDFS user until HBase has improved security in handling /hbase as another owner., I just committed to 0.20.205 branch, thanks Eric, I thought we were wrapping up 205. I am sure there is a good reason why it is needed for 205, but would you care to share it here?, This patch enables HBase 0.90.x with keroberos setup to run on secure Hadoop 0.20.205+ with defined host key tabs for HBase master and HBase Region server.]
