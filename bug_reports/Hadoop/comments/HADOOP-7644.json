This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch., I just committed this to 205 and 20s. The trunk patch will go in with MAPREDUCE-2764., The two tests have been failing even after the commit of the patch.
Since no other bug has been filed to follow up with this, I am reopening this jira., I missed one of the files in the commit to subversion, which I've just fixed. Does it work for you?, Thanks Owen! Now the two tests are passing.
I will close this Jira., Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0]
