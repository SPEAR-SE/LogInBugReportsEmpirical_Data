[In the attached patch, I removed the thread doing the taskReportServer.stop(). Instead the TaskTracker.close() stops the taskReportServer inline (this is anyway required for the case where the config for the TaskTracker specifies the RPC port as some non-zero number)., +1, All tests including test-patch passed on my machine. Committed this., It would be nice if somebody can comment if this affects 0.17 and 0.18 as well., Yes it does affect those versions as well., Hi Devaraj, If this affects 0.19 as well, does it need to be commtted into that branch as well?, Ok I committed this to 0.19 branch too.., Thanks Devaraj, for committing this into 0.19., I committed this to the 0.18 branch too.]
