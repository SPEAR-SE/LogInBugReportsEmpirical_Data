[This test was first seen failing on Jan 04, 2008 (see HADOOP-2524). Since this JIRA has the latest information, I am going to mark HADOOP-2524 as a DUP of this one., build-369-TestEditLog.txt : contains the output of this failed test from the console.

Konstantin and I looked at this and it looks like disk sync was very slow during this test. We don't know if there is some other reason, but a very slow or busy partition could cause this.

Not sure if this is related to TestDFSStorageStateRecovery failures., More regd TestEditLog : even when it passes, it came dangerously close to the limit, 8 minutes :

For Hudson, we might have to reduce the number of transaction in this test.

Actually this was not common till build #366 or so.. the test used to take 1-2 min in earlier builds. may be the Hudson got busier?, I think these problems are related to the slowness of the mounted disk drive.
In case of TestEditLog name-node is supposed to make 100,000 transactions and synchronize them to disk.
And this takes more than 10 minutes with less than a half of transaction completed. 
Here is the relevant part of the log:

In case of TestDFSStorageStateRecovery the name-node tries to recover from the aborted rollback, which means 
it needs to rename some directories. And this also takes more than a minute and causes the test to timeout.

Could anyone please check the partition Hundson uses for storage directories., Could we simply decrease the value of TestEditLog.numberTransactions to 500, or even 200?  I did that in my local copy for saving time., > Could we simply decrease the value of TestEditLog.numberTransactions to 500, or even 200? I did that in my local copy for saving time.

Before we do this probably its better to know what changed on Hudson. This slowness would affect pretty much everything that Hudson does..., Perhaps this is causing the slowness:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-1460? 
focusedCommentId=12557402#action_12557402




, I see that the hudson tests run on a machine that shows that lots of swap space is being used:

Memory: 16G real, 5912M free, 13G swap in use, 30G swap free

Can somebody please check if these machines are really swapping user processes (this could cause test runs to slow down drastically)?, Also, a "iostat -xc 5" on the test machine yields:

sd19     92.8   99.4  237.9  430.5  0.0 14.7   76.6   0 100

which means that device sd19 has a service wait time of 76 ms and 100% busy (this is very very bad)., Marking it as resolved since I have not seen it in the recent builds]
