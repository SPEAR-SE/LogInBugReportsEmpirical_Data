[Thanks Robert for creating the jira, I'm assigning to myself per our discussion. 
, Many thanks to [~rkanter] for the discussion and debugging together. Attached patch version 001, to fix the logic in KerberosAuthenticator, such that if branch A is executed, also check the token type, and fallback when the token type is not kerberos or kerberos-dt.

Hi Robert, I tested the patch against both secure and non-secure oozie server. Would you please take a look at the patch? Thanks.

This message is automatically generated., This looks good.  It now checks for an OK and that the delegation token is a kerberos token.  And even though you moved some things around, it looks like you maintained the same API so it should be backwards compatible.  Though I think it would be good to add some tests for the AuthToken class; if we already had tests for AuthenticationToken, you can probably reuse them here.  I know you tested it manually, but if possible, it would be good to have a test that passes a non-kerberos token to the KerberosAuthenticator and check that it doesn't accept it.

+1 from me after the tests.  Because we've had a lot of trouble with this area, I'd like to get more than one reviewer on this.  Perhaps [~atm]?, Thanks a lot [~rkanter], I will follow up to address your  comments asap.
, Hi [~rkanter],

I uploaded rev 002 to address your comments:

1. Added TestAuthToken.java to test out AuthToken. Added test for valid and invalid token string; Redundant tests in TestAuthenticationToken are removed. 

2. I did not manage to get a testcase to return non-kerberos token from {{conn.connect()}} in KerberosAuthenticator#authenticate; I guess this is probably why we did not see this kind of token returned in the oozie test. Any more suggestion is appreciated.

Thanks.

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~daryn],

You were in the discussion of HADOOP-10398 and provided quite some insightful input, would you please help taking a look at the patch here?

This jira is similar to HADDOPO-10398, but we want to support that when the server side is PseudoAuthentocationHandler, and when oozie.authentication.simple.anonymous.allowed is true, we want to be able to fallback to PseudoAuthenticator at client side.
Right now the branch A (see the description of this jira) succeeds with HTTP_OK, so no fallback. This is what this jira tries to fix.

I have tested that once I set oozie.authentication.simple.anonymous.allowed to false, then branch A will fail, and it will fallback.

Thanks a lot.
, Nits: 
# A new variable httpok is not required, we could just use the condition directly.
# The if-condition and return seems very complicated and hard to read. Is there a way to simplify this more? , HI [~kasha],

Thanks a lot, nice nits! Uploaded rev 003 to address them.

, One question, why we need to have {{AuthToken}} instead of modifying original {{AuthenticationToken}}? , Hi [~hitliuyi], Thanks for the question.

The reason is, we need the token-parsing functionality in {{KerberosAuthenticator}}, which is a client side class. However,  {{AuthenticationToken}} is a server side class. So what I did is to put the common code to {{AuthToken}} in util area, and let it be shared by both client and server side. 

Hope that makes sense to you. Please let me know if you have any concern. Thanks.
