[This patch fixes the problem by setting the HADOOP_CONF_DIR earlier in the script., Shouldn't we also make similar changes in the other scripts that source hadoop-env.sh?

Also, wouldn't it be cleaner to assign & default HADOOP_CONF_DIR in a separate line, rather than as a side-effect the first time its used?

Finally, why kill the comment about CLASSPATH?

of course. I just missed the fact that they had similar mistakes in them.

I was just trying to copy your style, since it was your script.

After the conditional assignment was removed, it seemed like a "add one to x" type comment.
A better comment would be:

# The configuration directory needs to be first in the classpath so that the config files are found by the 
# classloader.
, It's not my script, it's *our* script!  Which do you think is the better style?  I don't think I wrote that line anyway...]
