[Attached is the patch - this starts a single thread that does progress reporting for the entire map phase. Also made taskProgress as volatile since that is read/updated by multiple threads., Oops.. had attached the wrong patch earlier. This is the correct one., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12347767/846-correct.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r489707., The status thread is not cleaned up if the merge throws an exception. I think it should probably look like:

try {
  runner.run(...);
  ... merge code ...
} finally {
  in.close();
  collector.close();
  sortProgress.interrupt();
}

so that if run() throws, the merge code won't run. But if the merge code throws then the cleanup is still done.

, Thanks for the review Owen. Attached is the modified patch., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12348190/846.new.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r492232., +1, I just committed this.  Thanks, Devaraj!]
