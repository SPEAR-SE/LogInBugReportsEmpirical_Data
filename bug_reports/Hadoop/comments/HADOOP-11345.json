[The idea here is that {{find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)}} should be setting {{OPENSSL_LIBRARIES}} to the correct value for your platform, and using {{target_link_libraries}} should be adding the correct {{\-l}} flag to the linker line.  As-is, it looks like it's adding {{\-lssl}}, but that is not working for you.

I am using openSUSE 12.3 with no problems, what version are you using?  I am on x86, though.

It's hard to think of fixes here that doesn't involve rewriting that {{find_package}} script, which I'd really like to avoid.  There may be some options we can pass to the {{find_package}} script?

It's also a little concerning that we are linking openSSL statically into {{libhadooppipes.a}}.  It would be nice to get rid of the static library build altogether... can someone who is still using libhadooppipes speak up?, Hi Colin
My colleague Cesar who is facing this issue is using: openSUSE 13.2 ppc64 .
He planned to redo his attemps on a second openSUSE machine. Asking him what are the results.
I've tried to have a look at this CMake find-package() routine, but I'm not able to understand. Is it defined in:
    /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake ?
It looks to be a fundamental tool. I'm surprised that it generates an issue like it does.]
