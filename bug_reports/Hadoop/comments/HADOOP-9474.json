[Someone should consider back-porting the post 1.x FsShell.  It fixes virtually all of the issues that are being reported in 1.x.  I would expect the new FsShell to practically be a drop-in replacement, although it's consistent behavior and posix compliance will introduce some incompatibilities., I don't think it is an issue. This behavior is in sync with Unix way. Your cannot copy files to a non-existing directory but you can copy a directory to another path:
{code}$ cp mydir/* fakedir
usage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file target_file
       cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file ... target_directory
$ cp mydir/* existingdir
$ ls existingdir/
1	2
$ cp -r mydir/ fakedir; ls fakedir
1	2{code}
