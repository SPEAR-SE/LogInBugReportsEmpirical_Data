Console output: http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/438/console, I've been using ec2-api-tools-1.2-7546 (the previous release I think - the one you're using came out a couple of weeks ago). I'll see if your patch fixes the problem using both versions of the tools.

BTW which OS are you using?, Great, thanks!

I'm using Ubuntu 7.04., Included in HADOOP-1635.]
