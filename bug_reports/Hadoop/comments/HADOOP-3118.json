[Could briefly describe the fix, though the patch looks simple? Should this be fixed for 0.17?, The new disk format stores open lease for files that were being written to. When a old disk format is upgraded to the new format, the values inside the lease were not initialised. For example, the name of the client that holds the lease was erroneously set to null., 0.17? Yes!, I applied this patch to the same set up that had the previous NPE and got another one :

not sure if these are related.
, Dhruba, can you set the Affects Version field?, This affects version 0.17. However, the drop-down list for "Affects version" does not yet have a 0.17 value., Hi Raghu, The earlier patch had a bug that caused locations of the last block of the file (that is stored in the lease) to be stored as null.
