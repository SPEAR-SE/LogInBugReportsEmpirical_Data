[This could be a workaround for HADOOP-2606., Make the Replication Monitor periodicity configurable. The default value of 3 seconds remains the same as before., +1 The patch looks good to me. 

It would be nicer if the replication monitor can adjust its frequency dynamically. It slows itself down when the namenode becomes busy and replicates more aggressively when the namenode becomes idle.
