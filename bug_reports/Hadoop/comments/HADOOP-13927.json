[Hi [~jzhuge], this error started appearing after HADOOP-13900. After reverting the {{azure-data-lake-store-sdk}} version to {{2.0.4-SNAPSHOT}} the error went away., The test failed with SDK {{2.1.1}} as well., {{AdlFileSystem#delete}} calls {{ADLSStoreClient#enumerateDirectory}} with {{maxEntriesToRetrieve}} set to 1. So I experimented the value 0 and 2, both fixed the issue! Please note the unit test created 2 entries in the root.

I suspect ADLS REST server has a subtle bug for this query {{op=LISTSTATUS&listSize=1&api-version=2016-11-01}}, while ok for the following strings:
* {{op=LISTSTATUS&api-version=2016-11-01}}
* {{op=LISTSTATUS&listSize=2&api-version=2016-11-01}}
* {{op=LISTSTATUS&listSize=1&api-version=2015-10-01-preview}} which is the query string used by {{2.0.4-SNAPSHOT}} SDK

Engaging Microsoft to investigate., Microsoft confirmed it is a backend bug. Its fix will not need SDK change., [~jzhuge] and [~twu] for the analysis. I will confirm once the fix is reflected in the backend., The test no longer fails so the backend is probably fixed., Thanks for confirming [~jzhuge]. Closing this issue., Thanks [~vishwajeet.dusane].

Do you think {{Fixed}} is the correct state? According to help, {{Fixed}} means "A fix for this issue is checked into the tree and tested." In this case, Hadoop source tree is not changed., Thanks [~jzhuge], i was also in 2 state on what should be right state to put between {{Delivered}} or {{Fixed}}. I suppose you are referring to mark as {{Delivered}} in this case?, {{Delivered}} sounds good.]
