[This patch uses the same directory for the final outputs in the case that there is a single spill. It also adds some logging so you can understand if (and why) the mapper's sort spilled., Should this be fixed in 0.17?, > Should this be fixed in 0.17? 

Is it a regression?
, +1 Looks good. Some of the logging could be at the debug level, particularly the logging in the synchronized section of BlockingBuffer.Buffer::write, but it shouldn't be a real issue.

bq. Is it a regression?

No; it looks pretty ancient, but if there's a 0.17.1, including this would only make things better., Port to 0.17, if we need it., I just committed this. Thanks, Owen, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #511 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/511/])]
