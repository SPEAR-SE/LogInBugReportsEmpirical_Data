[This attached cleanups http://www.shellcheck.net/ for dev-support/create-release.sh.

Is there a recommended way to validate these scripts?

Thanks, \\

This message was automatically generated., create-release.sh is one of the few that hasn't gotten rewritten yet.  It really needs a complete overhaul. So ironically, it's probably the one I'd recommend skipping. :D

We don't have unit tests for the shell code yet.  (There's a JIRA for that though.) So the best way to do this is to use the docker stuff to get a dev environment. This will give you a place to run test-patch.sh against any patch you build using 0.3.7 of shellcheck.

From there, it's just run shellcheck against everything bash and fix the errors.  Most of the errors that are left are relatively minor things or just need to get the check disabled (hint: anything with ${HADOOP_OPTS} is a disable, since we really do want it to split on ${IFS}.), \\

This message was automatically generated., I'm going to clean them up as part of adding the unit tests.  See HADOOP-10854 as an example.

Thanks.]
