[The patch introduced a "force-mode" property which is off by default. Can be turned on with -Dforce-mode=true., force-mode may not be the best name for the option as it doesn't say anything about ivy.  How about something like force-ivy-resolution.  More descriptive names are better, even if they are longer., How about force-resolve (ivy is an impl detail.)? it's only useful to use with resolvers=internal anyway., I'm ok with force-resolve, -1 overall.

I'm going to go ahead and commit this, HDFS-1544, and MAPREDUCE-2222, unless there are objections., I've just committed this.
