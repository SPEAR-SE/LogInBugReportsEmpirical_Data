[This short program illustrates the problem. The {{failing()}} method will terminate with an OutOfMemoryException. This occurs quickly with native libs enabled and less quickly (more iterations of the loop) with native libs disabled - but both of these leak., Aaron, this is not a bug, you should use DefaultCodec.createOutputStream(OutputStream out, Compressor compressor)., How is it not a bug that this leaks memory? If there is a preferred API which works correctly, then this one should be marked as deprecated and eventually removed., DefaultCodec.createOutputStream(OutputStream out) would be useful when you do not use native compression library. Otherwise, a direct buffer would be created and leaked. The problem with direct buffer is that it is not accounted under garbage collection and thus you may exhaust the memory yet does not trigger gc., If this method should not be called, and there is a preferred method, then this one should at least log a warning informing the user that he's calling a bad API. Attached is a patch which explains the situation.
