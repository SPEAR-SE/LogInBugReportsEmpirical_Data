[test-patch.sh does the following in checkout() method.
"
   $SVN revert -R .
    rm -rf `$SVN status --no-ignore`
    $SVN update
"

This makes sure that any .xml files in conf directory is deleted and updated from .template .

test-patch.sh first runs the tests on trunk . This results in generation of these xml files again in conf directory , hence when patch is applied the new template file changes 
are not copied to existing xml file , this results in test case failures .
, I think this had to be addressed in the build.xml, perhaps we can make the ant clean target to remove the xml files., bq. I think this had to be addressed in the build.xml, perhaps we can make the ant clean target to remove the xml files.

I am not sure if this is the right solution. We don't overwrite xml files in the conf folder because they may have user configured values. It seems to me this is only a problem in the build setup. Hence, Rahul's solution of removing the ignored files after applying the patch in test-patch.sh seems fine to me., attaching the patch which cleans up the conf/*.xml for template files, What happens if there are user xml files in conf?  Would these files be deleted by test-patch.sh?, Patch only delete files , if they have  corresponding template files.
, I think this patch is fine, except, I think this should be done only if its being run on HUDSON. That will keep parity with what is done in the checkout method and thus not cause side effects to developers using test-patch. Rahul, since we can't run this patch itself through hudson, can you please make sure that test-patch is functional when used with projects like map-reduce and then I can commit it  to unblock MAPREDUCE-861 ?, Attaching the new patch with hemanth's comments., Attaching a new patch that just formats the new method as per convention. I ran test-patch locally with a Map/Reduce patch and verified it still works fine. Will commit the patch based on this., I committed this to trunk.
