This message was automatically generated., Hi Duo.  Here are a few comments on this patch.

I'd also appreciate getting a second code review on this one.  [~ivanmi] or [~chuanliu], would you like to take a look?

# When catching {{InterruptedException}}, we need to re-raise the interrupted signal in case any code that called into this layer relies on seeing the interrupted status, such as daemon shutdown logic.  To do this, call {{Thread.currentThread().interrupt()}} inside the {{catch}} block.  Also, please use the {{LOG}} if you want to print information about the exception.  {{e.printStackTrace()}} would go to stderr.
# I think the {{continue}} on line 2485 is unnecessary.  Can you please remove it?
# Inside the retry loop, there is some code duplication for {{else}} paths to {{throw ex}}.  I think we can cut one of these code paths by changing the conditional to this:
{code}
if (ex.getErrorCode().equals(
    StorageErrorCode.SERVER_BUSY.toString()) &&
    retryCount < copyBlobMaxRetries) {
{code}
# It would be great too if we could eliminate the code duplication caused by multiple calls to {{dstBlob.startCopyFromBlob}}: once to get started and a second time in the exception handler.  This isn't directly related to the current patch, but let me know if you have any thoughts on cleaning this up.
, [~cnauroth] Thanks for all these suggestions. I have changed the code to call startCopyFromBlob from only one place. 

[~ivanmi]  Please also take a look., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks for looping me in Chris, Duo. Will take a look tonight., +1 for patch v03.  Thank you, Duo!  I'll hold off on the commit in case Ivan wants to comment., After further investigation, [~ivanmi] and [~onpduo] traced this to a problem in the Azure Storage Java SDK.  It would be incorrect to add throttling logic at the Hadoop layer on top of what the SDK is supposed to provide already, so we're going to resolve this without committing any Hadoop code changes.

Duo and Ivan, thank you for your efforts investigating this.]
