[Submitted a patch that adds missing licenses to Java, HTML, jsp, jr, xsl and a few config files. I tried to maintain the same format as trunk., Patch looks good to me. Tom, do you want take a quick look or run a RAT report with this patch?, Attaching a file that lists files that are flagged as missing license headers. 

Before the patch:
{noformat}
releaseaudit:
     [java] 
     [java] *****************************************************
     [java] Summary
     [java] -------
     [java] Notes: 33

     [java] Generated files do not required license headers
     [java] 
     [java] 493 Unknown Licenses
{noformat}

With the patch:
{noformat}
releaseaudit:

+1 for the patch. It reduces the number of warnings. I am going to commit this in a day or two. 

I do not think it is worth the effort fixing the rest of the files to get the warning down to zero., +1. Thanks, Arpit., I committed the patch to trunk-1.

Thank you Arpit!, I did not examine each of the ~380 remaining files that release-audit is flagging as unlicensed but I believe most of them are either:
1. Auto-generated.
2. Test output files.
3. Files that have a non-Apache licence e.g. sorttable.js
