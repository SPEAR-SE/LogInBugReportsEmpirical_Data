[This patch fixes the timeouts by creating a synchronized queue (we really should go to java 1.5 soon) of tasks that need to be cleaned up and a daemon thread that does it in the background.

It also fixes some race conditions in the TaskTracker on the tasks variable. (Some references where locking the TaskTracker and others were locking the TaskTracker.TaskInProgress.)

I also changed the rpc logging a little to include both client and server time measurements., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
