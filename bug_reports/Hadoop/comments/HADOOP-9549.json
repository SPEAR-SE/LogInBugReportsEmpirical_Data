{panel}, The synchronize around queue.take() was added by HADOOP-9049. , This also bug prevents the use of multiple webhdfs instances since the 2nd blocks when a token is acquired., Should we revert HADOOP-9049 or make an additional change on top of it to fix the issue?, I've almost got a patch ready, Bug is actually in the less-than-ideal token renewer in common that is bolted onto hftp and webhdfs., The problem is the unnecessary synchronization on the thread-safe DelayQueue.  The daemon thread synched while trying to take from the queue.  This manifested as two problems:
# After creating a filesystem, the thread was blocked waiting for the token in the queue to be ready for renewal.  Closing the fs and removing the token blocked on the queue waiting for the thread to renew the token.  It would have "worked" when the token renewed after about 21 hours...
# Creating another webhdfs and/or hftp instance would block trying to add its token to the queue while the thread waited for the 1st fs token to be ready for renewal.

The synch on the queue was to allow removal of tokens by iterating the queue.  The queue needed to be iterated, versus calling {{remove}}, because the {{RenewAction}} objects improperly implemented {{hashCode}} and {{equals}}.

I had a much cleaner overall implementation but it required changes to webhdfs and hftp.  This patch should be good enough for now.  I also added a bunch of missing tests., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
