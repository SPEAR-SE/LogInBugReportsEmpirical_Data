[This environment variable exists - JOB_TOKEN_FILE. In this jira, we should read the contents of the file via TokenCache's APIs and load the tokens in the UGI (similar to the way job-token is loaded in Child.java). In the JobInProgress, the tokens already exist in memory and it should be easy to add it to the ugi used for copying the jobconf file from the hdfs. In the tasktracker, ditto (for localizing the job's files).
For tasks (and for other processes like an MR Streaming app running a hdfs command from within the tasks), if we have a static block in the UGI to look for the env variable, and load the token cache using the TokenCache's APIs, it should work. Also, when the env var is defined, we should use simple authentication for login.
Thoughts?, Attaching a patch for common. For the mapreduce part, we need to have a separate jira. This patch disables kerberos login when the env var is set. In the method getLoginUser in UserGroupInformation, the token file is read and tokens are loaded.
Thoughts?, I'd flip the test around so that we don't load tokens if we are in the simple authentication.

It also should leave the kerberos flag turned on even if there is a token file.

I'd also suggest changing the name to HADOOP_TOKEN_FILE and making it a static final string constant., Addressing Owen's comments., This looks good, but:

This message is automatically generated., Fixed the line length issue. I tested the patch manually. Difficult to write a test for this since this patch relies on env variables being exported., I agree on the unit tests.

Shouldn't this be using the code in TokenStorage from  MAPREDUCE-1338? Replicating the code to read the file into this class seems wrong. Unfortunately, we would need to move the TokenStorage code down into Common..., bq. Shouldn't this be using the code in TokenStorage from MAPREDUCE-1338?

That's true. I was thinking about doing it in a future jira since it involves couple of mapreduce jiras - MAPREDUCE-1383 & MAPREDUCE-1338, but okay I will put that effort in this jira & MAPREDUCE-1432., Ok, this patch adds TokenStorage class in Common. Not much has changed since my earlier patch other than creation of the new files TokenStorage.java & TestTokenStorage.java, and invocation of TokenStorage.readToken directly from the UserGroupInformation.java.., -1 overall.
