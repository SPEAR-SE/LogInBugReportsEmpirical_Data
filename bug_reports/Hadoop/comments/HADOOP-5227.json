[Currently, -delete does not work well with -update. If a file exist in both src and dst, -update tells distcp to skip such file but then -delete cannot see it (since it is skipped)., 5227_20080211b.patch:
- only skip file in the copy list but not the check list.
- always check all files in the src (instead of skipping the remaining files once filelimit or sizelimit is exceeded)., Tested locally, submitting..., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I'm not sure what semantics a user might expect when \-update and \-delete are combined, but this seems like the right fix to me., I committed this. Thanks, Nicholas, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #763 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/763/])
