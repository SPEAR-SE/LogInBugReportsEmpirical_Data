A few comments on your patch.

Rather than assigning HOSTLIST after hadoop-env.sh is sourced we should do the following

1. in hadoop-config.sh source the hadoop-env.sh before additional parameters are processed such as --hosts. This way if you specify the hosts at command line they will get set appropriately. This will help as in start-dfs.sh the secondary namenode is being started as

{code}
"$bin"/hadoop-daemons.sh --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR --hosts masters start secondarynamenode
{code}


2. in slaves.sh remove the source of hadoop-env.sh as it has already been sourced by hadoop-config.sh. Thus the assignment of HADOOP_SLAVES done by hadoop-config.sh will be available rather than being overwritten by hadoop-env.sh
, About the format: I cloned with git the trunk repository but the two files I'm proposing to change are different. So this is not a patch for the trunk. This is only a patch for the  hadoop-1.0.3.tar.gz version. What should I do? Create a git with hadoop-1.0.3.tar.gz and then after the change publish the "git diff"?

about the comments: 1 is already the way I modified hadoop-config.sh
                    2 I thought in slaves.sh the sourcing of hadoop-env.sh could serve to other stuff but if this is not the case I agree that we should remove it., @Giovanni

I checked trunk and it looks like the same problem exists in trunk where we source the hadoop-env.sh after reading the command line arguments. So the same fixes should apply there as well. Could you generate a patch for trunk also.


For hadoop 1.0.3 we need to create the patch for branch-1 and that will be ported to branch-1.1 and branch-1.0 so the future 1.x releases can pick up the fix., patch of the secondary namenode issue for the trunk, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~arpitgupta] I checked again and found that in branch-1 I need to move the setting of the HOSTLIST variable because when slaves.sh calls hadoop-config.sh it hasn't the --hosts attached so hadoop-config.sh sets HADOOP_SLAVES (by calling hadoop-env.sh) to the slaves file instead of the masters. , patch for branch1, -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., could you generate the patch using git --no-prefix, otherwiese i have to provide which file to patch.

Also for the patches the naming convention is something like HADOOP-8767.patch for trunk and HADOOP-8767.branch-1.patch for branch-1

Also good catch on the branch-1 changes., bq. could you generate the patch using git --no-prefix, otherwiese i have to provide which file to patch.

You can apply this patch with {{patch -p1}}.
{code}
diff --git a/bin/hadoop-config.sh b/bin/hadoop-config.sh
index c23cbcf..073a5fe 100644
--- a/bin/hadoop-config.sh
+++ b/bin/hadoop-config.sh
% cd branch-1
% patch -p1 < /tmp/patch_hadoop-config.sh_slaves.sh_branch1.patch
patching file bin/hadoop-config.sh
patching file bin/slaves.sh
%
{code}

Using {{--no-prefix}} makes the patch less useful to others. :), @Andy

thanks for the info. However i was just following what we recommend to users on our wiki http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GitAndHadoop, also --no-prefix only removes the "a/.. b/..." so not sure how it will be less useful., patch with --no-prefix, ops. plural=> patches with --no-prefix flag
