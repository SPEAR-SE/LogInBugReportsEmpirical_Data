[Moved to 1.2.0 upon release of 1.1.0., Created [pull request|https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/pull/9] which upgrades commons-math to commons-math3 version 3.2., Other projects using hadoop, like mahout, use commons-math3, and it's not nice to have hadoop trailing, and have both commons-math and commons-math3 on classpath., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2., Attaching [^hadoop-1.2.x-HADOOP-8425.patch] which targets branch-1.2 (1.2.2-SNAPSHOT), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12602583/hadoop-1.2.x-HADOOP-8425.patch

This message is automatically generated., It's understandable why PreCommit-HADOOP-Build build job has failed, since it builds trunk.

I don't see PreCommit build job for Hadoop branch 1.2.x.

Not sure though, why PreCommit-HADOOP-Build-branch-1 is failing, [build job execution #8 console log|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build-branch-1/8/console] just states that applying patch has failed, but no other info (e.g. patching which file has failed, any error stack traces)., \\
