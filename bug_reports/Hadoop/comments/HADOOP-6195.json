I'm not sure how it found modified unit tests...   But hey, the intelligence of scripts is inscrutable., I just committed this, thanks Lee!, >I'm not sure how it found modified unit tests...
It is because the patch changed src/test/checkstyle.xml, a file under src/test.  That why it said "The patch *appears* to include 3 new or modified tests."  I could not explain how it came up the number of modified tests., Re-opening to mark this as INVALID since HADOOP-6182 has been reverted., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk #55 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk/55/])
