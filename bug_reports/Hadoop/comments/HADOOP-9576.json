[Makes sense -that wrapping was meant to cover the expected problems and make them easier to diagnose -swallowing the common exception types was never the goal.
, I've seen this, and yes, it should be handled and marked as "connection torn town"

We'll need a corresponding Wiki page along with the code patch, patch, also fixes a cut and paste text error in the {{NoRouteToHost}} handler, Wiki Entry is at [https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/EOFException] - I had to cover FileSystem EOFs too, as well as things like HTTP channels shutting down early

This is what the stack trace looks like
