[It is a *feature* to have understandable key version names. The job tracker used to create unique identifiers for job ids and task ids too, but we fixed it to use patterns. As a result you can actually understand what is happening.

Do not disable the feature., Hi [~tucu00] - I am looking at moving unnestUri into a utils class as well.
What is your status on this jira?

We should make it the same utils class.
I'm thinking ProviderUtils.

Any thoughts?, [~lmccay], i was thinking about that method as well. I may have time later this week, if you want to take over and repurpose this JIRA for both methods, go for it. THX, Hi [~tucu00] - After looking at it more closely, I'm not sure that the methods should be in the same utils class. BuildVersion is pretty much key  provider specific where unnestUri is used across both Key and CredentialProvider APIs. I added unnestUri to a new org.apache.hadoop.security.ProviderUtils class - since it is more general security provider functionality. Thanks., Larry, both could be in the ProviderUtils class]
