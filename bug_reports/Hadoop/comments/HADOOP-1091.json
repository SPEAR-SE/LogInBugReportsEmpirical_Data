[Two small, safe fixes., This patch doesn't apply to trunk.  I get:

patching file src/java/org/apache/hadoop/metrics/spi/MetricsRecordImpl.java
Hunk #1 FAILED at 64.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file src/java/org/apache/hadoop/metrics/spi/MetricsRecordImpl.java.rej
patching file src/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/Counters.java, Patch doesn't apply, My bad, the patch is fine.  An editor I looked at the patch in removed the ^M end-o-line characters., I've just fixed this. Thanks David! BTW, what's Simon?]
