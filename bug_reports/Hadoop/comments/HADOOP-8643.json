This message is automatically generated., I'm afraid this won't work as expected.

{{hadoop-client}} has {{hadoop-project-dist}} as parent and {{hadoop-project-dist}} has {{hadoop-annotations}} as dependency. Because of this, {{hadoop-client}} cannot exclude {{hadoop-annotations}}.

Currently {{hadoop-client}} show {{hadoop-annotations}} with {{provided}} scope, this means that it should not be pulled during packaging, thus we are good for now. 

Still, we should see how to untangle this in a better way.

For now we lower the priority of this JIRA.
