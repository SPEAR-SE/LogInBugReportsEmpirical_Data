[Attaching jstack of the PipeReducer process, This patch would fail the task when MROutput/ErrThread throws a Throwable.
Right now, I propagate the Throwable by including in the IOException. 
This is probably not the right approach.  I'd appreciate any suggestions., +1

It is reasonable to fail a streaming task if its the threads readingfrom/writing to the streaming process fails.
