[Is this a duplicate of HDFS-303, which details and encompasses the differences between file system implementations?, I'm not very familiar with how issue tracking is handled here, so very possibly. My own interest is mostly in matching the documentation and the unit tests, though -- that's how I discovered the differences., I'm going to go ahead and say this does duplicate the other jira.  It would certainly be great to iron out those differences, but we ran into problems involving backwards compatibility when we worked on it previously.  If possible, stick to the FileSystemContract test and then rely on DFS behavior as guidance if there are differences.]
