[As Runping points out, this is largely caused by the map runners allocating buffers to collect the map outputs. In particular, if you have R reduces, it means there are 2*R files open, each with a buffer associated with it. At 800 reduces, you already have 2 * 800 * 64k = 1g of buffer. A reasonable implementation of HADOOP-331 would solve this problem., This is a duplicate of HADOOP-331.]
