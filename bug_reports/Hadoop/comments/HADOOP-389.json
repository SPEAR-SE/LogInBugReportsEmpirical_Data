[This patch waits for the tasktrackers to be initialized before shutdown can be called. This patch also fixes a bug in build.xml where in a dependency has been introduced between compile-test-core and examples (in TestMiniMRWithDfs.java)., I divided the original test into 2 independent patches.
MiniMRCluster.patch - is the MiniMR cluster part of the original patch.
BuildXML.patch - fixes some target dependencies in the ant script.
The original patch fixes the bug in build.xml but introduces unnecessary
dependencies on the compile targets.
, I just committed this.  Thanks!]
