[I think HADOOP-4947 isn't quite right -- in fact, neither HADOOP-5087 nor HADOOP-4947 is quite right; I checked both. , Submitted a revised patch for HADOOP-5087; this one removes trailing spaces from adapter params. This should fix the TestStartAtOffset errors., Fixes:
- FileTailingAdaptor.java: remove trailing spaces on the fileName
- ChukwaAgent.java: Fix regex to be able to parse a valid checkpoint (cf HADOOP-5087)
- ConstRateAdaptor.java: output the right information so the agent can generate a valid chekpoint
- TestCharFileTailingAdaptorUTF8.java: CharFileTailingAdaptorUTF8 test case, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Separating TestCharFileTailing and TestFileTailing adaptor is a good workaround to ensure the queue isn't reused between two instance of the ChukwaAgent. +1 to this patch., I just committed this.
