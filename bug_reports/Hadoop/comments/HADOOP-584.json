[I don't see this as a bug. If you have cygwin installed it should run fine. 

And cygwin is explicitly required in the documentation:

=====================================
Requirements

   1. Java 1.4.x, preferably from Sun Set JAVA_HOME to the root of your Java installation.
   2. ssh must be installed and sshd must be running to use Hadoop's scripts to manage remote Hadoop daemons. On Ubuntu, this may done with
      sudo apt-get install ssh
   3. rsync must be installed to use Hadoop's scripts to manage remote Hadoop installations. On Ubuntu, this may done with
      sudo apt-get install rsync.
   4. On Win32, cygwin, for shell support. To use Subversion on Win32, select the subversion package when you install, in the "Devel" category. Distributed operation has not been well tested on Win32, so this should primarily be considered a development platform at this point, not a production platform.
=====================================

This should be updated to say that Java 1.5 is required.

The new saveVersion.sh script should probably detect and handle internally if svn is not installed/found. Although it is hard to imagine a case where I wanted to build Hadoop and not have svn installed., Yes, under cygwin it builds fine. But it does not if you build in a stand alone eclipse.
Which it did before the patch, and that is why I'm saying it imposes more depenecies.
I think it should not.

Here is a practical advice that solved the problem for me:
Include "C:\cygwin\bin" and "C:\Program Files\Subversion\bin" into the Path.
cygwin\bin contains sh.exe, and Subversion\bin has svn.exe, which are now
required to build hadoop.
