[Also, the documentation refers to the config as "signature.secret" not "signature.secret.file". It should also mention that it should be created on each host in the cluster that runs an auth-enabled Web UI.

, Actually, we need to:
* remove the default value from core-default.xml
* if the value isn't defined, let the lower layer generate random bytes

Saving the random bytes lowers the security of the system., We should be able to get away with that, IIUC the only reason to save the randomly generated bytes was for users that need to share the secret across hosts, but we can require they generate their own secret., The secret cannot be generated randomly in the case of a cluster as the secret must be shared by ALL machines. We have to update the docs removing the 'generated randomly' comment., patch updating docs and default.xml, +1, this change looks good to me. I agree with Tucu that it's not reasonable to generate this value randomly given that this cookie will need to be validated by all of the hosts in the cluster., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
