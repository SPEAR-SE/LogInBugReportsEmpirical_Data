[Still get compilation error, but it's not immediately obvious why. Should probably call it quits for today and look at this again tomorrow., Resolved all compilation issues. Further testing will follow., Resolved compilation issues. Further testing to follow..., Btw trunk is currently on 1.5.3 in some places (HADOOP-7264, see /hadoop-project/pom.xml) and 1.5.2 in others (/hadoop-mapreduce-project/ivy/libraries.properties). How about we bring all branches/projects up to 1.5.3?

, Patch looks good to me.

One minor improvement would to be replace java.lang.CharSequence with just CharSequence., Eli: yes makes sense to have all branches on the same version.
Doug: good point, will make suggested change., I had used the fully qualified java.lang.CharSequence to match the generated AvroSpecificTestProtocol, but adjusted according to Doug's suggestion., Let me file a Jira for hdfs and mapreduce (the latter seems to be the most work).
Then I'll run all three through our Jenkins builds together and do a quick test on it before we commit them together., Ivy seems to cache some of the dependencies. I've found that cleaning out the local cache (~/.ivy2 and ~/.m2/cache if needed) can help with this.
After that I build common first with target mvn:install, then hdfs, then mapreduce., A patch is available for each of the sub-projects: common, hdfs, and mapreduce. The latter one needs review as I think more work is required there., +1, 3 tests are failing with this patch:
    [junit] Test org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestPath FAILED
    [junit] Test org.apache.hadoop.io.TestEnumSetWritable FAILED
    [junit] Test org.apache.hadoop.io.TestText FAILED
Will commit as long as those are fixed., The last patch passes the tests., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-22-branch #84 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-22-branch/84/])

, Here is a modification. The point is that BinaryEncoder needs to flush before written data will be available for the reader. Looks like a difference in semantics with the old avro., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-22-branch #86 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-22-branch/86/])
