[* Well, this isn't a support channel, more for filing bugs and fixes. So I'm afraid you are going to have to start creating that bug report (with stacks in here, versions defined, etc). And you are going to have to turn up the logging in the swift code, the httpclient code, etc, to see what's going on at all. I don't expect anyone else to put their hand up here, sorry.

Auth and openstack is a really source of pain with that swift module. Every endpoint had its own variants of the auth mech, and, for security reasons, nothing provides meaningful information. If its your own openstack instance. see what gets received, how it matches the expectations. That's what I would probably start with.]
