{code}

I haven't managed to make any headway in identifying the cause yet., The warnings in the stdout is unrelated., 
If I insert a two second sleep in testSetTimesSymlinkToDir() in SymlinkBaseTest.java:
{code:java}
    long at = wrapper.getFileLinkStatus(link).getAccessTime();
    // the local file system may not support millisecond timestamps

    try {
    Thread.sleep(2000);
    } catch (Exception e){}
    wrapper.setTimes(link, 2000L, 3000L);

    assertEquals(at, wrapper.getFileLinkStatus(link).getAccessTime());
{code}
Then this test code will always fail, usually the actual timestamp is two seconds after the expected timestamp. This implies that (in Linux) setting timestamp of the destination file also updates access time of the symbolic link, and therefore breaks the assumption of the test case., Java API does not seem to specify if the access time of the symlink is updated in this case. I think it could be platform dependent, or maybe version dependent.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/attribute/BasicFileAttributeView.html#setTimes%28java.nio.file.attribute.FileTime,%20java.nio.file.attribute.FileTime,%20java.nio.file.attribute.FileTime%29

POSIX has clear definition in this case: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/futimens.html But it's not clear if Java implementation uses it.

In this case, I suggest removing the checking of atime, due to the ambiguity. I will keep looking though., Did the assertion always occur when verifying atime (not mtime)?
Is dir "/testptch/hadoop/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/test/data/4/vae1ng5t75/test1/" on NFS mount?
If so, run "grep testptch /proc/mounts" on Linux; also find out the NFS server type.
NFS mount has "noatime" option to improve performance., # on windows the FS timestamp is ~2s. So we should have a range of a slightly more than this. [~cnauroth] —this is still the case, right.
# even with a 1s granularity, there's always the risk of a race where the clock rolls; a 1/1000 event in my estimate
# if things are mounted then the time can be generated at the far end and a few seconds out. Or, if your clock is in a different TZ from the server, many hours out, which can cause no end of fun with automatic GC of old files in production systems, I can assure you.

If you run {{ant -diagnostics}} you can see a check of temp dir timestamp alignment, or more precisely, the timestamp diff between the time a file was created and the time immediately afterwards., ..given this is checking local FS behaviour, and that's an implementation detail we can't address, why not just kill these tests. They don't show regressions in our code, merely demonstrate that different filesystems behave differently.

if they are to be retained, then they should go into the AbstractFSContract tests, and {{LocalFSContract}} can determine the expected timestamp range on symlinks, the way it already determines FS permission model and case sensitivity., Thanks for the comments. This test fails much more frequent than 1 in 1000 (around 1 in 4~10 on my local machine). Possibly setTimes() operation takes more than 1 millisecond. But you are right, the time difference is non zero and could be longer in different scenarios.

I am more inclined to removing the assertion. But I would like to hear comments from Chris before taking actions., At the OS level, neither Linux nor Solaris modify the times on a symlink when updating, only the times of the target file are updated. The java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributeView does the same, setting the time via a symlink sets the tike of the file not the symlink., +1 for removing the tests., These tests were introduced in HADOOP-12045.  I'm linking the issues.

The failure on Solaris is the same as the way it fails on Windows (if you remove the {{assumeTrue}} that currently skips it on Windows).  The root cause in this case is lack of a native {{stat}} implementation on the platform's Hadoop native library.  This then causes the {{FileStatus}} to be populated with the atime from the target instead of the symlink.  For more details, refer to this comment of mine from HADOOP-12045, where decided to skip these tests on Windows:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12045?focusedCommentId=14606655&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14606655

The tests are intended to check the capability introduced in HADOOP-12045: changing atime on the local file system.  Removing the tests would leave us in a state where that enhancement was no longer tested regularly.  However, it seems as though the mere act of checking status of the symlink risks updating the atime, depending on timing.

Instead of removing the tests, I suggest that we relax the assertion so that instead of strict equality, it checks that current atime is greater than or equal.  This would still serve the intent of the test, which is to check that {{setTimes}} alters the target instead of the link.  The previous line sets atime to 3000, which is way in the past, so we never expect to be anytime near that in the link's atime.
, bq. The root cause in this case is lack of a native stat implementation on the platform's Hadoop native library. This then causes the FileStatus to be populated with the atime from the target instead of the symlink.

NIO has the ability to select either the symlink or the target of the symlink in many of its APIs, e,g, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#getFileAttributeView-java.nio.file.Path-java.lang.Class-java.nio.file.LinkOption...- That might be an option rather than Native code., Thanks [~cnauroth].
I am attaching rev01, basically relaxing the assertion condition, and ignore the test if the platform is Windows or Solaris.

The other solution is to use Java's get/setFileAttributeView class to update the symlink's atime (with the NOFOLLOW_LINKS option). But considering side effects (e.g. symlink to symlink) it can still be error-prone for corner cases. 

I wonder is there any general guidelines (POSIX?) that specify what happens to the symlink when the the mtime/atime of target is updated. Or, do we care about it at all? Reading HADOOP-12045, I feel the semantics of atime of symlink should be backward-compatible, and it has always been the case that atime of symlink is always updated when setTimes is called., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, I've written a C test case and it works the same on Solaris and Linux - updating the mtime/atime affects the target file unless AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW is specified. As far as I can tell, the NIO classes behave the same way. I'm still not clear why the test case is failing, is it possible to provide a self-contained Java program that illustrates the problem, because I'm having difficulty replicating the problem outside of the test harness., HADOOP-11935 is the issue that tracks filling in the gap on the {{stat}} syscall.  As you pointed out, we're also considering NIO instead of JNI., The failure reported here is on a check of atime for a directory (not a file).  Did your test try a directory or just a file?  The theory proposed in my last comment is that the act of accessing the directory through the symlink to check its current atime for the assertion risks updating the atime once again.  If the granularity of the atime tracking is 1 second, then that would explain why the failure is so rare and why it manifests as showing an atime off by a full second., {code}
    assumeTrue(!Shell.WINDOWS || !Shell.SOLARIS);
{code}

I think this was supposed to be AND instead of OR.  Right now, it always evaluates {{true}}, because it can't be two different OSes at the same time.  :-)  Also, there are 3 total test cases inside {{TestSymlinkLocalFS}} that are skipped on Windows.  Please update all 3 to skip on Solaris too.

Thank you., Ahah, that's the bit of the jigsaw I was missing - yes I only checked files. However I think your supposition is correct - accessing a dir is accessing a dir, even if it's done through a symlink so atime will be updated, and POSIX says this about the timestamp resolution of the utimes() syscall:

{code}
accuracy is only to the microsecond, not nanosecond, and rounding towards the nearest second may occur.
{code}

I think it's therefore safest to assume rounding will happen. If you use the futimens() or utimensat() syscall then you should get nanosecond-accurate times but to be maximally portable I think you need to assume the JVM will use utimes() and will therefore only be microsecond-accurate at best, and may round up to the nearest second.

I think rather than special-casing the test for specific platforms it should just be modified to check for the POSIX semantics, as anything else is non-portable.



, Rev02: skip one other test cases for Solaris as well.

From HADOOP-12583, TestSymlinkLocalFS.testDanglingLink, TestSymlinkLocalFS.testSetTimesSymlinkToDir and TestSymlinkLocalFS.testSetTimesSymlinkToFile also fail on Solaris. Two of which are related to symlink atime.

TestSymlinkLocalFS.testDanglingLink is not related to atime so this is maybe due to some other issues with Solaris. 

It's interesting testSetTimesDanglingLink did not fail on Solaris., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, I'm concerned that we are just disabling tests rather than understanding what the correct semantics should be. There are also ownership test failures on Solaris related to symlinks so there are clearly more general issues at play here, rather than just time-related ones.

What are the assumptions that are being made about Linux behaviour by these tests?, If I look on a Centos machine I see that / is mounted with the following options:

{code}
/dev/mapper/centos-root on / type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
{code}

The mount(8) manpage says this about relatime:

{code}
       relatime
              Update inode access times relative to  modify  or  change  time.
              Access time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier
              than the current modify or change time. (Similar  to  noatime,
              but  doesn't break mutt or other applications that need to
              know if a file has been read since the last time  it  was  modified.)

              Since Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided
              by this option (unless noatime was  specified), and the strictatime
              option  is  required  to  obtain traditional semantics. In
              addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the file's  last  access  time  is
              always  updated  if  it  is more than 1 day old.
{code}

That's not POSIX-conformant behaviour, and as it says is the default from 2.6.30 onwards. Solaris has a noatime mount option which is the same as Linux's noatime, but no direct equivalent to relatime, although on UFS it has dfratime which is similar. ZFS, which is now the default Solaris filesystem, only has noatime. BSD only appears to have noatime as well. Linux also has nodiratime which isn't available on either Solaris or BSD. Windows varies depending on filesystem type but NTFS may defer updates to atime for up to an hour and you can also disable atime updates entirely. On FAT the resolution of atime is 1 day. 

Leaving aside the issue of POSIX correctness, unless you implement a probe that understands the semantics of atime updates across all relevant systems and that probes for the mount options of the filesystem you are testing on, any access time behaviour tests are almost certainly going to be unreliable.

Rather than trying to bodge up these tests, I believe it's better to remove them entirely.

More here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/POSIX_Reference/sys/stat.h/stat#Criticism_of_atime, Besides these actime mount options at OS/kernel layer, the filesystems below (especially network filesystems) favor performance over atime compliance.

Have we ruled out any problem at JAVA library or JVM layer?, I traced the JVM and it doesn't seem to be doing anything other than normal stat()-type operations to get file times so I don't think there's a problem there. I think the tests are based on one subset of observed behaviour rather than an understanding of the different ways in which atime may behave. As I said, I believe they should just be removed. Testing ctime and mtime makes sense but atime? No., The goal of HADOOP-12045 was to enable setting atime explicitly on the local file system using the {{FileSystem#setTimes}} API.  It did not get involved at all with the automatic access time update semantics of any particular local file system, nor did the tests include any assumptions that atime is enabled on the local file system.  I would agree that our tests cannot make assumptions like that about the local file system.

The tests in question just need to be able to set an atime value explicitly, and then verify that the atime was changed on the target instead of the link.  If we can get cross-platform agreement on this basic level of functionality, then I expect we can keep the tests.  There won't be any need for complexity like checking the mount table.  I think we just have a corner case bug in that the test's call to {{FileSystem#getFileLinkStatus}} might inadvertently update atime of the link once again.  The proposed patch solves this by relaxing the assertion to use >=.

HADOOP-12045 was implemented as a pass-through to {{BasicFileAttributeView#setTimes}}, which then appears to be a pass-through to [{{futimes}}|http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/futimes.3.html] in UnixNativeDispatcher.c in the OpenJDK source.  On Windows, it's a pass-through to [{{SetFileTime}}|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724933(v=vs.85).aspx] via WindowsNativeDispatcher.c.

The Linux man page for {{futimes}} says that the function is not specified by a standard and is only implemented for Linux and BSDs.  [~alanburlison], do you know if Solaris has {{futimes}}?  I couldn't find a definitive source on that.  As long as {{BasicFileAttributeView#setTimes}} somehow works correctly onn Solaris, then I expect we're fine.

The tests need to be skipped right now on Windows and Solaris due to a difference in native code implementation supported by the Linux side compared to other platforms.  I described this in more detail in my comments on HADOOP-12045.  HADOOP-11935 is an open issue that would fix this problem by using appropriate NIO APIs to get the {{stat}}/{{lstat}} behavior we need on those platforms.  I don't think we're indiscriminately skipping tests without trying to understand semantics.  We are skipping them temporarily until after resolution of HADOOP-11935.

To summarize, I am +1 for committing patch v02, which retains the tests but corrects for a corner case.  Follow-ups are tracked in separate JIRAs.  I will hold off on committing though in case there is further discussion., do we need to care about atime at all, given we explicitly recommend turning atime off on filesystems used for mounting HDFS. Or is it that hdfs itself does atimes, and we want filesystems to be roughly consistent? 

In which case: does anyone have any data on how often atimes are checked in real applications?, [~cnauroth] thanks for the detailed explanation of the background, that has clarified the issues.

No, Solaris does not have {{futimes()}} but it does have both {{futimens()}} and {{utimensat()}} which are both POSIX functions, and are both available on Linux. The closes match for {{futimes()}} is {{futimens()}}, the only difference being that {{futimes()}} takes a {{struct timeval}} as a parameter and {{futimens()}} takes a {{struct timespec}}. If you are looking at a JNI solution then {{futimens()}} looks like it is the better option.

However I think NIO will work just fine on Solaris for updating file times, if I trace the operation of {{java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributeView.setTimes()}} I see this:

{code}
/2:     openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/l", O_RDONLY)            = 47
/2:     uucopy(0xFFFF80FFBCDFC970, 0xFFFF80FFBCDFC910, 32) = 0
/2:     utimensat(47, NULL, 0xFFFF80FFBCDFC930, 0)      = 0
/2:     close(47)                                       = 0
{code}

So it is already using {{utimensat()}}.
, If atimes is usually turned of on filesystems backing HDFS then there seems little point about worrying about it., [~alanbur], thank you for the clarification on what is available on Solaris.  It's another compelling argument for us to use NIO instead of JNI wherever feasible., bq. do we need to care about atime at all, given we explicitly recommend turning atime off on filesystems used for mounting HDFS.

We also need to keep in mind that Hadoop code can trigger local file system interactions on client machines, external to the Hadoop cluster itself.  The standard recommendation to disable atime is less relevant on these client machines.  In some environments, these machines might not be governed by the same system administrators that operate the cluster nodes.  It might not be feasible for them to enforce a noatime policy everywhere.

One use case for setting atime on the local file system is {{hdfs dfs -copyToLocal -p}}.  The expected semantics are to retain the atime stored in HDFS when the file lands on the local file system.  Prior to HADOOP-12045, that wouldn't have worked correctly.

bq. Or is it that hdfs itself does atimes, and we want filesystems to be roughly consistent?

Yes, I do also think it's good to make the semantics consistent across our file system implementations as much as possible, unless there are compelling technical reasons that prevent it.

I admit that setting local file system atime through the Hadoop code probably isn't a very critical thing.  However, I see it as a nice-to-have based on the copyToLocal use case and the consistency argument.  It was enough to motivate me to review and commit HADOOP-12045., This test is really that the file:// FS handles atime too, especially on windows. It just looks like atime is so inconsistent for symlinks that we should really think about abandoning the test.

certainly, if I tried to run the test on my dev linux VM, it would fail with noatime.

If it makes you feel better, I've discovered yesterday that HDFS rename() sets the modtime, but POSIX doesn't..., bq. certainly, if I tried to run the test on my dev linux VM, it would fail with noatime.

That's not the behavior I'm seeing.  I ran the test in a xfs mount point using noatime, and it still passed.  I hacked the test to skip deleting the data at the end so I could inspect it manually, and it matched my expectations.

{code}

/home/cnauroth/git/hadoop/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common

{code}

I can understand the concern about consistency across the whole world of OSes and file systems though.  Given that this is not a critical feature, I'm willing to compromise and delete the tests, and let the lack of test coverage slide.  Let me know if that's how you'd like to proceed, and we can ask [~jojochuang] to update the patch.

bq. If it makes you feel better, I've discovered yesterday that HDFS rename() sets the modtime, but POSIX doesn't...

Two wrongs make a right.  :-), We really should have left out atime from the Hadoop FS interface.  It turns all reads into writes. :(

Yes, rename() should change the mtime of the parent directory, not the thing being renamed.  I guess we got that wrong in HDFS?

Symlinks technically do have an atime separate from the file they point to, at least on UNIX.  I'm not sure about Windows (which only kinda sorta has symlinks in the first place).

Probably better to {{\@Ignore}} this test for now., where are we with this? I think we can either commit the latest patch or go with an @ignore. I'd prefer the fix as it still keeps the test running on systems where things behave the way the test expects, I don't have a strong opinion, but I am +1 for the latest patch.  An \@Ignore would also be acceptable., bq. where are we with this?

Here is a summary of my position, with quotes pulled from my prior comments.

Here is where I stated my +1 for patch v02:

It sounded like there wasn't consensus though, so I never committed it.  I also stated that I was willing to compromise if others feel strongly that the tests need to be deleted:

[~stevel@apache.org], what are your thoughts?  Proceed with patch v02 or ask for a patch that deletes the tests?, well, I don't see the value of this test. But I'm happy for the patch to go in if you are —we can always revisit that decision if it continues to play up.

+1 then, bq. well, I don't see the value of this test.

The value I see is that it verifies {{RawLocalFileSystem}} is implemented correctly to support {{hdfs dfs -copyToLocal -p}}.  Again quoting one of my earlier comments:
