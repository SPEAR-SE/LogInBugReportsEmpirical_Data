This message was automatically generated., That change to exec() doesn't break anything does it?

Given its inside the maven plugin, I'm happy

+1, bq. That change to exec() doesn't break anything does it?

No, it's fine.  The only other caller is the {{VersionInfoMojo}}.  I chose to do the {{Exec}} change in a way that would be backward-compatible for {{VersionInfoMojo}}.  It's a new overload of the {{run}} method that captures stderr in a separate in/out variable.  Only {{ProtocMojo}} calls the new overload.  {{VersionInfoMojo}} still calls the old one.

An alternative would have been just to dump both stdout and stderr into the same in/out variable used by the existing {{run}} method.  That could have been dangerous, because {{VersionInfoMojo}} has specific expectations about the output, and dumping stderr on top of that could have harmed that logic.

Thanks for the review.  I'll commit later today., I have committed this to trunk and branch-2.  Steve, thanks again for the review., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8648 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8648/])
