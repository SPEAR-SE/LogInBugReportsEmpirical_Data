This message was automatically generated., [~andreina], I think you are creating the patch on the branch-2.6. due to which its not applying on branch-2.

In the later versions all .apt files are converted to markdown (.md) files.
And the Exactly this issue has been fixed in 2.7.0 through HADOOP-11558.

[~aw], Do you need this in branch-2.6 as well ? in case any more releases from branch-2.6 , Hi [~andreina], would you please update the patch as Vinayakumar suggested?, Please ignore the before comment., Hi [~andreina], thank you for taking this issue.

1. Would you use {code}{{{URL}Name}}{code} instead of {code}[Name](URL){code}? The latter style is not supported by apt format.
2. When you upload the patch, please name it appropriately (e.g. HADOOP-11844.<rev>.branch-2.6.patch)., Thanks [~ajisakaa] and [~vinayrpet] for reviewing.

Let me know if i have done any mistake in naming the patch file., bq. Do you need this in branch-2.6 as well ? 

Nah.  If this has been fixed in trunk, I'm good.

bq. again the patch is been applied on trunk instead on hadoop2.6 branch. Let me know if i have done any mistake in naming the patch file.

Unfortunately, test-patch doesn't know about minor releases. :(  

But let's go ahead and close this as won't fix since it is correct in newer branches.

Thanks for the work on this!, Already fixed in 2.7+, so closing as won't fix.]
