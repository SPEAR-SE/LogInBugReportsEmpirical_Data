[The submitted patch tries to address the two issues reported.

Some notable changes:

1.  A new boolean field "targetPathExists" is introduced to DistCpOptions class. The value of this field is a derived by checking whether the target path exists or not in the beginning of distcp.  (Arguably, this information could be put somewhere else, but I found DistCpOption is the most suitable place based on the current DistCp implementation). 

A new corresponding jobconf property CONF_LABEL_TARGET_PATH_EXISTS is introduced, and it's initialized at the same time as the targetPathExists field.

The reason is that the result of class SimpleCopyListing's method computeSourceRootPath depends on DistCpOption. E.g., whether the distcp target exists or not, whether -update or -overwrite switches are passed. And Item 3 below needs this info (via the new jobconf property). 

Unit tests that use DistCpOptions need to be aware of the need to set this filed according to the test-case's setting.

2. For the issues reported in this JIRA, an entry that  was skipped by writeToFileListing method with the following code:
{code}
 if (fileStatus.getPath().equals(sourcePathRoot) && fileStatus.isDirectory())
    return; // Skip the root-paths.
{code}
is now added to the filelisting when no -update/-overwrite is specified.

This entry is recognized by both the CopyMapper and CopyCommitter.
Using this entry, the CopyMapper will create dir accordingly (for ISSUE 2), and the CopyCommitter will update attributes when specified (for ISSUE 1).

E.g., distcp a/b xyz, where a/b is the source dir, 
a. if xyz doesn't exist, then "a/b" is written to the copyListing with empty relative path "". 
b. if xyz exists, then "a/b" is written to the copyListing with relative path "b".

3. 
class CopyCommitter's method deleteMissing creates a DistCpOption object with default setting, and collect listing from prior-to-committing result of distcp. This is not sufficient for the above mentioned reason  (The result of class SimpleCopyListing's method computeSourceRootPath depends on DistCpOption). The problem is revealed with the change I added to fix this JIRA, and the patch I submitted addressed it.

Since the earlier failure of TestUniformSizeInputFormat is about too many open files, anyone who would help 
me review  the patch, would you please try to spot whether the newly added entry to the file listing (described
in "notable changes #2") would contribute to that (even though it may just be a glitch on the node that ran build
6495)? thanks a lot.
, Hi [~ajisakaa], thanks for linking to HADOOP-9705. I was focusing on resolving the test failures yesterday and didn't see your update in time. I noticed that it's [~schu] who filed HADOOP-9705. Actually ISSUE 1 reported in this JIRA is also found by him. Thanks Stephen., Hi Yongjun, the latest patch looks pretty good to me. Just a handful of small comments:

# There are a few small changes that seem wholly unnecessary, e.g. the changes in CopyMapper, some white space changes in CopyCommitter, etc.
# Recommend making {{syncOrOverwrite}} in {{CopyCommitter#preserveFileAttributesForDirectories}} final, or doing away with the variable entirely since it's never modified and only referenced in one place.
# Recommend adding a comment to {{SimpleCopyListing#doBuildListing}} to explain the logic about what is and isn't written out to the copy listing.

+1 once these are addressed., Thanks a lot ATM! I just uploaded a new revision (003) to address all your comments.
