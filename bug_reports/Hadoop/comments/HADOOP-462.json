[This patch ensures that a user does not see a java-stack trace if he/she encounters an error with DFSShell. Instead, an error message shouls get displayed., Enhanced DFSShell to handle error conditions better. A user of DFSShell does not have to grind his/her teeth trying to decipher a java stack trace., Overall, this looks like a good change.

In DFSShell.run(), instead of adding a 'exitCode=0' to every clause, why not change the 'else' clause to 'return -1'?  That would save about 15 lines.  Why the double-semicolons?  And the 'else' clause you add is formatted non-standardly.

There's a typo in the javadoc for setQuietMode()., Hi Doug,

I am looking at it and will get back to you shortly.

Thanks,

, A new version of the patch with Doug's code review comments incorporated. This supercedes the earlier patch that was submitted., Submitted patch with Doug's code review comments., You're still sometimes placing 'else' and 'catch' clauses on a new line, rather than on the same line as the preceding close brace.

This could all really stand to be replaced by a commons-cli, but that's for another day...
, I was not aware about the coding style for the exception catch statement. Fixed as per Doug's comments. This patch supercedes earlier attachments., Changed coding style of catch-exception statements., I just committed this.  Thanks, Dhruba.]
