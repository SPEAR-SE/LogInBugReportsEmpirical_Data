As a side note, it'd be nice to name patches as "JIRA-#.version.patch", e.g. "HADOOP-10928.001.patch". For whatever reason ".diff" downloads rather than opening in my browser, so it'd be more convenient for me :), Committed to trunk and branch-2. The backticks in the JIRA summary were eaten by my shell, so the trunk commit message is a little messed up. Correct in branch-2 though., Also, of course, thanks Josh for reporting and fixing this issue!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6012 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6012/])

, Great, thanks [~andrew.wang]. I'll try to keep the file suffix in mind. I tend to flip-flop between diff and patch when using Subversion given the current phase of the moon :), FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #634 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/634/])
