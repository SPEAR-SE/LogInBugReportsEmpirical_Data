[I tried to minimize contention in the patch. From a comment section in the patch:

{code}
   * There are three different points where concurrent accesses happen.
   * 1) User-to-groups mapping: This is thread safe data structure, so
   *    putting and getting don't need to make them safe.
   * 2) cachedGroups: This needs to be protected from concurrent accesses.
   *    Also, the content needs to be kept in sync with 1).
   *    Synchronize on cachedGroups whenever updating mappings.
   * 3) refresh: Refresh requests need to be serialized.
   *    Caller to be synchronized on refreshLock.
   *
   * By separating into three, cache lookups are never explicitly blocked.
   * Regular cache add activities and refresh can mostly overlap. 
{code}

Improved:
* Refresh does not leave removed users in the cache.
* No more direct modification of values in the map. It wasn't thread safe.
* No more rebuild-from-scratch whenever a group is added.
* Addition of fine-grained locking., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
