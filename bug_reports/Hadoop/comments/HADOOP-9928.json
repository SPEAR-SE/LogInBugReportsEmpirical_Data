[Just ran into this on another project. The creation of the mds file is documented in the [release instructions|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease], but by my read of the [ASF release signing documentation|http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html#basic-facts], a file with suffix ".md5" must be present with each released artifact.

I'm also definitely in favour of having easily-verifiable artifacts via md5sum, for as long as md5sums are considered a necessary release artifact., It turns out, that the way hadoop (and and also hbase) do checksums is not what the ASF wants. The checksums are not supposed to be distributed via the mirrors and mds files are not the format required:
