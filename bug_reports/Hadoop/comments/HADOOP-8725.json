[I'm not sure how to easily write a test since there's not a supported way to set envs in java.  Well, that's non-extremely-dirty-and-hacky by using reflection to bypass the immutable map., I have manually verified that the changes fix the problem.  The change is small and looks good to me +1 assuming Jenkins comes back OK., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12542227/HADOOP-8725.patch
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    -1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
                        Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.
                        Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    +1 eclipse:eclipse.  The patch built with eclipse:eclipse.

    +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    +1 release audit.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common:

                  org.apache.hadoop.ha.TestZKFailoverController

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

This message is automatically generated., I've just run TestMRJobs with the patch and I'm still seen errors

Unless they are unrelated, the issue is still there., mmh, jenkings come back while I was writing my prev comment. But I believe jenkins is not testing MR, can somebody verify running {{mvn clean test -Dtest=TestMRJobs}}?, I did run all of the mr tests.  The only one that failed is TestProcfsBasedProcessTree, which seems to be a race condition.  I ran several jobs on a single node cluster with this patch and they all passed. so I am still a +1, but I would like others to chime in on if their tests pass., I was able to reproduce the errors Alejandro is seeing in TestMRJobs twice in a row.  However when I emptied my environment of Hadoop variables (e.g.: HADOOP_PREFIX, HADOOP_CONF_DIR, etc.) then the test passed twice in a row.  So apparently that test is sensitive to its environment., Because non-secure mode is completely broken currently, and this patch does seem to fix the issues.  Also because Jason and I both seem to have validated that the MR tests pass with this fix, I am going to check this in, simply because it seems better then the current state of trunk.  If we find other errors we can fix them on a different JIRA. , I checked this into trunk, branch-2, branch-2.1.0-alpha, and branch-0.23.

Thanks Daryn for a quick fix to this., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2633 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2633/])
