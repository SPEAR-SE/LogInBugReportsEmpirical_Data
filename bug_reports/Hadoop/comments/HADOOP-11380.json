This message is automatically generated., +1 as is, though it could be good to list common problems with rack awareness setup. You did mention missing topos, there is also

# wrong IP addresses in the script -may result in missing nodes  from the topology, even if you think you have them
# machines having wrong IP addrs. Same
# wrong machine to rack mapping: risk of scheduling "adjacent node" work on different racks, leading to increased backbone traffic. Possibly increased backbone traffic on writes. Possibly reduced resilience to failures.
# broken script. Check it on the CLI first. Consider keeping under SCM, maybe even tests (e.g PyUnit)
# out of date script. Have a process for updating it. Checking out from SCM is usually sufficient

BTW, you know you can edit documents in markdown now, under site/markdown/*.md ? Multiple editors, automatic rendering if pushed to github, bq. BTW, you know you can edit documents in markdown now, under site/markdown/*.md ? 

OH! No, I didn't!  Yes, this would be MUCH better to do under markdown.  I'm tempted to move some other docs to that as well. apt is... interesting. ;)  Awesome! Thanks!, The lack of a standard around table support in markdown makes it a less than great choice for a lot of documents. :(, I think I'm going to commit as-is.  We need to do a more comprehensive doc uplift anyway.

Thanks for the review [~stevel@apache.org]!, Committed to trunk., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6722 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6722/])
