[Ugh.  I like (3).  We should really try to limit public classes to the user API we intend to support long-term.  The only way I can see to achieve this is to compile the jsp's to servlets offline using Ant's jspc task, where you can specify a package., Here's something that will compile the jsp pages as servlets.  More changes are required to configure jetty to use them, but this is a proof of concept., The JSP pages are now pre-compiled to servlets that can access package-private classes.]
