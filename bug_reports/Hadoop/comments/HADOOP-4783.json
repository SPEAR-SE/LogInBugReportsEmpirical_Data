[Hemanth, since HADOOP-4782 is a blocker for 0.20, why isn't this issue too?  They seem to go together., Yes, I think it should be a blocker. Marking as such., I would propose we have 0710 permission for history directory and 0740 permission for history files, sothat clients like Chukwa and Hadoop-vaidya would read history files. Thoughts?, patch changing the permissiond properly, test-patch result:

This message is automatically generated., Code changes look good to me. +1, Also, the test case failure seems unrelated to this patch. It is in testProxyFilter., I just committed this to trunk and branch 0.20. The patch applied cleanly to the branch as well, I guess because HADOOP-4191 is committed now to the branch.

Thanks, Amareshwari !, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #780 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/780/])
    . Change permissions on history files on the jobtracker to be only group readable instead of world readable. Contributed by Amareshwari Sriramadasu.
