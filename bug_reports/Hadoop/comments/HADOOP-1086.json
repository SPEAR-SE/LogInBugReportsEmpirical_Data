[I forgot to mention that files 254 to 274 were declared "bad crc"., I checked the source code and I feel that dfs handles the file/dir rename correctly.

What was the command that caused the error? Did the command get issued more than once?, From my understanding of the problem, the command was issued only once. , This piece of code has gone away as part of  HADOOP-1134. This problem should not occur anymore.]
