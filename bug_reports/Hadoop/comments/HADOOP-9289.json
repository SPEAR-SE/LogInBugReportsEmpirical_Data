This message is automatically generated., Daryn, the docs need to be updated to indicate this behavior. For example man page on rm says:
{noformat}
     -f          Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation, regardless of the file's permissions.  If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify the exit
                 status to reflect an error.  The -f option overrides any previous -i options.
{noformat}

But this change can be done in a later patch.

, I committed the patch to trunk. Will soon merge it to other branches., I committed the patch to trunk, branch-2, 2.0.3 and 0.23.

Thank you Daryn!, The FsShell rm usage states:
{noformat}
-f     If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic
       message or modify the exit status to reflect an error.
{noformat}

How do you think the text should be updated?, I meant these options need to be added and the description needs to be added to user docs in {{hadoop-common/src/site/apt/FileSystemShell.apt.vm}}., Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #120 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/120/])
