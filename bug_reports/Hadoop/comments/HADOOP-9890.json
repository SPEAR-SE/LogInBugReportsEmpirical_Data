[The file {{hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/site/apt/SingleCluster.apt.vm}} provides instructions for building a hadoop tarball in the hadoop-mapreduce directory

The suggested operation {mvn clean install assembly:assembly}} halts on the first failed test.


A build with {{mvn clean install assembly:assembly -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip}} fails as there's no assembly defined.

The instructions in CLIMiniCluster appear to be the valid ones.

Rather than cut and paste the CLIMiniCluster docs, pulling out the 'how to make a tarball' instructions into a single .apt file should reduce maintenance costs and ensure consistency, I feel, this can be close now since it's not exists now.., The file has moved to {{SingleCluster.md.vm}}, reviewing that shows the problem no longer exists]
