[looks like someone wants a way to get a stack trace of wherever a configuration is created. Sometimes that could be useful. As it is only done if the debug log is enabled, its cost is otherwise minimal. 

Recommend leaving as is, file as INVALID or WONTFIX.
, Since it is showing stack trace, how about change the log level from debug to trace?, 2851_20080925.patch: use trace level instead of debug level., Talked to Chris: these debug messages do not seem useful.  So they are better removed.

2851_20081103.patch: removed the debug messages and fixed all unchecked warning in Configuration., Seem that this is not needed.  Closing this as "Won't Fix".]
