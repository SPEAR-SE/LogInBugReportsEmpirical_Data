[RawLocalFileSystem#setWorkingDiectory(path) if path is itself a relative path. 
It does not bother to convert it to an absolute path internally. Also, sadly, the existing tests for 
working directory never correctly checked if the setWorkingDirectory worked. 


, The attached path fixes the bug. I also backported one of more extensive tests for FileContext to FileSystem., Addressed Nicolas's feedback., +1 patch looks good., {noformat}

The javadoc warnings already exists in trunk and not related to this.

The patch also passed all unit tests., The calling of the obsolete rename was intended (the tests we ported use that).
