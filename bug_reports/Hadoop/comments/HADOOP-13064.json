[Here's an example that fails., Is this not a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-6481 in combination with MAPREDUCE-5948?, [~jellis] those two do look pretty related -- were you testing with version 2.7.1 by chance?  Can you check if your test passes in 2.7.2 which contains fixes for both those tickets?, Yeah just bumped to 2.7.2 and my broken test passed. We can close this out.]
