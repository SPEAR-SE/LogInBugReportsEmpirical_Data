[Some of the test failed on windows build #84 (Yahoo internal) are attached., all the above three tests passed on my local windows machine. Ran multiple times but could not reproduce failure., Is there anything in the log that points any suspects?, nothing obvious from the logs except that one problem is common in all test failures i.e. Lost tasktracker., Indeed this looks to be a machine issue. After the regression machine got changed build #89 onwards (Yahoo internal), all TestMiniMr* tests are passing., Can't be reproduced on my local machine as well as new regression machine.]
