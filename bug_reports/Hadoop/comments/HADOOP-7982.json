[In particular, I think Hive might have a bug which sets a thread's ContextClassLoader to null. In the JAAS LoginContext constructor, it saves off the thread's Context ClassLoader into a member variable, and then uses that CL when loading the HadoopLoginModule class. In the case that its a null CL, it fails because HadoopLoginModule isn't on the bootstrap classpath.

A workaround which fixes it is to temporarily change the thread's CCL to match the UGI class's ClassLoader, then flip it back. I don't know quite enough about correct/conventional classloader usage to know if this is the right fix or a hack., Here's a branch-1 patch which fixes the issue. Unfortunately I was unable to write a test case for it, since the login functionality uses a lot of static state, etc., +1 to the branch-1 patch, trunk patch (exactly the same code, just rebased to the right spot), -1 overall.

, Here's a test case which shows the issue. We tracked it down to a JNI issue -- if when using libhdfs, the thread that started the JVM isn't the same thread that first uses libhdfs, it will fail with the error described in the JIRA. The fix as committed solves the problem.]
