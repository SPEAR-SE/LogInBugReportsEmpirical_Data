[Hey Arpit, according to HIVE-6741 it sounds like folks are just planning to remove Hive's use of the Sasl properties, since Hive only fetches it to log it, this property is overridden anyway.  Change it if it will be of use to other callers, but it sounds like Hive will not be dependent on this one.  Thanks., Attaching the patch which changes the visibility, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

bq. Hey Arpit, according to HIVE-6741 it sounds like folks are just planning to remove Hive's use of the Sasl properties, since Hive only fetches it to log it, this property is overridden anyway. Change it if it will be of use to other callers, but it sounds like Hive will not be dependent on this one. Thanks.

Thanks for the pointer to the Hive Jira. I saw no harm in fixing this anyway., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5585 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5585/])
