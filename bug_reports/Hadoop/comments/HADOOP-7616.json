[This is caused by the three post commit Jenkins builds polling SVN at hadoop/common/trunk and detecting any change under that level:
* https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/
* https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-HDFS-trunk-Commit/
* https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-MapReduce-trunk-Commit/

I propose that we have a single job that runs at hadoop/common/trunk to write the JIRA comment and run maven deploy. If we want to add some fast post-commit tests at a later point it will be good to run all of them for a change in any project, since it will increase the probability of detecting breaking changes between projects.
 
, As discussed on common-dev, they've turned off all but one job.]
