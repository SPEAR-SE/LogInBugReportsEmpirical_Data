    Do not require user to set HADOOP_SSH_OPTS to a non-null string, allow
    setting of an empty string.

, I think this makes total sense.  If a user has configured, say, .ssh/config to do what it needs to do then there's no point in configuring HADOOP_SSH_OPTS.  Additionally, if someone has replaced the ssh functionality in the shell code, then this may have different requirements., Would it be better to make HADOOP_SSH_OPTS default to empty string?  I believe this was the case in Hadoop 2.X.

If say a user has configured everything in .ssh/config, they have to knowingly set HADOOP_SSH_OPTS to empty string to force it to be empty.  IMO this is the opposite of what most users would think.  Most would think they have to set HADOOP_SSH_OPTS if they need to., It was blank in prior versions of Hadoop. The goal of setting this to be not-blank and have actual options was to improve the "out of box" experience, especially for those without pdsh installed., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
