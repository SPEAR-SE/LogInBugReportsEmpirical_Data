[This patch uses a hack to workaround the bug.  Synch'ing on the streams before closing dovetails with the synch'ed {{ProcessPipeInputStream.drainInputStream}}.  The hack is a safe no-op on JDK6 because it does not drain the streams.

Y! has been using this patch in production for 8 months.  The problem was immediately reported to Oracle but a fix will not be available until around mid-year so we're providing this workaround to the community., No tests are included due to the difficulty of reproducing the bug on demand, and it's not hadoop's responsibility to have unit tests for JDK bugs., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Anyone want to review?  After moving to JDK7 in production, we had many NMs under load going OOM and crashing due to this bug.  Task retries masked that the cluster was slowly shrinking.  As noted above, we've been running production clusters for 8 months with this patch., bq.  ProcessPipeInputStream.drainInputStream's will OOM allocating an array if in.available() returns a huge number, or may wreak havoc by incorrectly draining the fd.
You've seen OOMs in practice? Or the closing of wrong streams?

I think I understand the race. Patch changes look good. Great that it's a no-op in JDK 6.

May be link to the corresponding source in openJDK here for posterity?

Also, may be you should be put the exact JVM version in the comment - to ease reasoning in the future., JDK bug has been verified as such by the devs and patched in 7u60: 
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8024521, Yes, we were losing ~10s of NMs/day because of OOMs caused by this bug.  After the patch, no OOMs.

The referenced openjdk bug is indeed the same problem.

Do I have a +1 to commit?, Can you add a reference to this JIRA as well as a link to the corresponding (buggy) JVM version in the java comment for posterity? We can revisit and revert this when the time is apt., Yeah, +1 barring that point about code comment., Added comments based on info provided by Steve.  Will commit when pre-commit passes unless there's objections to the comments.

Note: the original patch filenames had the wrong jira..., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
