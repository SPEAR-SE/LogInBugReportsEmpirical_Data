[I should comment that I also factored out a method in JobConf for

void setJarByClass(Class exampleClass);

to set the jar via an example class., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12350602/minimr-conf.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r504682., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
