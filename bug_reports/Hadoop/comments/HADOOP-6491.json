[On the other hand, passing HADOOP_OPTS in seems like a bad idea. For example, I use HADOOP_OPTS to turn on hprof, and I definitely don't want to profile the PlatformName script...

Instead, I'd suggest we check for already-set $JAVA_PLATFORM:

if [ -z "$JAVA_PLATFORM" ]; then
  JAVA_PLATFORM=`CLASSPATH=...blahblah`
fi

or perhaps try to match HADOOP_OPTS against \b-d(32|64)\b before running the magic command., Building our own hadoop shell scripts. Closing as won't fix.]
