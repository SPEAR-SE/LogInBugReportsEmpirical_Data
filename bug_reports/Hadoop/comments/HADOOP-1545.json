[Hairong, after the investigations we have done into this and lack of closure on causes for this particular job's failure do you think it makes sense to move this bug to 0.15 and hence mark it as a non-blocker for now? Thanks!, +1, Thanks Hairong, I'm marking this *critical* for 0.15.0, Do we know the causes for this now ?, The last we checked there were a couple of application-level issues... I'm closing this for now. Please feel free to re-open or file a new jira.]
