This message is automatically generated., Thanks Sathish for providing fix. I have just committed this to trunk, branch-2 and 2.2. Note: Your previous patch includes files from both HDFS and common files. I have committed only src part here and attached HADOOP-9114-002.1.patch what I committed as we need to keep changes lists in CHANGES.txt in respective project. Please file separate one in HDFS project for test if you want. I understand that testing checksumtype needed to add test in HDFS side., Thanks UMA for review and Commiting the patch

Acoording to your comments,test case is needed to test that dfs.check sumtype so i can add that test case in HDFS project ., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #399 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/399/])
