[the attached patches "--a" and "--b" correspond to the fix possibilities (a) and (b) respectively., Hi Ivan,

I think we should stick with the (b) option, since that's what we already use for handling other Unixes (e.g. AIX).

Also, could you add a unit test for MacOS to {{TestDFVariations}}?, Hi, Andrew, 
regarding the way (a): "-P" option of "df" command is especially designed to provide standard POSIX format of the output.
I cannot state about all Unix systems, but I experimentally confirmed that this option is supported on CentOS 6.3 and Mac 10.8.
I don't have AIX box, but documantation of AIX 6.1 also say that this option is supported, see http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v6r1/topic/com.ibm.aix.cmds/doc/aixcmds2/df.htm .

Okay, I will write the test., Attaching patches with the fixed/added tests.
The patches correspond to fix options (a) and (b): (a) uses -P df option and expects standard uniform POSIX output on all operating systems, while (b) does not use "-P", instead  providing special output handling for Mac.
 I would recommend solution "(a)" if we're able to test it on all supported OSs. If not,  I would recommend to take solution "(b)"., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
