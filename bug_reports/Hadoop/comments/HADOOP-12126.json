[Simple patch to use Configuration classloader when creating the DocumentFactory, Thanks for the patch [~laurentgo]! It looks like the patch has redundant diffs for the same file? Could you please update the patch? Also, the naming convention for the patch file is \{JIRA-id\}.\{sequence\}.patch (e.g. "HADOOP-12126.001.patch")., Attach correct patch file. The wrong patch name came from http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GitAndHadoop#Creating_Patches_for_attachment_to_JIRA_issues vs http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute#Generating_a_patch, The patch is fairly small, I would appreciate if someone can review it., I basically agree with the approach. Since DocumentBuilderFactory does not provide an option of passing in only the constructor when it gets an instance, this might be the best way of doing that.

Can you think of a way to write a unit test for this?

Also, it would be good to flip the state to "patch available" so we can run the jenkins on the patch., There are multiple places when we flip between classloaders, but none of them are covered by test. One possible way to test would be to create a fake ClassLoader, set it as the context classloader, and make sure it fails if someone tries to load the resource {{META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory}}, New patch with unit test, This patch fix some checkstyle errors, \\

This message was automatically generated., I agree that loading {{DocumentBuilderFactory}} has to be fixed, however, it should respect the {{classloader}} instance variable of {{Configuration}} instead of blindly resorting to {{Configuration.class.getClassloader()}}. By default, the {{classloader}} instance variable will point to ApplicationClassLoader. Thus we still have a problem that has to be resolved outside the configuration class in the {{ApplicationClassLoader}} of the app.]
