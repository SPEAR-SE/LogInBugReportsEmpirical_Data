[Also we we should probably revisit how the webui gets protected with SPENGO, which at the moment is documented as adding the AuthenticationFilterInitializer. If we already have the SPNEGO filter registered, it would be just matters of handling that in the code. This handling should be done with a switch as web UIs in many setups may not want to use SPNEGO as browsers are not configured to use Kerberos (instead they want to use the own custom intranet authentication), Removing Fix-version. Please use Target-version for the intended release and let committers set the fix-version at commit time.]
