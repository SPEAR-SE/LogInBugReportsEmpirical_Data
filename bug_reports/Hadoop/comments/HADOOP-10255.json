This message is automatically generated., A few minor comments.  (Is failure because patch build is against trunk and not branch2, the target for this patch?)

nit: Should you leave the -  @Deprecated in place?

nit: Do you want to explain in class comment why there is a class named HttpServer2: i.e. 'this class exists because hbasers were whining when their httpserver was taken away"?  Folks may wonder expecially in h3 when HttpServer is gone.  Do you want to add 'yarn' to the list of LimitedPrivate or is mapreduce suficient proxy for yarn?

Else looks good on quick review.  +1  Above could be addressed on commit.  Thanks for doing this [~wheat9], I marked this a blocker on 2.4 since without it downstreamers will be incompatible w/ 2.4.  Please recalibrate it if I have it wrong., Patch does not apply to branch-2.  Any chance of fixing it [~wheat9]?, Rebased the v2 patch on the current trunk., bq. nit: Should you leave the - @Deprecated in place?

{{HttpServer2}} is used by HDFS / YARN only. It is safe to remove all the deprecated methods.

I would prefer to landing this patch on trunk before porting it to branch-2., The v3 patch is for trunk only. It does not include the HttpServer in branch-2.2.

The patch for branch-2 should include the class from branch-2.2., +1 pending what hadoopqa says.

I can test a branch-2 patch when you put it up., [~wheat9] Any luck w/ a branch-2 patch?  Any ETA?  Would be good all around getting this 2.4 blocker behind us.  Thanks., Still waiting for Jenkins to come up.

My plan is to apply this patch to branch-2, then directly pull in the HttpServer in branch-2.2 into branch-2. How does it sound?, [~wheat9] Sounds great.  Thank you., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Now 2.3.0 will be taken from the tip of the branch, this becomes a 2.3.0 blocker.  Without this fix, downstream projects, HBase in particular, that work fine on 2.2.x cannot start on a 2.3.0., Are we going to end up having 2 copies of HttpServer in 2.2 now? If so, I don't think it is a good idea from a maintenance perspective. Can we get back the old one (the one that works with Hbase) and retrofitted to support the required stuff by Hadoop? The new one as not been shipped as part of a release, so we could easily revert that, right?, bq. Are we going to end up having 2 copies of HttpServer in 2.2 now? If so, I don't think it is a good idea from a maintenance perspective.
As agreed upon in HADOOP-10253, we will maintain two copies of HttpServer. One deprecated and retained for backward compatibility reasons. The other cleaned up version to be used only with in Hadoop. Undoing the cleanup is a lot of work and a step in the backward direction., Is there the intention of keeping, fixes-wise, both versions in sync until the old one is gone? If so, how do we facilitate that?, Two copies is ugly but agree it is probably easiest way of undoing the breakage.  The restored old httpserver(1) can have deprecated sprayed all over it.  Our [~jxiang] tried restoring old behaviors atop the refactored httpserver and ran into issues around https; having one-server only might not be too straight-forward., Splitting the task of bringing in HttpServer in branch-2.2 into HADOOP-10292.

This message is automatically generated., The branch2 version of this patch. The original HttpServer in branch-2.2 will be introduced in HADOOP-10292., [~stack], the https issue we met was some configuration issue related to the new HttpServer, just FYI., [~jxiang], can you please elaborate on this? The new {{HttpServer}} uses {{HttpPolicy}} to control whether to start a SSL server. The code is supposed to be backward-compatible. It seems to be a bug if it can't work with the old configuration., [~wheat9], we found we need to add the following to mapred-site.xml in order for resourcemanagers and nodemanagers to start in a secure cluster:
{noformat}
    mapreduce.jobhistory.webapp.spnego-principal
    mapreduce.jobhistory.webapp.spnego-keytab-file

This message is automatically generated., [~tucu00] To answer your question, httpserver will now have deprecated all over it and LimitedPrivate('HBASE') only, rather than ('HDFS, 'MAPREDUCE', 'HBASE').  It also has this note in class comment:

{code}
+ * This class comes from the HttpServer in branch-2.2. HDFS and YARN have
+ * moved to use HttpServer2. This class exists for compatibility reasons, it
+ * stays in hadoop-common to allow HBase working with both Hadoop 2.2
+ * and Hadoop 2.3. See HBASE-10336 for more details.

 If fixes, other than critical security holes, only make it to httpserver2 and not to httpserver, I think it ok.  The httpserver instance that hbase is using can be let rot.  Meantime over on our end we are undoing our dependency on this hadoop class.  So, yeah, two instances is less than ideal but ok if the old one is let go., [~wheat9] What you think of the trunk failures?  Let me retry your patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Looking at the test report, I believe that failure is irrelevant. MAPREDUCE-5719 tracks the failed unit test., [~wheat9] Ok.  I can commit this in morning unless objection., [~wheat9], please file a jira if you have further cleanup of HttpServer2. One thing we could do in that jira to remove deprecated method. I see one such method - #getPort().

+1 for the patch.

[~stack], once the copy of HttpServer is made in HBase, we can delete it from future 2.x release. This is an incompatible. However given this removal is breaking compatibility only for HBase and HBase will no longer use this class, such an incompatible change should be fine. Do you agree? We need to agree upon a release to align this change., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5051 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5051/])

, [~sureshms] Thanks for committing.  On 'We need to agree upon a release to align this change.', lets align on hadoop3 (hbase 0.96/0.98 depend on httpserver and should be able to run on any 2.x hadoops).  Thanks., FYI with the reswizzle of branch-2.3, I think this was missed. I just merged it to the new branch-2.3.]
