[Build has a workaround to pass the -Dyear=2011 as a build argument (or build.properties). Still the year should be updated before a release is cut.

Can one just bump up the copyright year in documentation, or does copyright expiration in # years start from the first publication and should the copyright reflect the year of creation/last modification of the doc?, Does trunk need fixing as well?, Eli: Yes I think so.
The only place where I see this in trunk is in the non-mavenized portion of mapreduce:
trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/build.xml

That part goes into the generated javadoc.
I cannot easily tell where javadoc is generated from in the Mavenized part of the build and if any date is injected there.

On <= 0.22 saveVersion.sh generates the year (date) part of the Compiled: message in the top of the NN and JT UI.
The year at the bottom of dfshealth.jsp and jobtracker.jsp seems to come from a static final HTML_TAIL in ServletUtil which is initiated with the current year from java.util.Calendar when the webapp starts., In the USA, the correct form of the year in a copyright statement (I've been told by multiple lawyers) is either:
* YYYY, the year in which the referenced document was created, eg 2009, or
* YYYY-ZZZZ, where YYYY is the year in which the first (oldest) version of the referenced document was created, and ZZZZ is the year in which the referenced document was most recently modified (newest), thus 2009-2011.

If a document has actually not been modified since its original creation year, then the first form is correct.
, Thanks Matt, that is what I seem to recall having heard as well.
With that I'll create a patch to update the year in the build scripts wich does into the generated javadoc.
I'll leave the other documentation alone until updates are done at which time -ZZZZ will be added on said pages., closing as stale]
