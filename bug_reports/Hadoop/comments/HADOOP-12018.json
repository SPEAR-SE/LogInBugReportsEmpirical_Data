[I'm thinking there are two patterns to fix this issue.
# Fix smart-apply-patch.sh.
# Document not to use "git diff --no-prefix" to create patch., I prefer the plan 1. The root problem is that smart-apply-patch can't recognise the patch created by 'git diff --no-prefix' as git's one. This patch enables smart-apply-patch to detect it and use 'git apply -p0' rather than 'patch -p0'., \\

This message was automatically generated., I found this issue cannot test by jenkins. This is because test-patch.sh applies the patch before updating smart-apply-patch.sh. I'll test the patch manually., Two comments:

1. {{has_prefix()}} returns 0 if the input is as follows:
{code}
diff --git hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/resources/images/rm-ha-overview.png hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/resources/images/rm-ha-overview.png
deleted file mode 100644
{code}
The method should return 1 with the input.

2. {{$1}} should be {{$PATCH_FILE}}.
{code}
# Case for git-diff patches
if [[ $(head -1 $1) =~ ^diff\ --git ]]; then
{code}, Note: I included binary file in {{HADOOP-12018.test-noprefix.patch}} intentionally to confirm that smart-apply-patch.sh will apply the patch by {{--binary}} option., Thanks [~ajisakaa], I'm attaching a fixed patch.
As for the first comment, the previous patch was a bit verbose. We can simplify it as an awk one-liner:

{code}
[sekikn@mobile ~]$ cat sample.patch

# Case for git-diff patches
if [[ $(head -1 "${PATCH_FILE}") =~ ^diff\ --git ]]; then

Detecting by the first line is not sufficient. Developers may upload the patch created by {{git format-patch}}, so grepping the line starts with {{diff --git}} would be fine., bq. Developers may upload the patch created by git format-patch, so grepping the line starts with diff --git would be fine.

Thanks [~ajisakaa], I didn't recognize such a case.
Attaching a revised patch. It seems to work fine.
