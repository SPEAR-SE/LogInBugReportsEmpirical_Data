Looking under the debugger the actual shell command to check if container is alive fails because the kill command syntax  "kill -0 -20773" fails.

This causes DefaultContainerExecutor#containerIsAlive to catch ExitCodeException thrown by ShellCommandExecutor.execute making it assume the container is lost., As per GNU linux [documentation|http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/kill-invocation.html#kill-invocation] "--" may not be needed, but looks like all distros (Debian) do not support  not having "--".
{noformat} If a negative pid argument is desired as the first one, it should be preceded by --. However, as a common extension to POSIX, -- is not required with ‘kill -signal -pid’. {noformat}
So a fix is to prefix "--" always to match the recommendation., Attaching patch that prefixes "--" when using negative pid for kill, [~cnauroth] appreciate your review, \\

This message was automatically generated., Fixed a new checkstyle that was added, the other two are preexisting and should not be fixed., Fixed whitespace , It looks it is a duplicate of YARN-3561. For fixing this issue, there is issue exist in hadoop-common i.e HADOOP-11989.
[~adhoot] would you have look at HADOOP-11989?, Thanks [~rohithsharma] for pointing it out. I have added a comment there why that fix is not working in all cases., \\

This message was automatically generated., +1 LGTM.  I think this better fixes the problem than HADOOP-11989 does; it also has a unit test.  Thoughts [~stevel@apache.org]?, This patch seems to address all the corner cases of the problem —and justify the workings, so I'm +1 for it, Thanks for the fix Anubhav.
