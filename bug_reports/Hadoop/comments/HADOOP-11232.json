[Probably the remote repo going down triggered this. Updating any nexus POM is dangerous as it now makes for even more inconsistent build results. 

Another fix should be for hadoop-common to explicitly include the artifacts that jersey 1.9 asks for -at which point there is no need for maven to follow up the transitive query.
