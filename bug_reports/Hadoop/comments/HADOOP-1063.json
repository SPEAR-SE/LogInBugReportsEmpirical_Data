[This patch removes the race condition in MiniDFSCluster. It guarantees that resources are released after a mini dfs cluster shuts down., I just committed this.  Thanks, Hairong., I'm getting a NullPointerException in MiniDFSCluster.DataNodeRunner.run()
        node.shutdown();
because node is null. Should it be just
        shutdown();
