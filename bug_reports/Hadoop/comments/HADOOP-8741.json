[Yeah instead of /current we need to point to /stable. The /current points to the latest release now., Harsh, currently we configure the links for the default configuration in Forrest's site.xml as external. Is this on purpose ? Or can we refer to the configuration html files generated as part of the doc build. That way, I suppose the cluster_setup can directly refer without going external. Since configuration changes per release, we should probably link relative, right ?

Also, I see lots of other files files referred this way, including streaming, distcp, HAR, etc., One reason for the current state is probably because of the first project split, when the links might have become external. Do we want to merge this back now ? (I see there's a general discussion going on about splitting to TLPs again, so waiting on this bug could be another option)., On version 2.x and above this is no longer an issue.
The affected documentations are 1.0.4 and 1.2.1. These versions are EOL.]
