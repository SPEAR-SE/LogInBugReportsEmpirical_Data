This message is automatically generated., We do not need the "volatile" so switch back to the original version. Now in the patch, the locking sequence corresponding to WritableComparator#define() is 1) lock L1 of the targeted comparable class object, and 2) lock L2 in WritableComparator, and 3) lock L3 in WritableComparator#comparators (which is a ConcurrentHashMap), and 4) release lock L3, and 5) release lock L2, and 6) release lock in L1. The lock sequence of get: lock L3 --> unlock L3 --> lock L1 of targeted comparable class object --> unlock L1 --> lock L2 --> unlock L2. So we should be able to avoid the deadlock now., Very interesting problem! Nice solution Jing.

Did you run the test code with this patch?
One thing I do notice is with your solution an extra call to forceInit() may be made. I believe this should not be an issue., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I think the reentrant lock is not needed.
In each of the sections guraded by the reentrant lock, the concurrent map is accessed only once.

Incidentally, I think it is better to make the concurrent map to be final., Yes,I forgot to include that - we could just use synchronized. 

Once you address Hiroshi's comments, I will commit the patch., Suresh and Hiroshi: thanks for the comments! I changed from reentrantlock to synchronized (I use the synchronized here to keep the same semantic with the original version). And the test program runs well with the patch., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I'm not sure why the synchronized is needed.
Do you mean, it is possible that someone locks the WritableComparator class object in other places in order to interfere in the define/get methods?, In the WritableComparator#get() a double check is used to replace the original synchronized static method. So I keep the synchronized in the double check to make sure there is no put operation happening during the second check and the construction of a generic comparator. But the synchronized can be omitted if we do not need to keep this semantic., Hiroshi, you're right! The synchronized is not necessary and since in forceInit something has been already added into the comparators. I will remove the synchronized from the patch., -1 overall.
