Did you see this problem recently?
I have checked the code and I do not really see what misconfiguration is needed to reproduce this.
The only case I saw cat errors related to pid file is HADOOP-13238., Yeah, I think this problem has likely been fixed by now via the other changes.  Let's close it for now.]
