Looks like that under the job history log directory on the jobtracker node,
the job log files of both the old jobs (prior to upgrade) and the new jobs (after upgrade) co-exist.
The Hadoop 0.19 does not recognize the format of the old jobs.
To workaround, just remove the old files under the history dir.
 , Runping, what is the format of the files you removed? Currently the job history file format is jobtracker-hostname_jobtracker-start-time_jobid_username_jobname., 
The old job log files I removed are in the form of JTStartTime_job_...

Also, I had to remove JobHistory.log

, This is due to history file format change (incompatible change) for HADOOP-2178. From 0.17 onwards, If history files pre-0.17 are present in history directory, they have to be removed., HADOOP-5149 fixes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.]
