[This patch addresses the race condition by moving the thread synchronization out of FlipFlopProxyProvider and into the method interface being invoked.  All threads will block in the method invocation *before* throwing the exception that triggers the failover.  Therefore the failovers will be concurrent wrt. RetryInvocationHandler.invoke() because both threads will always be in invokeMethod() at the same time.

Speaking of RetryInvocationHandler.invoke(), I also moved the proxyProvider.getProxy() call to occur only when the failover is performed per the previous comment.  It appears this was only moved out of that condition to avoid deadlock when the test thread synchronization was in FlipFlopProxyProvider.getProxy()., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I believe the -1 javadoc is unrelated to this patch., Thanks a lot for tracking down this issue and providing a patch, Jason.

A question for you about testing - given that this test would only fail intermittently before, have you tried running this test in a loop with and without the patch applied to *ensure* that the patch addresses the issue? I believe it should fix it, but just want to make sure. Also, can you comment on the frequency with which you'd observe this spurious test failure without the patch?

The patch looks good to me. I'll commit it once Jason comments on the above question., Before I submitted the patch I stepped through the code with the debugger to make sure I was seeing the two threads synchronizing within the invokeMethod(), so I have high confidence it should address the issue.  RE: failure rate, I was seeing it very intermittently when running the test directly via Eclipse, but then on my machine I can see the issue nearly 100% (e.g.: 34 out of 35 tries) with this build command:

mvn test -Dtest=TestFailoverProxy

With the patch I've never seen it fail from within Eclipse nor from the build command even when placed in a test loop., +1

Thanks a lot for this info, Jason. I'll commit the patch momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk. Thanks a lot, Jason!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1452 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1452/])
