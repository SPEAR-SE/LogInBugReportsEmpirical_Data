[Luca,

Could you also tell us if this is a regression, or a bug report as you feel the behavior should be different?, Hi Harsh,

I'd say it's a bug report as I feel the behaviour should be different.  I think it would be reasonable to assume that the Configuration object in the tasks should appear identical what was present in the job client process., Duping this to HADOOP-6228 since there are more people on that JIRA.]
