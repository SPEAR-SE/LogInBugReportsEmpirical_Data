This message is automatically generated., Thanks for taking this up, Akira.  What's the reasoning behind putting the full pathnames?  The hadoop metrics output directory is configurable, right?  Wouldn't changing it now require changing all the filename properties as well?, The reason putting the full filepath name is, it is a little troublesome to find the fullpath of the output directory when using default property(relative path).
The output directory is configurable, right.
I'll change all the filename properties as well, sorry, I forgot to change these below properties.

{code}
#nodemanager.sink.file_jvm.filename=jobtracker-jvm-metrics.out
#nodemanager.sink.file_mapred.filename=jobtracker-mapred-metrics.out

This message is automatically generated., IIUC, changing default output directory would be an incompatible change, so I don't think we should do that.  The rest of the patch looks good to me., [~sandyr], thanks for your review!
