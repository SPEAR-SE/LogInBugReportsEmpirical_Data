[https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2707//testReport/ is one example of a build which failed, Another example:

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HDFS-Build/2779/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.io.file.tfile/TestTFileByteArrays/, I think this is failing for similar reasons to HADOOP-7111. That patch added the following:
{code}
  private int records1stBlock = NativeCodeLoader.isNativeCodeLoaded() ? 5674 : 4480;
  private int records2ndBlock = NativeCodeLoader.isNativeCodeLoaded() ? 5574 : 4263;
{code}
But the condition is wrong. If the native libs are present but they don't have gzip support compiled in (eg the gzip devel libraries weren't present at compile time), then it should use the non-native expected values. Instead we should check specifically for the zlib native code., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
