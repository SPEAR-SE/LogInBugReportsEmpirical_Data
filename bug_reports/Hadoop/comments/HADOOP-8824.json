[This patch updates the link to point to the correct place, and also moves configuration.xsl to the proper place to have it be used.  Once I get approval for the patch I can do the actual svn when I check it in. , I meant to say the actual svn move, so the history of the .xsl is not lost., +1 - manually generated the docs with this patch and it works now to include yarn-default.xml, Oops looks like this is a dupe, and just did not get into 0.23.  I'll upmerge instead.]
