This message is automatically generated., Ran a 2-node cluster, one with the patch and one without. Logged the hostname: the one with the patch doesn't have a '.' while the other one has.

If one were to write a unit test for this, we should either (1) mock InitialDirContext's getAttributes method (it is not static either) or (2) write a singleton wrapper for InitialDirContext and modify the method in the context of the test. Manual verification validates the fix., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Karthik, the patch seems fine to me, and I agree that the patch is so simple and writing a test sufficiently difficult that it seems unnecessary to write a test for this.

One question - can you comment on the ramifications of this issue? How does it manifest itself? And what triggers it?, Thanks Aaron for taking a look at the patch.

Consider a cluster setup where hadoop_allowed_hosts.txt is used to list nodes that can be included, say nodes are 'sample1', 'sample2'. Now, if they also choose to fix the interface to be used (say eth0), the TTs during initialization call themselves 'sample1.' and 'sample2.', note the '.' at the end of the hostnames. Now, as this doesn't match any of the nodes listed in the file, the two TTs are disallowed to join. Ideally, the TTs should identify themselves as correct hostnames without '.' at the end.

The code path that the patch modifies is invoked only when we specify a particular interface, otherwise the default/canonical hostnames are picked. As for when {{InitialDirContext#getAttributes()}} returns a hostname with '.' at the end, I am not quite certain - it didn't show up on a pseudo-distributed test., Thanks a lot for the explanation, Karthik. Makes sense, and the patch seems quite straightforward.

+1, I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-1.
