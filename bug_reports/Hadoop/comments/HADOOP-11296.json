[Issue was 'xargs' will consider full line of input as one argument when it reads from stdin/pipe.
in {{hadoop-functions.sh#hadoop_connect_to_hosts}} {{SLAVE_NAMES}} was space separated hostnames in one line. So it was considering whole list as one host. 
Here is the code snippet.
{code}    echo "${SLAVE_NAMES}" | \
    xargs -n 1 -P"${HADOOP_SSH_PARALLEL}" \
    -I {} bash -c --  "hadoop_actual_ssh {} ${params}"{code}, Hi [~aw], can you take a look at the patch? thanks, Lowering the Priority to major as this is only in trunk., [~vinayrpet] Which version of hadoop are you using?

, [~iwasakims],

You can verify using following test code
{code}#!/bin/bash

function printValue(){
  echo "Printing args : $@"
}

export -f printValue

echo "arg1 arg2" | 
 xargs -n 1 -P 10 -I {} bash -c -- 'printValue {} remaining args'{code}

output will be : {noformat}arg1 arg2 remaining args{noformat}

But expected is {noformat}arg1 remaining args
arg2 remaining args{noformat}

in the above test try replacing {code} echo "arg1 arg2" | {code} with
 {code}echo "arg1
arg2" | {code}, [~iwasakims], thanks for the heads up. It looks like it is difficult to fix, so I probably just leave it as is., Thank for the test code, [~vinayrpet]. I understand that xargs changes the behaviour by {{-I}} option. Adding comment about {{-I}} would be help., added comments regarding the xargs, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., It looks like this is dependent upon either the version of bash or the version of xargs, as I'm having trouble reproducing this on OS X.  Even the test code gives me the expected output.  What version is showing the problem?, OK, it looks like OS X is the outlier.  I've been able to reproduce this on both Linux and Illumos. As part of that, it looks like Illumos xargs doesn't support -P parameter (SVID issue? non-POSIX extension?).  At first glance, the patch seems reasonable, but I want to test a few things out. :), Any update on this [~aw] ? thanks, +1 passed all of my tests.  Thanks!, Thanks [~aw].
