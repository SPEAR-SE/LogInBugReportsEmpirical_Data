I'll hazard a guess that you've never tested with a user name containing a space character. *bigger smile*, DistributedFilesystem also gets a user's working directory by reading the system property "user.name". Could you please fix it too?, 2833_20080227.patch: fixed DistributedFileSystem.getHomeDirectory()., 2833_20080227b.patch: using UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUGI()., 2833_20080227.patch:
UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUGI() does not work since it does not compatible with the current codes, which save ugi to conf.  If we want to change everything to UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUGI(), we should create a jira to do so., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1 The patch looks good., I just committed this. Thanks Nicholas!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #419 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/419/]), 0.16.2 need this patch:
HADOOP-2915 reads user information from conf and use it as a part of FileSystem cache key.  Without this patch, user information will not be stored in conf.  It leads to an inconsistent state in FileSystem cache., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #445 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/445/])]
