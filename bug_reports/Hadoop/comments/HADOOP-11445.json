This message is automatically generated., The first -1 points to the patch itself rather than the testing results, so not sure which tests failed. Also, this patch is related to core components: hadoop-common and hadoop-mapreduce-client-core and unit tests for them have passed, then it should be fine right?

Could somebody please take a look?, Sorry I misread the results after patch application. It looks like -1 for overall is due to -1 for findbugs. But these warnings doesn't seem to be generated by the code that this patch touches.

Could someone from the commiters please take a look and suggest?, Nice catch, Ankit!  Increasing the severity of this bug since it involves silent data loss.

+1 the changes look good to me, and the findbug warnings are unrelated.  I agree that BZip2Codec should not be scanning for the next block if the current block starts at the split.  Ran the unit tests without the change and they fail, as expected.

Committing this., Thanks, Ankit!  I committed this to trunk and branch-2., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6816 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6816/])
