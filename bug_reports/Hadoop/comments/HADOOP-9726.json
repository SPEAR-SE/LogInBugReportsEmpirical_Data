[My two cents:

1. I don't understand why there is configuration for a utils class
2. a static initialization block and a static setter for this both stand out as an anti-pattern to be avoided - this will introduce problems in the long run where multiple tenants or the like require different settings - perhaps even in tests we need different settings

I don't believe the answer is to continue the anti-pattern but rather to refactor the utils class to accept the settings as part of the interaction.

Hitesh - what is the scenario that you need to override the settings for?
, [~lmccay] My concern is mostly related to creation of a configuration object that can be avoided by passing in an already initialized one with say HADOOP_SECURITY_TOKEN_SERVICE_USE_IP set to the non-default value. , [~lmccay] attached a change which is less invasive based on the current usage. I would prefer to leave the re-factor to anyone else who is more familiar with the usage of SecurityUtil and willing to take a crack at it., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
