This message is automatically generated., We should also state that the cygwin versions work too. Looking at my [[slider notes for windows dev|https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/slider/site/trunk/content/developing/windows.md]]:

{code}

1. Follow the Hadoop `BUILDING.TXT` instructions. 
1. install cygwin64 with its `sh` command.
1. Get the cygwin64 bin dir on the PATH (remember, ";" as separators)
1. find where the `CL` C/C++ compiler is and make sure it is on the PATH
1. get the (native) [CMake 2.8+](http://www.cmake.org/) command on the path, 
not any cygwin one.


Things to install in cygwin
* `sh`
* `ls`
* `rm`
* `cp`
* `gzip`
* `tar`
* `awk`
* `grep`
* `xargs`


## Avoid

* having cygwin `cmake` on your path; it must be the native cmake

### env variables

    CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning 
    PATH = cmake bin, cygwin bin, python bin, hadoop_home bin (see below)
    
example:

    C:\bin\cygwin64\bin;C:\bin\Python27\;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;
    C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;
    c:\java\jdk7\bin;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Windows Performance Toolkit\;
    C:\apps\maven\bin;C:\apps\Git\cmd;c:\bin;
    C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\12.0\Bin;
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin;
    C:\bin\cmake-2.8\bin;C:\bin\hadoop\bin;C:\bin\OpenSSL\bin
    

### Commands to test CLI setup

    cmake --version
    openssl version
    python --version
    git --version
    tar --version

    ﻿java -version
    mvn --version

    msbuild /version
    cl /help

and for hadoop, once installed

    winutils sysinfo
    ﻿hadoop version
    ﻿hadoop checknative 
    
{code}

Most of these instructions could be moved over to the BUILDING.TXT doc...., Hi [~rkellogg].  Thanks for the report.

Are you finding that make is actually running on Windows at any point?  I thought this was only called behind the "native" Maven profile, which only triggers on Unixes.  On Windows, there is a separate "native-win" profile which would use some combination of cmake and msbuild instead of make., Updated patch to follow in next few days incorporating comments from above., [~cnauroth] you are correct.  I did a search for all references to exec tags and had neglected to look at the higher level profile.  Make is not used with the native-win profile.]
