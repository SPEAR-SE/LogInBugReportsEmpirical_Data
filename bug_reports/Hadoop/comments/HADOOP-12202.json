* fix a bug where files that failed lint got deleted, even when running in non-lint mode, I blame the code reviewer who +1'd it earlier.  :-)

+1 for v01.  Thanks for fixing this.

I just noticed that releasedocmaker.py is using a mix of 2-space and 4-space indentation.  I filed HADOOP-12204 as a minor follow-up jira to clean it up., Thanks for the quick review.

Committed to branch.

I guess we need to figure out what to do about hadoop trunk, but I'm inclined to just revert the last patch to it without the lint mode., \\
