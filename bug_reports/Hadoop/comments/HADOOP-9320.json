[Attached a patch that moves the ARM JVM float ABI detection down below the search for JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY. It also improves the diagnostics a bit by reporting which library it's examining and positively confirms if it finds a hard-float JVM., Note that I tested the attached patch with both JDK7 soft-float and JDK8 (preview) hard-float on ARM and with JDK7 on x86-64., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Could someone please commit this patch? The build is broken for ARM hard-float systems, which are now the default. (Oracle 7u40 supports armhf.) This fix trivially reorders two chunks of JNIFlags.cmake so that JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY is defined before it is used, and it has no effect on other platforms. Thanks., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~scurrilous], can you please rebase the patch? Thanks., I no longer have the ability to test this patch, as I have no access to an ARM Linux environment. I don't really work on Hadoop anymore either, for that matter, so I'm not sure of the status of this issue.
, This problem still exist with Hadoop 2.8. Unfortunatelly, the patch doesn't work for this version. I updated the patch to work with Hadoop 2.8:

, GitHub user amuttsch opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/224

    HADOOP-9320 Fix Hadoop native build failure on ARM hard-float

    Moved the ARM JVM float ABI detection from `HadoopCommon.cmake` to `HadoopJNI.cmake`, because `${JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY}` is not available in `HadoopCommon.cmake` yet and therefore the build fails.
    
    This commit fixes this issue.
