This message is automatically generated., Hey Arun, fix looks good, just a few comments:

* Can we expand the comment a bit? Not necessarily obvious to the reader why the UGI would change.
* The test additions end up sleeping for an additional 20seconds, which is quite substantial. Is there a way we can test this without such long sleeps?

Thanks again!, Thanks for the review [~andrew.wang], Updating patch :
* added more comments
* cut down total sleep time from 20 to 8 secs (We unfortunately need atleast 4 secs to ensure the rollover signer rolls over atleast twice... and I put in another 4 to be on the safe side), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The test failure looks unrelated..., +1 LGTM, I guess it's hard to decrease the test time further. Will commit shortly., TYs again Arun, committed to trunk and branch-2., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6919 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6919/])
