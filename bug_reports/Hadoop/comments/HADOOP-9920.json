[Duplicate of HADOOP-9853 or vice-versa., Hi Jason,

Comparing the error message logged in HADOOP-9853 and here, I don't think they are completely the same, but since patch attached here will upgrade the maven-surefire-plugin version to 2.16, I guess the patch might also resolve the issue mentioned in HADOOP-9853.

I'm sure with patch here, it at least won't hit SUREFIRE-910 any more. :-), We are upgrading to maven-surefire-plugin 2.16 in HDFS-4491, which I intend to commit tomorrow., Hi [~cnauroth],

Ok, good to know, and it's great that we can parallel HDFS UT running with HDFS-4491. :), This has been fixed by HDFS-4491., Upgrading maven-surefire-plugin to 2.16 resolves the error message mentioned in Description of bug., +1 for the patch.]
