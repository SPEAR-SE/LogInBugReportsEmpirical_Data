[This patch renames the "stdout" log4j appender to "console" and sends the log events to stderr instead of stdout. This _partially_ fixes Yoram's problem., It is also arguable whether the default logger for applications should be "WARN,console" or "INFO,console". The default is currently info, which is why you're seeing those messages. The default can be changed via the environment variable HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER or the log4j.properties file in the config directory., I just committed Owen's patch, for inclusion in 0.3.2.  If this fix is not sufficient, please file a new bug.  Thanks!]
