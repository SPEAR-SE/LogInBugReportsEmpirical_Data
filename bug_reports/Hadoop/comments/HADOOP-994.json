[A block report now can return a maximum of BLOCK_INVALIDATE_CHUNK number of blocks to be deleted. If more blocks were to be deleted, they are sent out to the datanode through heartbeat responses., Code reviewied by Milind. , +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12352069/blockReportInvalidateBlock.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/hadoop/trunk/513935. Results are at http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch, I committed this.  Thanks, Dhruba!]
