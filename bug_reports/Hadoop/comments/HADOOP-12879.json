[I agree.  But we need to tread carefully here.

The Hadoop Auth guide is actually written from the perspective that it can be used by multiple frameworks and live (mostly) independently.  So when it talks about e.g., PREFIX.kerberos.keytab in the examples above, dfs.web.authentication is an example of a PREFIX.

, I'm not totally sure how it works. Does it work like one set of parameters takes precedence over others? It would great if someone understand it can write better docs. A CDH cluster uses {{hadoop.http.authentication.kerberos.keytab}}, as far as I know.]
