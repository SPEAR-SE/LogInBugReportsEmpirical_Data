[Our fix to get around the issues has been to add exclusion filter to 'rsync' under hadoop-daemon.sh script:

Original:
  rsync -a -e ssh --delete --exclude=.svn --exclude='logs/*' --exclude='contrib/hod/logs/*' $HADOOP_MASTER/ "$HADOOP_HOME"

Updated with fix:
 rsync -a -e ssh --delete --exclude='pids/*.pid' --exclude=.svn --exclude='logs/*' --exclude='contrib/hod/logs/*' $HADOOP_MASTER/ "$HADOOP_HOME"
, This has probably been fixed as part of the shell script rewrite]
