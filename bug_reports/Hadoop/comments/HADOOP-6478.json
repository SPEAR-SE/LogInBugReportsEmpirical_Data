This message is automatically generated., You might want to check HADOOP-6407 first., HADOOP-6407 would be the way to go, if done right. Just retaining this as a placeholder until that closes and then we can circumvent the need altogether. Thanks. , Does HADOOP-6407 solve this for you?, Have not tried that yet ..
