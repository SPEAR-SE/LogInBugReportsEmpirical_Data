[3951_20080813.patch: fixed the names., No new tests added since the patch only changes some names.  Passed all tests locally except the ones in HADOOP-3950.  Submitting ..., Marking this as an incompatible change for consumers of log output, Replaced other hard-coded getLog requests..., Chris, you are ambitious.  I like that.  Assign this to you.  :), +1 Patch looks good.

Minor comments:
- It would be great to make all LOG variables final.  In general, all static variables should be final.

- We could use LogFactory.getLog(XXX.class) instead of LogFactory.getLog(XXX.class.getClassName())
, bq. It would be great to make all LOG variables final. In general, all static variables should be final.

Agreed, but this is OK for now.

Sure. It's the [same|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/logging/trunk/src/java/org/apache/commons/logging/impl/LogFactoryImpl.java?view=annotate] either way, but using the class is more readable., I just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
