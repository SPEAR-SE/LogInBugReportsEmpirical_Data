[Fix this for the 0.16 release., Turns out the fix is needed in the hadoop build.xml file inside in the tar target rather than fixes down in hbase build.xml.  Attached patch makes it so scripts in $HADOOP_HOME/contrib/*/bin all get their execute bit set (I should have included this fix in HADOOP-2207).

I pegged it as Major rather than as Critical or Blocker since its not the end-of-the-world if folks have to do chmod on hbase bin directory to make things work., Try patch against hudson., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
