[The hadoop command also doesn't seem to pick up on the top-level conf dir, I have to explicitly pass it to via the "config" option, eg

{noformat}
hadoop-0.24.0-SNAPSHOT $ ./bin/hadoop --config conf namenode -format 
{noformat}
, Have to explicitly set HADOOP_CONF_DIR in hadoop-env.sh for any of the bin and sbin commands to work., There should be only one template copy which has been utilized by hadoop-setup-conf.sh to jump start new comer to configure hadoop clusters.

{noformat}
./etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml
./share/hadoop/common/templates/conf/hdfs-site.xml
{noformat}

It seems there are certain artifacts left over from project refactoring.  Some clean up would be nice., Closing as Won't Fix since none of it exists in trunk anymore.]
