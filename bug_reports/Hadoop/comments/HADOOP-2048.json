This message is automatically generated., Given HADOOP-2049 and HADOOP-2050, changing the way distcp handles failures seems warranted. This deletes partial copies and fails the map in FSCopyFilesMapper::close. Though it may repeat work if 'overwrite' or 'update' are set, it should handle retries properly., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., This is a very important patch for distcp to ensure that the copy worked correctly and should be part of 15., A couple of issues:
  1. Please use better/longer variable names.
  2. The failures shouldn't be stored, but always logged at the INFO level.
  3. I'd change the bfailed flag to failureCount and have the final exception record the number of failures.
  4. Don't bother doing a time limit on the status reporting. The framework already limits it down to once a second.
  5. Just use the status message to record # bytes copied, # files copied, # failures, since particular failures will be overwritten too quickly. You just want the user to know that there is something to look at in the logs., Addressed comments, Added counters, I just committed this. Thanks, Chris!, Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #282 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/282/])]
