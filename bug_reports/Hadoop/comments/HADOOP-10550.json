[came across this documentation for a prior release 
http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.0.4/HttpAuthentication.html

Should the fix be to update the document with similar steps?, Looking into this. Will try to upload a patch with replacement for these terms if I see them in hadoop-common. , It looks like this is not an issue anymore on trunk? 
Latest HttpAuthentication.md on trunk has the wording as "ResourceManager, NameNode, NodeManagers and DataNodes)" 

https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-
common/src/site/markdown/HttpAuthentication.md

Also, in hadoop-common, I see the following, so I think there isn't anything to fix here? 

{code}
[machine-channapattan hadoop-common-project (trunk)]$ grep -rni jobtracker * | grep md | grep -vi changes  | grep -vi releasenotes | grep -vi deprecatedproper
hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop.cmd:58:@rem   HADOOP_{COMMAND}_OPTS etc  HADOOP_JT_OPTS applies to JobTracker
hadoop-common/src/main/bin/hadoop.cmd:122:  set mapredcommands=pipes job queue mrgroups mradmin jobtracker tasktracker
hadoop-common/src/site/markdown/RackAwareness.md:114:#       |jobtracker|    |datanode|

, Closing as "Not a problem". ]
