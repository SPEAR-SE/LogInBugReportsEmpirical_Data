[It's  not in there to keep the dependency graph down; add jets3t and will work

All S3 support moves in 2.6+ to the hadoop-aws JAR, along with s3a:; these do explicitly add the dependencies, on the basis that if you pull in that JAR, you want the dependencies,

I'm closing this as a wontfix. Sorry, Thanks [~stevel@apache.org] for the explanation. I missed that things look different on the trunk. Yes, I'm fine with wontfix.]
