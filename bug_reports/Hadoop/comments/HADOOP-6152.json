We are currently doing manual tests for scripts. Could you post the manual test results and "Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch"?, Fixed more bugs in the script. Attaching (hopefully!) final version.

My test procedure:

* I have checked out the projects in {{\~/src/git/hadoop-common}}, {{\~/src/git/hdfs}}, and {{\~/src/git/mapred}}.
* Create directory links:
{code}
$ cd ~/src/git/hadoop-common
$ ln -s ~/src/git/hdfs hdfs
$ ln -s ~/src/git/mapred mapred
{code}
* Build all three projects:
{code}
$ cd ~/src/git/hadoop-common
$ ant clean jar
{code}
* Repeat in hdfs, mapred
* If you want version info to be accurate, run 'ant jar' again in all three directories.
* Configured a pseudo-distributed cluster in hadoop-common/conf/mapred-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, core-site.xml
* Start services:
{code}
$ cd ~/src/git/hadoop-common
$ bin/hdfs namenode -format
$ bin/start-dfs.sh
$ bin/start-mapred.sh
{code}
* Prove that it works:
{code}
$ bin/hadoop version

Hi Aaron, I tried an earlier version of the patch (with some additional fixes).  Everything works fine except for the jsp web pages (e.g. http://namenode:50070/dfshealth.jsp).  Have you checked it with your latest patch?

+1 on the latest patch which fixes many problems.   We may commit it first and fix the jsp problem, if there is any, in a new jira., This doesn't fix the JSP issue. I think that'll require a separate issue. I've gotten closer to fixing some JSP build-process stuff in my MAPREDUCE-679 and HDFS-453 patches which are as-yet uncommitted. But they still don't totally fix the issue. (To test them, I am manually copying the build/webapps/ and build/classes/ hierarchies on top of one another.), I have committed this.  Thanks, Aaron!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk #70 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk/70/])
