[This seems to be working for multiple maps after recent patches  HADOOP-788 and HADOOP-929. Can you please reconfirm if you are still facing this issue. , Mahadev, can you please verify if this problem is resolved? Thanks!, the reducer none problem is still not fixed in the current trunk. It is still broken. The jobs fail consistently with -reducer NONE., java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: java.net.URISyntaxException: Relative path in absolute URI: input_file:269+270

This is the exception I get on running with -reducer NONE
, PipeMapRed:getSideEffectFileName which would put ':' in the 'fileName' as <fileName:offset:length> (via FileInput.toString()); this multiple colons cause an URI exception while constructing the path.

I've fixed that to put '-' instead of ':' and seems to work... I'd appreciate any review/feedback since I'm not too conversant with streaming...

Mahadev, could you check this patch and let me know if it works? Thanks!, Better tested post HADOOP-1029., -1, because 2 attempts failed to build and test the latest attachment (http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12351850/HADOOP-878_20070222_2.patch) against trunk revision http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/hadoop/trunk/510644. Please note that this message is automatically generated and may represent a problem with the automation system and not the patch. Results are at http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch, Looks like it was TestCheckPoint which failed, which obviously this patch doesn't affect... could we ignore the -1?, I just committed this.  Thanks, Arun!]
