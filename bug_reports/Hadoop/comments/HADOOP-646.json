[Maybe we can avoid using the available() method completely. Can we first find the size of the edits file and then issue the appropriate number of readByte() calls? , Dhruba,

Finding out number of entries from the size of the edits file is not possible, since these are not fixed size entries. However, trying to read a next byte and ending when we get an EOFExxception will allow us to avoid the call to available() completely. I am attaching a patch (untested for files > 2G) which does exactly that.

Christian,

Can you try this patch out for the backed-up edits file (6.5 G) that you have and let me know if it worked ? (It should be safe to try this patch out if you backup your image.)

- milind, Patch for christian to test his large edits file loading., Sorry to get back so late, but the previous large edits file was deleted, and I had to wait for another 'big' one to be generated. I tested the patch on a 3.2GB edits file, and it seemed to have loaded it okay (sampling of files to be copied to local worked). FYI, the loading took more than 10 minutes, and during that time  the name node server was not available., I just committed this.  Thanks, Milind!]
