Moving to 1.5 is fine for us, in fact I recommend it., Ok, this patch adds a timer for the map output copy threads. If they don't make progress often enough. (Progress is defined as receiving a block of data from the http server.) I've been testing it for the last two days and it seems to be working, but if we go to java 1.5 we should probably use the socket timeouts., Does Pingable really need to be a public interface in the util package?  The util package could easily get cluttered with stuff that's only used in one place.  Any objection if I make this a package-private interface in mapred, or perhaps even a nested class?, Ok, I moved the Pingable interface to be an inner interface to MapOutputLocation., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
