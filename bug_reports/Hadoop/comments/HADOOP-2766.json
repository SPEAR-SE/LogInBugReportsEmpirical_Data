[Fixed this. Now users can set HADOOP_OPTS by specifying it in configuration parameters gridservice-mapred.envs or gridservice-hdfs.envs depending on where it need to be specified. Any special characters present have to escaped.

                  e.g: ./bin/hod -c ~/hodrc.old -o "allocate ~/hod/clusterpath 4" -t ~/hadoop-0.17.0-dev.tar.gz --gridservice-hdfs.envs="HADOOP_OPTS=-XX:+MaxFDLimit\ -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio\=70" --gridservice-mapred.envs="HADOOP_OPTS=-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio\=70"

Also forcing validation of both envs variables, absence of which was throwing uncaught exceptions when invalid list of keyval pairs is specified by user., +1

Patch looks good.
Also tested with both trunk and earlier version and passing single and multiple values in the HADOOP_OPTS through the envs option.

Also tested that invalid key value pairs now fail with a proper error., +1 
Ran hod after applying patch with follwoing options -:
hod -c conf/hodrc0.16 -b 4 -o "allocate clusterDir1 3" --gridservice-mapred.envs='HADOOP_OPTS=-Dmy.env\=\"Hello\,World\:Test\/test1\;tt\"\ -Xms512m\ -XX\:\-UseParallelGC -XX\:\-RelaxAccessControlCheck,HADOOP_HEAPSIZE=2048,HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER=DEBUG\,console' --gridservice-hdfs.envs="HADOOP_OPTS=-Dmy.env\=\'World\:Test\'\ -Dmy.env2\=\'hodtest/HOD\'\ -XX\:\+MaxFDLimit -
XX\:\+UseBoundThreads -XX\:\+UseTLAB,HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/home\:/proc,HADOOP_HEAPSIZE=2048,HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER=DEBUG\,console"

Also tried it by setting value in hodrc.
Note--: If in hodrc some value of key=value params contains ';' then value from ';' afterwards will be ignored. Same thing works from commandline.
Tried with bot hadoop 0.16 and hadoop 0.15 
Also ran smoke test successfully with static dfs , See also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2551, Patch looks fine. Submitting now., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hudson gave a -1 because of failure of the test case org.apache.hadoop.dfs.TestBalancer.testBalancer0 which is in no way related to this patch or HOD. The patch can be passed., The same patch applies cleanly to both trunk and release 0.16. No issue being left unresolved, the patch is committable., I just committed this. Thanks, Vinod!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #406 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/406/])]
