[If you can figure out a way to contribute the javadoc fixes, that would be awesome.  Can you maybe create a diff patch from what you have and then just delete/revert the parts that aren't javadoc changes?, Unfortunately the changes I have done to Javadoc in the beginning are destructive since I was not thinking initially about the possibility of committing the code (and since I am just prototyping it made no difference for me to have or not to have the docs). I think it would be better to checkout the branch-2.6 again and apply the proper changes. I can try to do so this (less likely) or next weekend., The patches are all done for Hadoop 2.7+, but not branch 2.6

bear in mind that Hadoop 2.6 doesn't, AFAIK, work properly on java 8; Kerberos related.

my recommendation is build/release on java 6 or 7, or go {{-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true}}

looking at BUILDING.TXT, we don't mention that standard switch...we  ought to]
