[Note that the problems in test-patch.sh seem to be fixed in trunk, but interestingly it is not backported to 0.20., Added java5.home and forrest.home definitions to all ant commands. Added curly braces for ${10} (JAVA5_HOME)., +1 patch looks good., I have committed this to 0.20 only.  Thanks, Hong!]
