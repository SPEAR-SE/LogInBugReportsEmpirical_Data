[Runping, Can you paste the last lines from the JT log (including the last task) where it is complaining that it cannot connect to namenode.  Is it complaining in garbageCollect()?, Java Stack trace for the JobTracker process, Looked offline at a JT which was in this state. It looks like, due to an exception while updating the job history file (FSError exception) during heartbeat processing, the JT couldn't process the heartbeat completely leading to this inconsistent state. Maybe we should move to a model where we queue up everything to be written to the disk/dfs (mainly when a task is launched/succeeded/failed/killed), and let the JT deal with just in-memory datastructures during heartbeat processing.. That will lead to faster heartbeat processing as well., We can queue DFS writes, but still might wish to have disk writes inline for the sake of immediate availability of JobHistory for JobRecovery. Or in the minimum, we should give higher priority to disk writes while queuing JobHistory writes., 
The problem may be due to the following exception logged in jt log:
