[This patch allows under replicated blocks to be added to neededReplication when data nodes get started, +1. Code reviewed. Looks good., +1.  I have manually tested this patch.  I now see replications taking place right away for missing blocks.  If I bring the missing node back on line, replications stop and over replicated blocks are deleted.  Very cool!  It would be nice to have a unit test for this case., I just committed this.  Thanks, Hairong!]
