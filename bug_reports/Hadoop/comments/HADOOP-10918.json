[Adding a protected method {{isInstrumentationAccessAllowed}} that can be overridden by services not running with Jetty, Patch that adds a method to the JMX servlet to allow subclassing and overriding the authorization check. It also changes the "UNAUTHORIZED" response to "FORBIDDEN" in HttpServer2 as UNAUTHORIZED on its own should indicate also the expected authentication mechanism. 

It also wires a subclassed JMX servlet for KMS.

I've tested on local deployment that JMX works fine from KMS with the change (cannot do testcase for that)., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
