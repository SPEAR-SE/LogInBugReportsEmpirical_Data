This message is automatically generated., +1 on the fix. I noticed that the test doesn't fail without the fix though. This is because BZip2Codec.BZip2CompressionInputStream.readStreamHeader() tolerates a missing (two-byte) header, so BZip2 files happen to work anyway. I've modified the test slightly to test a deflate-compressed file, and this one does fail without the seek fix., Thanks Tom, I did wonder about that. Then though it to be my maven local repo cause I had first run test with fix installed. thanks for revising the patch. Committing to trunk and branch-2 now, but leaving open for 2.0.2 (gatekeeper has to grant)., Oh, first gotta wait for jenkins again., Cancelling patch to re-submit and kick Jenkins, Uploading the same patch again., I ran the new test locally - works on a Mac too so apparently no native dependency as I'd originally thought (due to deflate):
