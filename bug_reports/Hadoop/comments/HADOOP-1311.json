Console output: http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/218/console, The final parameter to arraycopy should be 'length', not 'size', right?, Yes. It should be length.

Srikanth

, But just before the call to arraycopy, we invoke setSize(length). This sets size = length. Thus, size and length are the same when the arraycopy is invoked., Please review again., +1
