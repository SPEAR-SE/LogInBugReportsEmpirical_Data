This message is automatically generated., HI [~arpitagarwal], 

I noticed that you are watching this one. I wonder if you could help reviewing the latest patch of this JIRA and HDFS-6719? These are intermittent test failures that I'm seeing among various test runs, and the patches are small. Hopefully with them resolved, we can see clean runs more often.

For HADOOP-10872, since it's not easily reproduced, I didn't really figure out why it failed to created "d1", because mkdirs is supposed to create the whole path. However, I noticed that the test root dir is not created and cleaned for each test in TestPathData, I fixed this and added a better debug message with the patch, so we can see better why when it failed.
 
As noted in HDFS-6719, I'm seeing some interference between different tests for us to watch out. But I think the fix I did for HDFS-6719 solve HDFS-6719 itself.

I may look at the TestIPC failure later when I have time, it's a long outstanding failure across the board.

Thanks a lot.
, +1 for the patch. Good find [~yzhangal]. Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.5.
