This message is automatically generated., It doesn't seem to be my patch that is failing. "ant test" returned success locally. And the console output suggests that the failure is related to `/export/home/hudson/hudson/jobs/Hadoop-Patch/workspace/trunk/src/c++/utils/install-sh' which is not related to the file that I modified.
