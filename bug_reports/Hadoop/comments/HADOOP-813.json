[This patch starts a thread to report progress during the merge process. Also, added a couple of reportProgress statements., +1, http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12346976/813.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r483772, 1. sortComplete should be declared volatile.
2. The sortProgress thread should use LOG.info for reporting exceptions rather than System.out.println.
3. I'd probably add a sortProgress.interrupt() when you are closing down so that it can shut down faster.
4. The sortProgress thread should be a daemon thread.
5. There seem to be a lot of other changes in this patch that aren't related to the issue and aren't mentioned in your comment. Are they intentional?
, Thanks Owen for the review. I have removed the sortComplete variable and made the thread exit only on interrupt instead. 
The comment on "lots of changes" is actually due to the fact that I introduced a try{ } finally{ } block and wrapped/indented existing code within the 'try' block. This led to lots of diffs., +1, I just committed this.  Thanks, Devaraj!]
