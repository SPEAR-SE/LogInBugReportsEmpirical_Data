This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~fang fang chen] for the report and the patch. Nice catch. The fix looks good to me. Two comments:
1. The code lookups {{conf}} twice. I'm thinking it's better to do in a single lookup as follows:
{code}
          String extClazz = conf.get(CONF_LZO_CLASS);
          if (extClazz == null) {
            extClazz = System.getProperty(CONF_LZO_CLASS);
          }
{code}
2. Would you add a regression test for this? I'm thinking the test will
* Set "io.compression.codec.lzo.class" to a codec other than the default lzo codec (ex. o.a.h.io.compress.DefaultCodec)
* Call {{Algorithm.LZO.isSupported()}}
* Call {{Algorithm.LZO.getCodec()}} and verify the specified codec is obtained., Sure, thanks for looking at this JIRA, Akira. I generated new patch based on current trunk. And the regression test has been made with pig before, here is the process and log:
1. Add following settings in hadoop core-site.xml:
<property>
<name>io.compression.codecs</name>
<value>com.ibm.biginsights.compress.CmxCodec</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>io.compression.codec.lzo.class</name>
<value>com.ibm.biginsights.compress.CmxCodec</value>
</property>
2. Launch pig grunt with properties:
-Dpig.tmpfilecompression=true -Dpig.tmpfilecompression.codec=cmx -Dpig.additional.jars=ibm-compression.jar:libcmxbiginsights.so

Together with patch in PIG-4341, test case passed with following massage:

This message is automatically generated., bq. And the regression test has been made with pig before, here is the process and log:
The log looks good to me, however, I'd like to add a regression test in hadoop side also. I'm not sure PIG-4341 will be merged soon.
{code}
+              (extClazz_conf == null ? System.getProperty(CONF_LZO_CLASS) : extClazz_conf);
{code}
* The line contains unnecessary parentheses. Would you remove them?
* The line is longer than 80 characters. Would you render it within 80 characters?, About "unnecessary parentheses", do you mean it should me like this:
+          String extClazz = extClazz_conf == null ? System
+                            .getProperty(CONF_LZO_CLASS) : extClazz_conf;

It looks like a little strange.

Let me provide 2 patch files, HADOOP-11418-3.patch remove parentheses and HADOOP-11418-2.patch keep the parentheses.
