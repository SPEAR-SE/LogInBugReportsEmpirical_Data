[A patch to HADOOP-4540 will fix the problem described in this jira. But while I am working on HADOOP-4540, I realize that the policy change proposed in HADOOP-4540 bring subtle dfs semantics change which needs more discussion. So I plan to mark HADOOP-4540 to be fixed in 0.20 and having a simple solution in this jira to be fixed in 0.18. This jira is a part of the solution to avoid data loss as described in HADOOP-4556., Here is a patch that does not count excess replicas as live replicas., +1. Patch looks good., patch for branch 0.18., Patch for the trunk again., Ant test-core build passed on my local machine.
