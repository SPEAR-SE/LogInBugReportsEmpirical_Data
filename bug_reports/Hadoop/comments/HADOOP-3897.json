[While running secondary namenode, I saw an instance when it failed with NullPointerException. This was while merging image which had file underconstruction. The stacktrace is below

{noformat}, This is due to the use of _NameNode.getNameNodeMetrics()_ which wouldnt be initalized in secondary namenode. , Patch to fix the problem. Should it go to 0.18 also?, Path for 0.18 branch., Patch for 0.18 branch, Is this a regression, or was this broken in 0.17 too?, bq. Is this a regression, or was this broken in 0.17 too?
This is not broken in 0.17. It was introduce was 0.18. So, only 0.18 and trunk needs to be fix, Ran test-path and tests on 0.18 and trunk. Both pass
