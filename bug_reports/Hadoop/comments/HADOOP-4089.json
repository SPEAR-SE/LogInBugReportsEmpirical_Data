[Elsewhere in Hadoop we have avoided the use of /tmp, since it is error-prone (it may not exist, it may not be large, etc.).  What's the justification for using it here?, We have actually not hard coded this in the code. The scratch directory that the hive client side code uses is stored in the hive-default.xml and the hive-default.xml file contains /tmp/hive-${user.name} as the value of the 
hive.exec.scratchdir property.

This is completely modeled on how hadoop defines hadoop.tmp.dir in the hadoop-default.xml.

, I think that rather than creating it, it would be fine to just print a nice error message if the directory does not exist., Fixed as part of JIRA-4230, Fixed as part of JIRA-4230]
