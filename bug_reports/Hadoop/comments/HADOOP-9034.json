[bq. We should consider having the SASL server always return success when authentication is complete. ..., and for the client to always read at least one RPC response to ensure PLAIN will work.

Sounds good to me., Since we're introducing RPC version 9 via HADOOP-8990, I think we should do this via HADOOP-9421. Review the patch on HADOOP-9421 if you please.]
