bq. SE_BAD_FIELD erros want to add in exclude.xml since those are maps but fixed ( let me know your thought on this,..)..
I'm +1 for fixing the warning instead of adding a section in findbugs-exclude.xml. Following steps can fix the bug.
# Make the maps {{transient}}.
# Add private {{readObject(ObjectInputStream)}} method for deserialization and initialize the maps there.
{code}
  private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException,
      ClassNotFoundException {
    in.defaultReadObject();
    handleOperTimecostHistogramMap = new HashMap<>();
    queueAllocatedMemoryCounterMap = new HashMap<>();
    queueAllocatedVCoresCounterMap = new HashMap<>();
  }
{code}, [~ajisakaa] Updated the patch based your comments ..Kindly review.., \\
