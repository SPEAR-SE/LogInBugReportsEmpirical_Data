[Can you please give more information to replicate. I am not seeing this.

$ hod allocate -d /home/user/hod-clusters/test -n 3 -t /home/user/temp/hadoop-0.17.0-dev.tar.gza
INFO - Cluster Id 1823.foo.bar
INFO - Cleaning up cluster id 1823.foo.bar, as cluster could not be allocated.
CRITICAL - Cannot allocate cluster /home/user/hod-clusters/test

The specified tarball here does not exist.
, shouldnt it check for existence of tarball even before it tries to allocate and error out ??? 
, sorry I did elaborate on the bug... 
but what I meant was better error reporting saying the tarball does not exist.

, sorry I meant did not elaborate... :), Mahadev, understand your intent. The problem is that the tarball path is on the ringmaster node, not the local file system. Hence we cannot check before allocation, only when the ringmaster runs. Typically the tarball file is a path that's common to both the node from where hod is running, and where the ringmaster runs - but that need not be the case always.

If we could take the tarball file as a local file path, and transfer it ourselves to the ringmaster node first, then we could check.
Alternatively, if we could get the errors from the ringmaster node to the client node, that would improve the error reporting.

Given the more general purpose utility of the second case, I think we should move in that direction.

However, both approaches are significant changes over the existing implementation., thanks for the explanation hemanth. Feel free to mark this resolved or wont fix if you want. This bug could be a part of better error reporting in HOD.
