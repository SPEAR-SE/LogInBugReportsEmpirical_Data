[very simple fix. org.apache.hadoop.record.compiler.JVector.genCompareTo() needs to increment its level (call incrLevel()) at the beginning and decrement it at end. This lets it generate unique variable names. 
This fix is part of the patch submitted for HADOOP-1883. , RecordIO has been deprecated. We do not recommend using it further.]
