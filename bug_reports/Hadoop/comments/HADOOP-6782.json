[I think I have seen something similar with Avro in the past, when using the Specific API.

Does this stop if the Datum that is being written is not recycled?  I think it is related to recycling an object with a Union and having the underlying type of the union differ from one use to another.  Is the union above a union of  "string" and something other than "null"?, Here's a patch that fixes this., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
