[Attach a unit test that exposes the bug., The question here is whether a principal without realm it is a valid the Kerberos name. 
If yes, then we will need to fix this for KerberosName. Maybe adding an option for using default realm implicitly. Otherwise, we can close this one as won't fix. , Yes, it's valid, no realm means default realm., [~xyao] I have went through your patch in HADOOP-13890,  and it seems better to address KerberosName's issue in that JIRA.
I will mark this JIRA as resolved shortly if you don't mind. 
Look forwards to your patch in HADOOP-13890 since the test failures are quite often.]
