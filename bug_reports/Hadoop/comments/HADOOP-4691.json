[4691_20081119.patch: fixed the link.

BTW, it seems that our "ant test-patch" script cannot discover this kind of problem., +1 Good catch, 4691_20081119b.patch: Oops, java.lang.Comparable is also wrong.  It should be java.util.Comparator., Edited description: I shouldn't put a solution in the description at first, especially a wrong one., I just committed this., Checked that there is no javadoc warnings and the link works correct.  I forgot to say that previously., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #667 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/667/])
    . Correct a link in the javadoc of IndexedSortable. (szetszwo)
