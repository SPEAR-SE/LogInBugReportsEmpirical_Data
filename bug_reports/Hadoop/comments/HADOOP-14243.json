[Depends on common changes in the patch for HADOOP-14241., {{fs.s3a.secret.key}} already on the default list.
{{fs.s3a.access.key}} is not on the default list by design., One thing to consider here is that with per bucket config, fs.s3a.bucket.X.secret.key is sensitive for all values of X., Regex pattern {{fs.s3.*[Ss]ecret.?[Kk]ey"}} does covers the per-bucket keys, however, there is no test case in {{TestConfigRedactor}}. I will add it in a patch for HADOOP-14241., need to cover `fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-key` for SSE-C; note the "-key", not ".". I'm actually tempted to rename things for consistency, For the server-side-encryption-key I'm proposing in HADOOP-14324 just renaming the key. That patch can include a change to {{TestConfigRedactor}} to verify its working]
