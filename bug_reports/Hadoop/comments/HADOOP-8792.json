[Whirr log. it's hadoop-daemon that is failing; that failure to chown propagates into a log access problem -neither of which are picked up and reported back

{code}
+ echo 'Starting hadoop-jobtracker'
+ service hadoop-jobtracker start
chown: invalid user: `hadoop'
/usr/lib/hadoop/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh: line 135: /var/log/hadoop/logs/hadoop-hadoop-jobtracker-nn1.out: Permission denied
head: cannot open `/var/log/hadoop/logs/hadoop-hadoop-jobtracker-nn1.out' for reading: No such file or directory
+ retval=0
+ (( 0 == 0 ))
+ echo 'Service hadoop-jobtracker is started'
+ CONFIGURE_HADOOP_DONE=1

{code}, This was fixed by HADOOP-9902.  At this time, the hadoop shell code no longer executes a chown or do much with usernames other than use them for the names of logs. Closing as Not a Problem.]
