[Did it work this way in 0.14?  It was implied on the user list that things used to work this way and then were changed in 0,14.  If that's the case, this is a regression and should be included in 0.15.1, no?, I don't this is a regression.

 HADOOP-1462 fixed some bugs in the reporting framework, that might have hidden this bug then..., Raising the priority of this since it is a regression for some apps that (correctly) assumes incrCounter to be an indicator of progress made., I don't see why this is a blocker.  It was filed over 2 months ago and never got fixed in a 0.15.x release.  Arun commented in Nov that it wasn't a regression.  Please justify or downgrade.  I've added a 0.16.1 release if you want to assign it there or get a patch in today., Ok, here is the patch. , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
