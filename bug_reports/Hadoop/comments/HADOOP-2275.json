[If the namenode fails to allocate any datanode for a newly allocated block, it removes that block from the file before returning an exception to the client., Would it be better to first chooseTarget() and then allocate a new block? In that case, you don't need to remove the block from the file., If you call chooseTarget first, then you would need to acquire the FSnamesystem lock twice.... first time to get the replication factor of the file and then the second time to insert the block into the INode. This will happen for the normal code flow path.

On the other hand, the current patch needs to acquire the fsnamesystem global lock twice only in the case of error. The normal code flow path remains unaffected., Thats right. +1 for the patch.
