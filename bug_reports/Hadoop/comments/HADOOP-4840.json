[The error was caused by an unsynchronized access to the list of block locations. The patch fixed the problem., I think we should synchronize fsnamesystem but not blocksMap., This patch adds the synchronization on FsNamesystem in the failed test., I ran TestNodeCount for 50 times on my local machine without seeing NPE., FSNamesystem.countNodes(..) is called in many places including:

- FSNamesystem.addStoredBlock(Block, DatanodeDescriptor, DatanodeDescriptor)
- FSNamesystem.checkReplicationFactor(INodeFile)
- FSNamesystem.decrementSafeBlockCount(Block)
- FSNamesystem.getBlockLocationsInternal(String, INodeFile, long, long, int, boolean)
- FSNamesystem.invalidateBlock(Block, DatanodeInfo)
- FSNamesystem.isReplicationInProgress(DatanodeDescriptor)
- FSNamesystem.markBlockAsCorrupt(Block, DatanodeInfo)
- FSNamesystem.processMisReplicatedBlocks()
- FSNamesystem.processPendingReplications()
- FSNamesystem.updateNeededReplications(Block, int, int)

However, some of them, e.g. getBlockLocationsInternal, call countNodes(..) without owning the fsnamesystem lock before calling .  It may causes NPE in runtime.
, I totally agree with Nicholas's observation. Can we handle only the unit test failure in this jira and handle the non-synchronized call to countNodes in a different jira?, > Can we handle only the unit test failure in this jira and handle the non-synchronized call to countNodes in a different jira?

Sure.  Let do it in a separated issue., +1 patch looks good., patch for branch 0.18., I've just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #698 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/698/])
