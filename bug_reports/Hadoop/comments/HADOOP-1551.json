[I created another issue HADOOP-1595 asking for an option to wait for completion of replication. Once implemented, this option should be available in libhdfs as well., The libhdfs API has fallen out of sync with the FileSystem API. It does not have a setReplication method as pointed out above. In addition, getFileStatus is also not implemented, last mod time, block size, replication are not available through libhdfs., -1, build or testing failed

2 attempts failed to build and test the latest attachment http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12362632/libhdfs_setrep.txt against trunk revision r559886.

Test results:   http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/474/testReport/
Console output: http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/474/console
