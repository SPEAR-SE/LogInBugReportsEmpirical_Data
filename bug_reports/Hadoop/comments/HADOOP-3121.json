[This does not seem to be a regression and I propose that we fix it for 0.17., Is it likely to be fixed in 0.18.x ? 

--, This seems already fixed in trunk.  At least, the behavior should be different since I could not find "Could not get listing " in the ls codes.  I will check this in details., > This seems already fixed in trunk...

Unfortunately, we still have this bug but the error message have been changed.

"lsr /", then remove /a right before lsr printing the result of /a

bash-3.2$ ./bin/hadoop fs -lsr /
drwxr-xr-x   - tsz supergroup          0 2008-11-05 14:01 /a
lsr: hdfs://namenode9000/a: No such file or directory.
{noformat}

I plan to change lsr such that lsr prints an error message and then keep listing other items., 3121_20081105.patch: print an error message and then keep listing other items, instead of throwing an exception and quit.

Same as before: "lsr /", then remove /a right before lsr printing the result of /a

Shouldn't it be the same for other exceptions? What if dir '/a' does not have permissions for this user?

Since this issue is target for 0.18, I don't want to introduce big changes.  How about we fix other exceptions in a separated issue?, Then I don't think it is a proper fix for the real issue. It fixes just one symptom reported.

> How about we fix other exceptions in a separated issue?
may be. +0 from me., Raghu, I see your point now.  Here is a new patch.

3121_20081106.patch: try-catch all IOException., Couple of comments:

- do we need to rename ListStatus() to FileStatus()?
- getFileStatus() name is too close to FS.getFileStatus(), might be confusing while reading the code.

I suggest renaming it to some thing like 'shellListStatus()', 3121_20081106b.patch: renamed getFileStatus(...) to shellListStatus(...), Thanks Nicholas. looks good. One nit:

instead of ls throwing exception with "There were totally..." message, I think it is better to make ls return -1 and replace {{ls(..)}} with ' {{exitCode = ls()}} ' in doall(). , > instead of ls throwing exception with "There were totally..." message, I think it is better to make ls return -1 and replace ls(..) with ' exitCode = ls() ' in doall(). 

I am not sure what do you mean.  Could you post a patch for this?, I hope attached patch clarifies what I mean. It behaves same as before and does not add extra line of output that is unecessary.

For e.g. compare 'bin/hadoop fs -ls  /other' :

- with the patch attached (*and* trunk) : {noformat}
ls: could not get get listing for '/other' : org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: [...]
{noformat}


- with your patch : {noformat}
ls: could not get get listing for '/other' : org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: [...]
ls: There were totaly 1 exception(s).
{noformat}

I don't think most command print extra lines like 'ls: There were totaly 1 exception(s)'  at the end..', +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I agree that the extra line is odd.  Thanks.

{noformat}, The patch passed all unit tests locally., 3121_20081107_0.18.patch: for 0.18.  It also passed all unit tests locally., I just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #655 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/655/])
    . lsr should keep listing the remaining items but not terminate if there is any IOException. (szetszwo)
