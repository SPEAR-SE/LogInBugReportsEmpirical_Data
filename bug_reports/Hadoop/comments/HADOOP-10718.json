[I've seen a jira with similar odd windows tcp connection issues.  The error about "forcibly closed" is the normal graceful tcp shutdown (FIN) did not occur but a hard connection abort (RESET).  I tried to read up the windows tcp stack and found that close() immediately frees all resources.  If there is data remaining to be sent then it's discarded and a RESET is sent.  The shutdown() call is supposed to initiate the graceful FIN shutdown.

The ipc layer is doing shutdown + close but apparently windows isn't behaving correctly.  I suspect that reason the errors are non-deterministic is the server thread is not being context switched between the write ... close.  The client thread never got a chance to read the response.

It'd be curious to know if windows sent both the FIN and the RESET.  Someone with windows should get a packet trace., Yes, I believe Daryn is referring to HADOOP-8980, where I entered this comment:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8980?focusedCommentId=13509416&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13509416

It's not really a Windows-only bug, but it sure seems like the specifics of the Windows scheduler are much more likely to expose it., In fact, I suggest we close this as duplicate of HADOOP-8980.  What do you think?, Thanks, [~daryn] and [~cnauroth]! I closed the ticket as duplicate.]
