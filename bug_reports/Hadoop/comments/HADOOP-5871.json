[Attaching the simple straight-forward patch. Though I don't want to believe it myself, it reduced test time of TestClusterMapReduce by a whopping 40% on my local box. Need to verify it on some other machine., The large differences seem to be because of ipv6 enabled on my machine., I am +1 to this, because you can't turn ipv6 off the latest ubuntu release.
