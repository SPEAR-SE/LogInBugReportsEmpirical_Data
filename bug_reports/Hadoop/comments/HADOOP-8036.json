[* fix bug where we were assuming that the user's home directory had only two path components.  For example, if the home directory was /var/home/foo, the code would fail.

* rename setupForViewFs to setupForViewFilesystem, to avoid any confusion.  There is another class called ViewFsTestSetup which shares no code with ViewFileSystemTestSetup.

* remove commented-out junk, Looks great Colin. +1 pending jenkins

Nit, the style for 1-line comments is C++ style "//", I'm a little surprised you need to call {{tearDown}} explicitly in {{setUp}}. I believe that any method annotated with {{@After}} is guaranteed to run regardless of the failure of the test which it's being run after (unless the JVM exits, but we've got a heap of trouble if that happens.), +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I've confirmed that aborting the test halfway through (for example, with the stop button in Eclipse) will NOT invoke the tearDown function.

Given this, it seems prudent to do out cleanup work beforehand.  Otherwise people who manually abort the test halfway through will be hosed.  Also, as you pointed out, there is always the possibility of the JVM aborting, which would definitely prevent cleanup.

We definitely want to avoid a situation where the Jenkins machine can't build, but we can, due to some mysterious build artifacts hanging around.  So I figure it makes sense to stay on the safe side., {quote}

Yea, I buy this, but given that we don't do this anywhere else, I'd rather be consistent with the rest of the test suite.

In general, I'd be in favor of having any test which mucks with persistent file system state both a) clean up after itself using an @After (the normal case) and b) call that same cleanup code in an @Before so that aborted test runs don't cause subsequent test runs to spuriously fail. Perhaps you could file a separate JIRA to do that across all the tests?, Filed as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2967.  I'll remove the @Before->@After logic from this test until we make a more general decision about 2967., * change single-line comment to use '//' not '/* */'

* don't call cleanup functions from startup functions, pending resolution of HDFS-2967, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
