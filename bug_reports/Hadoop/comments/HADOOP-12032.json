[I've just found what is going on.

This is a known bug with the docker-machine's vmwarefusion driver. Should be fixed in docker 1.7.0.
https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/641

The workaround for now is to:
 - manually enable folder sharing on the VM (in vmware preferences)
 - docker-machine ssh dev (ssh on the VM)
 - manually mount the volumes mapped on the start-build-env.sh script:
     $sudo mount -o loop /mnt/hgfs/Users/USERNAME/.m2 /Users/USERNAME/.m2 
     $sudo mount -o loop /mnt/hgfs/Users/USERNAME/PATH/TO/HADOOP/FOLDER /Users/USERNAME/PATH/TO/HADOOP/FOLDER

Then ./start-build-env.sh from another terminal should work and connect to the container with the content of the hadoop folder.]
