[This is not a bug. You are not closing the configuration element correctly. the last line must be </configuration>, This is a configuration issue, not a Hadoop issue.

(The issue is that you're missing the '/' in the closing configuration tag.), see also http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/InvalidJiraIssues, Thank you for all the comments it helped me resolve a configuration issue!, However there is still a warning msg, when I try to format and run $ hdfs namenode -format in the terminal 

I get a warning msg and there seem to be an issue with loading library for my platform.

I run hadoop on OS X El Capitan. Can new operation system cause this?

, that's exactly the kind of question to raise on the user@ list. Or paste the error text into a browser and see what stack overflow throws up
