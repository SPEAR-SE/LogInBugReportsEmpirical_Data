[We should probably hold off on this until more of the SASL work is completed.  I think it's necessary when changes are made for the client to honor the server's negotiate info, ex. for IP failover.

On a related note, the rpc or dfs client (haven't investigated which is at fault) can't be interrupted while making a connection.  This is most evident by the inability to use control-c with FsShell commands during connection retries.  Fixing that issue may also require propagation of the InterruptedException.]
