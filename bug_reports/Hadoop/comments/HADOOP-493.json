Clusters don't seem to show this problem anymore. DFS still reports wrong value for 'used bytes' (see HADOOP-599), but it is not weird value like above. It always shows % used is zero. Will close this for now and will reopen if HADOOP-599 does not fix this.

either it is already fixed or HADOOP-599 might fix it.]
