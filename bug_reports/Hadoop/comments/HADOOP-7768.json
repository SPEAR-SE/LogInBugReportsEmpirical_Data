[Jonathan,
 You working on it? This seems to have caused the builds all over to break., Not sure the root cause of this issue. Looks like maven issue with multi-module build as seen in both
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWAR-192
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MDEP-259, I think the problem is the one described here: http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/FileNotFoundException-when-packaging-WAR-using-project-dependency-td136578.html

It seems that "mvn install test" fails, but "mvn install" (which also runs the test) passes.

The attached patch changes "mvn install test" to "mvn install" in test-patch.sh. I ran it manually and it fixes the problem., +1, looks good to me. , I've just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #1177 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/1177/])
