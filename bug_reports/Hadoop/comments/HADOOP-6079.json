[6079_20090618.patch:
- serialize proxySource as DatanodeInfo only.
- change BalancerDatanode not to implement Writable since it is not used anywhere.

The existing TestBlockReplacement is already serializing proxySource as DatanodeInfo.  So, no new test is added., +1. I agree that serialization/deserilization should use the same type., {noformat}
