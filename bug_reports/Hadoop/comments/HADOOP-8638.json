[Interestingly, the exit code from the default task controller is different across machines, I have seen 1 or 134 so far., MAPREDUCE-4036 addresses the same issue - the corresponding patch there seems to solve the issue on the local machine. 

We might have to re-open this should anyone experience the same in other (new) environments.]
