This message was automatically generated., [~ozawa], I'm not familiar with urllib, but according to Python Library Reference, urllib seems to respect $http_proxy from at least 1.6.

https://docs.python.org/release/1.6/lib/module-urllib.html

Is that feature defective? , [~sekikn] urllib doesn't work well with *https* unfortunately - I cannot build with current script and *https_proxy* variable behind a proxy. With the patch, it works well., Thanks [~ozawa], I misread your comment.

Allen, Thanks for review and committing!, I pulled this down to trunk/branch-2, thanks all., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8221 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8221/])
