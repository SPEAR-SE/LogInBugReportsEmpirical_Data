, Personally, I'm -0 on this patch. Two points:
  # by moving to the one requiring libcap.so.2 you're killing off the distros where that is not available. I'm pretty sure at least CentOS/RHEL5 fall into that category and given how widespread they are in the enterprise I'm not sure you want to do that to them.
  # I thought the agreement was to KILL jsvc bundling to begin with. See HDFS-2303 for details. This is a much cleaner solution and you have a wide choice of what jsvc to depend upon ranging from bundled with your system (http://pkgs.org/search/?keyword=jsvc) all the way to the one we're curating in Bigtop (bigtop-jsvc package). , -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Roman, I set HADOOP-8133 to "is superceded by" HDFS-2303. Thanks to bringing it to my attention. It does seem like the better solution., Roman, with regard to your first point about an upgrade breaking older distributions, I think the daemon is able to choose the right version depending on the platform (at least that is the sense I get from reading DAEMON-234). I will look on Amazon for an older CentOS image to test this assumption with., Hi Roman, 
You are right: commons-daemon 1.0.5 will not run on a libcap.so.1 distribution (tested Centos 5.6):

{code}, Since HDFS-2303 is done, this is no longer an issue. Thanks for the patch effort though, Eugene!]
