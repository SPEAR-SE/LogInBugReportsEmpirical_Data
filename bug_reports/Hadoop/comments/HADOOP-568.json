[I started seeing this last week and I think fundamentally it is caused my some of the new code in localizeJob. However, the error handling is broken in that if something goes wrong in localizeJob, it prints an error message into the log and doesn't report the failure back to the job tracker. This patch should fix that problem., After more testing, this patch reports the problem, but doesn't succesfully report back to the job tracker., Ok, this patch also extends the killTask method to handle the unassigned task by setting it to failed/killed., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
