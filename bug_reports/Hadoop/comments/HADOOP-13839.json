[Hi,

I tested the htrace with hadoop/hdfs 2.7.3. In the mean time I updated the documentation. I tested it with LocalFileSpanReceiver and ZipkinSpanReceiver, using external client or using the example TracingFsShell, and using the hadoop htrace command:

Note: The old htrace 3.1 could not been built with the provided commands. I replaced it with instruction how the required jars could be retrieved from maven central.

, Thanks for the patch, [~elek].  +1. committing this to branch-2.7., I committed this to only branch-2.7.

branch-2.8 and above uses htrace-4 and the documentation has been already updated., Thanks, [~elek] and [~iwasakims]!]
