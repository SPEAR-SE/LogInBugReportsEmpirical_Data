[I don't see a need for job ids to be identical between localrunner and jobtracker.  User code should not rely on the format of job ids.  Having them different helps enforce that!  We should never parse job ids, but only require them to be sufficiently unique.

So we should change the format of localrunner's job ids if they're not sufficiently unique.  I'm aware of no bugs resulting from localrunner job id clashes.  If any arise, then we might revisit this issue, otherwise I think we should resolve this as "won't fix".
, bq. We should never parse job ids, but only require them to be sufficiently unique.
Actually we may sometimes need to parse the {job|tip|task}ids where we do not have the relevant context to do the mappings such as taskid -> jobid, etc. An illustrating case is in the patch for HADOOP-53, where we need to parse the taskid to obtain the job and tip id in TaskTracker$Child. 

I guess this issue should be fixed as a part of Hadoop-544, so that parsing should never be done by the user, but the framework itself. , HADOOP-544 will make this moot... either way, as Doug notes:

{quote}, We can close this as duplicate once HADOOP-544 is in. ]
