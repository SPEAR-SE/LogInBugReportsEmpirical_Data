[+1 this looks good to me., Fix Version should be 0.12.1 alone, since we'll include this in that release. 0.12.0 is already out the door, so this can't be included there.  And this will be implicitly included in all future releases, so should not appear explicitly in the 0.13.0 release notes., I just committed this.  Thanks, Andrzej!]
