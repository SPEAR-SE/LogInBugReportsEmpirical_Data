[For now I added "-DskipShading" to the deploy instructions on HowToRelease., this was correct behavior. the "deploy" lifecycle goal implies "install" which implies "package", which means shading happens.

Also, isn't releasing expressly when we want the shaded artifacts to be created? Otherwise how are downstream maven users supposed to consume them?, Is it something we should work on? It seems it is intended behavior., I believe this is intended behavior., Our current release process invokes maven multiple times, with deploy at the end after building the artifacts. It seems like an error to rebuild everything when running the deploy, since then the artifacts will differ.

I added -DskipShade to the HowToRelease instructions which seems to achieve what I want, though other artifacts might still be overwritten., Resolving this since weÂ coalesced the multiple maven invocations to do deploy directly.]
