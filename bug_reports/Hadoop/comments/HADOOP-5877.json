* Fixes all of the javac warnings in the above mentioned files.  These all related to use of the deprecated secondary name node.  These were fixed by suppressing the warning on the method it emanated from, rather than applying the annotation to the entire file.
* Of note, in two places the SecondaryNameNode was a return type of a method and due to a bug in Java (http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6460147) the warning suppression doesn't work and still generates a javac warning.  This has been noted in the code.
* In {{TestHDFSServerPorts}} the offending warning was suppressed and a new test that uses the backup node to test the equivalent functionality added.  This is the best approach to take with replacing these tests with backupnode versions until the secondary namenode is removed, but doing so on the other cases is beyond the scope of this JIRA.
* General clean up of the {{TestHDFSServerPorts}} class.
* As part of the new test BackupNode had to become a public rather than package-private class in order to make it available for testing., submitting patch., It looks like our erstwhile squire Hudson has wandered off again... I ran the full test of suites and everything passed except failing-on-trunk TestJobHistory and the usual contrib cases.  From a unit test perspective, the patch is ready to go.
