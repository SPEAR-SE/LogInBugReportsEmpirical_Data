, Green from me., Thanks for helping to test this Amir, marking this PA., Shouldn't this patch get applied to 0.18 if one wanted to use 0.18 to do experiments with compression of transient data at large scale?, This is probably more correct, but what is the use case? LzopDecompressor tracks and verifies block checksums for lzop streams, but without being initialized by enums to which only LzopCodec has access, it cannot be distinguished from LzoDecopressor. Using LzopCodec as anything but a stream doesn't make sense., bq. Shouldn't this patch get applied to 0.18 if one wanted to use 0.18 to do experiments with compression of transient data at large scale?

Intermediate data is compressed using LzoCodec, not LzopCodec. LzopCodec provides compatibility for users reading streams compressed by the [lzop|http://www.lzop.org] tool., bq. Using LzopCodec as anything but a stream doesn't make sense.

I should probably be clearer. Reusing the decompressor between streams makes sense, but using LzopDecompressor like LzoDecompressor or ZlibDecompressor to effect block compression for a structured file format is not going to work, or at least is unlikely to match the intent. I'm assuming this is related to HADOOP-3315, which- like SequenceFile- shouldn't use LzopCodec.

As written, an LzopDecompressor instance can't be reused between streams. The checksums aren't reset. LzopDecopressor should clear its checksum maps in initHeaderFlags before adding new ones., Thanks for the information. The problem was found in the development of TFIle (Hadoop-3315). The way we use Hadoop Compression in TFile is to take each compression block as a separate compression stream (each block writes conclude with compressor.finish()). It makes no assumption of any internals of compression algorithm. The tests show both LZOP and LZO work fine.

Also, based on the information you provided, it seems that existence of LzopDecompressor is to read lzop compressed data. So I changed to use LZO instead of LZOP internally for TFile now., +1 for the patch. 

Arun, thanks for the patch and rapid turn-around., bq. The way we use Hadoop Compression in TFile is to take each compression block as a separate compression stream (each block writes conclude with compressor.finish()). It makes no assumption of any internals of compression algorithm. The tests show both LZOP and LZO work fine.
LZOP works because the streams are generated by LzopCodec, which disables all the block checksums (assuming its target will be HDFS, which keeps its own checksums). In that case, the LzopDecompresor is a passthrough to LzoDecompressor. If someone were to pick up a LzopDecompressor and use it on a stream with block checksums, it would fail if that decompressor were reused to open a TFile. Until LzopDecompressors can be reused without errors (i.e. initHeaderFlags clears the checksum flags before setting them for the next stream), I'm \-1 on making them reusable through CodecPool.

bq. it seems that existence of LzopDecompressor is to read lzop compressed data. So I changed to use LZO instead of LZOP internally for TFile now.
That sounds exactly right. Unless one wants to support a the C tool, LzoCodec should always be preferred., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Chris points out that we need to reset state in LzopDecompressor in the 'reset call..., Is there any progress on this? , LZO is not part of hadoop any more... Will mark the issue invalid., We are using 0.20 and LZO can be used for map compression. In which case the same issue appears:

, @alex, your description looks like a very different problem from this jira (LzopCodec instead of LzoCodec). Additionally, LZO code is moved to github. You may want to create a new issue there. http://github.com/omalley/hadoop-gpl-compression/issues.]
