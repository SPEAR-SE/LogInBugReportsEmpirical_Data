This message is automatically generated., [~mingma], I think your suggestion of maintaining dedicated metrics for exceptions is useful to measure "wasted" calls., Thanks, Gera. Here is the updated patch. For RpcMetrics, it doesn't distinguish good call from waste call. For RpcDetailedMetrics, if the call throws exception, it will use $MethodName_$ExceptionClassSimpleName as the metrics name., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., [~mingma], thank you for the suggestion. I think this improvement is useful, too. One minor comment: both {{rpcMetrics}} and {{rpcDetailedMetrics}} are not final field, so how about adding null check before accessing them?

{code}
+         server.rpcMetrics.addRpcQueueTime(qTime);
+         server.rpcMetrics.addRpcProcessingTime(processingTime);
+         server.rpcDetailedMetrics.addProcessingTime(detailedMetricsName,
+             processingTime);
{code}

{code}
  protected RpcMetrics rpcMetrics;
  protected RpcDetailedMetrics rpcDetailedMetrics;
{code}, Thanks, Tsuyoshi.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the updating, Ming. It looks better approach to me. One additional point: if we can make the variables final, we can remove null check in {{Server#stop()}}.

{code}
    if (this.rpcMetrics != null) {
      this.rpcMetrics.shutdown();
    }
    if (this.rpcDetailedMetrics != null) {
      this.rpcDetailedMetrics.shutdown();
    }
{code}, Thanks, Tsuyoshi. [~lohit] asked a good question how the increase of the number of metrics will impact metrics subsystem. The most common one might be StandbyException, which can be thrown regardless of methods. Other exceptions are likely to be specific to certain methods. Based on the current number of metrics, JMX size; number of methods, a very rough estimate can put the increase to around 10-15% for NN.

So to be safe, we can aggregate by exception class name instead; that will still provide useful information (from the exception name, we can find the possible methods).
