This message is automatically generated., I presume it also affects 2.0.6-alpha, right?, I just checked with [~atm] and he said that I'm wrong, that the HDFS HA client does not use ZK. Please disregard my previous comment., Also, it seems that the patch actually adds the dependency to hadoop-client. Am I reading the patch wrong?, the patch does an exclusion, it seems OK, still have to verify it., Thanks, I knew I was misreading it... needs more coffee., Any more updation required on this jira..?
, Konstantin, if yarn-client (& hence mapred-client) needs ZK, then it should be an explict dependency in those modules. We should warn them though, bq. if yarn-client (& hence mapred-client) needs ZK, then it should be an explict dependency in those modules.
It's not the client, the server needs it. Hopefully removing it from client doesn't affect our setup for YARN servers., Hi All,
Any changes required on this jira..?
If no changes required can push this in..?

This message is automatically generated., we are past Hadoop 2 GA, removing this dependency in Hadoop 2 now would break backward compatibility for apps using ZK (and expecting Hadoop to provide it), Alejandro, I'm still up for dropping the dependency on ZK

We can't have a "no changes to POMs or dependencies in Hadoop 2" policy. To do so says "we can't ever upgrade any POM we depend on, in case transient dependencies change"

# we explicitly say "no guarantees about dependencies" in the compatibility document. That was not an accident.
# this only affects downstream apps that work via maven, not production code
# we can mark it as 'incompatible" in the changes.

The patch isn't ready -yet- as we need to make sure YARN is up with it. But otherwise, I will eventually +1 a patch that drops ZK from hadoop-cliient, Thanks steve. 
As for as Yarn is concerned Vinod has already confirmed that zookeeper dependency required only for server. Removing it will not affect the clients., @Vinay -yes, but we need to make sure that the server POMs are set up to pull it in once the client POM drops it, Defining in server pom may not be required. That will be inherited from hadoop common dependency.  Excluding in hadoop client will not affect that., \\

lgtm 
+1, I'm +1 for trunk only., Rebased the patch. It was applying at wrong place due to line number mismatch.
