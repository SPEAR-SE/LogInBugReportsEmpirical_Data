Thanks!, One more thing: I see that you want to target branch-1-win.  Can you please provide a separate patch for branch-1-win?, Thanks Chris for taking a look. I've added test case, and patch for branch-1-win. , +1 for the patch, pending Jenkins test-patch run.  I verified the fix on both trunk and branch-1-win.
