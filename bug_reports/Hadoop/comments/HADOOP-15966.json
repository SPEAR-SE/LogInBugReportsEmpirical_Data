, Lack of tests doesn't seem like it should be an issue for this.

+1, thanks, committed to all the hadoop-3 branches, And a bit of a stack for searches; HOST1 is the host in question. 

Note how there's not a chance of recovery but the retry logic doesn't recognise this.
IllegalArgumentExceptions need to uprated to unrecoverable errors

HADOOP-15966. Hadoop Kerberos broken on macos as (stevel: rev db2d8b01c65fdff3acf83b4c4f0a79fe48270487)
* (edit) hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/conf/hadoop-env.sh
, Thanks [~stevel@apache.org] you beat me to it!, [~stevel@apache.org] Hadoop server side should dictate which realm to authenticate.  Instead of recommending in HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS, the recommendation should be in HADOOP_*_OPTS, I think., Pulling the JVM settings out stops it saying "no realm". If there's some multi-realm thing, we're in a deep world of pain, aren't we?

Bear in mind this is macos only, so isn't going to have any impact on servers at all, not unless you've built a cluster out of mac minis, [~stevel@apache.org] The patch is fine.  I am more concerned about the recommendation description in this JIRA that the realm can be defined in HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS, which is misleading.  The realm is better applied to HADOOP_OPTS to ensure client and server have the same coverage, if someone chose to build a cluster out of Mac.]
