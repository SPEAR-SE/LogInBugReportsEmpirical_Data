[This patch consolidate all of the places where status was put in to or out of the taskTrackers status map, so that
the counts of maps and reduces are maintained consistently. 

I also added the cluster status to the webapp so that you can get a quick view of how busy the cluster is., This looks great.  I just committed it.  Thanks, Owen.]
