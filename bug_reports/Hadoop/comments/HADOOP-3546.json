[The problem is added by the code for Joining cleanup thread through HADOOP-2393.
TaskTracker is waiting for the task cleanup thread to come out. But taskcleanup thread comes out only when the flag _shuttingDown_ is set true. So, the tasktracker is stuck in close().

After analysing the code in TaskTracker.java, these following improvements in the code will actually fix the bug,  
1. _taskCleanupThread_ is started by static code block. That should be moved to _initialize()_. Since we want to stop the thread and start again in the reintialization. 
2. There are two flags _running_ and _shuttingDown_. _running_ is set true in _intialize()_ once all the data structures are intialized , all the threads and servers are started etc.. And _shuttingDown_ is set in the method _shutdown()_ .  _shutdown()_ is nothing but  _close()_  and stops the StatusHttpServer. So, we can move _shuttingDown_ to _close()_ and rename it to _closing_.
3.The following code in TaskTracker.run() is not necessary:
 {noformat}  if (shuttingDown) { return; } {noformat}
Since the flag is never set in the loop. 
4. _intialize()_ is called even for Denied tasktracker before shutting down (easily reproducible). So, We can call _intialize()_ only if task tracker is stale state.
5. The method _isRunning()_ (introduced in HADOOP-2393) can be removed and the flag can be directly accessed from the thread.

This message is automatically generated., There is a race condition in the cleanup thread due to which the thread may never exit (a case where the interrupt is sent by the main thread but the cleanup thread is just about to do tasksToCleanup.take(); hence the interrupt is lost, and the cleanup thread will stay in take() for ever). Although, we could handle the problem by introducing additional synchronization, I'd suggest that we remove the join for the threads and instead make the threads run as daemons. I am nervous about putting lot of code for synchronization to handle the case where files are left over on tasktracker exit. Since, the tasktracker, at startup, does the cleanup anyway, we should be ok. , Here is patch removing joins for cleanup threads and making them daemon threads., -1 overall.
