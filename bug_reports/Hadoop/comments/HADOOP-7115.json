[This is what nscd should be providing for you at the OS level.  Why do we want another cache?, In production we found nscd to be very unreliable, causing storms against the LDAP server when it goes down., Do we actually know it was getpwuid or some other call?  Yahoo uses a lot of netgroup info--which is not cached by nscd.  The other thing is that nscd is tunable.  You might have just needed to bump up the size of the ncsd cache.

Given how previous "caches" have been implemented, I'm extremely hesitant to see another one implemented.  Especially one that would likely require ops to bring the whole grid down to fix.  [It is bad enough we have to bounce the NN/JT to fix some of these caches.], It was the getpwuid calls leading to ldap outages in our major clusters (almost twice every week). After implementing this cache, we didn't have a single incident (and hopefully we will have none in the future too).

The version of nscd on our clusters proved to be really unreliable., Devaraj, can we make this cache timeout period configurable ?  
If yes, ops would have an option to set this timeout to 0 to skip the caching altogether.
Allen, will this address your concern? 

We really had miserable weeks when our LDAP servers were going up and down.  Don't want to go back there., Do we really want to set a precedent where we start patching Hadoop due to specific vendor's implementation problems?  That's where we are headed with this patch...., bq. Do we really want to set a precedent where we start patching Hadoop due to specific vendor's implementation problems

Yes. In my opinion this is unavoidable for large scale systems.

But I agree with Koji that these workarounds should be configurable and probably off-by-default., > Yes. In my opinion this is unavoidable for large scale systems.

From my understanding, the reliability issue was fixed by upgrading libc and/or nscd.  This makes it an OS bug that was fixed with a vendor supplied patch.  We need to be very clear on what we want to do when it comes to OS workarounds. Right now, we're incredibly inconsistent. (and yes, I'm thinking specifically of the whoami, getent, etc problems.)
, Hey Devaraj. Any news on this patch for trunk? I need to fix HADOOP-7156 which is likely to conflict with this code., This patch is a straight port from the 20.100 security branch to trunk for the corresponding commit in the security branch. I will also raise a MR jira to address the MR side of the changes.



, A few comments:
- getUIDforFDOwnerforOwner is a kind of messy name - maybe just getUIDForFDOwner?
- The following should probably be debug level:
{code}
LOG.info("Got UserName " + user + " for UID " + uid + " from the native implementation");
{code}

- ensureInitialized has a formatting issue (cacheTimeout is on the same line as the opening if)
- The log message there should also probably be debug level
- Do we need fstat and the Stat type at all now? I think not, we might as well remove it.
- The change in getGroup.c seems unrelated to this JIRA, right?
, bq. Do we need fstat and the Stat type at all now? I think not, we might as well remove it.

Actually, just to keep this closer to the 0.20 security branch, why don't we do that part in a separate JIRA. Filed HADOOP-7173., Patch for 22, Reattaching the patch after removing the changes for mapreduce. The changes for mapreduce are attached in MAPREDUCE-2353, I just committed this to branch 0.22.1. Thank you Deveraj and Benoy.
Will close it if not needed in other version., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-22-branch #106 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-22-branch/106/])

, We need this in trunk, branch-2, and probably branch-0.23, too - not sure how it got missed somewhere along the line, Just chatted with Devaraj and he is OK with me taking over this JIRA to have a patch for trunk. THX, Patch for trunk. It revives the cache for ID->NAME. It has been refactored a bit to be used for both UIDs and GIDs. It has been tested in a secure cluster configured to use and external directory for user provisioning running terasort jobs. Without this patch the same cluster cannot run a single terasort job for non-local users., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., - why is cacheTimeout volatile? You're already synchronizing on the class inside {{ensureInitialized}}.
- instead of {{ensureInitialized}}, why not initialize the configuration in the existing static {...} block?
- instead of using ints for {{USER}} and {{GROUP}}, how about an enum like this:

{code}
enum IdCache {
  USERNAME,
  GROUP;

  ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, CachedName> cache =
    new ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, CachedName>();
}

...

private static String getName(IdCache cache, int id) {
  CachedName cachedName = cache.cache.get(id);
  ...
}
{code}

this way you get typesafety, and you can just stringify the {{IdCache}} instance to get a printable name


Otherwise looks good to me, Thanks for the review Todd, new patch addressing you comments. Minor tweak, converted the INT constants to an ENUM but did not move the cache into the ENUM, left as before (not very keen of mutable ENUMs)., Forgot the mention before, the native part of the patch it was done by Sandy Ryza (thx Sandy)., {code}
+    cacheTimeout = new Configuration().getLong(
+      CommonConfigurationKeys.HADOOP_SECURITY_UID_NAME_CACHE_TIMEOUT_KEY,
+      CommonConfigurationKeys.HADOOP_SECURITY_UID_NAME_CACHE_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT) *
+      1000;
+    LOG.debug("Initialized cache for IDs to User/Group mapping with a" +
+      " cache timeout of " + cacheTimeout/1000 + " seconds.");
{code}

This should move up into the try block above -- if the native library fails to load, then it shouldn't log this debug message (since the cache won't ever be used). Additionally you can reuse the Configuration instance that's already constructed above.


- Just noticed an addition of {{syslog.h}} to the native code - doesn't seem to be used.


Otherwise looks good.
