[*This patch works by keeping the fs and the jobconf working directories different. In hdfs we don't need it because the "local" fs is different from the default fs.
*potential problems of this patch: if a user creates a file ( with relative path) in the mapper/reducer phase this file will be created in the attempt directory and then deleted on cleanup. Without the patch the file would be created in the current working directory of the filesystem, i.e. the directory from which the user launched hadoop., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Cancelling patch:

a) this change will almost certainly break HDFS.
b) Hadoop 1.x is dead and this patch doesn't apply to trunk.

There's a good chance this issue should just be closed, but I'll leave it open for now.]
