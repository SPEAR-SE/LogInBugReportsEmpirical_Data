# It would be better to add the test case for asserting the owner and group are also preserved.
# The lines should be within 80 characters.

In addition, mtime is not preserved by "cp -p" in HDFS, but I think it should be addressed by another JIRA., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

In local fs, these test cases will fail because a test user can't change the owner and group freely. So these tests are not needed., Fixed formatting., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Sorry, my comment is incorrect. Mtime of a directory is not preserved because a file in the directory is copied after setting mtime of the directory.
I'll update the patch shortly.
