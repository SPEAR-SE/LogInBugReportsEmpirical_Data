[-1 As I wrote on HADOOP-3171, these semantics lead to very hard to debug cases. In particular, what was happening was:

client:
  conf 1

job tracker:
  conf 2

task tracker:
  conf 3..n

and depending on which part of the framework looked at the particular value, they would take the value from conf 1..n. It was *very* difficult to debug and lead to wasted days of developer time., Why are you bringing the TT 3..N configurations into the equation here? They shouldn't play a role in the job settings. Only the JT should.



, But what if I'm in a heterogeneous network such that some machines have eight cores and others have two cores?  The TaskTracker config will play a part there, correct?, Having an heterogeneous network would not be affected by the proposed solution.

The TT configuration is not affected by this. The proposed solution is only about what configuration properties are sent by a client when submitting a job, instead sending all, just to send what has been explicitly set and the rest to be resolved using the default values set in the JT. 

, Hadoop-3730 enables the functionality, in a much simpler way, this issue was about]
