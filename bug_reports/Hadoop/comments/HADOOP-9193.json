[Note that this may be somewhat moot if HDFS-2745 is committed and no other delegated commands are expected to take wildcard arguments or other types of arguments that could be accidentally interpreted by the shell during the exec., The wrapper script is clearly wrong using {{$*}} , unquoted even.  The correct construct is {{"$@"}}.  Attaching patch., Oops, sorry [~robsparker], I didn't mean to steal this jira from you (my display didn't even indicate that you'd assigned it).

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/2019//console

This message is automatically generated., [~adi2] No worries, The TestZKFailoverController failure is unrelated.  There does not seem to be any existing test code for the {{hadoop dfs}} shell scripts, so adding tests for this condition is challenging., Seems like a good fix.  Another layer of shell expansion doesn't help anyone here., +1, lgtm. Will commit momentarily., +1, the patch looks good to me.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3252 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3252/])
