[Attaching the complete hudson log of the test failure, The test is nondeterministic; though it sets mapred.inmem.merge.threshold to 2, the third may be fetched, closed, and included in the in-memory merge. In this case, all the outputs will be merged to disk. The test should probably set mapred.reduce.parallel.copies to 1 to avoid the race, here. Off-by-n misses on mapred.inmem.merge.threshold aren't a real bug, not even for the final outputs; it's a heuristic, not a contract., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., That didn't work; canceling patch., Size the buffer to require an in-memory merge during the shuffle, leaving one map output in memory., +1, *sigh* There's still a race condition in the last patch. If the third output is fetching (allocated) but not closed when the second closes, it's possible to merge the first two to disk before allocating the following three, which trigger a similar fault. The reduce will begin with all segments merged to disk. The solution sets {{mapred.job.shuffle.merge.percent}} high enough to avoid an intermediate merge in the test until the fetch thread is stalled on the final output., +1 overall.
