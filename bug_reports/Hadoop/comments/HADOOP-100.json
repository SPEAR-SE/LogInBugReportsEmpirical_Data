[I made the table private instead of package local.

I also wrapped each of the references to the table with a lock on the table.

There is still a lingering issue with the webapp's use of JobTracker.taskTrackers(). If a status update comes in while the webapp is iterating through the taskTrackers, it will get a ConcurrentModificationException., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen.]
