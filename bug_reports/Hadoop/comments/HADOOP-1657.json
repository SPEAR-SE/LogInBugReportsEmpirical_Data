[Attached patch does the following:

 - User can optionally specify -bytePerChecksum.
 - If bytesPerChecksum checksum is not set, then default from config is used.
 - When default is used, and bytesPerBlock is not multiple of bytesPerChecksum, then bytesPerChecksum is set to bytesPerBlock
 - All the exceptions are logged.
 - When number of exceptions is larger than {{numFiles*100}}, a runtime exception is thrown to stop the test.

Above list long but patch is simple :), Sorry for the multiple updates. One more white space diff sneaked in., Limit the number of execptions per file.  Added some more documentation., Thanks Nigel.
