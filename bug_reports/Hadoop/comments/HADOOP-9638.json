[HADOOP-9287 changed {{FileSystemTestHelper}} to allow passing an override of the test root to its constructor.  This supports overriding to paths of the form /tmp/<test name> for HDFS.  It looks like we missed {{FileContextTestHelper}} though, so we'll likely need similar changes for that.  An example of a failing test is {{TestFcHdfsCreateMkdir}}.

[~aklochkov], are you interested in doing a follow-up patch?  If not, I can take it.  I'm also happy to help with testing., [~cnauroth], please review and help to test the patch I'm attaching. Thanks for catching this., Thanks, Andrey.  This looks good.  I found one more thing that needed to be fixed for {{TestHDFSFileContextMainOperations}}.  It inherits from {{FileContextMainOperationsBaseTest}}, which had a hard-coded call to the default constructor of {{FileContextTestHelper}}.  Rather than go back and forth on this, I tested a change similar to what you did elsewhere, and it passed on Windows.  I'm attaching version 2 of the patch, which includes that change.

Aside from that just a couple of minor style nitpicks:

# {{FileContextTestHelper}} has some lines indented by 4 spaces.  Can you please switch those to 2 spaces?
# The patch has a few lines that go past the 80-character limit when creating a new {{FileContextTestHelper}}.  Can you please split those, wrapping at 80 characters?
