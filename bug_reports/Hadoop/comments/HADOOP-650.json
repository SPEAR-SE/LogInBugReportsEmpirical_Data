[The problem is with the data not the software.
You have illegal sub-directory "/" inside /user. That is why it loops.

bin/hadoop dfs -ls /user
Found 7 items
/user   <dir>
/       <dir>
/user/mahadev   <dir>
....

The entries were probably created prior to HADOOP-423, which fixed the problem.
But I don't know how to get rid of this entries now when we do not allow them.
I guess a custom code should be written., Nobody else complained, but just in case I'd propose to include a deprecated method in FSImage
that would delete files named ".", ".." and "/" if any when loading the image.
, Another proposal is to make the removal of invalid files a part of fsck.
, it seems like this issue has been resolved. SHould we close this ?, >SHould we close this ?
+1, this has been fixed in 0.15 version.]
