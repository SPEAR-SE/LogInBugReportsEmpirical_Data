[This patch moves the check into hadoop-config and suppresses further warnings., I messed up the fix from HADOOP-7816. This pulls the hadoop-env into hadoop-config., applied the patch and built hadoop and ran the following tests

1. No HADOOP_HOME exported -> no warning
2. HADOOP_HOME exported -> warning
3. HADOOP_HOME and HADOOP_HOME_WARN_SUPPRESS set -> no warning
4. HADOOP_HOME set and HADOOP_HOME_WARN_S +UPRESS set in hadoop-env.sh -> no warning.

So it is working as expected. +1, Committed to 1.0.0 and branch-1.  Thanks, Owen!

Per HADOOP-7816, not needed on trunk., Closed upon release of version 1.0.0.]
