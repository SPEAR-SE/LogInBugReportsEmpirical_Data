[UnderReplicatedBlocks.update has an optimization that a under-replication block does not get added to the queue if a block was under-replicated and its previous priority is the same as the current priority. This optimization is based on the assumption that a previously under-replicated block should have already been in the queue.

For the case that Koji filed, due to for some bugs like HADOOP-4597, under-replicated blocks did not get to place in the under-replicated block queue at NameNode startup time. Later on changing a file's replication factor to be a bigger number does not trigger the move of the file's blocks into the queue if the replication factor change does not change their priority.

The fix for this problem is to remove the optimization., A patch for review., +1 This should work., Ant test-core passed on my local machine.
