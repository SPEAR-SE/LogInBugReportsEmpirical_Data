[Attached patch handles this case. This patch ignores open files by default but lists them as total number of open files. It provides an option '-open' when used will print the open files. , 1. The ClientProtocol # has to be bumped because LocatedBlocks is used in a few RPCs. Please check if NamenodeProtocol uses it too.

2. Maybe it is better to add a new field to DFSFileInfo to say whether a file is opened for writing. The open/close characteristics is more related to a file rather than a block. This can replace the new field that you added to LocatedBlocks.

3. The summary prints total file and total open files in two separate lines. One confusion is whether the total file count includes the open files or not. It might be better to put these two in the same line
     Total Files: 589 (Files that are currently being written to: 10)

4.  The "open" parameter to fsck might confuse people to wonder whether these files are opened for reading or writing. It would be worthwhile to come up with a different name of this command line parameter.

This message is automatically generated., This updated patch adds few more details. When hadoop fsck is run without any options it along with total number of open files, it also lists total number of blocks owned by those open files and also its size if it is greater than 0. When -openforwrite option is used, all of them are added up and reported as total blocks. 

Sample output when default fsck is invoked while a file is being written

{noformat}
[lohit@ hadoop-core-trunk]$ ./bin/hadoop fsck /
...Status: HEALTHY
 Total size:    420912 B
 Total dirs:    5
 Total files:   3 (Files currently being written: 1)
 Total blocks:  3 (avg. block size 140304 B) (Total open file blocks: 1)
 Minimally replicated blocks:   3 (100.0 %)
 Over-replicated blocks:        0 (0.0 %)
 Under-replicated blocks:       0 (0.0 %)
 Mis-replicated blocks:         0 (0.0 %)
 Default replication factor:    1
 Average block replication:     1.0
 Missing replicas:              0 (0.0 %)
 Number of data-nodes:          1
 Number of racks:               1


The filesystem under path '/' is HEALTHY
[lohit@ hadoop-core-trunk]$

{noformat}, Attached slightly modified patch with changes to messages printed. Here is the summary. 
- {{hadoop fsck /}} would ignore validating blocks owned by open files, but it does report number of files open, number of blocks owned by open files as not validated and total file size of such files
- {{hadoop fsck / -openforwrite}} defaults to checking all files and validating all blocks reporting for missing blocks as done now.

Here is sample output of {{hadoop fsck /}}

{noformat}
[lohit@ hadoop-core-trunk]$ ./bin/hadoop fsck / 
....Status: HEALTHY
 Total size:    2148912 B
 Total dirs:    5
 Total files:   4 (Files currently being written: 1)
 Total blocks (validated):      4 (avg. block size 537228 B) (Total open file blocks (not validated): 1)
 Minimally replicated blocks:   4 (100.0 %)
 Over-replicated blocks:        0 (0.0 %)
 Under-replicated blocks:       0 (0.0 %)
 Mis-replicated blocks:         0 (0.0 %)
