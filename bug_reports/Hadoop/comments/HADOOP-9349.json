[Good idea, I've seen this bite a few users before. Note though, that on 2.x and current 1.x, the HADOOP_HOME was deprecated for HADOOP_PREFIX and per-component homes. So maybe we could also look at HADOOP_COMMON_HOME, which is the lib set that has the VersionInfo?, Or perhaps just print the path to the hadoop common jar itself? That way this works even for projects like HBase that depend on Hadoop and print the hadoop version info in their webpage. It's also more independent of packaging, etc., What would be the best way to find the path to the hadoop common jar?  The script currently adds all the jars in certain folders.


  # tarball layout
  if [ -d "$HADOOP_HOME/webapps" ]; then
    CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$HADOOP_HOME
  fi
  for f in $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-core-*.jar; do
    CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f;
  done

  # add libs to CLASSPATH
  for f in $HADOOP_HOME/lib/*.jar; do
    CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f;
  done

  if [ -d "$HADOOP_HOME/build/ivy/lib/Hadoop/common" ]; then
    for f in $HADOOP_HOME/build/ivy/lib/Hadoop/common/*.jar; do
      CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f;
    done
  fi

  for f in $HADOOP_HOME/lib/jsp-2.1/*.jar; do
    CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:$f;
  done

  for f in $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-tools-*.jar; do
    TOOL_PATH=${TOOL_PATH}:$f;
  done
  for f in $HADOOP_HOME/build/hadoop-tools-*.jar; do
    TOOL_PATH=${TOOL_PATH}:$f;

, Check out JobConf.findContainingJar. You could run code like that from within the Java code in VersionInfo.java, Cool, that works.  Should I move that method to somewhere common or just copy it?, Either way works for me. If you move it you'll need to leave the old version too, pointing to your new location, for compatibility., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
