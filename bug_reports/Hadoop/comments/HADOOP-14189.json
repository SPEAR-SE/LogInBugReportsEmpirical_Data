add distcp-site.xml to override hadoop parameters for distcp, [~raviprak] could you please take a look? Thanks, Is there some reason -D params aren't working?  Adding a -site.xml per tool seems like overkill and a bad precedent., Thanks Fei Hui for your contribution! Isn't this the same as HADOOP-10738. Could you please take a look and close this as duplicate if it is?, Thanks Allen for your comment! I think the problem users face is that most of them want a common set of distcp options to be used all of the time. A distcp-site.xml (or other configuration place) would have been a natural place to put them. IMHO data transfer is important enough to merit this extra configuration file. Although I do get your point about having configuration strewn all over in multiple files. I'm not sure there is a better alternative though :( . Could we please continue on HADOOP-10738 ?, bq.  I think the problem users face is that most of them want a common set of distcp options to be used all of the time.

You should be able to set them in core-site.xml., [~raviprak] i will close this jira as duplicate, bq. You should be able to set them in core-site.xml.
Do we really want core-site.xml to be the catch-all for all configuration for all tools? See how that atomic blaster shoots both ways ;-)

Let's continue on HADOOP-10738]
