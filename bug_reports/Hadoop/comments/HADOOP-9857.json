[This relates back to HADOOP-7335 and HADOOP-7841, which started passing {{-Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom}}.  Officially, documentation says that we're supposed to use {{file:/dev/urandom}}, but according to this comment, that didn't work as expected on Linux:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7335?focusedCommentId=13042504&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13042504

Instead, we needed {{file:///dev/urandom}} to get the behavior that we want.

Unfortunately, this causes bad side effects on Windows, because the JVM tries to do an exact string match on "file:/dev/urandom" in logic for selecting the native entropy provider on Windows.  See line 256 here:

http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6/jdk/file/ffa98eed5766/src/share/classes/sun/security/provider/SunEntries.java

Also, see the logic starting at line 96 here:

http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6/jdk/file/ffa98eed5766/src/share/classes/sun/security/provider/SeedGenerator.java

By enabling {{-Djava.security.debug=all}}, I was able to see that it was entering the "Failed to create seed generator" code path after a 5-second delay.

The problem was made more obvious recently by the introduction of client ID in each RPC client instance.  This requires creation of a {{UUID}}, so creation of the first RPC client instance in a test would trigger the 5-second delay.
, Here is a patch to use {{file:/dev/urandom}} when running on Windows.  Note that this doesn't mean we actually attempt to open a file at that path on Windows.  (See earlier comment for explanation of how the JVM does a string match on this value to determine whether or not to use a native entropy implementation.)  Since comments in the earlier jiras said that {{file:/dev/urandom}} didn't work correctly on Linux, I hid this behind a Windows-specific Maven profile, so we'll keep using {{file:///dev/urandom}} on Linux and only use {{file:/dev/urandom}} on Windows., On Windows, I had been seeing timeouts in {{TestProtoBufRpc}} and {{TestDoAsEffectiveUser}}.

Nice find! Would you consider documenting it in the pom.xml where you make this setting for Windows? It is hard to guess why we use a non-existent device on Windows.

Verified that {{TestProtoBufRpc}} and {{TestDoAsEffectiveUser}} are fixed by the patch. They used to fail.

Interestingly {{TestDoAsEffectiveUser}} fails with JDK7 with an unrelated issue. I will file a separate Jira for that., bq. Would you consider documenting it in the pom.xml where you make this setting for Windows?

Good idea!  Here is a new patch., +1 for the updated patch pending +1 from Jenkins.

There are no new tests required, because this patch fixes multiple existing tests on Windows.
