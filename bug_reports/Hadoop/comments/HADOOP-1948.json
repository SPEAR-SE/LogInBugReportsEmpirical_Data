This message is automatically generated., +1 since the test failed is unrelated. This patch does not even touch normal DFS functionality. It only affects Upgrade from pre-0.14., Marking it Blocker so that it makes it to 0.14.2. The patch is safe and simple., I just committed this. Thanks Raghu., Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #257 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/257/])]
