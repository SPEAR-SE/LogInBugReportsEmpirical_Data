[This patch corrects 2 small issues:
# Previously, in HADOOP-10270, I had padded with spaces on the line before displaying effective permissions in getfacl.  On closer inspection of the Linux implementation, I see that this is really done with a tab character.  I'd like to change our implementation to use a tab for consistency.
# In HADOOP-10241, we relied on {{FsPermission#toString}} to append '+' to the permission string if an ACL is present, and we used this detail to determine column alignment.  Since removal of the ACL bit in HDFS-5923, this alignment logic is no longer correct.  The patch includes a correction for this.

I updated the ACL CLI tests, and I also tested manually against a cluster built from trunk., +1 for the patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
