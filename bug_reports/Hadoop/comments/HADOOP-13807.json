The following method in the UGI should add to the following IF condition {{&& !externalKeyTab}}:

{code}
  private void spawnAutoRenewalThreadForUserCreds() {
    if (isSecurityEnabled()) {
      //spawn thread only if we have kerb credentials
      if (user.getAuthenticationMethod() == AuthenticationMethod.KERBEROS &&
          !isKeytab) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
  ......        
{code}, Thanks [~tucu00] for reporting this.

Do you have the warn logs? Could be helpful to see what the exception is. (Too bad only versions [only log the exception message|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/d0a347984da175948b553a675dc357491df2fd0f/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/security/UserGroupInformation.java#L994], but that's still something...)

Looking at the code I think this (HADOOP-13807) and HADOOP-13805 are mutual exclusive: this only happens when {{isKeytab}} is false, and HADOOP-13805 only happens when {{isKeytab}} is true... Whether the keytab is external seems to only impact {{keytabFile}} parameter. Am I missing something?, [~xiaochen], 

the message was "java.io.IOException: loginUserFromKeyTab must be done first". 

you may be right that HADOOP-13805 may take care of this going away.

, Based on my understanding of this jira, it is a dup of HADOOP-13805.
I'll close this jira as a result. Please reopen if this is not the case. Thanks!]
