[Thanks [~fjk] for reporting this issue and creating the patch. The fix looks good to me. Would you fix {{MapredCommands.md}} also?, I'd like to include the fix in 2.7.1 since this issue is a regression from 2.6.0., Hi [~ajisakaa], thanks for the comment.

I fixed {{MapredCommand.md}}. I couldn't notice it., \\
