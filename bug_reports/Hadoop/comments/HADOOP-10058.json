[Attaching the logs., Attaching the logs when the test doesn't fail., The test fails at
{code}
    //When we call stop, at most two sources will be consumed by each sink thread.
    verify(sink1, atMost(2)).putMetrics(r1.capture());
{code}

IMO, TestSink.putMetrics() is called at most three times because there are three sources to be consumed. The three sources are s0rec, s1rec, and MetricsSystem.
I change the test code and attach a patch soon., Here is the part of the output of succeeded test:
{code}
2013-10-17 15:34:03,799 WARN  util.MBeans (MBeans.java:register(65)) - Failed to register MBean "Hadoop:service=Test,name=MetricsSystem,sub=Control": Instance already exists.
{code}
The above line is not found in the output of failed test.
I think failing to register MBean is not good case.

Therefore, HADOOP-9559 should be resolved before creating a patch for this issue., I tried a patch attached to HADOOP-9959 and found that the issue is nothing to do with the above WARN message.
Removing the link., This error is caused by Java 1.7 framework. In Java 1.6, test code are running in sequence. However, in 1.7, it is random order. Some test methods have dependencies. I have fixed this problem. Patch is attached., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
