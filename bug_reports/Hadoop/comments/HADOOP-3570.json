[I think this is applicable for all kinds of jobs, not limited to streaming only.
One way to handle this is in GenericOptionsParser itself. Adding the parsed jars to the conf classpath. 
It is demonstrated in the attached patch. Not tested yet., Setting the classpath in JobClient.configureCommandLineOptions. I think it would be the better place than GenericOptionsParser. The classloader is set in the thread context as well as in the conf.

This message is automatically generated., Amereshwari pointed out that as Streaming is not implementing the Tool, the libjars are not getting available for streaming. 
I fixed it by setting the classpath in RunJar which launches the Streaming application. 
Now I need to set the classloader in GenericOptionParser itself. The issue in setting it in JobClient is that it makes libjars available only after submitJob is called. However applications may requires to load a class (inputformat) before calling submitJob., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
