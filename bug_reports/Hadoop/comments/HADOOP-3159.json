, I agree with Doug, "hdfs" should not appear in FileSystem.
Could you please elaborate what and how you are trying to fix the problem. It is not clear from the comments in the issue., One option would be to always invoke UnixUserGroupInformation.login (without check for "hdfs"). Howeverm the login() method could have a static variable that caches the last value. This way there will not perrormance impact even if login gets called many many times within the same process., 
Digressing a little bit, the fundamental confusion seems to be that the key used by the cache needs scheme, authority, and username, but it only requires scheme and authority for look up.. so tries derive username some how. In long term, hopefully the interface itself gets fixed.

> We shouldn't do hdfs-specific stuff in FileSystem.java.
If the ugi is not found in conf, it will login for any file system.  For better performance, a LOGIN_UGI will be stored in UserGroupInformation.  So actual login is done only once., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1 The new patch is acceptable.  Longer-term it seems to me we need a static login(Configuration, URI) method, and the possibility to register different login methods for different URI schemes, e.g., fs.login.hdfs=UnixUserGroupInformation.  The static method would then, when the configuration has no login information invoke the login method of the class named for that scheme, if any., This patch is committed.
