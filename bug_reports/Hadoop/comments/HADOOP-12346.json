[Attaching patch that increases configuration, code and documentation files., -1 to any changes to s3n; its used enough that changing things would only cause surprises. Things installed via management tooling can pick up the defaults from those, and the people who do the tools can therefore control what those defaults are. More succinctly "we don't like changing defaults, even when they aren't always the best"

As s3a is newer, that's probably more amenable to change, under the "getting it working completely" category, sorry, misread: you aren't changing s3n are you?

I'll let others look at this patch, but I don't currently have any reason to -1 it., Correct, my patch applies to s3a only., \\

This message was automatically generated., I did manual testing of this by running a bunch of distcp and teragen / terasort jobs against S3 with various size datasets at different times of day. I haven't had any failures with the new defaults applied - it's noticably more reliable. I haven't added tests because no functionality / code is changing - just default configuration values. An automated test seems impractical since this is intended to address occasional flakiness., This looks like a straightforward change to some defaults; I'm +1. Will trust in what sounds like extensive testing by Sean.

[~stevel@apache.org] any thoughts? else I'll commit later., LGTM +1., +1, Committed.

Thanks much for the reviews, [~andrew.wang] and [~stevel@apache.org].
Also thanks the effort of working on this, [~mackrorysd]., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8369 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8369/])
