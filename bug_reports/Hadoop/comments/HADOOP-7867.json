[Dave i think the fix in HADOOP-7827 might be the cause of this., Possible.  I will check it out.  I tried a few browsers, but there are always more.  :-), Even on the namenode UI the bars that show the used % have the new design and the progress bars are not colored, It looks like HADOOP-7827 broke this issue.  I've reverted it, please retest.  Thanks., Update target version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, upon release of version 1.0.0., Moved to 1.2.0 upon release of 1.1.0., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2.]
