[The point is to try to get map tasks with side effects to sometimes succeed, even with speculative execution?  That sounds like it could be a bad idea.  Wouldn't it be better to have map tasks with side effects fail more frequently with speculative execution, so that you find such problems sooner, with smaller datasets on a smaller cluster, before you try a big run?  Or am I misunderstanding you?, My goal with this would be to do the equivalent of "make -k" or a "best effort" job. It the option was set, the job would continue after a given TIP had failed 4 times, but that TIP would be abandoned., Fixed as a part of HADOOP-1144]
