This message is automatically generated., This patch looks fine to me, except that I think you can also replace the DelegationTokenProto in yarn_protos.proto with this new refactored TokenProto.

Unless I'm missing the pattern, it seems we're pretty inconsistent about capitalizing the .proto files throughout the project. Did you consciously choose to capitalize the name of the file? If not, I'd recommend making it lower case, but I don't feel strongly about it.

I don't think you actually need to split this patch up into smaller ones. The change is straightforward, and it seems better to me to keep it as one, since it is logically a single refactor., bq. Did you consciously choose to capitalize the name of the file
Several changes have recently been done to capitalize the file names correctly. This is consistent with other files in hadoop-common-project., Updated patch to replace DelegationTokenProto with TokenProto in yarn, Works for me.

+1, the latest patch looks good to me. Thanks, Suresh., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~sseth] told me that this patch will disrupt YARN-50. I will commit the common and HDFS changes. I will rebase the YARN and MR patch once YARN-50 goes in and will do it in a separate jira., YARN side changes look good. Moving from "optional" to "required" on the yarn side shouldn't cause problems.
This change ends up breaking the patch posted on YARN-50 though. If it's not an issue, I'd prefer getting that patch in before making at least the YARN/MR side changes. Otherwise, I can of-course re-base that patch.
Also, for a future jira, RequestDelegationTokenRequest, Response etc - could also be moved to common., Comment race. Thanks Suresh., Part of the patch with common and HDFS changes. Given this has been reviewed, I will commit it once I get +1 from Jenkins., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
