{code}
String newLocalDirs = conf.get(contextCfgItemName);
if (!newLocalDirs.equals(savedLocalDirs)) {
				int minDiskFreeThresholdMb = conf.getInt("hadoop.min.local.disk.freespace.threshold", 1024);
{code}

Here newLocalDirs will become null and it'll throw NPE..

I did fix like this..

{code}
  String newLocalDirs = conf.get(contextCfgItemName);
			if (null == newLocalDirs) {
				throw new IOException("dfs.client.buffer.dir not configured");
			}
      if (!newLocalDirs.equals(savedLocalDirs) ) {
        localDirs = StringUtils.getTrimmedStrings(newLocalDirs);

This message is automatically generated., Cancelling patch Since it's depend on HADOOP-8437 patch..AS Both patches are applicable to same class.After HADOOP-8437 got committed then will make patch available.., Hi,

Does this functionally depend on HADOOP-8437 as per your earlier comment? I don't seem to see the patch relying on it.

The parameter {{dfs.client.buffer.dir}} appears very, very outdated to me, and whatever is using that must be removed or changed to use a new config name. We no longer require buffer directories in DFS writes as we used to in ancient versions of HDFS.

Comments on patch:

{code}
+	  if (null == newLocalDirs) { 
+        throw new IOException(contextCfgItemName + " not configured"); 
+      }
{code}

Indentation issue near {{if}}

{code}
+ fail("not throwing the exception"); 
{code}

Same comment about this as on HADOOP-8437. Please apply a better failure message that makes it easier for us to debug it if it ever fails in future someday.

{code}
+      assertEquals("Incorrect exception message", 
+          CONTEXT+" not configured", e.getMessage()); 
{code}

Probably wanna space between the strings concatenated here.

Thanks!, Canceling patch until comments are addressed., HI Harsh,
