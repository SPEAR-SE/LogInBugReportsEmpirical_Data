, This is not applicable to trunk due to HADOOP-6671, +1 patch looks good.

Unfortunately, I can't validate it because maven wagon pluging doesn't exist locally and can't be in installed automatically because of some mvn repository issues not related to the patch. 

Will be committing it., I have committed this. Thanks Joep!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-22-branch #67 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-22-branch/67/])
