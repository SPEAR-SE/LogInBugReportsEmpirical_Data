[The issue is with the call 
{{
  bloomKey.set(buf.getData(), 1.0);
}}
which appears twice in the BloomMapFile source.  The buf variable is a DataOutputBuffer.  The documentation for DataOutputBuffer clearly states that getData() is only valid to getLength().  But bloomKey is an o.a.h.util.bloom.Key which expects the entire array that it is getting to be valid.
