[While attempting to create a 'universal' configuration for our nodes, I was dismayed to discover that if log4j.properties has the following enabled:

log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.fs.FSNamesystem.audit=INFO,DRFAAUDIT

on a client node, the hadoop will try to open/write to the audit log despite not being the namenode process., Ops teams are expected to have multiple, different configurations for services served via their configuration management systems.  Closing as won't fix.]
