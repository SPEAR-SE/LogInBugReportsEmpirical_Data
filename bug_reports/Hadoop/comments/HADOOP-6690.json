[Can you use FilterFs? It has setTimes., Is FilterFs supposed to suppress FilterFileSystem? When was it introduced? , FilterFs is the AbstractFileSystem version of FilterFileSystem. If you're doing work on trunk you should be writing against the new APIs (or at least make sure they stay on par), if you're making a change against branch 20 then you'll want FilterFileSystem. I'm assuming you want setTimes to work on LocalFileSystem?, I noticed the problem when using contrib/raid, which currently relies on FilterFileSystem (because it was originally implemented on hadoop 0.20). Maybe we should change the trunk version to work with FilterFs.

However, this workaround doesn't make FilterFileSystem more correct. We should either fix it or deprecate it so that people don't feel compelled to use it in the future. What do you think?, Having FilterFileSystem override setTimes (and other APIs) is very reasonable. Just pointing out the new APIs in case you were doing trunk work. We'll want to move contrib/raid off FileSystem as part of HADOOP-6446., Sure! Thanks for the hint, BTW. 

With respect to HADOOP-6446, I should be able to help with Raid/Har/DistCp as soon as I'm done with some critical raid patches., Uploading patch, +1  Patch looks good.   Mind adding TestFilterFs that's a FilterFs equivalent to TestFilterFileSystem? Should be an pretty easy port., Sure! I can do that. I'll update the patch later today., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The warnings are generated because the methods of the DontCheck class are used by reflection. I'll silence these warnings in my next patch, but I'm not sure if Hadoop QA won't complain about that., Eli, while I was creating TestFilterFs, I realized there was a number of methods that were not being implemented. Some of them are quite suspicious like getUri(), getStatistics(), getHomeDirectory(), ... Can you please double check if FilterFs is fine without these methods. If it's not the case, it would be better to create a separate JIRA for that.

Here is the complete list:

{code}
{
    public FSDataInputStream open(final Path f) { return null; }
    public void checkPath(Path path) { }
    public Statistics getStatistics() { return null; }
    public URI getUri() { return null; }
    public Path getHomeDirectory() { return null; }
    public void checkScheme(URI uri, String supportedScheme) { }
    public String getUriPath(final Path p) { return null; }
    public void renameInternal(final Path src, final Path dst, boolean overwrite) { }
    public FsStatus getFsStatus(final Path f) { return null; }
}
{code}, New patch without any warnings., New patch without any warnings., I was talking to Dhruba and we thought it would be better to create a new issue to discuss the methods missing on FilterFs() and its unit test.
