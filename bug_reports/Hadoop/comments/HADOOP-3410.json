This message is automatically generated., Could you add a test case for this?, The existing test cases that are included for KFS cover this interface.  The change here is adding a call to the KFS library to get at the file's modification time; previously, kfs-0.1.jar didn't include such an API and hence I was returning 0., I just committed this.  Thanks, Sriram!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #511 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/511/])]
