[Linking to HADOOP-8756, which introduced the change in {{NativeCodeLoader}}.

The failing tests on Windows are {{org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.TestCodec}} and {{org.apache.hadoop.util.TestNativeLibraryChecker}}., Fix link errors by building LZ4 library and Snappy stub routine on Windows., Thanks, Arpit.  I tested this on Windows and Ubuntu with native build, and it worked great.  Here are a couple of comments.  I am +1 for the patch after removal of some unneeded #includes unless those #includes are there for some reason that I missed.  (See below for details.)

{code}
+      <DisableSpecificWarnings>4244</DisableSpecificWarnings>
{code}

I believe this setting would disable the warning across the whole project, right?  Another option could be to upgrade our lz4.c.  It looks like there have been some recent changes to address warnings seen when compiling on Windows:

http://code.google.com/p/lz4/source/detail?r=75&path=/trunk/lz4.c

I'm sure that would be a much larger scope though, so it's probably best to treat it as a separate jira.

{code}
+#include "org_apache_hadoop.h"
+#include "org_apache_hadoop_io_nativeio_NativeIO.h"
{code}

Is it necessary to add these #includes to NativeCodeLoader.c?  I tried removing them, and I was still able to compile.
, Thanks for the review!

org_apache_hadoop.h defines UNIX/WINDOWS so it is necessary. I removed the second include., +1

Sounds good!
, +1. I will commit this patch shortly., I committed the patch to branch-trunk-win. Thank you Aprit!

Thank you Chris for the review., Thanks Suresh.]
