[This issue appears to have been resolved in the latest Hadoop Trunk in SVN (ID 732572).  I was able to run ANT build successfully using various intermediate targets up to and including full package build.  Should I close this ticket/update status?, Yes, please resolve if this is fixed., Will do.  Thanks Nigel., This appears to have been issues with the Ant build file.  Changes to the build file in a subsequent revision resolved this issue.]
