This message is automatically generated., Hi [~ywskycn], thanks for making this change. Java 6 doesn't support TLSv1.2. Robert noted this in HADOOP-11217 as well. Should we be adding TLSv1.2 in this patch? , Thanks, [~schu]. You're right, we shouldn't add TLSv1.2. And according to this jdk document: https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/diagnosing_tls_ssl_and_https. JDK6 actually only supports TLSv1. I verified in a cluster that TLSv1.1 should also be removed when using jdk 6. Will confirm with Robert later., Hi, [~schu].

Just committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.6. , Given the fact that we're moving towards Java 7 in 2.7 maybe it's valuable to create another jira to either change the default value of the configuration for a more secure one or to remove it., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
