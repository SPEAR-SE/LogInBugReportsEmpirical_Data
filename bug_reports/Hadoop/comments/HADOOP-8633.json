This message is automatically generated., The changes look OK. I'm not sure I really like TargetFileSystem. I just don't see a lot of benefit from making TargetFileSystem.  I think it would be cleaner to just have your own list of Paths to delete and then delete them in the finally block.  Having it be a FileSystem just seems confusing to me. 

Because TargetFileSystem is never added to the FileSystem cache I assume that if a System.exit is called somewhere while processing the command the TargetFileSystem will not be closed and the files will not actually be deleted on exit.  Is this important?, The {{TargetFileSystem}} is just a shim over a real filesystem that is registering and canceling temp paths for deletion.  The shim simplifies all the code performing the copy and helps ensure the temp files are cancelled and/or deleted immediately.  I originally did what you suggest and I wound up with multiple nested try blocks and conditions that made the code (imho) harder to read, understand, and difficult to test.

It's true that a call to {{System.exit}} won't cleanup the filesystem, but it's only called as the last line in {{main}}.  Calling it in other places would break functionality and be a bug.

(I did manually run a copy with 100 iterations and pounded on control-c and no remnants where left), Ok +1, I went ahead and committed this. Thanks Daryn, Bobby, and Kihwal!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2612 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2612/])
