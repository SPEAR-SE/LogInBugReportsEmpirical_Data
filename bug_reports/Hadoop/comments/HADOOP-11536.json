[{code}__attribute__((format(printf, 3, 4))){code} is GCC specific.

VC++ has similar SAL Annotation {code}_Printf_format_string_{code}
Refer: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235402(v=vs.120).aspx

We need to wrap these in compiler specific {code}#ifdef{code}



, VC++ SAL annotations seem to available only in enterprise edition.
So not adding any format validations in WINDOWS.

Defining macro {code}TYPE_CHECKED_PRINTF_FORMAT{code} and stubbing it on windows. This is similar to approach taken for exception.h in HDFS native.

Since {{__attribute__}} is specific to gcc its defined under {{#ifdef __GNUC__}}

, Just updated my repository and saw that [~cnauroth] has already given patch under HADOOP-11547, Hi [~kiranmr].  Sorry I missed your earlier filed issue., Thats fine [~cnauroth], this issue was blocking windows compilation, so getting it resolved was important.]
