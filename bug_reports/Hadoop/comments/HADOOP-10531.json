[Hi [~sbarrier], I looked at this and agree that it's a typo and that your proposed fix works. Could you make a diff from the project root (name it something like "hadoop-10531-1.patch") and attach it to this JIRA? I'll then +1 and commit it.

A lot of work I know for a 1-character patch, but that's our process :), Fix a typo in hadoop-config.sh, Hmm, patch isn't quite right since this is against what looks like your local tarball, rather than the trunk codebase. You can check out the source via anon SVN (svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/trunk/ hadoop-trunk) or github (https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common).

This wiki page also has more details. You can skip most of it since this is just a shell script change, but it explains source control and making a patch.

I also made you a Hadoop contributor, so now you can do this yourself by hitting the "Submit patch" button, which triggers a CI run on Jenkins., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
