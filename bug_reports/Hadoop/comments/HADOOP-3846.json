This is right. fileNamePreffix is added to each path component during file generation.
Could you please correct the javaDoc comments. I think "fsimage" should not be mentioned anywhere.
It should also say
"The file+*s* are created in {{/createdViaInjectingInEditsLog}}"
, Thanks Konstantin. Updated patch changes the comments, no code changes. So could be checked in as it has passed all tests., I just committed this. Thanks, Lohit, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
