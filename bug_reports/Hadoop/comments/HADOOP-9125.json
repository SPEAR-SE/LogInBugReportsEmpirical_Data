[It was caused because DirContext used to connect/query LDAP/AD is cached in LdapGroupsMapping, however, according to Oracle JNDI/LDAP explained as below, the underlying Context and Connection can be garbage collected.

In http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/ldap/close.html, it says:
Normal garbage collection takes care of removing Context instances when they are no longer in use. Connections used by Context instances being garbage collected will be closed automatically. ..., One possible fix would be: 
create new DirContext so that new Connection can be made whenever found CommunicationException when querying in getGroups call., We just had a fix as proposed above and it works fine. Any better idea?, That seems like a relatively reasonable fix to me. The only thing I'm not sure of is which exception gets thrown if the connection fails due to the LDAP server being legitimately down, or something along those lines. You wouldn't want to spam the system with connection attempts that will never succeed., In our fix it tried to reconnect 3 times and then throw final exception for the getGroups() call. Just verified that the exception thrown due to the LDAP server being shutdown is also the CommunicationException.

Just trying to reconnect some times is simple. A complex one would be to detect connection close event using the UnsolicitedNotificationListener stuff, but I'm wondering if it's too overweight., Thanks for code review., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
