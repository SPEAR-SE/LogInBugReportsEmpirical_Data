This message is automatically generated., hudson failed because patch applies to MAPREDUCE for trunk, going to file a separate JIRA for that and attach patch for trunk there., MAPREDUCE-2575 has patch for trunk., I just committed this to the branch. Thanks Tom. Will review/commit the trunk patch soon., Hadoop 0.20.204.0 was released today.]
