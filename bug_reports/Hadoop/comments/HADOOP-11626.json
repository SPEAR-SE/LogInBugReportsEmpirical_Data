This message is automatically generated., I think [~ozawa] is correct here.  The code that updates ReadStatistics is correct since the read actually occurred.

However, one thing that concerns me here is that {{nread}} can be -1, in the case where the block reader hit EOF.  We should not be adding -1 to the read statistics.

Can you make a patch to check for this case and avoid updating when it it is true?  Also, it seems that this "short read" case is an error, and therefore worthy of a {{LOG.info}} at least... currently, it looks like we don't log anything at all, which could make diagnosing problems difficult., [~ozawa] and [~cmccabe] Thanks for reviewing this. You are correct. Now I realized that the read stats are for the actual read occurred. I updated the patch to add comments to {{ReadStatistics}} to make this clear. 

Also I added {{LOG.info}} for the error. 

bq. However, one thing that concerns me here is that nread can be -1, in the case where the block reader hit EOF. We should not be adding -1 to the read statistics.

[~cmccabe] This case has already been handled in {{DFSInputStream#updateReadStatistics}}.

This message is automatically generated., bq. Colin Patrick McCabe This case has already been handled in DFSInputStream#updateReadStatistics.

Ah, good catch.

{code}
1143	          String errMessage = String.format(
1144	              "truncated return from reader.read(): excpected %d, got %d",
1145	              len, nread);
{code}

The log message should be capitalized.  Probably something like "Unexpected short read" would be better.  "truncated return" sounds like something that could be a normal expected return (to me, at least).  Also, we should put the name of the DN (or possibly block reader) that is getting the short read in there somewhere., Thanks Lei and Colin for taking this issue. Colin's comment looks good to me too.
[~eddyxu], could you address Colins' comment?, [~ozawa] and [~cmccabe] Thank you so much for reviewing this and helping with the directions.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks, Eddy.  I guess what concerns me now is that we are checking for {{(nread != len)}}, but then we're announcing that the read was short without actually checking that {{nread < len}}.  It might require a logic error for {{nread > len}}, but it still seems like something that could happen if there is a bug.  I think we should only log about a short read after we check that it was short.  There is also another place where this logic message and exception occur, so we should change both (or put them in a common function) if we are changing either., Move this out of 2.8 given this jira don't make any progress for more than 1 year., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
