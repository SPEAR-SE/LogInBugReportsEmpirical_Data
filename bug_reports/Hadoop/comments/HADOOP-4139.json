[I verified the plan - can someone from Hive comment , I should be done reviewing this in couple of hours...

A few minor comments though:

1. In the tests we should drop the created destination tables. At some point we want to ensure that the cleanup code for a test is isolated within the test. (This is minor - I am ok with it as is for now).
2. The check to disallow different distincts - can that be moved up and potentially even before we generate the groupbyPlan. No point going through the entire processing stuff if we can disallow it right up front.
3. Also a comment describing the algorithm somewhere would be great
, 1. I will change the test.
2. The check is done before the plan is generated.
3. I will write comments/algrithm
, Namit and I went over this. The following are the comments:

1. In OpForward instead of copying input row resolver we could use the same one.
2. In the first job we evaluate all the input columns + all group by clause expressions + parameters to all the aggregation functions and do not eliminate all the duplicates because we treat expression resolution and column resolution differently (To be fixed in a later txn).
3. We can be smarter in terms of this list of what parameters we evaluate in the first stage, we should only evaluate those that are common across the group by clauses (To be fixed in a later txn.)
