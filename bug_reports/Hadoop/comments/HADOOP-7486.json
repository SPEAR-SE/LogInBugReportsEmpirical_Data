[The unrelated HADOOP-7378 (other than it touched the same file) should have fixed the test failure., Can you add details about test failure?, I do not see these failure. Post HADOOP-7378, the tests are passing for other jiras. On my dev environment the test does not fail either., Hi Suresh,
 Thanks for update on this issue!

Actually when i debugged the test failure report in HADOOP-7178, i observed one failure in TestCLI.



2011-07-27 18:55:22,407 INFO  cli.CLITestHelper (CLITestHelper.java:displayResults(180)) -          Comparision result:   [fail]
2011-07-27 18:55:22,407 INFO  cli.CLITestHelper (CLITestHelper.java:displayResults(182)) -             Expected output:   [^( |\t)*rather than a number of bytes.( )*]
2011-07-27 18:55:22,408 INFO  cli.CLITestHelper (CLITestHelper.java:displayResults(184)) -               Actual output:   [-ls [-R] [-h] [<path> ...]:	List the contents that match the specified file pattern. If
		path is not specified, the contents of /user/<currentUser>


But in next report it passed. :-) ( might be some intermediate committs causes this.not sure)
Anyway now now issue.
