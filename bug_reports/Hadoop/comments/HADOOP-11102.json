[I need curator for YARN-913; I'd been sticking to 2.4.1 as it's jackson version was compatible with Hadoop 2.4, and it was build against Guava 14.0.1.

Importing curator 2.6 means there's a significant risk that its eventually going to call classes and methods that arent in the 11.02 JAR

Where does that leave Hadoop?
# do the guava update? I'm personally in favour of this. See HADOOP-10101 patch for that
# make sure that Hadoop can run against Guava 16, which means moving off anything deprecated in the current builds, as well as working around other incompatible changes (e.g. HADOOP-10961)

What we can't do is ignore this as we now have an inconsistent set of dependencies, My plan: stay with guava 11 in hadoop 2.x, fix things to work there and against later versions of Guava â€”so people can update if they want to, even though hadoop doesn't itself.
# fix Hadoop so it builds/runs against Guava 16 *as an option*. That means: replace classes used in Hadoop which are not in Guava 16 with alternatives (as HBase has done)
# add a {{-Pguava-latest}} profile to verify hadoop does build against it
# roll back to Curator 2.4.1, which only depends on guava 14. AFAIK there are no classes in guava 11 that aren't in guava 14.

Hadoop 3 can move to guava 16+

This implies that part of curator is not compatible with guava 11, though it is not a core module.
As 2.4.1 builds without problems, I think the patch should still go in, +1 (non-binding)

The {{curator-x-discovery-server}} is for the Service Discovery Server, which creates a RESTful server interface for non-Java programs to use the Service Discovery recipe ({{curator-x-discovery}}), and I don't think Hadoop is currently using either of those, so it should be fine; at least for now., Apparently OOzie and WebHCat works with hadoop 2.x & Curator 2.6 on its classpath, so it is compatible for all main uses other than the x-service-discovery module. Closing as a WONTFIX]
