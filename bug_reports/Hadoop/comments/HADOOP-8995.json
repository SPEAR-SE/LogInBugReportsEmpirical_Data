[Patch uploaded., +1 for the change., I committed the patch to branch-1. Thank you Jing., Just to clarify, these were not _bogus_ but helpers in identifying what classes instantiated the Configuration object (prints a trace).

Has not come helpful to me personally, but was a good thing to have (just in case). Perhaps we could have just lowered its level below DEBUG, such as TRACE., Harsh, this was introduced many many years ago. Of all these years I have worked on Hadoop I do not remember using this. This also has been removed from the trunk.
, included in branch-1.1, Closed upon release of 1.1.1.]
