[Attached patch fixes the problem.

I am still using nc to verify that it's down, since it's possible that, if the user is wrong, then fuser won't be able to find the listening process. (it has to be either the same user or root).

I tested locally by using my external hostname and verifying the following in the logs:

12/03/19 21:40:19 INFO ha.SshFenceByTcpPort: Connected to todd-w510
12/03/19 21:40:19 INFO ha.SshFenceByTcpPort: Looking for process running on port 8020
