[This patch ensures that files opened by the tests get closed.  Most of the patch is indentation changes caused by introducing try-finally.  I successfully ran the tests on both Mac and Windows., One more note on this patch: I needed to change the stub {{CompressionCodec}} used in the tests to return a non-null value from {{createOutputStream}}.  This is because the logic inside the {{close}} method assumes that the underlying {{CompressionOutputStream}} is non-null.  Without this change, some of the tests were throwing {{NullPointerException}} when I tried to close the files., The patch looks good. Nit:

{code}
+      writer.close();
+      writer = null;
{code}

Some of these code can be removed. +1 after addressing the comments., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks, Haohui.  The redundant setting to null was intended to prevent double-close in the finally block, but it appears these objects are tolerant of double-close.  Here is patch v2 removing the redundant setting to null.  This version still passes on both Mac and Windows.  I'll commit this version after a Jenkins run., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
