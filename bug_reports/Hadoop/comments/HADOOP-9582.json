This message is automatically generated., I've been looking at this a bit more, and now I'm worried about some compatibility issue. It looks like {{-conf}} can be used to specify any resource path. Is this right, or am I misreading it?

If I am right, I could go {{--conf ftp://common/stdconf.xml}}, or {{--conf http://service/cluster-site.xml}}.

This could be handy -so I'm worried that some people may already be using it. If they are, we've got a problem.

At the same time, delving into {{Configuration.loadResource()}} looks like it gets the URI of the {{Path}} instance, calls {{getPath()}} on it and then converts it to a file for loading (skipping missing entries).

Is that right? That the {{Path}} representation of a command line path is simply an intermediate state -and that it doesn't interfere with the intermediate state.

If backwards compatibility isn't at risk -which I think is the case- then this check is something we can keep in, though it may be safer to build the 

{code}
  resource = new Path(value)
  File confFile = new File((resource).toUri().getPath()); //from Configuration
  if (! confFile.exists()) { throw ... }
  conf.addResource(resource);
{code}
The advantage with this approach is we can be confident the relative path resolution logic is consistent in both places. Which is something that tests could look for as well.

(I'm just adding extra work here, aren't I? Sorry)

, My current (YARN-117) fork of Hadoop trunk has an extra test in Configuration -it doesn't load empty files. This is the patch from HADOOP-9453, adding a {{file.length() > 0}} to the criteria, and stopping the XML parser failing on an empty file.

Should your -conf code reject empty files too? Today that triggers the XML parser failure -it's hard to see why we'd want to permit it once HADOOP-9453 gets checked in, {quote}I've been looking at this a bit more, and now I'm worried about some compatibility issue. It looks like -conf can be used to specify any resource path. Is this right, or am I misreading it?{quote}
I'm not sure whether URIs are allowed for '-conf' option.I checked up the documentation and javadoc, it doesn't talk about URIs. But I would tend to believe that URIs are allowed ,since its allowed for other options like hadoop fs -fs <URI>.If this is the case,then you're right,we have a problem.

{quote}At the same time, delving into Configuration.loadResource() looks like it gets the URI of the Path instance, calls getPath() on it and then converts it to a file for loading (skipping missing entries).{quote}
Yes,that's right. Here is where it gets interesting and I have a question for you.
Configuration.loadResource() has the following code :
{code}
if (doc == null && root == null) {
        if (quiet)
          return null;
        throw new RuntimeException(resource + " not found");
      }
{code}
Looking at the code,it seems that if 'file' doesn't exist we do throw RuntimeException if the 'quiet' flag is false,which means removing the 'quiet' flag seems to solve our problem.My question is why is there a 'quiet' flag in the first place ? I tried to look at svn file history and this particular code snippet goes back to early days(2006),hence no documentation about it. 
Do you know about this flag ?
Is there some ancient use-case where its legal to give a non-existent config file as arguments while loading it 'quietly' ? because this patch will break that.   , Ashwin 

# I don't know the history of that, let's ask. 
# fs shell calls {{setQuietMode(true)}} in {{init()}} and doesn't provide a way to turn it off. So even if we consider your current patch surplus, we do still need a way to turn the flag on.
, I've turned on the 'quiet' flag in FsShell.
This would cause a Runtime exception to be raised when the user gives a nonexistent resource. I've also changed INFO logs(which depends on the flag) to debug so that output is not verbose., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This would solve the problem for "hadoop fs" but since -conf is a GenericOptionsParser thing, it doesn't address the many other places where -conf could be specified and processed by GenericOptionsParser.  Is the real fix in a more central location like GenericOptionsParser or Configuration?  If we just target FsShell then we'll have to address this behavior in many places and open the door to inconsistencies with missing configuration files based on who's using GenericOptionsParser., Hi Jason,
Thanks for your comments. Yes this patch doesn't address the problem in other places apart from FsShell. But could we check this in so that we are good atleast from the FsShell standpoint. Maybe we could create another JIRA to investigate whether we break any use-case if we make the change directly in GenericOptionsParser.   , Seems reasonable to at least make a small improvement to FsShell to catch bad -conf parameters, and that should be lower risk than having GenericOptionsParser start blindly setting all Configurations passed to it as non-quiet.

Some comments on the latest patch:

* TestGenericOptionsParser change now seems moot, since we didn't modify GenericOptionsParser and it doesn't test the FsShell change.
* Nit: In TestFsShell rather than wielding AssertionFailedError directly we can simply use assertTrue(th instanceof RuntimeException), {quote}

Yes,right. I've reverted that change in the latest patch.

I did do this in one my previous patch,however Steve(on 22/May/13 06:01) recommended that raising AssertionFailedError would be better for diagnostics.

Ah, yes, that makes sense for better diagnostics.
