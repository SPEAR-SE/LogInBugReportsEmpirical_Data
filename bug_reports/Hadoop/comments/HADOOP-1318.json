This message is automatically generated., Testfailure is due to timeout and not related to the patch. And all the tests passed on my machine., I just committed this. Thanks, Amareshwari!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #499 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/499/]), This issue requires to simulate lost task trackers. And cannot be simulated by just killing the task trackers, because we have to make sure that one of the maps running on the tasktrackers is complete. And the tasktracker is running more tasks. Thus it is difficult to write a testcase for the issue. I simulated the scenario on a cluster and tested the patch.]
