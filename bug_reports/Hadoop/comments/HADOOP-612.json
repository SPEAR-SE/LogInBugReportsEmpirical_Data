[Hi sanjay, 
Is it likely that the property "dfs.client.buffer.dir" is not set in your configuration? if so, then this bug can be fixed by simply putting a try, catch block in the code segment you pointed out.  Please let me know if you want me to fix it., sorry for late response, missed it somehow. 
I will cross check and get back soon. , Is it possible to close this bug?
, I am closing this one because this does not happen anymore.]
