[This fixes ant test (thanks nigel for your help) . Also changes TestSymLink to adhere to the new MiniMRCluster changes. This patch also includes a bugfix for DistributedCache in which while iteratorating elementes were being removed (causing a concurrentmodificationexception). All the fixes are just one line, so I included it all in one patch., I just committed this.  Thanks, Mahadev!]
