I guess nobody else building hadoop in windows 32 bit.. ;), this patch works to me.
I read there has  Platform environment variable  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/trunk/BUILDING.txt
is this patch works in both 32 and 64 bit with Platform environment variable specified?

set Platform=x64 (when building on a 64-bit system)
set Platform=Win32 (when building on a 32-bit system)  , I hope it should work as both configurations are different based on env variable.

As building in 64-bit doesn't need this patch, it was not tested with the patch in 64bit machine with Platform=x64, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~vinayrpet].  Sorry to let your patch linger so long here.  :-)  Let's try to get it in now.

The change here looks good to me, but the patch needs to be rebased.  We also now have LibHDFS building on Windows.  That one uses CMake, but the build generator is hard-coded to "Visual Studio 10 Win64" in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/pom.xml.  I think we'll need to look for a way to parameterize that for a 32-bit build.  Let me know your thoughts.

This message is automatically generated., I have been compiling and using Hadoop on both Winx64 and Win32 from past few months.
Following are some inputs from my side.

1. Win 7 SDK is no longer supported from Microsoft. After installing some updates ( NET 4.5.1 SDK or Windows Update kb2455033) , it stopped working and got following error during compilation {code} fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'ammintrin.h': No such file or directory' {code}

Microsoft has no solution for this. See the first comment in this link https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/660584/windows-update-kb2455033-breaks-build-with-missing-ammintrin-h They recommend using VC++ 2010 SP1 or later compilers like 2012 Express or 2013 Express. There is no fix for Win7 SDK, which many people may be using.

So to compile x64 build, I used VS 2013 Express and Win8.1 SDK. This needs upgrading .sln and .vcxproj files.
I have documented my compilation steps here http://zutai.blogspot.com/2014/06/build-install-and-run-hadoop-24-240-on.html?showComment=1422091525887#c2264594416650430988

2. For Win32 build using VS2013, I ended up modifying some C++ code to overcome these errors in HDFS
{code}
[exec] thread_local_storage.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _tls_used [D:\h\hadoop-2.6.0-src\hadoop-hdfs-project\hadoop-hdfs\target\native\hdfs.vcxproj]
[exec] thread_local_storage.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol pTlsCallback [D:\h\hadoop-2.6.0-src\hadoop-hdfs-project\hadoop-hdfs\target\native\hdfs.vcxproj]

Error	1	error C2440: 'function' : cannot convert from 'DWORD (__cdecl *)(LPVOID)' to 'LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE'	D:\hadoop-git\hadoop-hdfs-project\hadoop-hdfs\src\main\native\libhdfs\os\windows\thread.c 
{code}

Issue HDFS-7774 has been logged by others also for similar error. I had attached a temp workaround patch there.

3. I also see issue HADOOP-11080 to convert hadoop-common to use cmake

Overall I think, following changes may be needed:
- Parametrize Win32/X64 and VC++ version also ( I think CMake can autodetect)
- Use CMake for both hadoop-common and hdfs. Let it generate proper build files based on VC+ version and x64/Win32
- Files that are modified in HDFS-7774 needs to be properly changed to compile on both x64/Win32






, [~kiranmr], thank you for your detailed investigation into this.  I'd like to recommend proceeding in small steps according to the following plan:
# Keep the scope of HADOOP-9922 limited to enabling a 32-bit build quickly with the existing build infrastructure.  Hopefully that will be a small change like Vinay's patch that can get into the 2.7.0 release quickly.  It sounds like HDFS-7774 might be a pre-requisite too, but that looks like an easy change for us to get in.
# Proceed with the CMake conversion tracked in HADOOP-11080.  The scope of this would be to retain existing supported build targets while doing the conversion, not to introduce new functionality.
# After completion of HADOOP-11080, parameterize the CMake build further to support the additional build targets (i.e. different Visual Studio versions).  If it turns out this step is trivial, then it could be consolidated with HADOOP-11080.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks again!, [~cnauroth], agree with your plan. As listed in first 2 points, getting successful 32-bit build can be the first target. , Uploading the rebased ( and git generated) patch, though I didnt face any problem in using old patch(using patch -p0).

I no longer use 32 bit windows 7 machine. So could not test the changes again. I have tried to verify in 64bit Win8 machine by setting 'Platform=Win32' it didnt work.

Please someone with 32bit machine can verify?, bq. We also now have LibHDFS building on Windows. That one uses CMake, but the build generator is hard-coded to "Visual Studio 10 Win64" in hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/pom.xml. I think we'll need to look for a way to parameterize that for a 32-bit build. Let me know your thoughts.
Thanks chris for the point. But I am afraid, I no longer use 32bit Windows machine. Currently I am using 64bit machine. So It would be difficult for me to verify. I didnot made any changes related to this in rebased patch.

This message is automatically generated., [~vinayrpet], can I take over this issue? Along with native.vcxproj, 32 bit build also needs to be added for winutils.vcxproj and libwinutils.vcxproj. I am preparing a patch to include all these. I can also verify on both 32-bit and 64-bit windows., bq. Vinayakumar B, can I take over this issue?
Sure. Assigning to you. Thanks [~kiranmr], A new patch is attached. It adds 32-bit builds for native.vcxproj, winutils.vcxproj and libwinutils.vcxproj

Both 32-bit and 64-bit builds have been verified using following:
1. 32bit: 
- Windows 7 using Win7.1 SDK 
- Windows 8.1 using VS 2013 Express

This message is automatically generated., [~cnauroth] check out this patch. This adds 32-bit builds only for VC++ projects in Hadoop-Common. I am planning to handle HDFS related things in HDFS-7774, [~kiranmr], thank you for sharing a patch.  This looks good.

When I built for 32-bit, there were 5 additional compilation warnings:

{code}
service.c(187): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [C:\hdc\hadoop-common-project\hadoop-common\src\main\winutils\winutils.vcxproj]
service.c(380): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [C:\hdc\hadoop-common-project\hadoop-common\src\main\winutils\winutils.vcxproj]
service.c(430): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [C:\hdc\hadoop-common-project\hadoop-common\src\main\winutils\winutils.vcxproj]
task.c(160): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [C:\hdc\hadoop-common-project\hadoop-common\src\main\winutils\winutils.vcxproj]
task.c(195): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [C:\hdc\hadoop-common-project\hadoop-common\src\main\winutils\winutils.vcxproj]
{code}

It looks like we have some code that was trying to compare an {{int}} to a {{size_t}}, and the difference in data type size on 32-bit triggers these warnings.  I suspect you can make this work on both 32-bit and 64-bit by switching the declaration of the relevant variables from {{int}} to {{size_t}}.

I think this patch will be ready to go once that is addressed., Thanks for the review [~cnauroth], I have attached a new patch addressing these warnings and few more.

For some variables, i have declared as {{unsigned int}} instead of {{size_t}}, as 64-bit build was complaining assigning {{size_t}} to {{ULONG}}

Following warnings in 32-bit build are resolved:
{code}
libwinutils.c(2887): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [winutils\libwinutils.vcxproj]
libwinutils.c(2899): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [winutils\libwinutils.vcxproj]

task.c(339): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [winutils\winutils.vcxproj]
{code}

Following warnings in 64-bit build are resolved:
{code}
service.c(282): warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch [winutils\winutils.vcxproj]
service.c(1117): warning C4020: 'AddNodeManagerAndUserACEsToObject' : too many actual parameters [winutils\winutils.vcxproj]

One warning is changed in 64-bit build:

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the new patch, Kiran.  Thank you also for the extra cleanup of some of the warnings.

I still see one new warning in the 64-bit compile:

{code}
task.c(312): warning C4133: 'function' : incompatible types - from 'unsigned int *' to 'size_t *' [C:\hdc\hadoop-common-project\hadoop-common\src\main\winutils\winutils.vcxproj]
{code}

Actually, it's not so much a new warning as a different kind of warning.  The existing code does have a warning on this line, but it's a different warning.  I'd like to suggest that we drop the change in {{AddNodeManagerAndUserACEsToObject}} for now to avoid this.

I don't want to expand the scope of this jira to a large-scale cleanup of warnings.  I just wanted to confirm that: 1) the changes do not introduce new warnings for the 64-bit build and 2) the 32-bit build has no additional problematic warnings.  I think once we drop the change in {{AddNodeManagerAndUserACEsToObject}}, we'll meet that goal, and I'll be +1.

We can file a separate jira for a complete cleanup.  (FYI [~rusanu], these warnings appear to be related to the YARN security code.), [~cnauroth], I have reverted the changes in {{AddNodeManagerAndUserACEsToObject}}. 64-bit build is now back to original warnings in method {{AddNodeManagerAndUserACEsToObject}}

, Hi Kiran , thanks for your answer , but i am still unable to get this working , i have hadoop 2.5.2 with me but some how the patch fails  , attaching the logs, i Know this post is not about patches but  i am really stuck to get this working .Think using win32 to work with hadoop is altogether a bad decision . , patch error.txt is attached., Patch was given for 2.7 version and trunk (3.0).
I see that you are using 2.5.2, can you upgrade to 2.7?
If you download 2.7, then this fix is already included.

If you cannot upgrade and want to continue with 2.5.2, then patch has to be rebased.
Are you interested in rebasing and submitting a patch for 2.5.x? 

, Yes Kiran , I am interested if i knew what has to be done, frankly played whole day with this on visual studio but reaching no where.I am new to hadoop and dont understand most concepts , got stuck at it at wrong time i guess ., I suggest you download and start with 2.7 version. Once you are able to compile and run on Win32 or Win64, then you can consider rebasing this patch to 2.5.2.

Refer this link for compilation steps
