This message is automatically generated., It just needs to be set to something.  Instead of a fabricated directory, why not use the java property {{user.home}} (or whatever it is)., I believe that the Shell class will need a valid directory in order to ensure that getcwd() succeeds. That's the reason why hadoop.home.dir needs to be set to a valid path.

it might not be a good idea to depend on java properties or environment variables. For example, using the environment variable HADOOP_HOME causes this bug. Similar issues might arise for properties like user.home -- I'm unfamiliar with the partsof JDK specifications that specify that user.home has to be a valid path (in fact it might not be, due to bugs in JDK: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2134338/java-user-home-is-being-set-to-userprofile-and-not-being-resolved).

Notice that simply setting it to "/" won't work either due to Windows compatibility.

I agree that setting to a temporary directory is imperfect, but compared to alternative approaches it seems this one is slightly more robust and more platform neutral., \\
