[Test results update to Description:
Issue does reproduce on a small (10 node) cluster, with consistent performance difference across release lines. Numbers from the 10 node cluster actually show a larger delta than the 350 node cluster's results (>10% regression), between 2.4.0 and 0.23.9, both in runtimes and throughput.]
