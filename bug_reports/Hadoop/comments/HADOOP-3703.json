This message is automatically generated., The script depends on an external HDFS which requires some stubbing to be able to write unit test cases. This is skipped for now.
The failure in contrib tests seems unrelated. The console output actually says contrib tests have run successfully., I just committed this to trunk. Thanks, Vinod, I committed this to the 0.18 branch., Verified that logcondense.py deletes datanod and tasktrackers in hadoop 0.18.0. it works with bothh -dynamic true/false, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
