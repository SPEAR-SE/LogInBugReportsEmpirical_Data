[Is this only a problem for S3 files that are written using other tools, or can you cause this problem by writing using NativeS3FileSystem? The discussion in HADOOP-3257 may be relevant here too. , I only noticed this with existing buckets written by other tools., closing as WONTFIX...s3n, s3a and openstack clients all assume that a "/" paths represent directory delimiters in paths, an assumption that goes pretty deep. Sorry, Closing old tickets that are already part of a release.]
