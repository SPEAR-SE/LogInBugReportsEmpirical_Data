This message is automatically generated., Seems reasonable. +1 assuming you tested this manually., Thanks for checking Todd.

Yes, I manually tested the Text command with these two types of files (one used a WritableComparable set, the other uses Writable sets), just to make sure the subclass checks don't break anything.

As WritableComparable subclasses Writable, this does not break anything, only relaxes the false requirement.
