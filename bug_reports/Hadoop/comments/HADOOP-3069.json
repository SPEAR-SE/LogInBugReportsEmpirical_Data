[Maybe we need this fix for 0.17?, I am splitting my patch attached to HADOOP-2585 into 2 parts because people want this bug fixed in 0.16 and 0.17 but don't want the import checkpoint feature in these versions.
The patch contains also the test which fails on the old version but does not fail on the new one.
, +1. Code change looks good. There are a few white-space-change-only lines in the patch though., I found one unjustified empty line. Removed it., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
