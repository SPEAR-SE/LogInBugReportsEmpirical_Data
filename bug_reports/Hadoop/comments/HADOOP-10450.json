[This patch updates the Windows build to include the zlib native code bindings if the {{ZLIB_HOME}} environment variable is defined, pointing at the location of the zlib headers.  I also made a small change in ZlibCompressor.c to provide more meaningful output from "hadoop.cmd checknative" on Windows.  We'll display the full path to the zlib1.dll., Looks good to me. +1.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks, [~wheat9].  We've confirmed that this patch works on Windows by running "hadoop.cmd checknative" and also running several MapReduce jobs that use zlib for compression., I committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5425 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5425/])
