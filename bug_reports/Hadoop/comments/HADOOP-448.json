[No, this works fine.

Before the task is run, the TaskRunner does a setWorkingDirectory to the working directory of the job. I always use relative path names in my map/reduce jobs and it works fine, even when a different user runs the servers., Okay, I guess the problem is that JobTracker does not call setWorkingDirectory() before invoking the InputFormat. (That is where I hit this problem.) If we did the initialization properly in DistributedFileSystem, we wouldn't have to worry about calling setWorkingDirectory(), I think this was resolved when we moved the split generation to the client.]
