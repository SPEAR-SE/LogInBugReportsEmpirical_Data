Did you try it?  My guess is that lots of unit tests would fail.  It significantly simplifies path manipulation if there is a single normal form for paths.  It is not generally possible to tell from a name alone whether something is a file or a directory, one must query the FileSystem to determine this.
, Doug: 
I didn't run tests with this, also we don't need it anymore with the new glob format spec. I agree that one must query the filesystem to determine the file type. The original issue in this case was to determine user's intention with a path from jobConf.getInputPaths()., Not needed anymore, marking Resolved. ]
