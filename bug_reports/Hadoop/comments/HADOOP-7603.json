[49 is not a safe gid on RHEL6.

Also, what happens when these uid/gids get used by something else?, What if these users already exist on the system?, bq. 49 is not a safe gid on RHEL6.

Base on Redhat 6 document, it should be available.  What group uses 49?

Reference:

http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/s1-users-groups-standard-groups.html

bq. What if these users already exist on the system?

The package checks for existence of the user before it creates the users.  If the users are already existed, the package will use the existing users.

, bq. What group uses 49?

wnn uses it:
