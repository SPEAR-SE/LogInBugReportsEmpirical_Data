[Attach a patch that will create symbolic links on Windows instead of copying files. Users need to add symbolic privilege to the account running Hadoop. If the user is in Administrators group, Hadoop need to be run in elevated mode., Attach a screenshot of Local Security Policy console (secpol.msc), where users can add symbolic links privilege to their accounts., Thanks Chuan for the patch. It's great to see symlink functionality on Windows.

A few minor comments:
1. FileUtil#symlink: Should we log a warning on {{ExitCodeException}} to be consistent with the previous behavior?
2. symlink.c: IMO, we should remove {{CreateJunctionPointW}} if it is not used in the codebase.
3. Would be good to add a few test cases for the symlink functionality., Attach a new patch.

>1. FileUtil#symlink: Should we log a warning on ExitCodeException to be consistent with the previous behavior?

Add the same warning message in the new patch.

>2. symlink.c: IMO, we should remove CreateJunctionPointW if it is not used in the codebase.

Removed.

>3. Would be good to add a few test cases for the symlink functionality.

This message is automatically generated., +1 looks good., The vcproj changes look like all lines have edits? Is it some line ending issue? Could you run this through dos2unix?, +1 for the patch. I do not see any DOS mode characters in the patch., I committed the patch. Thank you Chuan.]
