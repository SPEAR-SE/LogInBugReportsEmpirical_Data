[What was your partition size set to?, For the minicluster tests, I ran with:
  <property>
    <name>fs.swift.partsize</name>
    <value>1024</value>
  </property>

When I first discovered the problem, I had it set at 1GB:
  <property>
    <name>fs.swift.partsize</name>
    <value>1058816</value>
  </property>

Seems to happen any time the output size is greater than fs.swift.partsize., It appears that sometimes a path and sometimes a URI is getting passed into  SwiftPathObject.  The URI case was apparently unexpected.  This change allows URIs to be handled correctly., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good but it does need its tests, New patch adds a test to validate that a URI passed in as a Path is handled the same as a Path.  Also, verified the actual behavior using minicluster and it appears to correct the problem., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
