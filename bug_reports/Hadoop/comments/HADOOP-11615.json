Attached updated patch and updated {{ServiceLevelAuth.md}} file which is having all the changes..Since I was facing one issue ( Not able to see one chnage after patch generate,{{switch to `dfsadmin` and `mradmin` commands respectively.}} ) Hence I attached source file also after the change..Let me explore more here ..If you already faced same issue while generating the patch,let me know.. , Thanks [~brahmareddy] for the update. The updated patch looks good.
Reconsidering this, some properties have been removed or deprecated.
* {{security.inter.tracker.protocol.acl}} -> removed
* {{security.job.submission.protocol.acl}} -> {{security.job.client.protocol.acl}}
* {{security.task.umbilical.protocol.acl}} -> {{security.job.task.protocol.acl}}

Would you please update the patch to reflect these changes?
{code}
    <property>
         <name>security.job.submission.protocol.acl</name>
         <value>alice,bob mapreduce</value>
    </property>
{code}
The example should be fixed as well., Thanks AKIRA,Updated the patch.., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
