Also threw in a core-default.xml doc for the new property name as it was missing., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., 
I'd word "Configure the umask value to apply when creating new files using the FileSystem classes." instead as "The umask used when creating files and directories." since this applies to both files and directories and eg other APIs like FileContext or FsShell.

Otherwise looks great., The patch is simple enough, and the request too, so in order to let me get this into 0.23.3 I will just make the requested doc change and check it in.  +1 for the patch by the way., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2660 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2660/])
