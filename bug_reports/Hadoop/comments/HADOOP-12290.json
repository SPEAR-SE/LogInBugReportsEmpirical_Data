[This appears to be pilot error rather than a bug in Hadoop.  The wildcards are not quoted and therefore the shell is expanding them _before_ Hadoop even sees the wildcard.  You must be running on a Mac, which would explain why it's trying to lookup things like /Applications, /Library, /System, etc.  This needs to be something like:
{noformat}
hadoop fs -ls '/*'
{noformat}
to keep the shell from expanding it.

The same thing is occurring for the /t* case.

For the last case, the shell is not finding anything for /z* and therefore is passing it unexpanded to Hadoop, and Hadoop is expanding it to the various z* directories.  However I suspect all of those directories are empty, so it lists nothing as a result.

Closing as invalid.  Please reopen if there's a real issue here., Thanks [~jlowe] for the detailed information! That makes sense to me after I understand the shell expanding.

You are right, all the z* directories are empty.
