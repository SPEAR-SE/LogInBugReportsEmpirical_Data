[> Actually HDFS throws FileNotFoundException in this case (in FSDirectory.mkdirs() ). So I guess we should do the same.
Does throwing a FileAlreadyExistsException (a new class) make more sense in this case?, I second Nicholas' suggestion., Took Nikolas' suggestion. Created new class FileAlreadyExestsException.
Turns out mapred already has such class. 
After this patch is committed I will remove mapred's one and make it use this one (from common).
Also I will need to change HDFS to use this new exception instead of FileNotFound.
, Ran hadoop-common test, hadoop-hdfs and hadoop-mapreduce with new hadoop-common jar
Also created a new hadoop-mapreduce jars (with the new core jars) and ran hadoop-hdfs test with them., I believe the original code isn't defensive enough and there's a possibility for NPE to be thrown if {{Path f}} happens to be {{null}}. I'd add an extra check for this as the very first line of the method.

Looks good otherwise.

This will be tested by the test being introduced in HDFS-303, right?

Minor nit: we tend not to add serialVersionUID fields. (Any warnings in IDEs should be turned off.), removed serialVersionUID.
Added some unit test in any case for hadoop-common., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
