[Good catch!  It seems that closing in the finally-block using {{closeStream(..)}} is sufficient.  The following is not required.
{code}
       if(close) {
         out.close();
+        out = null;
         in.close();
+        in = null;
       }
{code}
, Thanks Nicholas for reviewing.

Closing the streams in the finally-block using closeStream(..) will suppress the exception if out.close()/in.close() throws and will not be thrown back to the caller. 

{code:xml} 

if(close) {
         out.close();
+        out = null;
         in.close();
+        in = null;
       }
{code} 

With the above lines if out.close() throws exception that will be thrown back to the caller and also other streams will be closed in finally-block using closeStream(..).

As per the discussions in the issue MAPREDUCE-2243, this way is followed.
