[I have not  checked if deletes are effect by this should be tested also.

I thank storing the data urldecoded would be the best solution so on every query we could just make sure the row key is urldecoded before running select/inserting/delete code., Believe this fixes the problem. Billy, can you test and let me know if this takes care of it?, Yes it fixed the problems.

I tested sending a urlencoded row key for insert/select/delete and all worked
