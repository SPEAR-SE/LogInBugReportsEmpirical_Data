[2633_20080116.patch: access NameNode by (local) method calls instead of RPC., - nn.namesystem.now() should be FSNamesystem.now()
- Methods should be separate by a blank line.
- there is to many methods called getBlockLocationsInternal(). It took me at least 20 minutes to understand who is calling whom. Traditionally the general idea of methods and their *Internal counterparts is to distinguish between the api methods and their synchronized parts. Synchronized part of the implementation is usually called *Internal. It is also supposed to be private.

I propose the following modifications here:
- getBlockLocationsInternal(String src,long,long) should be renamed to getBlockLocations(String src,long,long) because you need to call ii in NamenodeFsck.
- getBlockLocationsInternal(String clientMachine,String src,long,long)  should be removed and the sorting part of it should be placed directly into getBlockLocations(String clientMachine,String src,long,long).
- the private getBlockLocationInternal(INodeFile, ...) should be renamed to getBlockLocationsInternal(INodeFile, ...) with an 's' in the middle. This was probably my fault.

As a result you will have only one private synchronized getBlockLocationsInternal() and two getBlockLocations()., 2633_20080117.patch: incorporated all suggestions.  Thanks, Konstantin., 2633_20080117b.patch: updated with trunk, 2633_20080117c.patch: re-arranged some codes., +1, Does a test need to be written for this?  It's not clear how easy that would be., This change should be very low risk--fsck either works or it doesn't. There
was a lot more risk in the new code!

In this context, make sure you've taken a peek at
