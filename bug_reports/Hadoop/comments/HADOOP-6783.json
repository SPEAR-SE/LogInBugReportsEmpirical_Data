[While splitting the config may have made things easier for devs (maybe? is there any evidence that having xxx-xxx.xml did?), it would be MUCH easier from an ops and end user perspective if this was one big file again. Pushing around 3 files instead of 1 adds extra coordination and esp confusion for new users.  [I've lost track of how many times users tried to connect the hdfs client to the nn web ui port.]

If we want to retain the semi-autonomy, we could make stanzas for each project.

, If we are going to change the conf file name for core, then it will be nice if we rename it to hadoop-common-site.xml rather than common-site.xml. For all the projects using Hadoop, a file name starting with hadoop will make more sense. This is not that much important for mapred and hdfs, but having a file name core-site.xml reveals no clue about belonging to hadoop. , Meanwhile, four years later...

I suggest we do [~enis] suggestion in the 3.x trunk.  It's a great time to clean that up., I think in the last 8 years core-site.xml is too much embedded in the code. It's used more than 200 times and I am not sure about effects in the ecosystem. It's may not worth the effort and risk.]
