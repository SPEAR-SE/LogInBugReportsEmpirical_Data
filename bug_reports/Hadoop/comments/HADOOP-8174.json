[The confusion is because there are two separate perspectives:

# Whether a *path* is absolute (ie the reference is non-relative, starts with the root). Ie /foo is an absolute path.
# Whether a *URI* is absolute (ie [URI#isAbsolute|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/URI.html#isAbsolute()] where "A URI is absolute if, and only if, it has a scheme component"). Ie "/foo" is not absolute URI, but file:///foo is.

Because Hadoop Paths are represented by, and are just thin wrappers around, URIs (which is goofy!) there is some ambiguity. 

Given that the intent of Path#isAbsolute is #1 (the class-level javadoc states "A path string is absolute if it begins with a slash.") I think we should update the Path#isAbsolute javadoc to indicate this. It's also worth putting the above discussion in a class-level comment since it's not clear that we intend Path to be a file system path in most cases., isAbsolute() is a method on Path and so the method should not be attributed to URI, even if Path wraps URI, which is implementation detail.

Now I get what the problem is, there is a comment:
{format}
/** True if the path component of this URI is absolute. */
{format}

Hence the comment following it. I will fix the comment., @Suresh, looks good.  How about removing the comment "A path string is absolute if it begins with a slash" at the top of the file so we just have one place that defines what absolute means.

@Sanjay, unfortunately URI is not an implementation detail of Path, the Path constructor takes a java.net.URI object, has a toUri method that returns one that is used extensively. The code uses Paths and URIs interchangably so the URI semantics are leaked all over the Hadoop code base., Rebased Suresh's patch for trunk with Eli's second comment addressed., -1 overall.

This message was automatically generated., [~qwertymaniac] I took a look at the patch, and I think it's before our supporting Windows. Precisely, we can say "slash for Unix OS, back slack for Windows". What do you think?, bq. I think it's before our supporting Windows.
I think there is no problem here. because hadoop implementation uses '/' as Path.SEPARATOR. and its URI standard.
