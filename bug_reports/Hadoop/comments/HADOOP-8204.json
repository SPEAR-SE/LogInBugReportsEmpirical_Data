[Attached patch is on top of HADOOP-8193 and fixes the issue.

The problem was that you can't concurrently call mocks and set up mock behavior in Mockito. So the health monitor would occasionally call the mock proxy at the same time as the test case was changing the behavior of the mock proxy.

The fix is to pull some of the patch for HDFS-2185 into this one: HealthMonitor now monitors an HAServiceTarget, and the test implementation of HAServiceTarget has code to trigger different failure scenarios. The test now passes reliably for me., Rebased on trunk, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
