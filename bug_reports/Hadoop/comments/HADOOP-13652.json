[[~xiaochen], can you please take a look at this jira?, Thanks for creating this, [~axenol]. Agreed the connection issue should be tracked in a separate jira.

It looks to me the curator client is always created by {{ZKSignerSecretProvider}}, and the block that read the configs in {{ZKDelegationTokenSecretManager}} is not executed. i.e. {{CURATOR_TL.get() != null}} is always true.

Also seems [ZKSSP|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/4815d024c59cb029e2053d94c7aed33eb8053d3e/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-auth/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/security/authentication/util/ZKSignerSecretProvider.java#L360] and [ZKDTSM|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/4815d024c59cb029e2053d94c7aed33eb8053d3e/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/security/token/delegation/ZKDelegationTokenSecretManager.java#L205] creates the curator client using different default retry policies. [~asuresh], do you know more background on this? Is it intentional for some reason?
