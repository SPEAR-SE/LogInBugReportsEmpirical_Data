[Not sure we should keep using "ls -ld" because of HADOOP-2426., Thats right. Another issue is spaces in group or user names., Patch attached. Uses exit code from ShellCommandExecutor. '1' is the only expected exit code. Unusual errors like 'command not found' result in different exit codes (127 on my Linux box)., Updated patch : renamed {{ErrorException}} to {{ExitException}}., +1 Code looks good. But why does serialversionUid need to be defined, this class is not being serialized, is it?
, Thanks Dhruba. {{serialVersionUID}} is from {{java.io.Serializeable}} interface. If I don't define one, Ecplipse shows an annoying warning. It is strictly not required. , Ok, sounds good. thanks for the explanation., > serialVersionUID is from java.io.Serializeable interface. If I don't define one, Eclipse shows an annoying warning.

Sounds like a bug in Eclipse that shouldn't impact Hadoop.  Can you configure Eclipse around it?, Yes. This warning can be disabled in eclipse (search for "Serializable" in Preferences). Updated patch attached., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This will be simplified by HADOOP-2512, since will throw an exception that can return the exit code., simplified patch based on changes in HADOOP-2512. These two are tested together, so I am just marking this as part of HADOOP-2512.]
