[Patch attached. , +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12348477/Hadoop-864.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r493236., The File interface is problematic to use with the boolean return codes, however, the better way to structure the calls is with:

tmpDir.mkdirs();
if (!tmpDir.exists()) { ... }

since that way, if two threads/processes both try to create the directory they both succeed. , I edited the patch to call mkdirs and isDirectory in the right pattern., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
