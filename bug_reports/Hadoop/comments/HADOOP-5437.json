[Attaching the patch fixing the testcase.

The problem was: The configuration mapred.job.reuse.jvm.num.tasks wa set to -1, but never passed to cluster. Moreover, it should be job configuration, and not cluster configuration, since the configuration is a job-level configuration at tasktarcker.
With the patch I verified jvm reuse is on and each jvm runs multiple tasks., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Test failure TestJobHistory is not related to the patch., This test doesn't detect if jvm reuse is actually working., This patch:
  1. Removes the min split size from the sort run that was effectively forcing 6 maps (and therefore not allowing real jvm reuse).
  2. Removes the duplicated set up and tear down the hdfs and mapred cluster.
  3. Runs the sort in jvm reuse mode.
  4. Adds a new test that uses a static in the mapper to detect whether the jvms are actually reused or not. It tests the reuse flag set to -1 and 1., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
