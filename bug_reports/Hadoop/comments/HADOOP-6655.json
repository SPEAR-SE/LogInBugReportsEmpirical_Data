[Kos, the ACL proposed in HADOOP-4348 actually used a space character as the user-group list separator. The same AccessControlList is used for other features like queue administration and I know of code throughout MapReduce that hardcodes this same assumption for the lack of good API to deconstruct an ACL or modify an already constructed ACL.

Are you proposing we change the character separator to a semi-coloon? Any reason for this? Now?, I'm proposing to close this JIRA because I've misread the test in the config file. Nevermind.]
