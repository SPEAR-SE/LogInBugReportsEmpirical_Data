[Be aware that each receiver is using at least one thread.  So 8000 xceivers implies 8000 threads.

HADOOP-3856 is being visited by us over in HBase as a way to re-architect the Datanode so it doesn't require a thread per connection., I would vote to rather not change the default. The default value is set so that a person can download hadoop for the first time, install it on a relatively small size cluster and start some experiments. Setting the default to a high number potentially increases the memory requirements of the datanode., Tracked in HDFS-1861.]
