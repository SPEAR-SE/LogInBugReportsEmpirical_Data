[Hi Brian, Two small questions:
(a) Can you comment on how this relates to HADOOP-5579?
(b) I can't see "Cannot open file" in the current trunk of hdfs.c - do you know where this is coming from?, This patch causes HDFS to throw a FileNotFoundException in FSNamesystem instead of a generic IOException.

HADOOP-5579 fixes the parsing of the FileNotFoundException; with this patch, it should propagate the errno correctly., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks fine. A few improvements : 

JavaDoc for getBlockLocations could be modifed to make this a part of the contract.
Do we need any text for FNF excepton?

Instead of adding a new test, a test simple test case could be added to another test (e.g. TestDistributedFIleSystem.java). That way it comes almost for free (see test added in HADOOP-5191). Each new test adds on the order of 7-10 seconds, however simple it is.  
, Patch updated - made a note in the javadoc that getBlockLocation throws FNF.  Used TestDistributedFileSystem class instead of a new test class., +1.

Regd the contract, it needs to be added to ClientProtocol.getBlockLocations() and FNF is not the only exception. It is ok for now., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
