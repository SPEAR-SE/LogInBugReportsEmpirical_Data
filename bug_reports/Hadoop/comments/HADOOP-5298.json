Tested locally., +1 Makes sense.

It looks like HADOOP-4695 is addressing the same issue, but uses a different approach. Is the difference significant? The two tests are nearly identical and could probably share more code than they currently do., > It looks like HADOOP-4695 is addressing the same issue, but uses a different approach.

There is no difference in the logic.  I agree that two tests are similar.  The codes were duplicated in HADOOP-4284.  It needs more works to refactor the codes now.  Since these are only tests, I suggest we leave it and do the refactoring in the future., I committed this to 0.20 and above., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #778 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/778/])
