[HOD supports specification of an account name via the {{-A}} or {{--resource-manager.pbs-account}} option. To ease backwards compatibility of existing scripts, it is felt that it would be nice to support this through an environment variable as well., Attaching a patch that looks for PBS_ACCOUNT environment variable if the {{resource_manager.pbs-account}} is not defined., Updated patch file where I've updated documentation also., Running through Hudson. Doesn't have tests as the HOD tests are manually run. I've verified the patch applies cleanly to the Hadoop 0.18 branch, where this patch may be required, and also to the Hadoop 0.19 branch., Patch looks good to me., Submitting to Hudson again. It didn't run the first time., Since Hudson has taken a personal grudge to not accept this patch, here are the test patch results:

     [exec] -1 overall.

     [exec]     +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

     [exec]     -1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
     [exec]                         Please justify why no tests are needed for this patch.

     [exec]     +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

     [exec]     +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

     [exec]     +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs warnings.

     [exec]     +1 Eclipse classpath. The patch retains Eclipse classpath integrity.


The tests, as explained, are manually done for HOD., hod contrib was removed]
