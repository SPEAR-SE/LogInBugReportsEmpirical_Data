[I agree that we should put some sort of a lock file in the data directory, but I don't think we should move the existing pid file, since that is managed by the generic daemon start/stop code.  Rather we could use the nio file locking code to create an exclusive lock on a file.  This will automatically be unlocked by the kernel if/when the jvm exits.]
