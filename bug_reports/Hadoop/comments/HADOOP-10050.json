[We should include the changes proposed in YARN-1227 with this., [~sandyr]

Yup that was already part of the config clean up i was going to do :). Should we resolve it as a dup?, Attached are the configs i ended up using. If there are any other changes we  would like to make let me know and i can address them as well., Attached an initial patch. 

Also i would like to

hadoop-mapreduce-project/conf/mapred-site.xml.template -> hadoop-mapreduce-project/conf/mapred-site.xml

Not sure how a rename patch is generated. This is needed so that the file generated does not have to be renamed :)., Attaching the html files for the docs in case some one wants to take a look., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The capacity-scheduler configs are removed from SingleCluster.apt.vm - any reason for this?  
Generated SingleCluster.html has "Set $$YARN_CONF_DIR" - mind fixing this too?

{code}
Run ResourceManager and NodeManager as:

$ cd $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME
$ sbin/yarn-daemon.sh start resourcemanager
$ sbin/yarn-daemon.sh start nodemanager
$ sbin/mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh start historyserver
{code}

yarn-daemon.sh is not meant to be in HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME. 

If this doc needs to be fixed, there are probably a lot of confusing references to HADOOP_PREFIX vs HADOOP_YARN_HOME etc which probably need to be ironed out. It may be good to either address them in this jira or file a new one for a follow-up. , bq. The capacity-scheduler configs are removed from SingleCluster.apt.vm - any reason for this? 

I did not have to make any changes to be able to run an example.

We have yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.capacity=100 and yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.queues=default.

The following 2 are not there in the configs that are part of the release yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.capacity and yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.unfunded.capacity


 bq. Generated SingleCluster.html has "Set $$YARN_CONF_DIR" - mind fixing this too?

Will fix this.

bq. yarn-daemon.sh is not meant to be in HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME.

Actually when i ran the hadoop-2.2.0 tar ball i did not have to set any of these env vars everything was in ./sbin. I can make the change to to HADOOP_YARN_HOME and HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME.

I cannot find any reference for HADOOP_PREFIX on http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html , Addressed everything except for capacity scheduler changes. Let me know if we want to put those back.

Also found a minor issue on the last line of the page 

http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/PluggableShuffleAndPluggableSort.html

where the property should have been mapred_shufflex instead of mapred.shufflex so fixed that as well., I'm not sure that the yarn.resourcemanager.hostname port should be set to 0.0.0.0.  0.0.0.0 only makes sense as a port to bind to, and this config is also used by clients to connect to the resourcemanager., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Actually for my single node setup i used 0.0.0.0 for the property and it worked better. With it set to 0.0.0.0 the Application Master links for the running job worked where as when i set it to localhost those links did not work. If i changed the ip to localhost it would bring up the page.

So i think leaving to 0.0.0.0 might be better unless i am missing some configs.
, Anybody have any thoughts on what config i am missing that causes the running AM link to not work?, There are a lot of good changes in this patch, but with HADOOP-9902 committed, it's out of date.
