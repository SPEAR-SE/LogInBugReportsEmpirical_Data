[This is either a duplicate of HADOOP-11086 or a successor. Which *shipping* version of jets3t has this fix in?, The fix is not in any shipping version of jets3t yet.  Currently it can be found in 0.9.4 snapshot., well, it's not going in for a while then. renaming JIRA to be clearer about "latest".

I'm afraid you are going to have to build your own release if you want that specific fix. Alternatively, you can try the s3a:// filesystem, planned successor to s3n. This should be viewed as beta-quality in hadoop 2.6; for Hadoop 2.7 we think it's good to use, Thanks Steve., resolving as a duplicate.]
