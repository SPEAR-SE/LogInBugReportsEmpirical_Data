[A possible fix is to refresh "currentProxy" no matter if the failover is performed by the current thread or not. Since the process is protected by proxyProvider's lock, all the threads should be able to get the current value of currentProxy., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks reasonable. Did you have a chance to verify that it fixes the issue?, Not yet. Actually the issue cannot easily be reproduced since by default the client will retry/failover 10 times. I will decrease the retry number and rerun the test with/without the patch these days., +1 for the patch, once the failover tests pass., Looks like our failover tests run well with the patch during the weekend. I will commit the patch shortly., I've committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks for the review, [~kihwal] and [~sureshms]! And thanks [~arpitgupta] for reporting the issue., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5644 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5644/])
