[the mapreduce package is in whole a replacement to mapred package. By default, deprecated classes in mapred are replaced with the counterparts with the same name in the mapreduce package. , I didn't do enough to document the replacement classes, although in most cases they have the same name in the new package., This patch updates some documentation in the deprecated mapred packages.  Updated docs explain preferred use of newer mapreduce package., But I do not see any patches attached. Can you re-attach please?, I suppose at this point, this is just stale given the deprecration -> undeprecation that happened.]
