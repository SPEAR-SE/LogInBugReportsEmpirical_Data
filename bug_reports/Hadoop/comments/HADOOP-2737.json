[We only require the version to have a numeric major and minor version. The release / revision can be anything. So 0.15.1-H2422-H2460 and 0.15.3-H2085 should both work correctly. However, 'hadoop-full' would not. 

I feel it is reasonable to expect a numeric major and minor versions, as that is the way most version strings are built for any software, no ?, There is no spec for the Hadoop version string, other than that it is a string.  For HOD to impose a structure on that string seems unnecessary.  Both the patch process and our internal test frameworks use a version string that doesn't fit you desired spec.  I'm +1 to fix this issue., After a discussion with Nigel, Sameer and Mukund, it was decided that the Hudson testing process would be fixed to provide a version string with a major and minor release number. This is how the default Hadoop version comes up from trunk, and hence it is not too bad to expect it. Will close this bug as "Will Not Fix"., As described in earlier comment, closing this bug as "Won't fix".]
