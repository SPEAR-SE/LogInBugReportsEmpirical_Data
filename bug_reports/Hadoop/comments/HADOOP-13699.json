[Patch attached. This only attempts to catch the simple case of a variable resolving to itself. Support for detecting multiple variable loops is removed.

Solving this generally is like detecting a loop in a linked list. Since this is performance sensitive code, I think we'd rather not do that., Thanks for finding and fixing this Andrew. I'm +1 on the return-fast change, and looking at HADOOP-6871 it's fixing a bug that's not considered in the original implementation. Ideally we should let people from either jira comment, in case they feel differently.

And man HADOOP-6871 is 4+ years ago. I hope no one has been waiting for that for the past half-decade. :) Mind linking the jira (I didn't find a {{replaces}} option, maybe {{supercedes}}?) and comment there, so this is change is more advertised?, Committed to trunk, thanks for reviewing Xiao!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10579 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10579/])
