This message was automatically generated., Thank Brahma for reporting the issue. 
Comment on the patch, returning null will lead NPE in the subsequent caller methods. I think this require investigagation why path is null while deleting the logs path? I had seen this error while running Yarn cluster when NM is restarted whlie applications are running. But did not get sufficient time to look deeper into this issue., Thank you for taking this issue. 

Path can be null when baseDirs is not null and subDir is null. 
{code}
  @Override
  public void deleteAsUser(String user, Path subDir, Path... baseDirs)
      throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    if (baseDirs == null || baseDirs.length == 0) {
      LOG.info("Deleting absolute path : " + subDir);
      ...
      return;
    }
{code}

According to javadoc of FileContext, FileContext.delete() should throw InvalidPathException if path, f, is invalid. We can use Preconditions.checkNotNull for the validation. This change of behaviour can break backward compatibility, though it should be fixed., Thanks for taking a look into this issue.. But {{Preconditions.checkNotNull}} will also throw NPE right when refence is null ( here subdir path will be null)..?

{code}
 public static <T> T checkNotNull(T reference) {
    if (reference == null) {
      throw new NullPointerException();
    }
    return reference;
  }
{code}, [~brahmareddy] Good catch. It's correct to call Preconditions.checkState() for the assertion here., Sorry, s/checkState/checkArgument/, Updated the patch..[~ozawa] kindly review.., \\

This message was automatically generated., can we file seperate jira for following checkstyle or can we ignore?

{noformat}
./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileContext.java:1: File length is 2,570 lines (max allowed is 2,000).
{noformat}, Now checkstyle and white space reports sounds good to me ( very clear)..Nice work [~aw]!!, [~brahmareddy] Thank you for updating. I checked the caller of fixRelativePart, then I found that we cannot call Preconditions.checkArgument directory in fixRelativePart since caller can throw different exceptions at callers' side. 

Could you check the all callers' javadoc and check null at the caller's side?, Sure, I will update.., Please also update the message like "Path is invalid" or "Path is null" based on javadoc., [~ozawa] IIUC,we can fix by two ways
1) Just remove the following lines and add one log message..
{code}
LOG.info("Deleting absolute path : " + subDir);
      if (!lfs.delete(subDir, true)) {
        //Maybe retry
        LOG.warn("delete returned false for path: [" + subDir + "]");
      }
{code} 
2) Or add null check to subdir like following before following log..
LOG.info("Deleting absolute path : " + subDir);
Path del = subDir == null ? baseDir : new Path(baseDir, subDir);

what do you think..?, Shouldn't we try to find out why directory is null ? Is it some problem or expected behavior ? If it is expected behavior, then probably we should not try deleting this subdirectory at all., As others have mentioned here, we should figure out why the directory is null and fix the root cause in Yarn. Can we use YARN-3793 to do that? Please feel free to take it up. 

That said, it would be nice to make the exception easier to decipher and document it at every place FileContext#fixRelativePart is used. And, I believe checkNotNull is more appropriate than checkArgument. , [~kasha] As we got the root cause for NPE ( same mentioned in YARN-3793)..Attached the patch to  checkNotNull in FileContext.java # fixRelativePart(Path p)...[~kasha@cloudera.com] and [~ozawa] kindly review.., \\

This message was automatically generated., +1. Checking this in. , By the way, I checked none of the direct callers check for NPE and their javadocs don't necessarily mention throwing an NPE if the path is null either. There is a possibility of some indirect caller catching NPE in case the path is null, but I would think that is pretty bleak. , Thanks for looking into this, [~brahma]. Just committed this to trunk and branch-2. , SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8135 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8135/])

I also come across the issue and if there is workaround to fix it without apply patch ? Thanks in advance !]
