, This is due to hbase is using the deprecated constructor. HBASE-10336 is tracking the issue., Yes, HBase uses the deprecate constructor. It should work if it is not removed., My concern is that it might not solve the HBase problem completely. Recently {{HttpServer}} has gone through major surgeries for HTTPS support. For obvious reason the deprecated code path is not very well tested.

I have spent reasonable amount of time to test the current code paths of the {{HttpServer}} in NN / DN / JN / SNN in various configuration. In my opinion the approach that HBASE-10336 takes might be a safer bet., I think we can do both for now. Otherwise, existing older versions of HBase will have problem to work with HDFS 2.4+., Based on the discussion on HBASE-10336, it is likely not to go in on any released or soon to be released version of HBase. The next release is likely a few months out. , Thanks for applying this patch.  We are working to undo our dependency but cannot take the hit just yet; the undo will go into our trunk in a day or so with a release to follow soon after (a few months at most as per [~apurtell] above).  Thanks., Created HADOOP-10253 to track the effort of removing deprecated methods in {{HttpServer}}. Let's coordinate our effort in that jira., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #461 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/461/])
