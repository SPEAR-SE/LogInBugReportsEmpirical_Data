[I feel that a patch to http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-698 should also fix this problem., Duplicated in HADOOP-855, Attached a patch which allows us to continue reading after getting a checksum error by modifying Checker.read to catch ChecksumExceptions thrown by verifySum.  

In Checker.read, if we get a ChecksumException, we seek to a new datanode for both the data stream and the checksum stream (when using dfs, this is a no op for other fs).  If at least one of the datanodes is different from before, we'll retry the read.  

In DFSInputStream, added a new seek method which also requests a datanode other than the current node.

 , +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12349420/hadoop-731-7.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r499156., I just committed this.  Thanks, Wendy!]
