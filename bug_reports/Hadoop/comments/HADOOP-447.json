Is there a way reproduce this?

Is the fix simply replacing 

       public long getBlockSize(Path f) throws IOException { 
          return dfs.getBlockSize(f); 
       } 

with

      public long getBlockSize(Path f) throws IOException { 
        return dfs.getBlockSize( makeAbsolute(f) ); 
      } 

in DistributedFileSystem.java ?
thanks., patch for the fix mentioned above. Looks like using makeAbsolute(f) in place of 'f' fixes it.
, I just committed this.  Thanks, Raghu.]
