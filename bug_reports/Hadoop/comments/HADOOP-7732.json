The link embedded in the above text(same as the link in the desc) leads to a 404., Please review proposed patch., Note the link to the MapRed package is also bad, and fixed in this patch., Since HDFS is accessed by users through FileSystem (in Common), we haven't published javadoc for it in the past since its not a part of the public API. There is an option to generate HDFS javadoc that developers can use locally., Hi Tom, the link my patch fixes has been present in this file, in essentially the same form, since Doug's original commit clear back in Feb 2006., Hi Matt, there's some more background at MAPREDUCE-559, which removed the public facing HDFS javadoc and added the "javadoc-dev" ant target for developers. In trunk the HDFS classes are marked @Private, so they would not show up in javadoc anyway, since we use the ExcludePrivateAnnotationsStandardDoclet when generating it.

I wonder if the link just needs to be to the HDFS documentation? E.g. http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/hdfs_user_guide.html., Moved to 1.2.0 upon release of 1.1.0., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2.]
