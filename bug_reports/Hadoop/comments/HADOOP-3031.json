We should fix both warnings in this patch. We can strip EmptyInputFormat of even more information, rather than refining it to fit with SequenceFile's constraints, which seems to match the spirit of the test. It's not possible to fix the last warning in TestReduceTask, because WritableComparators are not generic types (i.e. WritableComparator.get(Class<T> c) does not return a WritableComparator<T> that can satisfy the RawComparator<KEY> formal in the ValuesIterator cstr), so we can only suppress the warning.
