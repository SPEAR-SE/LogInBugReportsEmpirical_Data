[Here is a patch for review - 
It makes sure that reduce task, sends a heartbeat/progress when none of copy tasks finishes with in "mapred.task.timeout". It replaces the unconditional wait with a conditional wait with a timeout of (mapred.task.timeout)/2. (we could make it 3/4th of this timeout as well)., Instead of adding a new timer to the ReduceTaskRunner, I think it would be far easier to have the PingTimer just call reportProgress when the progress() method is called.

To get access to the TaskTracker and Task, PingTimer would be a non-static inner class instead of static., updated patch, makes PingTimer non-static and sends a progress report in pingTimer.progress(). 

progress update time could be too frequent ( 1 sec ), it should be probably changed to a higher value in another patch. , This looks good, try it out and see if it helps., I just committed this.  Thanks, Sanjay!]
