[attaching a diff for TestAppend2::testSimpleAppend that demonstrates the issue with a simple assertTrue(stm.getPos() > 0);

, Dhruba, can we do something to avoid returning FileStatus as an array of size one.
You just need the number of block out of it right?, Yes, we should avoid returning an array of size 1. That part was mostly a hack to determine if this was this works.

We need to the size of the file returned to the caller., applied the patch and ran libhdfs and fuse-dfs unit tests and all passed!!

This message is automatically generated., Hi Konstantin, it would be nice if you could review this one. Thanks., can some hdfs contributor pl review this one?, How about make initialFileSize final and then getInitialLen() don't need to be synchronized?, Work on Nicholas's review comments., Removed the "synchronized" on getInitialLength() because the initialFileSize is initialized in the constructor itself. (I am not finding i very elegant to make it final because it is set inside one constructor invokes the other constructor), > I am not finding i very elegant to make it final because it is set inside one constructor invokes the other constructor

yeah, you need to change all constructors to make it work.  I am fine with the current code.

This message is automatically generated., I would like this to go into 0.19 branch. , any update on this? looks ready to commit to 20 and 19.1.  I think as dhruba said it really is a blocker since it is a bad bug when opening a file in append mode.

thanks, pete
, I just committed this.  Thanks, Dhruba!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #680 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/680/])
