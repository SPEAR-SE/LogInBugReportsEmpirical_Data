[This patch does the following.

1. It refactored a bunch of connection-related params from being global (stay the same for new connections) to become per-connection params and their values are obtained from the conf used when calling RPC.getProxy(). This allows new connections to be set up based on the conf used for that connection, which is more intuitive.

2. In particular, the server's Kerberos principal is now obtained from the per connection conf.

3. The conf cached globally in Client is not removed since it provides a cache for Classes that ObjectWritable.NullInstance relies on to figure out the declaredClass. It seems to provide a useful function and the cache can be shared among connections. No per-connection params are obtained from this global conf., Patch review:
* Methods added for only unit testing should be marked as Private and Unstable
* Move Client::getConnectionId to getConnectionID itself.  With these changes ConnectionID may be large enough to warrant its own class rather than being nested in Client.
* The custom hash method in ConnectionID seems a bit odd.  Would the default provided by Eclipse be more workable? (as well as Eclipse-provided equals to guarantee hash/equals equivalency?)
* Provide messages for asserts in unit tests, Canceling patch post-review., new patch addressing Jakob's comments. My equals() and hashcode() implementations are the same as Eclipse-provided defaults. I see Eclipse's hashcode() method is easier to read. So I coupled it with my own equals()., -1 overall.
