[Fixes the reversal of directory and child file

As a result, deletion is proper, There is also one more issue

Two instances of directories /tmp are found now. One in root directory and other in current directory(where application is run)

As a result it is looking at the wrong folder to delete (different /tmp). WIll try to fix this problem if more users confirm that delete is not happening

, Are you sure you are running the latest hadoop? There was an issue, which resulted in such behaviour on Cygwin, but it's been fixed in rev. 389633., I just fixed this.]
