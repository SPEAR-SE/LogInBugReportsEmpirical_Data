[{{: Class org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3native.NativeS3FileSystem not found}}.

means your classpath lacks hadoop-aws and/or jets3t jar. Not a hadoop bug, something with your configuration of hive.

closing as invalid. Sorry.

FFI, see: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/InvalidJiraIssues, in hadoop classpath both jars are placed already, and this issue hittibg me past 10 days, that Class org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3native.NativeS3FileSystem is in hadoop-aws.jar but it gives me same error.
, Thanks for suggestion
