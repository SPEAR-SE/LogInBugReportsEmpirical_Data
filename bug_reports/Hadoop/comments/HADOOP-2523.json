[This test passes on my local XP. We can actually remove the assest. What is happening is that on windows nightly build, System.getProperty("user.name") returns "SYSTEM" where as the process is actually owned by "hadoopqa" (ie, hadoopqa is the owner of the file created by this test). I don't know the source of this difference.

This assert does not really test any ch* commands. So can be removed., This patch removes the assert., I just commited this.  Thanks Raghu!]
