This message was automatically generated., Note: The attached patch is based on {{branch2-7}}. I think the patch is failing because it is trying to apply the patch against {{trunk}}., Looks good to me. +1 pending Jenkins. Renamed the patch to run Jenkins on branch-2., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thank you [~ajisakaa] for the reviews and the help in getting Jenkins report., +1, the patch needs no test because it is to remove duplicate dependency., Cancelling my +1. You need to remove duplicating declaration instead of setting the right version. Would you remove the following code?
{code}
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.curator</groupId>
        <artifactId>curator-framework</artifactId>
        <version>2.6.0</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.curator</groupId>
        <artifactId>curator-test</artifactId>
        <version>2.6.0</version>
      </dependency>
{code}, Sorry for the back and forth., Thanks again [~ajisakaa] for the detailed review, I didn't notice the duplicate declaration. Attached another patch modifying the same., \\
