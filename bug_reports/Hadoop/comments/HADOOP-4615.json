[Duplicate of HADOOP-4079., Hemanth, I am looking at this issue from the {{JobTracker}}'s point of view. This is what is done today
- add job to {{JobTrackers's}} _jobs_ structure
- invoke {{jobAdded()}} for all the listeners

The problem is that the jobtracker informs the listener after adding the job to its _jobs_ structure. If one of the {{jobAdded()}} calls fails (invalid queue etc), we should remove the job from the jobtracker and invoke {{jobRemoved()}} for each listener. , Sorry, I got the issue ID wrong. The right issue that is duplicated is HADOOP-4239.]
