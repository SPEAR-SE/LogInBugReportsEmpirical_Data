[The scope of this issue is to upgrade Hadoop Common's ZooKeeper version after resolution of that bug and get the failing tests to run and pass consistently on Windows.  This bug causes sporadic failures in the following tests on Windows: {{TestActiveStandbyElectorRealZK}}, {{TestFailoverController}}, {{TestZKFailoverController}}, {{TestZKFailoverControllerStress}}.
, Is this specific to Windows? {{TestZKFailoverControllerStress}} seems to fail intermittently for me too, The underlying ZooKeeper bug is not really a Windows-specific problem.  I was only able to repro on Windows, but it's theoretically possible on any platform.

I see that ZooKeeper 3.4.6 has been released, which included the ZOOKEEPER-1702 fix.  That means we can proceed with upgrading the dependency here in Hadoop.  I'll take a look at that.

There are no new tests, but the new version of ZooKeeper, including the ZOOKEEPER-1702 patch, gets our existing ZK-related tests passing consistently on Windows., +1, thanks for the followup fix Chris!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5674 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5674/])
