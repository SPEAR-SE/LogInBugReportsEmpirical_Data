[Returning 0 (success) if true is the correct behavior. This is the same behavior as the Linux test command. Resolving., Why does another tutorial list Returns 1 if true?

-test -[ezd] path	Returns 1 if path exists; has zero length; or is a directory, or 0 otherwise.

https://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module2.html#commandref, I'm pretty sure the Yahoo tutorial made a mistake and meant it the other way around. Can anyone else confirm just to be sure?, The convention is also to use 1 for true and 0 for false., Yeah, in typical code 1 == true and 0 == false, but the Hadoop commands follow the unix exit code conventions, where 0 means the command was successful and non-zero means otherwise.

In this scenario, when we run {{hadoop fs -test -e}} on a file that exists, then the exit code is 0, meaning that the existence test ran successfully., Thanks Stephen. Should have posted bug on Yahoo forum.
