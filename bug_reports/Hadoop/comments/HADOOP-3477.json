This occurs because those files are included twice in build.xml, because there is no explicit exclude on those dirs, like there is for the others.  The attached patch(1-line) adds such an exclude.

This is keeping me from using the downloaded tarball as the orig.tar.gz for a debian package., I just committed this.  Thanks, Adam!, Could you apply the fix to 0.16 as well(creating 0.16.5)?  Nutch isn't using 0.17 yet., I guess this is a regression, since it was introduced in 0.16.0 by HADOOP-2494.  Unless there are objections, I will merge it into the 0.16 and 0.17 branches.
