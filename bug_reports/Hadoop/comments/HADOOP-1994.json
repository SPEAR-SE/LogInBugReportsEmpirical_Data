[One simple and effective solution is to prefix generated variable names with a special string which users are unlikely to use. I've made changes (which show up in the patch for HADOOP-1883), where we prefix variables with "__rio__". As long as DDL users do not define field names that begin with "__rio__" (which is unlikely), our code's fine. This string can easily be changed if required (it's a const setting)., That should be "rio" (for Record I/O) with one underscore before and one underscore after. , This is a good idea, but I'd vote for something very simple as the prefix. Namely "_". We should also enforce that user fields do not start with the prefix., I think a prefix more complicated than an underscore is better. The prefix is used in generated code, which presumably the user will never want to go through if everything works well. So readability of code is not a big issue. Why, then, restrict the user to not using fields starting with an underscore? It seems like too harsh a restriction. It's much better to tell them to not have fields starting with <underscore>rio<underscore> than just an underscore. 

Regarding enforcing, I think that's a good idea. We can have the DDL complier do that. , Record IO has been deprecated with the advent of Avro.
