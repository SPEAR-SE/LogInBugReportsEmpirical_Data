[Was this JobTracker started today (6/23/09) ? If so, then it's also showing the wrong day...

, This seems to be present in 19.1 as well. Calls to jobClient.getStartTime() return the wrong time. 

In my output below jstar is the jobStartTime of a job started,
{noformat}
start 1259167798839
jstar 1259169013376
endtm 1259168098839
{noformat}

Has this been cleaned up as part of another Jira? , Probably stale.]
