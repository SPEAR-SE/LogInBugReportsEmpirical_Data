[did you install the protobuf compiler?, i think maven should install this for me.should i install this separate?, yes, you have to install it yourself: sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler -y, thank you for your reply ,my problem has been resolved.

, @ccin, how did you resolve this error? I am getting same error message. I see that protobuf is installed and 'protoc --version' gives 'libprotoc 2.6.1'. Some how error message shows 2.6.0 as version. I also have the path set to protobuf/bin directory.

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-maven-plugins:2.6.0:protoc (compile-protoc) on project hadoop-common: org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException: 'protoc --version' did not return a version -> [Help 1], [~v_ganeshraju]  hi, we only support protobuf 2.5.0 to compile. , @Ganesh Raju,did you resole this error? I am getting the same error., I resovled my problem,it was caused by the 64-bit-windows and the version of jdk(1.8) is too high for hadoop.I replaced the jdk_1.8 with jdk_1.7ï¼Œthen copy thebinary file protoc.exe to C:\Windows\SysWOW64,rebuild it ,then it worked!thanks.]
