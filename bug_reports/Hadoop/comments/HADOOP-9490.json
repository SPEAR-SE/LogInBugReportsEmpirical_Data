This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch.  I applied it in combination with HADOOP-9413 and verified successful test runs on Mac and Windows.

Minor question: instead of {{LocalFileSystem}}, do you think the close should happen inside {{ChecksumFileSystem#ChecksumFSInputChecker#seekToNewSource}} right before the call to {{reportChecksumFailure}}, since this is the class that initially opened the checksum file and owns it?  Either way, I am +1.
, I think calling {{close()}} in {{LocalFileSystem}} seems fine to me. +1 for the patch., I committed the patch to trunk.
