[This might be due to the query line:
"project in (YARN) and fixVersion in ('"+"' , '".join(versions)+"') and resolution = Fixed", 'startAt':at+1, 'maxResults':count}

For some reason it starts at: at+1.  If I remove the +1 then YARN-354 shows up. , Fix by simply removing the +1 from at+1.  Now it gets entries 0 up to max 100, then 100, up to max 200, etc.

I tested by generating the notes for 0.23.6 which is < 100 and then I generated them for 0.23.3 which has 266 jira.  I compared it to manually doing the query through jira., I ran it and verified that it is not dropping jira.  Sorry about my off by 1 error glad that you caught it.  +1.  feel free to check it in., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
