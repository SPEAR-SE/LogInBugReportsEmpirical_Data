[Added in a very simple test to -1 patches that break eclipse:eclipse generation., Apart from a typo ("checkEclpiseGeneration") this looks good. What testing did you do?, Thanks for finding that.

I ran test patch on a small patch that did nothing and verified that it failed (Because HDFS-2649 was not in yet)  I then ran it on HDFS-2649 and verified that it passed.  I am uploading a fixed patch now., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12507038/HADOOP-7912.txt
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 3 new or modified tests.

    -1 patch.  The patch command could not apply the patch.
