[Attaching patch with the fix.

Please review and provide your comments., mapred.tasktracker.tasks.sleeptime-before-sigkill  is currently a job configuration which I think was not the original intention. This should be picked up from TT's local conf and needs to be done as part of this patch., Being fixed as part of HADOOP-5488 because of a possible clash of patches. Closing this as duplicate.]
