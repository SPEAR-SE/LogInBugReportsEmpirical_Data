This message is automatically generated., I think TRUNK has the same issue. , I'm confused - what's throwing the CME? It's a static method and it doesn't touch any class variables..., See HADOOP-7831 for the actual exception., Per Kihwal's comment, the exception occurs when two unsynchronized callers attempt to use the {{Subject}} from the current context., Should we also be reporting this as a JDK bug? Seems like it should be up to the JDK to synchronize this., It does seem like a JDK issue, do you have a stack trace for the CME?, Good question.  The {{Subject} class appears to generally be thread-safe.  It's internally synchronizing and using instances such as {{Collections.synchronizedSet}}.  The problem is due to iterators becoming very grumpy when their collection is modified, and {{Subject}} is full of collections that can be accessed directly.  I can't find any documentation about whether {{Subject}} is even supposed to be thread-safe.  I suspect it is once you lock it down as read-only, but we don't do that., Stack trace is in the bug Kihwal mentioned: HADOOP-7831 , I think we should commit it. +1, Marking this fixed in 1.0.0 (0.20.205.1), because this patch will prevent the problem from recurring.

If further disposition is required (such as opening bug against JDK), please do so.

Should this be merged to trunk?, Yes, please merge this to trunk as well., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
