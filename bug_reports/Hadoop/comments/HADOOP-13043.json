[Patch attached. I did {{find . -name "*.js"}} to find all the bundled JS files. Went through all of them and added their licenses to LICENSE.txt.

The only odd ones out was json-bignum.js which is in the public domain. I take it that means it doesn't have any license requirements.

Some entries might need to be deleted for branches going backwards, I only looked at it for trunk., I found some "js.gz" files in yarn-common that I missed in the first iteration, and found we have a copy of the d3 license checked in so used a pointer. Also caught some CSS files., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, +1, Pushed to all the branches, thanks Steve. I made appropriate edits based on the contents of each branch., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #9649 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/9649/])
HADOOP-13043. Add LICENSE.txt entries for bundled javascript (wang: rev 08b7efa95202b6d6ada143cab9369fac4ebb4c49)
* LICENSE.txt
, [~andrew.wang], this never made it to branch-2.7 or branch-2.7.3, even though it is in branch-2.6.

The merge conflicts seem a little involved, can you please help address them for the 2.7.3 release? Tx., Seems like I forgot to "git push" just branch-2.7 when I committed this. Sorry.

On looking further, it looks like Akira's later backport of HADOOP-12893 to branch-2.7 fixed this up. It looks like this was also carried forward to branch-2.7.3.

Should I make a dummy commit so grepping "git log" works?, [~andrew.wang] For what it is worth, I ran into this "missing commit message" while grepping "git log" for 2.6.5. It was fairly easy to figure out what was going on based on your above comment. That being said, it was the only commit that showed up in branch-2.6 and not in branch-2.7 for the time range I compared (since 1/26/2016)., Closing the JIRA as part of 2.7.3 release.]
