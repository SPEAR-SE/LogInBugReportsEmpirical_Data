[What was the expected behaviour? A usage() statement?, I guess this has been fixed by MAPREDUCE-2765.  If args are null, OptionsParser.usage() method would be called in DistCp.java., I'll close this issue., closing this JIRA.
I've checked with Daisuke this issue is already fixed in MAPREDUCE-2765.
Thanks for checking!, I just tried this and confirmed it still fails with the latest build. In the future please try to reproduce the issue before you close it.

hadoop-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT $ ./bin/hadoop distcp
12/07/23 19:21:48 ERROR tools.DistCp: Invalid arguments: 
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Target path not specified
	at org.apache.hadoop.tools.OptionsParser.parse(OptionsParser.java:86)
	at org.apache.hadoop.tools.DistCp.run(DistCp.java:102)

	at org.apache.hadoop.tools.DistCp.main(DistCp.java:368)
, I reproduced it as well.  A usage() statement is printed in addition to the error - is the change to be made just removing the "Invalid arguments: Target path not specified" printed to System.err?  Or the ERROR log statement as well?, It should just print the usage. Eg in the following I'd remove the ERROR log, the  IllegalArgumentException backtrace and the "Invalid arguments" log.
