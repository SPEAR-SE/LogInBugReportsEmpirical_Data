[I would like to add more functionality including copying local files to remote cluster etc.
, Ambud, can you describe what the intent of this contrib is? Also can you describe what the problem is with more details?, Sure,
Error: 
I usually get a JsonMappingException and the location doesn't open. A lot of other users have faced similar issues with the eclipse plugin. The plugin works perfectly fine for pseudo distributed mode but has issues with remote clusters (including virtual machine).

Further contribution:
It would be really nice to have eclipse bundled with a file browser for HDFS (local and remote) as well as capabilities to retrieving and transmitting files between localhost and the remote cluster. This will be of great help for map/reduce testing without touching remote shell (especially to run M/R on a small data set for quick prototyping)
After this it would be really nice to eclipse plugin be able to access HDFS with proxy as well as kerberos authentication.

Intent:
I am thinking of this as a Google Summer of Code 2012 project (I am an undergrad)
