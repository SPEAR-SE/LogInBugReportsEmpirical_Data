[Patch posted. It's two APIs: Ranges and NullOutputStream. NullOutputStream is replaced by hadoop's own IOUtils.NullOutputStream. Ranges is replaced by Apache Commons' LongRange.

For easier diff, see https://github.com/sjlee/hadoop/commit/636a2b534d6125bb92267f144d873792d4583b23, I have not verified that it allows running with a newer Guava, but the code changes certainly look reasonable.  +1, pending jenkins

I use "git patch viewer" for Chrome, which makes all JIRA patches appear with context.  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/git-patch-viewer/hkoggakcdopbgnaeeidcmopfekipkleg, Thanks [~cmccabe]. It is certainly true that the code will build cleanly with guava 16+. Running correctly with newer guava is of course predicated on the assumption that the compatible parts of guava behave in the same way, which I haven't verified., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

, I ran the hadoop unit tests against guava 16.0.1, and found that TestDFSClientCache.testEviction fails. I believe it is because the test relies on a particular behavior of guava 11.0.2 (more aggressive eviction of LocalCache) which is no longer the case in 16.0.1. I'll file a separate JIRA to fix up the test.]
