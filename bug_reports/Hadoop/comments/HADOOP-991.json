[It's a feature not a bug.

Since file's replication factor is already set to the requested level (=3), it simply ignores the command. 
It has nothing to do with the replication factor of the first block.  I misunderstood the code.


For files containing under-replicated block (< 3) ,  I need to  

dfs -setrep 4 file

and then set it back 

dfs -setrep 3 file  ]
