[This is a fun one. Not easy to find & fix, as in "not easy to even decide what is a good solution here, given some codepaths may expect an exception to be raised from that finally clause in the case of some failures*

# Spark plays games with closures to have a finally clause which catches & logs exceptions raised in finally
# We could adopt try-with-resources for releasing resources more thoroughly, but I'm not sure what happens when something throws an exception in close() there.
