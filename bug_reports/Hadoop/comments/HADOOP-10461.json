[Any initial thoughts on this?  I can move forward on a patch , as I already have some code for this., 
The following 

TestLocalFsFCStatistics
TestLocalFSFileContextCreateMkdir
TestLocalFSFileContextMainOperations
TestSymlinkLocalFS
TestSymlinkLocalFSFileContext
TestSymlinkLocalFSFileSystem

All can be merged into a single "TestRawLocalHCFS" suite, from my vantage point., Doesn't the contract-driven tests in HADOOP-9361 do a lot of this?, might be.

Main thrust is consolidating  FSContract/mainOps/symlink into one test a into one controller class which any hcfs can copy and use with their fs plugin.

I better look and confirm were not overlapping ..., [~stevel@apache.org] I don't see you wrapping all tests into a single HCFS Suite like im attempting in this JIRA... https://gist.github.com/jayunit100/10014317

BUT... Maybe we should wait until AFTER your implementation of HADOOP-9361 ?, ping [~stevel@apache.org] .... Now that HADOOP-9361 is finalized, do you see value in this single point of entry for HCFS tests?, Shall I close this ?  Doesnt seem like much interest in it.  
We have docs for how to extend existing tests here https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HCFS/., closing this as a wontfix; there's no much interest and the abstract tests seem to work well now]
