[Based on the commit log, I created v2.5.0 tag and created tar.gz file for the community: https://github.com/oza/protobuf/releases/tag/v2.5.0

One idea is to change BUILDING.txt to point the link as a temporal solution. Do you have any idea?, Great news: Protobuf community has created a tag for 2.5.0! https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/251#issuecomment-85767877
