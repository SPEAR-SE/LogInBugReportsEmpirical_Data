{noformat}, Looks like HADOOP-14230 should help in this case. I am trying to repro this issue and add an appropriate fix around it which should help other test cases as well., Thanks [~vishwajeet.dusane].  Hope this is just a test code reliability issue, not the dreaded backend inconsistency. It'd nice to improve the test code without masking backend inconsistency., Saw HADOOP-14435 "TestAdlFileSystemContractLive#testMkdirsWithUmask assertion failed" on branch-2 and trunk. I suspect FileSystemContract test base might have been modified and caused the regression.

Saw both issues on CDH5.12 which is loosely based on 2.8. We could have backported some FileSystemContract test base changes to CDH.

[~vishwajeet.dusane] Let me get back to you., HADOOP-14435 turned out to to be caused by the "Other" entry in default permissions of my ADL store. In this case, the store was newly created., Sorry for the false alarm. This issue is fixed by HADOOP-14230., [~jzhuge] - No worries. Thanks for the update. However i do see some pattern where test directory is not cleared up. I believe, similar fix as HADOOP-14230 might be needed. Will create separate JIRA for the change., That will be great, [~vishwajeet.dusane]!, Removed the fix version. Fix version is set when source code is actually changed.]
