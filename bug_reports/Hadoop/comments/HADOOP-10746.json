[The attached patch ignores the small block of code to see if the writer is closed similar to how the test is dealt with for Windows., Is this ppc64 Linux?

The patch looks fine to me. Just a suggestion, there is OS type detection in Shell.Java. e.g. see {{Shell.getOSType}}. Perhaps you can extend that to include your target platform and add a static helper similar to {{Shell.WINDOWS}}. Not the ideal location to have this logic and there was a proposal to abstract out platform-specific checks into a separate module but for now we can at least keep them in one location., Thanks for the prompt review. Yes, this is for PPC64 Linux.

 I have modified the patch per you suggestion. However, rather than introduce a method that is as extentsive as the getOSType method, I simply added the detection for PPC64 since there is no need for detecting other architectures yet. Please let me know if a more extensive method is necessary., Thanks [~jwang302].
