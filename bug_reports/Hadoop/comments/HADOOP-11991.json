This message was automatically generated., Nice catch. Could you update the patch to re-execute test-patch.sh if any files in test-patch.d (e.g. checkstyle.sh) is changed?, [~ajisakaa] thank you for the comment. The current script is re-exec'ed if any files under test-patch.d are changed, because pattern "dev-support/test-patch" matches dev-support/test-patch.d/*.
I think the description of this function is inaccurate. It says "If this patches actually patches test-patch.sh, then ...", but not only test-patch.sh, test-patch.d and smart-apply-patch.sh are also included. So I'll fix it., -02:

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~sekikn] for the clarification and updating the patch. Mostly looks good to me.

-## @description  If this patches actually patches test-patch.sh, then
+## @description  If this patches actually patches test-patch.sh, smart-apply-patch.sh or the files under test-patch.d, then
 ## @description  run with the patched version for the test.
{code}
Minor nit: Would you render the line within 80 characters?, Also it should be "if this actually patches".  Also, as more stuff gets added to the test-patch bits (like the docker stuff), this description is going to be continually out of date...  So something more generic would be better for the long haul., [~ajisakaa] [~aw] thank you for your comments!
