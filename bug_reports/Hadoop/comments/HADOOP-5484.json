[I was not able to reproduce the issue. Here is what is happening :
{code}
dir = "test-recovery-manager"
test-case1
cleanup dir
run 2 jobs with output as dir/output1 and dir/output2
testcase1-end
test-case2
cleanup dir
run 3 jobs with output as dir/output1, dir/output2 and dir/output3
testcase2-end
{code}
Here the second testcase is still seeing output1 from testcase1. Spoke to Jothi and he says its some nfs issue.
Anyways attaching a patch that should solve the issue. The patch uses unique output folders across tests. I dont think any tests are required for this., Amar, thanks for your prompt fix. 

+1, With the patch TestRecoveryManager succeeded on my linux machine., I just committed this. Thanks, Amar!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #789 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/789/])
    . TestRecoveryManager fails wtih FileAlreadyExistsException. Contributed by Amar Kamat.
