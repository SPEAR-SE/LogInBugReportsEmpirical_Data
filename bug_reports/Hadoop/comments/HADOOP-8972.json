This message is automatically generated., Just noticed that this change is incompatible with HADOOP-8874. Specifically, the following code from TestWinUtils.java:
{code}
    File winutilsFile = new File(Shell.WINUTILS + ".exe");
    File aExe = new File(TEST_DIR, "a.exe");
    Shell.execCommand("cmd", "/c", "copy", winutilsFile.getCanonicalPath(),
      aExe.getCanonicalPath());
{code}
will have to be updated to the following (notice that there are no ".exe" anymore):
{code}
    File winutilsFile = new File(Shell.WINUTILS);
    File aExe = new File(TEST_DIR, "a.exe");
    Shell.execCommand("cmd", "/c", "copy", winutilsFile.getCanonicalPath(),
      aExe.getCanonicalPath());
{code}, +1 Change looks good. , +1 for the patch.
