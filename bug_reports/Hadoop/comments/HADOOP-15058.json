[Here's a patch which adds an option to mvn deploy rather than just install. I had to rejigger the order of the steps taken since the doc build requires -DskipShade due to the jdiff/xerces dependency.

Now:

* Do maven default lifecycle build, with optional deploy
* Stage bin/src tarballs
* Do mvn site build
* Stage site and fixup the bin tarball to have the docs

I checked that running --asfrelease deploys things to Nexus, and that the staged shaded jars there are not empty like before.

Checked that the binary tarball has the docs, and did basic validation with HDFS., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
