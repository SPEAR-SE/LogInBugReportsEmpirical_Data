HADOOP-6420 was completed with MAPREDUCE-1126 as a use case, but it's an independent feature. Does it need to be backed out? Also, HADOOP-6438 was closed as invalid, not committed, so fortunately there's nothing to be backed out, there., The patch I submitted backs out HADOOP-6420 - should I regenerate leaving it in? , bq. The patch I submitted backs out HADOOP-6420 - should I regenerate leaving it in?

Reverting it isn't part of this issue, but I'm +0 on retaining it. Is there another use case, other than the patch in MAPREDUCE-1126?, Here's a new patch which doesn't revert HADOOP-6420 (we can always revert if separately, if need be)., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., > HADOOP-6420 was completed with MAPREDUCE-1126 as a use case, but it's an independent feature. Does it need to be backed out?

If it has no other use cases, it should be backed out, no?  If someone comes up with a use case, we can add it back, but, since it was added with MAPREDUCE-1126 as its only use case, and MAPREDUCE-1126 has stalled, I'd vote to back it out., I should have been clearer: I'd vote to remove HADOOP-6420 as a part of this issue, since it's only current use case is to work with the serialization APIs that are being reverted in this issue., OK, I can remove HADOOP-6420 here. I'll commit this soon unless there are any objections., I've just committed this (https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12442620/HADOOP-6698.patch)., -1 overall.
