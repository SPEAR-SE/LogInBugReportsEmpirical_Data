[What are the fields for which we are getting this error? As an alternative to turning off the warnings, some of these variables that cannot be serialized need to be changed to transient variable., for example:
Class org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.dfsnodelist_jsp defines non-transient non-serializable instance field _jspx_resourceInjector
Class org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.dfsnodelist_jsp defines non-transient non-serializable instance field jspHelper

We could make jspHelper transient (not sure if it makes sense though), but I don't think you can do anything about _jspx_resourceInjector (it is created when converting from jsp to _jsp.java.]
