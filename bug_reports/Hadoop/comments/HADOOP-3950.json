[Both tests failed on Hudson in many recent builds., After TestMapRed failed, a directory "mapred.loadtest" was created in current directory.  We should use "test.build.data" for testing but not the current directory., HADOOP-3946 has a fix for the TestMapRed failure., After updated with the patch in HADOOP-3946, TestMapRed is passed in Windows and Linux but TestMiniMRDFSSort is still failed in Windows., See HADOOP-3960 for test traces in Hudson builds., TestMapRed passes after HADOOP-3946, but TestMiniMRDFSSort fails for me. 
I tracked down the issue, which seems to be due to the call to {{JobClient.getClusterStatus().getTaskTrackers()}} returns 0, which in turn causes the RandomWriter to run with 0 maps. 

I suspect the tasktracker has not finished its first heathbeat, so a call to getTaskTrackers() returns 0. I will look into it. , Attaching a patch, which fixes MiniMRCluster to wait for all the TaskTrackers to be recognized by JobTracker at initialization.
 , This works for me. Trying Hudson, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
