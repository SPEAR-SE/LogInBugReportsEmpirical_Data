[Good catch.  Marking this a blocker for 0.16.0.  Please search the rest of the code for references to the old URL., I changed the webapps jsp files to reflect the change in web page.
And I also changed the forrest documentation to reflect the same.  Modified the copyright constructor to generate for 2008.
The skin files in forrest documentaion are changed to incorporate the new 'Core' logo. I attached core-logo.jpg seperately, as we cannot put it in the patch., core-logo.jpg should be added to src/docs/src/documentation/resources/images/core-logo.jpg
ant docs would fail without that in the path. 
In my local system, I ran ant docs and ant tests. All the tests passed., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This issue is not that simple:  I searched the trunk for "lucene" and found a lot of old links in html, pdf, txt, java and jsp files.  Some of them are in contrib.  Of course, some of them are indeed correct (e.g. links to lucene).

Attached two files:
search_trunk.txt: search "lucene" in trunk
search_after2727.txt: search "lucene" after applied 2727.patch

Is it possible to use a variable to store the base link?  It should be easy for jsp and java but not sure for the other files., There a couple of minor fixes to this patch..., Doug has added a redirect, which should be visible in a couple of hours. I'm pushing this patch to 0.17., Ah, I just realised that the above patch doesn't fix stuff in contrib/hbase etc. 

I propose we fix this in 0.17.0 since http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop redirects (or should redirect) to http://hadoop.apache.org/core... thoughts?

Oh, and we need a proper _logo_! *smile*, Minor fixes to Amarsri's patch..., The forrest parts of this should be addressed in HADOOP-2734.  This issue should only concern the webapps., Could we use gif for the logo instead of jpg?  gif is better than jpg for small graphics with <=256 colors since it uses lossless compression., png is even better than gif., Improving the logo should be addressed in a separate issue., Let's create a method that generates a footer for the jsps and have all of them call it. That way we don't need to change the jsps for this kind of change in the future.

I am not wild about the "Core" logo. Can we take the Hadoop elephant and put "Hadoop core" below it or something?, This patch fixes lucene references in hbase also. 
The references in *.pdf, *.html files will not there, once ant docs is run., bq. The references in *.pdf, *.html files will not there, once ant docs is run.

This message is automatically generated., Wouldn't it be better to just change ServletUtil.HTML_TAIL to fix the link, and get the year with Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR), and use this String in all the jsp files? Even better would be to introduce a method htmlFooter() rather than using field HTML_TAIL. , I agree with Enis, lets fix it right since this is slated for 0.17.0 anyway..., Thanks Enis for the quick review. here is the patch with suggested change., -1 overall.
