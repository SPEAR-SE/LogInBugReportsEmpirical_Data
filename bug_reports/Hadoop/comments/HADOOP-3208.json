[Patch changes {{WritableSerialization}} and {{WritableDeserializer}} to extend {{Configured}}, so that the configuration is passed. , +1

The patch introduces some lines that are over 80 characters long., The patch looks good to me.  Can you please add a test case?

Should this be a blocker?  It could break Configurable Writable implementations that depend on a non-null configuration., This version fixes line wrapping, and introduces  a test case.  

I forgot to mark this issue a blocker but I think it clearly is. , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
