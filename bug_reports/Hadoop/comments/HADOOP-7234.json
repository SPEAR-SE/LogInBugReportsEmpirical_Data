[HADOOP-7235 will preserve the existing "bad" behavior, and this bug will fix it, Hi Daryn,

I took a look at this now, and it seems like if we remove away the {{expandArgument}} it will simply work?

However, am unsure about use of tail with multiple arguments, of how the behavior must be or if must even support such a thing. Especially with the {{-f}} opt., # the max args needs to be relaxed for {{CommandFormat}}
# yes, the {{expandArgument}} override needs to be removed
# multiple args sans -f should print the file name before each tail snippet
# multiple args with -f should probably loop over each file doing the aforementioned multi-arg support, but we could probably punt on this and only support -f on one arg initially.]
