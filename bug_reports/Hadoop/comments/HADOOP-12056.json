This message was automatically generated., Hi, [~zxu] Nice find.

This patch looks good in general. It'd be nice to address a few small comments, mostly regarding the unit tests.

* The test name should be {{testCheckDirsOnFile()}}.
*  Can you create the test file under test dirs, which can be obtained from {{PathUtils#getTestDir()}}:
{code}
 File localDir = File.createTempFile("test", "tmp");
{code}
* I have a question in the following code:
{code}
File spyLocalDir = spy(localDir);
doReturn(null).when(spyLocalDir).listFiles();
{code}

Why not pass a file directly? Would the case, which the input is a file, be handled by {{checkDir(dir)}} directly? I think you can pass a regular file to see what happens.

* We can use {{GenericTestUtils#assertExceptionContains}} to verify the {{DiskErrorException}} is correct. 

+1 non-binding once these are addressed. Thanks again for working on this., Hi [~eddyxu], thanks for the review.
It looks like PathUtils is located at HDFS project, which is not accessible by TestDiskChecker.
So instead of using PathUtils, I use directory "target/TestDiskChecker" {{new Path("target", TestDiskChecker.class.getSimpleName())}}
bq. Why not pass a file directly?
I tried, but it is failed with "Not a directory" exception at {{DiskChecker#checkDirAccess}}
{code}
    if (!dir.isDirectory()) {
      throw new DiskErrorException("Not a directory: "
                                   + dir.toString());
    }
{code}
I uploaded a new patch HADOOP-12056.001.patch which addressed all the other comments. Please review it., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi, [~zxu] Thanks for updating the patch.

bq. I tried, but it is failed with "Not a directory" exception at DiskChecker#checkDirAccess

What would be the real problem to fix in this patch? Is the {{Null}} due to the input is a file or an IO error?

If the later is the case, would it be OK to use {{DirectoryStream}} instead of {{listFiles()}}, as it can report {{IOException}}. Also we should test against this case.
, Discuss with [~eddyxu] offline, DirectoryStream need java.nio.file.Files support, which may have compatibility issue at other platforms.
We agreed to add a log for this IO error and rename testCheckDirs to testCheckDirsFailedWhenListDirs. thanks [~eddyxu] for the thorough review. I uploaded a new patch HADOOP-12056.002.patch which addressed these issues. Please review it., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hmm, what's the potential issue with using DirectoryStream? I see we already use it in IOUtils, and it seems to have a Windows implementation., Hi [~andrew.wang], that is good information, I thought no one use DirectoryStream in hadoop code base yet. Yes, IOUtils used it already. I will use {{DirectoryStream}} to fix this issue, which will give more detail message from the IOException as [~eddyxu] suggested in previous comment., Hi [~andrew.wang], I attached a new patch HADOOP-12056.003.patch, which use {{DirectoryStream}} instead of {{listFiles}}. Please review it. Many thanks., \\
