[Three comments
1) You can delete the {{throw IOException}} statement instead of commenting it out.
2) Because of spaces there is a diff generated (line 29 and 32 of the patch). I think we can avoid that. 
3) Plz document the change made in {{GenericOptionsParser.java}} in the javadoc. Btw {{getRemainingArgs()}} is a public api and there is a change is what it returns. Should there be a concern?
Rest looks good., Oh, I see. Thanks.
BTW, do we need to test them?, I think we should test all the code paths that directly/indirectly depend on {{getRemainingArgs()}}., >> Should there be a concern?

{code}, When GnuParser options parsing failed, commandLine doesn't defined., Submitting., You should remove the throw rather than comment it out as Amar already suggested.

Hiding the IOException (ie. logging at debug level) from the user is wrong. They need some indication of what went wrong., Thanks for your review, owen.
I changed the JobClient help to FsShell help style.

[root@udanax hadoop]# bin/hadoop job
Usage: JobClient <command> <args>
        [-submit <job-file>]
        [-status <job-id>]
        [-kill <job-id>]
        [-events <job-id> <from-event-#> <#-of-events>]

        [-list [all]]
        [-kill-task <task-id>]

Generic options supported are
-conf <configuration file>     specify an application configuration file
-D <property=value>            use value for given property
-fs <local|namenode:port>      specify a namenod
-jt <local|jobtracker:port>    specify a job tracker

The general command line syntax is
bin/hadoop command [genericOptions] [commandOptions]

This message is automatically generated., Does anyone care to give a review&commit?, This looks good, but getRemainingArgs probably shouldn't return null, but rather an empty array. Applications checking argv.length in their own run() method will throw a NPE instead of their expected behavior., Thanks.
