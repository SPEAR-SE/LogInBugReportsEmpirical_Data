[dfs.data.dir too.
care is required when making a change to maintain backwards compatibility with current configuratins, humm, so how do we specify a list of paths?

sounds like a conversation about quoting conventions is needed, For the record, we used to permit comma- or space- delimited lists.  Spaces were removed for better operation under Windows, where spaces are common in directory names.

We could fix this by quoting, or with nested xml tags.  But I would give this a very low priority.  (Has anyone actually complained because they need to specify a path with a comma?  Do we expect anyone will anytime soon?  If they did, would the workaround be difficult or non-obvious?), I vote that we close this as wont-fix., > I vote that we close this as wont-fix.
