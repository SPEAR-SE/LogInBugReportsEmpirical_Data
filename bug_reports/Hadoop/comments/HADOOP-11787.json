[Hello, [~kiranmr].  Are you interested in taking this as a follow-up?, I am continuing discussion on [~cmccabe] comment 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11638?focusedCommentId=14364215&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14364215

bq. I looked at this and found that {{pthread_threadid_np}} on Mac has the type signature: {{int pthread_threadid_np(pthread_t thread, __uint64_t *thread_id)}} This doesn't match with using an {{unsigned long}}. I'm not sure under what conditions an unsigned long is different than a {{uint64_t}} on Mac (on Linux, that would be the case with 32-bit compilation). So this patch may have a buffer overflow in that case.

I agree there may be a buffer overflow in case of 32-bit compilation on Mac. I went ahead with patch since 64-bit build was mostly used. I will submit a patch soon to use {{uint64_t}} and cast it to {{unsigned long}} , Thanks, [~kiranmr]., Chris, need your help to verify this patch on Mac OS X, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
