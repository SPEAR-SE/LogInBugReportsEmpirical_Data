[The whole business of "use system utilities to collect statistics, and then parse the output" never sat well with me. It's going to be a pain to maintain, going forward, since it's not easy to test on N different versions of utilities. Perhaps worse, there are cases where the text parses fine, but the meaning has shifted.  I've seen this with regards cumulative-versus-instantaneous measurements from iostat and such.  

There's a library, Sigar [http://www.hyperic.com/products/sigar.html] that does this correctly.  Unfortunately, it's GPLed.  Is there an Apache-friendly equivalent that we could use instead?, Fixed regular expression for matching top output., ganglia metrics library and dstat were suggested for this purpose.  However, there are other type of problems, like precision lost in float in ganglia metrics library.  dstat is also GPLed.  Replacing system metrics measurements with a third party tool should be another bug on it's own., We recently added a FLOSS License Exception (borrowed from mysql-connector-java-5.1.6/EXCEPTIONS-CONNECTOR-J) to sigar, see:
http://svn.hyperic.org/trunk/EXCEPTIONS?revision=3884&root=Hyperic+SIGAR&view=markup

The intent is to make the license Apache-friendly so sigar can be used in projects such as Hadoop., I forgot to say, before.  This patch is certainly helpful, even if it doesn't embody the ideal approach, going forward.

+1, The shell script calling should also be different:

In Redhat 5.1:
sar -q -r -n ALL
iostat -x -k 55 2

In Redhat 4.5:
sar -q -r -n FULL 55
iostat -x 55 2, Wait for a update to systemDataLoader.sh., New patch which includes lsb-release detection., Added lsb-release detection., I committed this. Thanks, Eric, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #756 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/756/])
