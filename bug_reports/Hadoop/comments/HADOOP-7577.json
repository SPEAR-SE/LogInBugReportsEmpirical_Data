host:         at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:188), On trunk the new location is o.a.h.log.metrics.EventCounter, while on 0.22 the location is still the old-old o.a.h.metrics.jvm, Does not apply to trunk as a similar file already exists there. The file on trunk is also a wrapper, but points users to the new location used after move to metrics2., +1 Looks good. Could you please link the respective jira that applied the change to security branch and / or trunk., I just committed this. Thank you Joep., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-22-branch #72 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-22-branch/72/])
