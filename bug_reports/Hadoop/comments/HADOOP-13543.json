[FWIW I'm working on a wrapper for Java ACC that provides more user-friendly API reports than JDiff. My WIP patch should already be usable., Forgot to mention, JIRA is at YETUS-445., bq. FWIW I'm working on a wrapper for Java ACC that provides more user-friendly API reports than JDiff. My WIP patch should already be usable.
Sure, once we have something ready there, we can compare and contrast the reports.

This JIRA's focus is on fixing the unnecessary incompatible changes that jdiff already recognized and fix them so as to unblock 2.8.0 and 3.0.0-alpha1., Looks like we've lost steam on this issue. I generated a Java ACC report as part of the 3.0.0-alpha1 release, and I know at least I looked through Hadoop and HDFS, and Ray through YARN and MR.

In light of this, do we want to keep pushing on this JDiff work? I don't see it as a 3.0.0-beta1 blocker at least, since I can keep generating the JACC reports., Been a month since my last comment. Seems like we can close this as dupe to the ACC work. Please reopen if you disagree.]
