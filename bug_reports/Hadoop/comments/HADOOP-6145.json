I'm running off the same build as I believe you are.  I'll need more information to track this down further., Moved to Common as bug was tracked to FsShell, which is in Common., Attaching patch for v20, Attaching patch for trunk.
Problem was the trash method was throwing FileNotFound, which was not being handled.  There are three different places where the non-existence of the file being deleted could conceivably be handled.  Fixed by just checking for the file's existence at the beginning and exiting if not found.

No unit test because the affected unit test is TestHDFSCLI, which is in HDFS project.  Manually tested and it works.  The reason this wasn't detected previously is that it only manifests itself when the trash feature is enabled, which apparently it isn't on the minidfscluster that powers TestCLI.  We should probably looking at running Test*CLI with both trash on and trash off., submitting patch.  Hudson should pick up the correct one., also, the trunk patch has a quick fix to bring the rm documentation in line with what was committed in HADOOP-6139., -1 overall.
