[The root cause of this issue is:

There're two different kinds of {{kill}} in popular Linux distributions, one comes from bash, which a bash built in. Another one comes from system, located at /bin/kill.

When running {{which kill}}, it shows /bin/kill, but if running {{type -a kill}}, it tells you the truth:

{code}
user@workernode1:~$ type -a kill
kill is a shell builtin
kill is /bin/kill
{code}

After HADOOP-12317, kill command becomes:
bq. kill -0 -- -<pid>

Bash built-in kill cmd can support syntax like this, but /bin/kill doesn't support it. By some reason, Hadoop Shell pickes up /bin/kill instead of bash built-in kill.

Steps to reproduce this issue (Ubuntu 12.04)
1) Run {{nohup sleep 1000 &}}
2) Run {{ps -ef | grep sleep}}
{code}
hrt_qa@workernode1:~$ ps -ef | grep sleep
hrt_qa   46531 44212  0 23:29 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
{code}
3) Run {{kill (or bin/kill) -0 -- -44212}}, kill and /bin/kill has different behavior.

Tested Ubuntu 14, it doesn't have this issue., Thoughts, [~adhoot], [~steve_l]., Some proposals of this issue: 
Proposal#1. Use "bash \-c" to execute the kill command so it will pick the bash built-in kill? The problem is, do we have other Linux distribution doesn't have bash support? Since we uses bash in ContainerLaunch, it shouldn't be a big problem. Another problem we may need to double check is: Some bash-kill could also violate the "--" POSIX recommendation like bin/kill

Proposal#2. Choose different kill args depends on different version of OS/kill.

Proposal#3. Run check command similar to what we did for "setsid" (for example: "kill -0 \-\- -1"). Choose different kill args depends on exit code.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,, Uploading an initial patch for review:
- Use {{bash -c "kill ..."} instead of {{kill ... }}
- Check if OS supports bash in NM, if a Unix-based system doesn't support bash, it will fail when trying to launch containers (ContainerLaunch.java uses bash for Unix systems).
- Check if {{--}} supported in bash built-in kill, I've tested at centos 6/7, ubuntu 12/14, debian 6/7, it works fine, just add this in case.
, Can you comment on how "echo 1000 | kill -0 -- -1" is supposed to work? There are no timing issues possible? May be even leave a code comment.

W.r.t the YARN changes for bash, we should crash the NM instead of failing every single container., \\
