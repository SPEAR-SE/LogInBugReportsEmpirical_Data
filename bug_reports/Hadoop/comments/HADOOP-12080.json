[Seems to me that the assumption that Globber is making (for any file that exists, the parent path should also exist) is reasonable, so I don't think Globber needs to change (though it could do better to protect against the NPE).  I believe swiftfs should behave consistently with what Globber is expecting and either:
a) don't return any child objects at all if the parent doesn't exist (i.e. baz is not a child of /foo/bar if /foo/bar doesn't exist); or
b) allow "implicit" directories and return information for /foo/bar so long as one or more objects exist with a prefix of /foo/bar/
