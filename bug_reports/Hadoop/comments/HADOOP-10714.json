[the patch looks good to me.
The simple test that we have run to reproduce the problem is to create more than 1000 files and then rename the folder., * can this just be merged into a new HADOOP-10400 patch ... as that isn't checked in yet it should just be updated
* scale tests are good -for the swift stuff we have some scalable ones which you can tune off the test config file. This lets you run smaller tests over slower links. File size can be kept low for better performance.

Tests for a large set of files should
# verify that the results of a directory listing is complete
# try a rename() (as this has a delete inside)
# do the delete(), This patch contains the following changes:
- Added scale test for s3a
- Modified {{rename()}} to make it behavior closer to s3n and other FileSystem
    1. Fails if both src and dst are the same directory, 
    2. Return true and no-op if both src and dst are the same file
    3. Allows if src is file and dst is directory
    4. Fails if dst is a child of the source directory
- Modified some base contract tests due to S3's limitation.
- Increased surefire plugin's forkedProcessTimeoutInSeconds to 30 minutes because the rename thousands of files in S3 takes time.

I ran all S3A unit tests against S3 and they passed., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, The patch looks pretty good to me. Charlie's nits don't seem unreasonable. I'll add one comment of my own, but it's really not a big deal:
{code}
+        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
+          LOG.debug(
+              "cannot rename a directory to a subdirectory of self");
+        }
{code}
The reason that we have "{{LOG.isDebugEnabled}}" in the code at all is to prevent the overhead of string concatenation when the message doesn't have just a string constant. In this case there's no string concatenation at all, so you can just go ahead and do the "{{LOG.debug}}"

I'll be +1 once all these little nits are addressed.

Thanks, Juan., BTW Juan, I apologize for my terse comments above. I had written them up in an editor buffer and then in a rush I just cut and pasted them into the comment frame without putting a greeting or any preamble in there.

In general, it looks like the patch does what it is supposed to do so nice work on this.

I also realized that my 2nd to last comment about the if (!renameSupported()) got badly formatted. The idea I was trying to convey is that there should be braces around the return; for those two if's.

Thanks Juan.

, Thanks [~clamb] and [~atm] for code reviewing. new patch to address all comments. Where can I find a guideline for code formatting?

The reason we need the rename test is because s3 doesn't support rename. we have to copy src to dest on s3 then delete src to mimic rename operation. 
because of the copy step, {{rename()}} on s3 could take long time if the source folder contains lots of files.

The Hadoop Coding Standards are here: https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/CodeReviewChecklist

As mentioned at the top of that file, it's basically the Sun Java Coding standards with an indentation of 2, not 4. But to be clear (I learned this lesson the hard way), it's 2 for new lines and 4 for continuations of lines). BTW (sorry, I can't help myself), the LOG.debug line that ATM mentioned probably does not need to be broken after the '('.

h3. new tests in general

If there's extra basic things to test. e.g. {{TestS3AFileSystemBasicOps}}, there's no reason why they can't be pulled up to the core.



h3. scale

{{testOpenCreate()}} relies on the tester having good upload bandwidth. It needs to be configurable or optional. We already do some of this for seek() testing, with {{ContractOptions}} having an option {{TEST_RANDOM_SEEK_COUNT}} for test performance. (that one because the cost of seeking is so high on remote object stores over HTTPS). Ideally I'd like to see some abstract filesystem scalability contract test which could then be implemented by S3a and others (file & hdfs at the very least) so that its a definition of what big files should do. 


Looking at the openstack tests, {{SwiftScaleTestBase}} is a basis for scaled FS tests, with one specific test, {{TestWriteManySmallFiles}} looking at the cost of creating and deleting lots of files. If we had something like that in the abstract tests, we'd have caught the problem you've seen : scale problems with many thousands of small files. 


h3. test helpers

You should look at {{ContractTestUtils}} for test helpers, replacing thing like {{assertTrue(fs.exists(path("/tests3a/c/a/")));}} with {{ContractTestUtils.assertPathExists()}}, which will produce a meaningful exception and a listing of the parent dir on a failure. You could even put {{testReceivedData}} in there too, once renamed to something like {{verifyReceivedData}}. There's already methods there that can do exactly what you've rewritten, though they won't work to multi-GB files as they save to byte arrays first. Your new verification code can be the start of some more scalability tests.

Same for the other methods —but fix {{createAndReadFileTest}} to always close its streams.

h3. rename()

Finally, the actual source code change: rename changes. The correct behaviour of {{FileSystem.rename()}} is something I'm not confident I understand, and I'm not confident that others do either. More precisely: Posix rename is fundamentally misunderstood and {{DFS.rename()}} diverges from it anyway.

If rename() problems weren't picked up in the previous tests, it means that not only does S3A need the tests you've added, {{AbstractContractRenameTest}} needs more tests too.


h2. Summary

Looking at my comments, My key point is that you've done some really good scale tests here, as well as tests to validate S3A behaviour. The scale tests can at some point be applied to others, so maybe design it that way from the outset. Add under S3A /test a test case based on the abstract contract class tree something with the scale tests

{code}
TestS3aContractScale extends AbstractFSContractTestBase {

    // scale tests, using/extending ContractTestUtils

}
{code}

that way there's no need for you to add new tests to all the other filesystems here, and spend the time getting them to work. For now we'll just trust HDFS to handle files >5GB and more than 1000 entries in a directory.

The rename tests are a different matter. If there's something up with S3a.rename(), and it wasn't found, then the root tests are lacking. Please add them to {{AbstractContractRenameTest}} and see what breaks. If it is HDFS, then the new tests are wrong. If they work on HDFS but fail on other things (swift:// s3n://) then that's something we need to know about.
, Thanks Charles and Steve. 
here is a new patch to address all [~stevel@apache.org]'s comments except the "abstract out the scale tests" request.
I'd like to file another JIRA for that.
Most of tests in my previous patch are tests from the original s3a patch. 
I compared them with the contract tests. most are duplicates so I removed them. a few of them are worth to keep. I added them to abstract contract test and verified they work on HDFS.

This message is automatically generated., I modified the new test {{testRenameWithNonEmptySubDir}} to honor HDFS' behavior, but seems HDFS doesn't honor POSIX rename behavior.
"If the link named by the new argument exists, it shall be removed and old renamed to new. "
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/rename.html

HDFS {{rename}} creates a subfolder under dest dir. this is the same as linux though.
- srcdir/file
- emptydestdir
after rename
- emptydestdir/srcdir/file

Should HDFS honor POSIX rename behavior?
, You are right, HDFS does't quite follow posix. There's actually a difference between the command line {{mv}} operation and the internal rename API; I think the behaviour of bits of HDFS match the CLI.

HDFS cannot/will not change its behavior; the file system specification says "HDFS is the definition of the FS API". And like I also said "nobody really understands rename"...even the POSIX API isn't that great., patch-wise, it looks good; abstracting out the scale tests is something that can be done later -at least now it is configurable for S3a.

The test is failing on jenkins as you've added a test/resources/core-site.xml, which triggers the test run. Rather than do something complicated there, why not

# change the -aws POM to trigger the test off `resources/contract-test-options.xml` ... which is of course the file needed for all the contract tests.
# add to the `core-site.xml` the config options for the scale tests, along with the default values. This makes it easier to see what options to change., the failed test is the new rename test {{TestLocalFSContractRename}} I added to abstract contract. it fails {{RawLocalFileSystem}} enforce POSIX rename behavior which is different than HDFS.

{code}
public boolean rename(Path src, Path dst) throws IOException {
    // Attempt rename using Java API.
    File srcFile = pathToFile(src);
    File dstFile = pathToFile(dst);
    if (srcFile.renameTo(dstFile)) {
      return true;
    }

    // Enforce POSIX rename behavior that a source directory replaces an existing
    // destination if the destination is an empty directory.  On most platforms,
    // this is already handled by the Java API call above.  Some platforms
    // (notably Windows) do not provide this behavior, so the Java API call above
    // fails.  Delete destination and attempt rename again.
{code}

, Since we cannot change HDFS's rename behavior, I guess the same for RawLocalFileSystem.
I modified the new rename test to accept both POSIX rename behavior and CLI rename behavior.

# {{ContractOptions}} already lists a set of rename flags -are there any which match the operation? 
# If so, check it in the test and make the relevant assertions for whichever outcome has been declared as supported. that is, if it says it renames like posix, it had better.

{noformat}, charles —you happy with this? If so I'm +1 for it.

there's one thing I'd like to do as an experience of setting up the tests, something we could merge in with this patch. 

It is: make the authentication property names in s3a match those of s3n. They do the same thing, but have different names. Making the same except for s/s3a/s3n/ will aid migration and documentation.

That change is easy enough to do here, and something we need to do before releasing this in 2.6.

There's another extension later, "convert more HTTP error codes into standard exceptions" —which can be done later, bq. charles —you happy with this?

Yes, +1 (non-binding) from me.
, Why don't we just use one authentication property for all three, s3/s3n/s3a like the following?
{{fs.aws.access.key}} and {{fs.aws.secret.key}}
There is really no need to use one per connector.
, Let s3a use {{S3Credentials}} to get authentication info, same as s3 and s3n.
If we decide to use the same property name for all three in the future, just need to change it in {{S3Credentials}}., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This is the patch I'm going to commit; I just need people with better bandwidth than a bay area hotel to run the tests that upload the big files. That experience shows we need to make those tests optional.

I've not changed the code, just
# finished off the docs
# renamed the S3/S3N fs subclasses of {{FileSystemContractTestBase}} to Test* and so automatically run
# made them fail meaningfully if their args aren't set
# made sure it builds and runs on branch 2. To do that I had to remove the {{@override}} tag from {{TestS3AFileSystemContract.testMoveDirUnderParent()}}
# doubled the test timeouts in the POM -which still arent enough for some networks.

So: some minor test tuning; I do want to finish the full upload test (tommorrow) before committing as is. , {{TestJets3tNativeFileSystemStore}} is timing out for me, even in places with better bandwidth. Can others try?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I tried it. with 1G file upload, the test takes ~20 minutes. which means the 5G one will take more than 1.5 hrs. , I also ran all other s3a, s3n tests and they passed., [~stevel@apache.org] - is Juan's confirmation of the tests sufficient for you? If yes, are you OK with me going ahead and committing this? Seems like you were satisfied with it based on your comment on October 12.

Thanks a lot., sorry, not had a chance do do another run, but its been making me fell guilty

+1 for the patch if you rever that rename I did of the slow test. my own fault for interfering, Revert the rename change, and comment the S3N extra large file upload test.
Will add test config flag for the extra large file uploading in HADOOP-11128.
