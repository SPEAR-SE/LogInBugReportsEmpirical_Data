[Good idea.
I'd recommend going one step further and throwing an {{InterruptedIOException(cause)}} so the caller can act on it without looking inside, Apart from default constructor InterruptedIOException has a constructor which takes string argument. 
So no way to directly do new InterruptedIOException(cause). 
we could do.
{code}
catch(InterruptedException ie) {
      InterruptedIOException iioe = new InterruptedIOException(ie.getMessage());
      iioe.initCause(ie);
      throw iioe;
}
{code}

Or Instead of InterruptedIOException we can just throw an IOException with cause ie. 

{code}
catch(InterruptedException ie) {
throw newIOException(ie);
}
{code}
I feel that cause should be preserved, while wrapping exceptions. , do the {{initCause}}. It's used in other places in the code to retrofit cause retention. Which is, as you node, very important, \\
