This message is automatically generated., Both test failures and findbugs are not related to the patch., Two minor comments:
{code}
   * @throws IOException
{code}
1. The method does not throw IOException, would you remove the above line?
2. Would you remove unused imports?, Thanks for your review, Akira. 

I found some points from your comment:

* Throwable is overkill here. We should fix it as IOException.
* Re-throwing IOException and catching it is straight forward to me.
* In fact, unused imports is not related to this JIRA, but it's better to fix here. We can also fix the coding style here. 

v4 patch includes fixes above points.
