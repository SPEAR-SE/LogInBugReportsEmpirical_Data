@Thomas, do you have any comments?, Its unfortunately hadoop doesn't have a consistent usage output for its commands.  I think what is here is better though. My only comment would be, can we put the options in brackets similar to hadoop fs/unix. like:

 [-getlevel <host:httpPort> <name>]
 [-setlevel <host:httpPort> <name> <level>], Thanks Uma and Thomas for looking into the patch.
