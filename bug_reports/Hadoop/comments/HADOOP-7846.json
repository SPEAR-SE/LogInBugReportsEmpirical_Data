[For now, a simple fix would be to point to common/releases.html from both hdfs and mapreduce. Thoughts?

Joe - do you want to provide a patch for that? Thanks., sure, I can provide a patch., This patch updates the links on the HDFS and MapReduce sites to link to common/releases.html. I only patched the un-built site -- you must run ant after applying the patch to https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/site 

I didn't remove or update the {hdfs,mapreduce}/releases.html pages (but they're not linked to). Let me know if you think that should be updated, too., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
