[Attached a simple patch that overrides #close() as expected. , Attached an updated version for latest Hadoop trunk. , looking at the code, probably good idea to tag the constructor arg as {{@Nonnull}} and have the ctor raise the NPE if it is null, avoids having a check on the close(). That'll let you add a test too, to keep jenkins happy, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
