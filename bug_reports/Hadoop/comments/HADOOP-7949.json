Defaults maxidletime in Server.java to 10000 instead of 1000, and updates the various hard-coded ipc keys and defaults in Client and Server to use the relevant constants to prevent similar future mistakes. , +1, the changes look good to me.

This message is automatically generated., Todd pointed out ipc.client.connection.maxidletime is set in core-default.xml so the defaults here in the code are actually dead code. Doesn't seem like we should define defaults in two places (the code and -default.xml) I'll file a jira for that.

Test failure is cut paste error in the test, will fix that., Updated patch, just fixes the copy past error in the test., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Eli,

Is this pending a 0.23 backport? I do not see a Fix Version(s) set., This was fixed in 23. Updating fixVersion.]
