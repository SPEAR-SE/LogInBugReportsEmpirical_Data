[Thanks, Giri. With this patch, the test is launched correctly. Although TestHdfsProxy is a bit flaky in trunk, this patch should still apply. 

+1 on commit to 0.20-security.

For trunk the patch needs to be a bit different due to the tree structure change., Hmm. It seems the entire TestHdfsProxy is disabled in trunk. I thought just one thing was disabled in the test. We can still do the same on trunk since the code is still there and may be brought back to life in the future., FYI, the following was done to trunk in HDFS-1666. If anyone intend to verify hdfsproxy in trunk or any release based off trunk, HDFS-1666 needs to be revisited.

{code}
   <target name="test">
+    <!-- hdfsproxy tests failing due to HDFS-1666
     <subant target="test">
       <fileset dir="." includes="hdfsproxy/build.xml"/>
     </subant>
+      -->
   </target>
{code}
, Corrected version - this jira was actually fixed in 0.20.205.0., Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0]
