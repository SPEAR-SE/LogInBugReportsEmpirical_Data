[I hit this today with 0.20-append on Debian when using 0.0.0.0 as the NameNode IP. Setting java.net.preferIPv4Stack for the Java process seems to solve the problem, as it makes the socket actually use 0.0.0.0 and not the ipv6 version., While you're supposed to use hostnames for HDFS URIs, HADOOP-6056 fixes this issue by shipping with the IPv4 preferrer opt. Resolving as dupe.]
