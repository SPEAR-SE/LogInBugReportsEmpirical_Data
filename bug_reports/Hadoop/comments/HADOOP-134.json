[Ok, this patch fixes the problem. In particular,
  1. adds the hostname to the task tracker names.
  2. moves exception-raising code out of the constructor for TaskInProgress
  3. pulls the task start up code into a separate procedure so that I can make sure it doesn't throw any exceptions
  4. records failures during initialization of tasks
  5. moves the stringifyException into the utils package., This is the previous patch updated to reflect the Path changes that went in today., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
