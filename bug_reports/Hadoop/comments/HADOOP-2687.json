This message is automatically generated., The failure in core looks radically unrelated to this patch changing log levels.  Failure was: org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: java.io.IOException: Cannot open filename /destdat/six/52594456153456364

I'll reschedule w/ hudson anyways to be sure since there are only two patches currently in its queue.
, Retry, Trying to get a +1 (though the -1 was in an unrelated test), I think this will be committed, without another +1., Good to know.  Cancelling patch., I just committed this. Thanks stack!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #379 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/379/])]
