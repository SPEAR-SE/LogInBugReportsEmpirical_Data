[agree, I think those two sections with incompatible changes should be merged. Thoughts on {{Delete an optional field as long as the optional field has reasonable defaults to allow deletions}} ? To me this looks like an compatible change., Perhaps "Delete an optional field as long as the optional field has reasonable defaults to allow deletions" should be moved to the section on compatible changes, and a new bullet item "Delete an optional field that does not have defaults that allow deletions" should be added to the (merged) section on incompatible changes., [~daniel@cloudera.com] will  have some opinions here, Thanks for the heads up, [~steve_l].  I agree that it sounds like that line ended up under the wrong heading.  The duplicate headings also give mo pause.  I'll have to dig in to see where exactly that went south, but I'm on vacation until next Tuesday.  I'll take a look then.  Feel free to assign it to me.]
