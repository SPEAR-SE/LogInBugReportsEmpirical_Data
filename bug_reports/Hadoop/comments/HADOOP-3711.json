This message is automatically generated., +1, The patch doesn't apply to 0.18, the test case passes without the change to PipeMapRed, and the code doesn't seem to have the problem this fixes. Does this only apply to trunk?, Chris, you are right. The bug is not there in 0.18. It is only on the trunk. It got introduced by HADOOP-3341. , I just committed this. Thanks, Amareshwari!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
