[On Windows, most of the native code calls use a Windows API, which sets an error code visible by calling {{GetLastError}}.  These error codes are not guaranteed to match the POSIX errno values, so in general, it wouldn't make sense to perform the errno mapping on Windows.  However, we can still preserve the intent of HDFS-4428 and provide a detailed error message on Windows.  The Windows native implementation already maps the value of {{GetLastError}} to a detailed message by calling {{FormatMessage}}.  This becomes the message for the {{NativeIOException}}.  We just need to update the test assertions to check for these messages instead of the errno values on Windows.
, This patch asserts for the Windows-specific detailed error message when running on Windows.  I've also changed the order of arguments to the assert calls.  The expected value is supposed to be first argument, so that JUnit correctly prints "expected X but got Y" during a failure.

I tested this on Windows and Linux with native build enabled., +1

Confirmed that users of NativeIO.renameTo do not care about the error code (outside of tests)., Thank you, Arpit., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

One comment on the patch. If I'm seeing things correctly, nativeio implementation for rename0 uses CRT#rename which returns errno code. On the other hand, Windows implementation for throw_ioe assumes winerror code. Can you please check if the two are compatible?

Ivan, thank you for asking about this.  I had thought that the two were compatible at least for the rename function (though not all CRT functions).  Your question prompted me to double-check, and it turns out that I was mistaken.  They are not compatible.

Here is a new version of the patch that uses conditional compilation to pass the return value of {{GetLastError}} to {{throw_ioe}} when running on Windows.  I retested this on Windows and Linux with native build.  I confirmed that {{rename}} is setting the value of {{GetLastError}} when it fails.

OK, I have one more minor comment since we're changing the native code anyways. To be semantically correct, we cannot assume that last error is properly set when we call the CRT rename API (its undocumented). Can we instead call [MoveFile|http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365239(v=vs.85).aspx] on Windows? (this is what rename does internally) Feel free to comment back with your take., {quote}
Can we instead call MoveFile on Windows?
{quote}

Sure, we can do that.  At this point, we already need conditional compilation, so we're not gaining much simplicity by trying to stick rigidly to CRT rename.  I'll work on a new patch., I am also +1 on using native calls over CRT functions. The behaviors of CRT functions are more unpredictable in my experience., {quote}

That's good to know.  Thanks, Chuan and Ivan!, I'm uploading version 3 of the patch, which switches to {{MoveFile}} on Windows.  I reran the tests on both Windows and Linux., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
