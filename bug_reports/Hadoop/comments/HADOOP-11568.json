[Hi, [~archanat].  Could you please help me understand the issue better?  See below for the output of {{hadoop}} from a recent trunk build.  I don't see a problem with the description of the {{classpath}} sub-command.

{code}
> hadoop
Usage: hadoop [--config confdir] [COMMAND | CLASSNAME]
  CLASSNAME            run the class named CLASSNAME
 or
  where COMMAND is one of:
  archive -archiveName NAME -p <parent path> <src>* <dest>
                       create a Hadoop archive
  checknative [-a|-h]  check native Hadoop and compression 
                         libraries availability
  classpath            prints the class path needed to get the
                         Hadoop jar and the required libraries
  credential           interact with credential providers
  daemonlog            get/set the log level for each daemon
  distch path:owner:group:permisson
                       distributed metadata changer
  distcp <srcurl> <desturl> 
                       copy file or directories recursively
  fs                   run a generic filesystem user client
  jar <jar>            run a jar file
                       note: please use "yarn jar" to launch
                             YARN applications, not this command.
  jnipath              prints the java.library.path
  kerbname             show auth_to_local principal conversion
  key                  manage keys via the KeyProvider
  trace                view and modify Hadoop tracing settings
  version              print the version

Most commands print help when invoked w/o parameters.

, Hi [~cnauroth]

This above issue exists in branch-2 

function print_usage(){
