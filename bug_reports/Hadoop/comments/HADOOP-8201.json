[this patch creates the src/native/configure script and update patches the build.xml to create the configure script inside src/native if its not there., Giri, isn't this the issue that causes MR to fail in 1.0.2-rc1 if Snappy compression is configured on?  If so, it needs to be marked as a bug, not an improvement.  Thanks., +1

We should systematically remove all of the autoconf/automake files and regenerate them in the build directory, but this is a step in the right direction., Committing to branch-1.0.2, branch-1.0, and branch-1.
Thanks, Giri!, Confirmed after applying this fix, the only difference in the resulting src/native/configure file was one added block of script related to Snappy.]
