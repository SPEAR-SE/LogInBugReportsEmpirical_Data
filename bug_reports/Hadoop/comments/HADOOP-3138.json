Sure.  I will fix it., > We should check if parent path exists before calling mkdir?

Should this be a client side fix? HDFS mkdirs is is like 'mkdir -p', if the dir exists it should pass (at least according my Linux machine anyway: {{`mkdir -p /usr`}} succeeds without error though I don't have permission to create /usr). So it looks like if a directory exists, then creating that directory should not result in a access denied (unless the user does not have directory-read permissions to the parent directory, may be)., > Should this be a client side fix?

Tried the following in Linux:

- mkdir(const char *pathname, mode_t mode) system call.  It returns " pathname already exists".

- For mkdir -p, it does not report any error if the path exists and the path is a directory, even if there is no w permission in the parent.

- For mkdir, it reports "File exists" error.

I guess Raghu is right since our mkdirs and mkdir -p have similar semantic., mkdirs() first invokes {{exists()}} at the beginning and returns false if the path exists. yes, exists() is called even before the check for safemode().

This message is automatically generated., +1 patch looks good, hmm... in multiple locations, there is code like {{' if (!mkdir(dir)) { throw new IOException("could not create dir"); } '}} , which is wrong. I can fix the ones that show up on the unit test. Alternately  we could just continue to allow this kind of use..., The next patch attached continue to enforce the assumption on mkdirs() return value., > ... , which is wrong. 
+1 I agree that the semantic of mkdirs(...) is not clear.  This should be fixed in HADOOP-3163.

Not sure we still need to fix this issue since the distcp problem is already gone by HADOOP-3099.  Should we mark this one as WON'T FIX and then work on HADOOP-3163?, Since this is a bug in DFS, it is likely to affect other users as well.. my preference would be to commit it.
