[I will submit a patch for this issue., This JIRA is similar as HADOOP-1386:The constructor of Path should not take an empty string as a parameter.
Since the string-based constructor checks for an empty string, for consistency it would make sense that the URI-based constructor do the same thing., My comment and suggestion can be found at

, Hi Zhihai, thanks for working on this. Patch looks good, just have some unit test quibbles:

* We should test the null URI case as well
* Better to use GenericTestUtils#assertExceptionContains rather than the current logic, and Assert.fail, i.e.

{code}
try {
  // some op that should fail
  fail("Op should have failed!");
} catch (MyException e) {
  assertExceptionContains("expected exception text");
}
{code}

+1 pending this though, thanks. I'll release note this just in case, but it seems like a straight bug to me considering we don't allow empty strings in the String constructor., Hi Andrew,
Thanks for the review, That is a good finding. I will fix these unit test quibbles with a new patch.

, Some internal testing revealed that this has bad behavior with Path("."). This gets normalized to an empty URI, so the symmetry of {{new Path(path.toUri())}} is broken.

I'm going to revert this out of trunk and branch-2 momentarily., I reverted this out of trunk and branch-2 after some discussion with Zhihai. We'll fix the user-level issue elsewhere., Andrew is right. The code can introduce empty Uri is at.
{code}
this.uri = new URI(scheme, authority, normalizePath(scheme, path), null, fragment)
        .normalize();
{code}
and
{code}
uri = aUri.normalize();
{code}

Normalize will remove ".", so we can remove normalize() in the code as

{code}
this.uri = new URI(scheme, authority, normalizePath(scheme, path), null, fragment);
uri = aUri;
{code}

But the problem is URI("") is valid in java based on http://download.java.net/jdk7/archive/b123/docs/api/java/net/URI.html.
"Empty relative paths are permitted; this seems to be the intent of RFC 2396 although the grammar does not permit it. The primary consequence of this deviation is that a standalone fragment such as "#foo" parses as a relative URI with an empty path and the given fragment, and can be usefully resolved against a base URI."
, Thanks Andrew, Zhihai.
(Sorry I was too lazy to create the jira myself to fix this.)

If possible,  I still want to prevent path creation from empty URI. 
Original bug (HADOOP-10820) was about unintentionally reading the current working directory recursively.  I'm afraid next time we hit a similar issue, it could be about deleting the entire working directory.

Maybe I'm worrying too much.  Let me think about it., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6034 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6034/])
