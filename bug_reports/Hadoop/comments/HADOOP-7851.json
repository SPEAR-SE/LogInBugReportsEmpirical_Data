[Configuration.getClasses() internally uses getTrimmedStrings() which returns an empty array in case the parameter value is not specified. , I think, the fix should be something like

This message is automatically generated., Can we not test instead for an empty array and return the default value? This way we properly reuse the getTrimmedStrings function thats already present, instead of directly calling out the StringUtils one., This problem exists in 0.20-security as well. Would love it if you can post a patch for that as well?, {quote}

This also should work.

In 20Security205, getStrings itself will return null if collection is empty.

Collection<String> values = getStringCollection(str);
    if(values.size() == 0) {
      return null;
    } 

I dont see problem here. Am i missing some thing here?, For 23 branch, we can directly merge the trunk patch because there is no code mismatches. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Javadoc comments are not from this patch! let me check., Not setting a value for a configuration parameter is different from setting it to "". Hence when the parameter is not set, the default value should be returned. When the parameter is set (including "") then the specified value should be returned and not the default. Hence a simple check before invoking getTrimmedStrings() should suffice., Yes Amar, 
 My first pacth should adderss your comment. But i used directly StringUtils api directly. So, that i could avaoid two times get invokation. 

But coming to harsh comment, i thought to raise your point. But i could'nt find any usecase for setting "" for classnames. Do we have some use cases? If so, we can prefer 1st patch itself.

Thanks
Uma , Some comments on the first patch.
1. Instead of 
{code}
String[] classnames = StringUtils.getTrimmedStrings(valueString);
{code} 
use 
{code}
String[] classnames = getTrimmedStrings(name);
{code}

2. In the testcase, 
{code}
Class<?>[] classes = config
        .getClasses("testClassName", Configuration.class);
{code}
kindly use
{code}
Class<?>[] classes = 
    config.getClasses("testClassName", Configuration.class);
{code}

3. Instead of assertTrue, you can use assertEquals()
4. Kindly add a testcase for a value of "". The output should be an empty array., Hi Amar, Thanks for the review.

1. Instead of 

String[] classnames = StringUtils.getTrimmedStrings(valueString);
use 

String[] classnames = getTrimmedStrings(name);
{quote}

get call will be executed multiple times if i use getTrimmedStrings(name).
Because we should call get once for validating null and then call getTrimmedStrings. This api again will call get and passed to StringUtils.getTrimmedStrings. That is the reason i used directly StringUtils.getTrimmedStrings. do you agree with this?

i will update the patch with other comments. Can you please confirm above one.

Regards,
Uma 
, Uma, does it makes sense to use {{getRaw()}} instead. Something like
{code}
if (null == getRaw(name)) {
  return defaultValue;
}
String[] classnames = getTrimmedStrings(name);
{code}, Thanks Amar for taking a look again.
Ok, it is better than get. its little lighter :-)

Updated the patch by addressing the comments.

{quote}

kindly use

Class<?>[] classes = 
    config.getClasses("testClassName", Configuration.class);
{quote}
This is due to formatter. I am usiing hadoop formatter only. Manually i changed it.

3. Instead of assertTrue, you can use assertEquals()
  Yes, assertEquals will give the values in trace when it is failing. But i included the value in error message.Since they are premitives i used assertTrue. 
Now i changed it to assertEquals.  

4. Kindly add a testcase for a value of "". The output should be an empty array.
 Added test for "".

Amar, can you please take a look?

Thanks
Uma
