[I've got a local patch that basically asks the running JVM where the libjvm.so file is at.  I should really clean it up and post it., That sounds like a good approach Allen. Something that greps forward from the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib directory for the libjvm.so to determine the path would be quite elegant and much simpler than trying to divine the OS Architecture signature and build the right path., No, no, there's an easier way.

The system property sun.boot.library.path (at least on Sun JRE's) will tell you the location of libjvm. So I have an autoconf that builds a small java app that prints out this property., This is a one line fix that identifies the location of the appropriate libjvm.so file. For Sun systems this is under the jre/lib/$OS_ARCH/server folder for IBM JREs this is under the jre/lib/$OS_ARCH/classic folder. Non-Sun JREs do not have a sun.boot.library.path environment variable that can be relied upon. 

This is also easily extensible as other JREs (such as Apache Harmony) can simply extend the regular expression by adding in an "OR" expression for a folder that is unique to their JRE., This will need to tested on OS X Snow Leopard, which is both bi-arch, a Sun-based JVM and doesn't use jre/lib/server. :)

This message is automatically generated., Simply extending the regular expression with an "OR" will not do the job for Apache Harmony. As a first problem, Harmony does not have such file, instead they have libharmonyvm.so. One could create a soft link to this file under libjvm.so


A change is needed in the path given to the 'find' command as the equivalent to libjvm.so

find . -name '*a*' | head -n , Simply extending the regular expression with an "OR" will not do the job for Apache Harmony. As a first problem, Harmony does not have such file, instead they have libharmonyvm.so. Second, this library is in the 'jre/bin/default' directory. As a solution, one can create a soft link to libharmonyvm.so and then modify the path as suggested, which would still work for SUN or IBM JREs:

Replace:
+   JVMSOPATH=`find $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib -name libjvm.so | egrep 'server|classic'`

With:
+   JVMSOPATH=`find $JAVA_HOME/jre/ -name libjvm.so | head -n 1`

This message is automatically generated., Is the first libjvm.so found always the right one?

Perhaps better to use JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/OS_ARCH/<dir>/libjvm.so where <dir> is "default", "server", "jrockit", etc.   Or you could reuse AP_JVM_LIBDIR in hdfs (see apsupport.m4)., @Eli, in my opinion, the first libjvm.so should be considered (the user doing the build should ensure that the intended libjvm is the first one). In the future, if we have a usecase for <dir>, then we can provide that option (in a way that makes sense). Thoughts?, FWIW, libjvm.so will break on OS X., I don't want to hold the commit of this really really simple two line patch that improves the build in a big way.

Allen, could you please submit your ideas as a patch on how to make it work on a Mac (you seemed to indicate you had a solution that is more general). I'd suggest you open a separate jira to track that approach.

Hope it makes sense to everyone., bq. the first libjvm.so should be considered (the user doing the build should ensure that the intended libjvm is the first one).

Why? How would the user doing the build ensure the one they want is first w/o modifying the build? Seems like that would require them to delete whatever libjvm.so files showed up first (yuck).

Why not just add both JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/OS_ARCH/server/libjvm.so and JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/OS_ARCH/default/libjvm.so to the library path? It's simpler than this path and doesn't potentially change which libjvm.so is currently being picked on some systems., some sample code., You really aren't looking for a specific library, you're really looking for the lib directory.  The easiest way to do this in a somewhat portable fashion is to ask the JVM directly.

I've uploaded a snippet of what I do locally to build libhadoop.so and libhadoop.dylib on my machines.  [The code I use is so radically different than what is in Hadoop that making it into a patch is too time consuming.]  You should be able to do the same thing with any JVM, you just need to determine what the proper system property is.  While this doesn't make it 'instantly' portable, it does it make much easier to add support for JREs after they have been vetted.  

For IBM's JRE, I believe the system property to look for is com.ibm.oti.vm.bootstrap.library.path ., IMO we should do something simple here (just add the path for the IBM jre lib dir) and have a follow up jira that implements Allen's suggestion throughout the project (we need this for libhdfs test and fuse-dfs as well). , Okay, this patch should cater to both - keeps it simple and doesn't break compatibility in the existing build process. Basically, it keeps the current -L and appends to it the path discovered by the 'find' command.

Allen, thanks for posting the snippet. We should open a follow up jira to keep track of that bigger fix., @Devaraj, works for me. Nit: If it works, I'd be explicit vs using the 1st option, eg
{code}
JNI_LDFLAGS="-L$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/$OS_ARCH/server -L$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/$OS_ARCH/default"
{code}, @Eli, the problem is that 'default' doesn't seem to be a standard. In case of the IBM JDK I have been testing with, the path ends with 'classic'. I'd like to retain the 'find' and let the first path containing a libjvm.so win, rather than make an assumption about the path. Makes sense?, Makes sense. +1 to your latest patch, Btw on my install (build 2.4, JRE 1.6.0 IBM J9 2.4) the IBM jdk has a bunch of versions of the file:

This was done to handle the build of Hadoop with IBM's JDK. Contributed by Stephen Watt, Guillermo Cabrera and Devaraj Das. (Revision 1302704)
