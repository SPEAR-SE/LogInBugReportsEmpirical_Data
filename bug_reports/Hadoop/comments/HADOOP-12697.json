[The retries in this case were per-exception (see YARN RMProxy), but they don't specify SaslException/GSSException anywhere. I am not sure if this is an issue with retry policy setup in YARN, or in ipc.Client., looks like a duplicate of HADOOP-10036. Certainly filed by same reporter, who should have checked first.]
