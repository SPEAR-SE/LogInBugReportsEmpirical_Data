[This is *NOT* the appropriate use of the combiner. The data types must be the *same* between the input and output of the combiner., The functionality must be moved into either the map or the reduce if you want it to be done exactly once., I spoke with Ben, and he argued that Pig could implement its combiner in its mapper to address this, and that would probably be faster too, since a HashMap could be used to buffer tuples and they would not need to be serialized and deserialized, as they are with a combiner., Olga's concern was that HADOOP-3226 changed the semantics of combiners in an incompatible way. I've updated the release note on HADOOP-3226 to both call out the semantic change and point out the deprecated configuration attribute that disables the additional calls the combiner.]
