, Do I need to do anything more to this JIRA and the pull request [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/140] on github? I'm not familiar with the workflow in this community! Thanks!, LGTM, +1. Hi [~andrew.wang], would you double check this?, Great work here, thanks for sending us a patch. I have a couple small nits, some of which are not related to your changes but things I saw while looking at the diff.

Some things I think read better as the original:

* "Identifying the audience of an interface helps defining the impact of breaking" 
* "The interface is for general use by any applications."
* "implementing rolling upgrades. It communicates that this interface should"
* Prefer we leave the empty Precondition headers in the FileSystem specification
* "dest` will match those under `src`, as will the contents do:"

Suggestions:

* "e.g. In HDFS, FSImage stability can help providing more flexible roll backs." -> "provide more flexible rollback."
* "A good example of a limited-private interface is BlockLocations, This is" -> "A good example of a limited-private interface is BlockLocations. This is a"
* "have got a coordinated effort with the MR team to release matching releases" -> "coordinate release efforts with the MR team"
* "While the caller may expect for as much buffer as possible to be filled" -> "While the caller may expect as much of the buffer as possible to be filled"
* "be used as direct replacement for HDFS." -> "be used as direct replacements for HDFS.", Thanks for suggestions! Updated patch uploaded!, Totally confused by GITHUB pull request workflow :-(. Please use patch file only., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Hi [~danix800], could you attach a single consolidated patch? The "-3" patch looks like a partial. I'm not that familiar with the github PR model either., Github user danix800 closed the pull request at:

, Seems like the github PRs are confusing the precommit bot :( I triggered the build manually, hopefully it picks up patch v4., I put the v4 patch up at a new JIRA HADOOP-13724 to make things simple for the precommit bot, closing this one as dupe., Two notes:

* Once precommit picks up that github is being used, it will not go back to doing a patch download. 

* The PR likely started to fail once it got a bunch more commits in it. (Looking at it now, there are 17 commits in it!) Github PRs should be rebased and have it's own commits squashed into one for absolute best results.]
