Would be nice to get the integration going at the earliest., Straight-forward patch that bumps jersey version to 1.9, Built packages successfully., [~kkambatl], patch looks good, just one NIT, instead have the version explicitly set in 4 different artifacts, a less prone error for this would be defining a jersey.version property in the POM and using ${jersey.version} as version for all the artifacts., Updated to address Alejandro's comments., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
