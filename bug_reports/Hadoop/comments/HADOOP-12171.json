[This is sort of a continuation of HDFS-7223, which shortened most trace span names.  But there were a few we missed., fullClassNameToTraceString looks like utility that belongs in htrace rather than in hadoop rpc util. Could add it here for now deprecated to be replaced with htrace implementation.

Call it toTraceString or toTraceName or toTraceKey ... since what is passed in is not classname, we do more than just shorten the passed String, and our output is used keying the trace.

Otherwise, LGTM [~cmccabe]





, bq. fullClassNameToTraceString looks like utility that belongs in htrace rather than in hadoop rpc util. Could add it here for now deprecated to be replaced with htrace implementation.

yeah

bq. Otherwise, LGTM Colin Patrick McCabe

thanks, waiting for jenkins, let me see if I can change fullClassNameToTraceString -> toTraceName, \\
