It seems since we run junit in fork mode we could just System.exit(1) after dumping stacks, I wonder how Maven's Surefire handles times outs? It feels like moving Hadoop to Maven is pretty much imminent which raises the question about ROI of such modification. I agree though that not-having logs when a timeout occurs is annoying to say the least.]
