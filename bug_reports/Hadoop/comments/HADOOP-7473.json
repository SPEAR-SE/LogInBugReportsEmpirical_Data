[We could fix this by changing the command to use: "du -ks --apparent-size <file>", which causes it to return the part of the allocation that is actually used. That however, isn't available on non-gnu systems.

I'd propose instead that we just loosen the TestDU test to require that the size be between:

size <= returned size < size + 10%
 

, Have you seen HADOOP-7045?, I'd missed that. This is clearly a duplicate, although I'd lean toward my solution of using 10% slack instead of a hard coded 4k. , 10% slack is fine with me, I used 4k because it addresses the specific case of ext attrs., Hadoop 0.20.204.0 was released today.]
