, Thanks for reporting this, [~GeLiXin]. Let me see the patch and related code. I think changing code path not for the test is not intended by HADOOP-10865. It would be good to fix it if there is a regression. , +1 Good catch on the regression and thanks for the patch!

Will commit this tomorrow to see if anyone has comments., The patch lgtm too. I'm running HDFS tests with the patch applied. +1 if there is no failures except for known flaky ones.

bq. I find that the write performance decreased by 13%

[~GeLiXin], can you share how you did the comparison? It would be nice if we can reproduce the issue by TestDFSIO or similar.

BlockReceiver seems to be relevant caller of {{DataChecksum#BlockReceiver}} with non-direct buffer. Based on the result of Crc32PerformanceTest, NativeCrc32 is faster than CRC32 if bytes-per-checksum <= 128 on my environment., [~szetszwo] Thanks for review !, [~iwasakims] Thanks for review, too.

It's my spark job which takes longer time than before that catch my attention. The simplest way to reproduce is just write a big file to HDFS, the time cost by write a 10GB file change to 71 seconds from 63 seconds.

{quote}
On my environment, NativeCrc32 is faster than ZIP and PureJava at all the bpc. BTW, the default checksum type is CRC32C in hadoop, which means HDFS will use PureJava algorithm when we didn't let it use native.

, +1. I saw no relevant test failures in hadoop-hdfs. 

bq. BTW, the default checksum type is CRC32C in hadoop, which means HDFS will use PureJava algorithm when we didn't let it use native.

Sure. Discussion about further optimization should be done in another JIRA. , I will commit this shortly. Before that, I'm going to move this issue to Hadoop Common to which the fix belongs., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
