[Glen, would you like to work on this? If you post a patch, I will commit it. I have added you as a contributor and have assigned the jira to you., Suresh, I just posted the patch, it's in the description., Glen, please use a patch file to post the patch, instead of description. I am posting the patch from the description, this time. Is this problem in trunk?, I don't know and don't care if the problem is in trunk, HADOOP-9206 makes trunk useless for me, forcing me to have to stay with the 1.1.x branch.
, bq. I don't know and don't care if the problem is in trunk
The changes in Hadoop always first go to trunk and then to older releases to keep the trunk. Hence the question.

I will see if I can talk to the folks who can help with HADOOP-9206 and see some progress is made on that.

, I committed the patch to trunk, branch-2, branch-1 and branch-1.2. Thank you Glen., Suresh, please don't assign this JIRA to me -- I'm just a user entering in a JIRA over a typo --the only people who should be assigned JIRAs are committers.  If the Hadoop project unfortunately requires committers to need to jump through a dozen hoops in order to fix a silly typo (no other Apache project I'm aware of requires JUnit tests for typos), that's a procedural problem you guys need to change, instead of just farming out such busywork to the people reporting the errors.  And the alternative of having me type up a justification of why a JUnit test is not necessary for a typo is too silly to consider.

If my further non-participation in this JIRA item means you need to close this item as a Won't Fix while keeping the misspelling in the code base, so be it.  The Hadoop team is making it too crippling a process to resolve problems with their system, with the result that fewer and fewer people are going to bother reporting issues., OK, glad to hear you committed it, Suresh.  I *refuse* to type up JUnit test cases for typos.   :), Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #183 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/183/])
