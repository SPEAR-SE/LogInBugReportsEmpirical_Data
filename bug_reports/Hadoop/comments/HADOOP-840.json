[This patch needs review and testing..., My patch depends on HADOOP-836, I believe that because the patch for 836 was modified before committing it, this patch now needs to be updated., updated the patch to the current trunk. Fixed a nullpointer exception in the patch and also changed synchronization so that initialization of the new job does not get stuck on cleanup of the previous one., problem with the prvious patch. Updating a new one., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12347774/lost-tt_2.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r489707., an updated patch that passes all the unit tests., +1, I just committed this.  Thanks, Devaraj!, Oops!  Resolved the wrong bug., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen & Mahadev!]
