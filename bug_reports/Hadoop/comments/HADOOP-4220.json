[I can think of 2 options 
1) Split the test {{TestJobTrackerRestart}} into 2 test cases. Currently it comprises of 3 test cases.
2) Reduce the timeout  to << 1 min

I will check if the test case can be improved further., one cause of the delay is the 60second wait 
    //  Wait for a minute before submitting a job
    waitFor(60 * 1000);
Would it be possible to spin and poll for whatever state change is required before starting the service. Relying on delays is very brittle., Attaching a patch the brings down the runtime of {{TestJobTrackerRestart}} and {{TestJobTrackerRestartWithLostTracker}}
||Test||Run-time||
|TestJobTrackerRestart| 276.645 sec|
|TestJobTrackerRestartWithLostTracker|136.736 sec|
Trying to optimize it further., TestJobTrackerRestart  failed in hudson build #3722.  See http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/3722/testReport/, Given the number of times this is failing, I think it makes sense to address this issue for Hadoop 0.20., Attaching a patch that is updated to trunk. The test times on my box were _2 min 55 secs_ for {{TestJobTrackerRestart}} and _1 min 39 secs_ for {{TestJobTrackerRestartWithLostTracker}}., Let's get HADOOP-4880 committed first.
