[Fix is straightforward: use the method name in generating the contract test path

Other workarounds (e.g override deleteTestDirInTeardown or not call superclass stuff will hide the problem; best to make sure that every test case has a unique filename (or at least unique except in the special case of subclassed tests running in parallel)

I'm seeing this in HADOOP-13786; the more threads I have, the more often it surfaces, invalid for the S3a paths, it's only local test paths for the staging FS]
