[Simple patch, Thanks for contributing Elias. Can you update TestConfiguration with a case that will fail w/o your patch?

I've rebased your patch on trunk., Patch attached., Eli,

Thanks for your response. I would like to reproduce the problem but I'd have to somehow embed the .xml file inside a .jar and adjust the test classpath to match. I'd likely have to isolate the test from the rest of the existing classpath as well. Maybe you could guide me through this?

Thanks., Thanks Elias, 

I have noticed that the patch no longer applies due to the recent changes to Configuration.java. I have made the required changes so it can apply cleanly on trunk. 

Also changed:

{code}
+        doc = builder.parse((InputStream)name);
{code}

to:

{code}
+        doc = parse(builder, (InputStream) resource);
{code}

to insure the InputStream will be closed.

Regarding testing, I am not sure if there is an easy way to reproduce this issue in a unit test., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Hey Tucu. I think this commit broke the way in which relative xincludes are handled in Configuration. I have some development confs which use xinclude with non-absolute paths, and it used to successfully pick up the included files from my conf directory. Now, it seems to be looking in the current working directory instead.

Is it possible to fix the code so that the relative paths are resolved the same as before? I think xinclude is relatively common for deployments., I confirmed that reverting this patch locally restored the old behavior.

If we can't maintain the old behavior, we should at least mark this as an incompatible change. But I bet it's doable to both fix it and have relative xincludes., Hi Todd, It is weird that this patch caused this behavior change. The patch didn't modify the builder or the docBuilderFactory, and it is still  docBuilderFactory.setXIncludeAware(true). In essence, the patch is basically using DocumentBuilder#parse(InputStream uri.openStream()) instead of DocumentBuilder#parse(String uri.toString()). Seems there is a change in implementation of both parse methods, which seems weird., Yea, I don't know much about the underlying API, but it definitely changed the behavior. It's still trying to do the xinclude, it's just looking in cwd instead of my conf dir., I looked into the implementation of javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder and org.xml.sax.InputSource and there is a difference when the DocumentBuilder parse(String) method is used versus parse(InputStream). Basically we need to use parse(InputStream is, String systemId) which provides a base for resolving relative URIs. Here is a new patch that fixes this issue. It needs to be applied on top of the previously committed patch. I am not sure if we need to create a new ticket since this one is already committed., I'd either file a new jira explaining the bug with a new patch with fix/test, or revert this patch and post a new one that includes the fix., Thanks Eli!
