[Yea, I just noticed this as well. It seems to have been going on for quite some time. I should also note that the -1 I got in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3068 for javadocs seems to be transient, and appears in a lot of tests., Based on the hudson chart, it appears to have started between 993 and 994:

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/993/console
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/994/console

994 contains:

MAPREDUCE-3157. [Rumen] Fix TraceBuilder to handle 0.20 history file names also. (detail/ViewSVN)
MAPREDUCE-3125. Modified TaskImpl to consider only non-failed, non-killed task-attempts for obtaining task's progress. Contributed by Hitesh Shah. (detail/ViewSVN)
Move line for HDFS-2422 under 0.23 instead of 0.24. (detail/ViewSVN)
Move the HADOOP-6490 Changes note to the right section. Accidentally placed it under Bugs in r1182189. (detail/ViewSVN)
MAPREDUCE-3140. Fixed the invalid JobHistory URL for failed applications. Contributed by Subroto Sanyal. (detail/ViewSVN)
HADOOP-7736. Remove duplicate Path#normalizePath call. (detail/ViewSVN)
HDFS-2349. Corruption detected during block transfers should log WARNs. (detail/ViewSVN)
HADOOP-6490. Use StringUtils over String#replace in Path#normalizePath. Contributed by Uma Maheswara Rao G. (detail/ViewSVN)
HADOOP-7642. create hadoop-dist module where TAR stitching would happen. Contributed by Thomas White. (detail/ViewSVN)

Not sure if any of this is relevant/helps. The Hudson test chart has been running flat at 69 tests ever since., Guessing ... but I see HADOOP-7642 made some changes to the version of the assemblies plugin as well some other assemblies plugin changes. I will investigate this a little, perhaps by submitting the reverse patch for experimentation., Yea, that's the one that made me nervous as well. Look forward to your findings. :), I did find a maven issue that may be of some help to understand a fix. 

http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MDEP-259, Jonathan, thanks for looking into this. A speedy resolution will help a lot!, Also, we should add this as list of jiras along with the maven backport to 0.23., Can anyone with build conf access post what the exact test-patch command is being executed by jenkins? It seems that another occurrence of this issue in auth is masking the error in mapreduce. Thanks., Here's the script:

{code}
#!/bin/bash
set +x

source ${WORKSPACE}/nightly/hudsonEnv.sh

mkdir -p ${WORKSPACE}/patchprocess

cd ${TRUNK}

{code}, Terrific! Thanks, Mahadev!, Seems like the build has started working again.

326 tests run
https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/1054/testReport/, I was never able to fully reproduce this error exactly as the reactor build still always had Auth problems. Not sure how to remove those from the build.

, Since the issue is fixed for now. Plan is to use this ticket to fix test-patch.sh to permanently prevent this type of error in the future., Why this happens is that the maven test command can fail in such a way that no tests fails and yet not all the tests are run because of the failure.

Ideas:

1) Detect non-zero exit status for maven test command and -1 the patch.
2) File a long term fix that will -1 a patch if the number of tests has been [significantly] reduced, Reverting to the earlier logic in test-patch.sh that continues fail patches when the core-test fails to build., Manually tested change by
1) Successful build and tests still +1 core test
2) Successful build and failed tests -1 build with failures listed.
3) Failed build with no failed tests -1 build with build broken message., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12499588/HADOOP-7755.patch

This message is automatically generated., Hadoop QA still doesn't recognized patches in dev-support. Here are the test-patch results from my desk. Findbugs warnings are unrelated to the patch.

-1 overall.  

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 3 new or modified tests.
