[is this win32 bit or 64 bit machine..? Mostly it will be win32 platfrom, please confirm the same..

If it is win32 , please check this jira HADOOP-11425.., Thats correct I am trying to build Hadoop on Windows 7 (win32). I went thru
HADOOP-11425 but I dont see a clear direction. Need to l know what else is
to be setup so that I can complete build and start working on actual
implementation.

I am investing lot of time in building hadoop itself on window, I still
have not started my actual implementation work. Please help.

, Hello [~talk2gopijj],

AFAIK, Directly we can't compile hadoop code in win32, you may need do some extra steps  like following

1) Apply HADOOP-9922 patch.
2) install winsdk8.0 and visual studio-2013.

I am not pretty sure,you can try..

In the future please use a mailing list. JIRA is for reporting a bug.

Mailing list URL : http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html, We're working on adding the 32-bit build targets in HADOOP-9922.  I'm resolving this as duplicate.]
