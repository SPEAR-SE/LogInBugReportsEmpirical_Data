[Catch throwable and log it in error, More generally, in a bunch of hadoop code, only IOException are caught. (eg: same issue on DataNode.DataXceiveServer.run())

I think a little cleanup is needed, especially while catching an exception in a run() of a Thread..., Agreed. All threads should catch Throwable at the top level and log them. *Sigh* I thought we had gone through all of the threads and fixed that problem. If you see any more, please file them as bugs., I just committed this.  Thanks, Philippe!]
