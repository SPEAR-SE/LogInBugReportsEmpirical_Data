[The problem is due to trunk/.../contrib/chukwa.  In trunk/.../chukwa/lib, there are jar files duplicated  with trunk/lib., Remove duplicate jar files, Modify classpath to include Hadoop libraries., Apply the patch file to change Chukwa's classpath and execute the shell script to remove duplicate jar files, I just committed this. Thanks, Jerome!, Commons logging warnings still exist on the trunk. The warnings:
{noformat}
  [javadoc] javadoc: warning - Multiple sources of package comments found for package "org.apache.commons.logging"
  [javadoc] javadoc: warning - Multiple sources of package comments found for package "org.apache.commons.logging.impl"
{noformat}, I think these warnings are new and they are caused by failmon.  See HADOOP-3964, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #581 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/581/])]
