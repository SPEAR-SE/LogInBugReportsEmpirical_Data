[git bisect shows this was caused by HADOOP-15816.  Looks like the ZK threads are silently crashing on startup and that causes the thread blocked on successful startup to hang.
, It seems that the issue is CURATOR-409. CURATOR-409 is caused by ZOOKEEPER-2355 and this is in ZooKeeper 3.4.11.

There are 4 options to fix this problem:
 # Downgrade ZK to 3.4.10 or lower. This option is not recommended because of the ZK vulnerabilities.
 # CURATOR-409 is fixed in 4.0.0. Upgrade Curator to 4.0.0 or upper.
 # Ask Curator project to backport CURATOR-409 to 2.x and wait for the release.
 # Ask ZooKeeper project to fix unintentional override and wait for the next release., Upgrading Curator to 4.0.0 or upper does not fix this issue because if we are using ZK 3.4.x, Curator 2.x is still used for tests.

Upgrading Curator to 4.0.x *and* upgrading ZooKeeper to 3.5.x fix this issue.

Now I'm asking ZooKeeper and Curator community to fix this problem., We asked ZooKeeper and Curator communities and the summaries are as follows:
* ZooKeeper: This issue should be fixed in Curator project.
* Curator: Curator 2.x is EoL.

Now I'm planning to remove the usage of TestingQuorumPeerMain, or upgrade ZK and Curator., The situation has changed in CURATOR-409. Now I'm trying [https://github.com/risdenk/curator/tree/test-CURATOR-409-2.x]Â , I tried Curator 2.13.0 release candidate and the test succeeded. https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/959d9897e18ed628a46be06f2d4d2657b85998a2a083e0936f4bb0a9@%3Cdev.curator.apache.org%3E

I'll provide a patch to bump the curator version after 2.13.0 is released., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
