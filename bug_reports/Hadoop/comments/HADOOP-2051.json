In Christian's jobtracker.out file, I found this exception. This would make the thread go away., FindBugs is complaining that I'm catching Exception, which is precisely the point of this jira. *smile*

REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION: Exception is caught when Exception is not thrown

This method uses a try-catch block that catches Exception objects, but Exception is not thrown within the try block, and RuntimeException is not explicitly caught. 
It is a common bug pattern to say try { ... } catch (Exception e) { something } as a shorthand for catching a number of types of exception each of whose catch blocks is identical, but this construct also accidentally catches RuntimeException as well, masking potential bugs. 
{noformat}, Arun, could you please modify the patch to do "return" when InterruptedException is thrown by queue.take()., > FindBugs is complaining that I'm catching Exception, which is precisely the point of this jira.

Maybe you should catch Throwable instead?
