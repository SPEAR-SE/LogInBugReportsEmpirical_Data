[Uploaded a patch adding the entry., Hi Kai, no need for a separate JIRA to change CHANGES.txt, it's not code.
You can change the CHANGES.txt and commit log directly through git., Hmm, I'm not sure. It's hard to say CHANGES.txt is code or not. If you'd like to search or just access the following URL, you can get many issues for such things.
