[Did you try to set HADOOP_HOME=C:\hadoop-2.6.0?, yes i have done, it is basically related to winutils.exe . I didn't find compatible winutils.exe for my windows 32 bit system
, 
HADOOP-9922 has added support for WIN32 in Hadoop Common.
You can apply this patch and compile hadoop-common to get winutils.exe, [~GATI1978] did you try using the patch HADOOP-9922. If it solved your problem, let me know. Planning to close this issue., Hi Kiran, sorry for the delay. You can close the case. I have used it and it worked well. 

Thanks , HADOOP-9922 solves this issue. Closing as duplicate., how to apply the patch as I am using apache spark with hadoop 
so i cannt find any .diff or patch file , As I am using Apache Spark with Hadoop on Windows 7 32 bit .
And it is giving the same error of finding winutils.exe.
Then I tried to use the patch but I cannot apply that patch as Apache Spark does not have any .diff or patch file .
Please help me with this issue, Why have you re-opened this issue? Seems like you are having issue in applying patch. This you can easily find in git or diff guide.
Refer my comments in HADOOP-9922 on instructions to download and apply patch.

I will close this issue. You can also send a mail to Hadoop mailing list for help.]
