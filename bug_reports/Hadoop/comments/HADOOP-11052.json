[Moving this to common.  The real fix is to make verify exit on failure so that it matches the other verify functions.  At that point, the if statement can be removed from bin/hdfs as well., This is a trivial fix to the problem. Also fixed the bad logic for HADOOP_SECURE_COMMAND., Committed to trunk., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #672 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/672/])
