yes, that should be done. Infact I had that in my patch for HADOOP-775. If a tasks is killed/failed  the tasktracker does not need to maintain state (files/mapoutputs) for these tasks and should remove these tasks from RunningJobs and clean them up., Attached is a straight-forward fix..., +1, http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12346834/HADOOP-782_1_20061209.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r483772, I just committed this.  Thanks, Arun!]
