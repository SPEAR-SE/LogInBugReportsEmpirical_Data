[Ataching trivial patch.., Hey Arun, looks good, I think we can improve it a bit more by lazily opening the FileInputStream too. That way we save the open and the FD if the Random is never used., Good catch [~andrew.wang], updating patch.., +1 pending Jenkins, thanks Arun, \\

Manually tested and verified using *lsof* that no new file descriptors are created for */dev/urandom* when {{OsSecureRandom}} is initialized and {{setConf()}} is called.. only when a random bytes are requested.
