[This is occurring because the getConstructor method on Class changed between Java 5 and 6, from:

public Constructor<T> getConstructor(Class... parameterTypes)

to

public Constructor<T> getConstructor(Class<?>... parameterTypes)

This patch should fix the warning. I haven't managed to test it on Java 6 - Tahir, would you be able to try it please?, +1

, Thanks Tahir. I've now got Java 6 working which exposed a few more warnings. This patch fixes them. I've checked it with Java 5 too., I've just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #71 (See http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/71/)]
