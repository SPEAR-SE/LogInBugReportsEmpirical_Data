This message is automatically generated., Failed tests in patch verification are not anyhow related to the patch. They are likely failed due to flakiness.
The patch does not introduce any new tests because it should be tested with existing tests that use the downloaded "apacheds" server., This is no longer an issue due to the way that apacheds dependency is specified.]
