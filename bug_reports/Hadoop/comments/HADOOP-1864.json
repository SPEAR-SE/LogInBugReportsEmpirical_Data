[We are now raising our expectation for the fix. I've confirmed Java v1.6 does not solve this problem., We expect solution for both this issue and 2089. , Yiping,

This is clearly out of scope for Hadoop because Java uses its own zlib that does not handle >2GB jar files. There is another Jira issue pending that will allow .tgz files as cache archives (HADOOP-2019). Would that meet your needs ?, Milind,

Yes. Either this issue or 2019 should satisfy our requirement.]
