[This looks like a dupe of HADOOP-13051?, Thanks [~qwertymaniac]. Isn't this a dup of HADOOP-12436 which fixed the issue as a side effect? HADOOP-13051 only added a unit test., An old HADOOP-7222 "Inconsistent behavior when passing a path with special characters as literals to some FsShell commands" seems related.]
