, ping [~andrew.wang], since it looks like he did the commit that broke -Preleasedocs ., Do you know which commit this was off-hand? Else I can dig., It was one of them that got merged from the Yetus branch., I'm tempted to replace this with a wrapper to download releasedocmaker from yetus, since the one in trunk has other bugs. :(, I'm cool with that. My attempt at "fixing" would be to apply all the changes from Yetus.

Do we have a Yetus release yet? If not, could also pin to a given git hash., Not yet.  I'd rather do that when we have a release since I'll also nuke the other parts out of dev-support. But applying this patch and putting escapes in the one release note (HDFS-9278) that broke mvn site at least lets things build again., SGTM, +1 on this if you want to get this in. Thanks for fixing that release note too., Thanks! Committed to trunk, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8974 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8974/])
