[Actually, I think the resolve call must never return null. It should return _ /DEFAULT_RACK _ at a minimum (o.a.h.n.ScriptBasedMapping is implemented that way). So maybe, we should remove the null check., Attached patch sets the racks to DEFAULT_RACK when the script returns null and also logs whenever a block report is discarded., +1. code looks good., -1 overall.
