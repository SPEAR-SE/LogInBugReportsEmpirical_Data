[I think I found the reason at high level, after I put a return to avoid that permission setting, the job started with a localjobrunner and the result was written to the remote hdfs, which confused me for a while, since I had no knowledge of localjobrunner before. Now I realize that it's really that the JobClient wasn't initiated properly from the plugin xml conf, so without any mapred.job.tracker settings, it just started the localjobrunner. After I added the code:
    Configuration conf = new Configuration();
    conf.set("mapred.job.tracker", "[server]:9001");

It's working now. However. This configuration should be loaded from plugin's server configuration and it used to be working., This issue is related to submitting a job to a hadoop cluster from a client submitting a job on windows machine.

I have verified that the above work arounds solves the issue. Since there are other issue related to RawLocalFileSystem setpermission issues on windows, I am going to resolve this jira.]
