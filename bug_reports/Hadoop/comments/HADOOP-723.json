[You might want to use a temp file and rename strategy to make sure:

a) you only delete files you own
b) it is clear that a file was completely transfered by inspection.
c) temp files can be easily cleaned up in some conditions (restart say)
, Good catch. This is the cause of the FileNotFoundExceptions., This patch:
  1. Gives each map copier thread a unique id.
  2. Uses the id to generate unique names for the fetched files.
  3. Adds timeouts for the connect/read in getFile.
  4. Adds checks for interrupted in getFile.
  5. Add exception handlers inside the while loop of the map output copier threads and the map output lease thread.
  6. Add synchronization around the renames of the temporary files so that there aren't any race conditions.

We might consider putting this one into a 0.8.1 release., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
