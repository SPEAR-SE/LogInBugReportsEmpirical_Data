[It looks like the test-patch.properties file at the top level /dev-support needs to be updated to take into account each sub project.  6 of the warnings are from rumen, which never got built before.

Also the sub-project test-patch.properties need to be udpated too as common and hdfs have more then its actually generating., I had a look at this earlier - here's the patch I came up with. Note that we can remove all but the top-level test-patch.properties. Also, we still need to record the allowed number of javadoc warnings (6) since the ones resulting from use of com.sun packages cannot be easily suppressed., Minor thought. Can the greater-than check for warnings be changed to not-equal-to? This will give us better visibility, for example, when javadoc warnings are reduced in code but not in the properties file., This is really just a copy of Tom White's patch with the 6 allowable javadoc warnings set, and and -eq instead of a -gt.  All I really did was test this., Oops I forgot to remove a shortcut I added for testing.  This patch should be good., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, We got a funny "-1 javadoc. The javadoc tool appears to have generated -2 warning messages." in [HDFS-3369|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-3369?focusedCommentId=13271545&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13271545].  :)  What to do in order to fix it?, @Nicholas,

Well I really don't know for sure what caused this, but the difference in the javadoc warnings are the following two lines are missing in HDFS-3369.

{noformat}
[WARNING] hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/tools/offlineEditsViewer/XmlEditsVisitor.java:32: warning: com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.serialize.OutputFormat is Sun proprietary API and may be removed in a future release
[WARNING] /hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/tools/offlineEditsViewer/XmlEditsVisitor.java:33: warning: com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.serialize.XMLSerializer is Sun proprietary API and may be removed in a future release
{noformat}

The patch does not look like it did anything to fix the issues, so I really don't know why the disappeared.  HADOOP-8344 should hopefully help with this issue., There are compilation errors in HDFS-3369.  The javadoc check may be confused by them.

BTW, I think test-patch should stop immediately once it has found compilation errors.  It was the behavior previously if I remember correctly., I agree that test-patch should stop on compilation errors.  +1 for that., I filed HADOOP-8375.]
