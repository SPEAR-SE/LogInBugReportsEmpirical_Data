[Removed the second expression. First expression itself enough to findout the prefix., I've opted to toss smart-apply-patch because the whole reason it needs to do that work is, frankly, stupid when one can just re-run git for nearly the same cost. See my rewrite at HADOOP-12156 as part of Yetus., Re-write looks better. Do we have chance to port it back to trunk before Yetus is completed? or till then this patch can go in?
Because I am kind of blocked here, as latest patch on HDFS-7285 is not applying because of the above mentioned issue.
, (!) A patch to the files used for the QA process has been detected. 
Re-executing against the patched versions to perform further tests. 
The console is at https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/7140/console in case of problems., \\
