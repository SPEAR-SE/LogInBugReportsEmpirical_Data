[note that the nanotime is only guaranteed to be monotonic in code running in a single core: if the code is rescheduled onto a different core on the same CPU die, some parts have different clocks; if it runs on a core in a different socket there are no guarantees. So its only safe to use for calls where you don't think things will be blocked.

But: it's a lower cost query.

I'd recommend that if the processing time is negative —which will only happen on cross-core rescheduling—, its not added to the metrics. That way: the metrics aren't tainted, Bulk update: moved all 3.2.0 non-blocker issues, please move back if it is a blocker.]
