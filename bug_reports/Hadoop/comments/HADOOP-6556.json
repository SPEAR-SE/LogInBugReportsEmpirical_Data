[Additional changes needed to FileContext methods:
* isFile, isDir - should it throw notFoundException or return false if the path does not exist?
* deleteOnExit should return void instead of boolean.
, FileContext#delete and FileContext#copy should return void instead of boolean. On failure an appropriate exception should be thrown that details the failure instead of returning false. There could be other methods in FileContext too that need similar changes., FileContext#listStatus(Path[], ..)  should fail on any errors on any of the supplied paths., Another comment from HADOOP-6537 - listStatus(all variations), globStatus(??) - add the UnresolvedLinkE
, isFile, isDir no longer exist.
deleteOnExit: I am afraid we cannot be sure how much applications use it and expect return value from the ecosystem.
Seeing that it is a 7 years old ticket and it is an incompatible change I would close it as Won't fix.]
