This message is automatically generated., Hi Rajiv, I agree with you that we should config appropriate principles.  The thing is - shouldn't we support the use case where users just want to config short principles?   At least it is supported in 2.4.  We met the issue when we upgrade from 2.4 to 2.6.  The patch here is just fallback to the behavior of 2.4 when there is no principal like HTTP/host@REALM.]
