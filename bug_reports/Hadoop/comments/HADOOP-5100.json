Set append flag to true.

From log4j Doc API
  /**
     The <b>Append</b> option takes a boolean value. It is set to
     <code>true</code> by default. If true, then <code>File</code>
     will be opened in append mode by {@link #setFile setFile} (see
     above). Otherwise, {@link #setFile setFile} will open
     <code>File</code> in truncate mode.

     <p>Note: Actual opening of the file is made when {@link
     #activateOptions} is called, not when the options are set.
