[example fix attached., Hey Robert. Thanks for noticing the bug and the fix. It looks good to me.

Would you mind adding a simple unit test in ./src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/TestFileUtil.java? It seems like it should be trivial to mkdir a directory with a space in the path and try to create a symlink.

Also, when you generate a patch, best to generate it relative to the SVN root so the automatic patch tester can build it. Thanks!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2586 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2586/])
