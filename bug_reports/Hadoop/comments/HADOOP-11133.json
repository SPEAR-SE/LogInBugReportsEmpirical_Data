This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the JIRA Yi!
Is it possible to have a test with space and which will be trimmed proceed normally?, Thanks Uma for the review. In {{javakeystoreprovider.password}}, I edited it in Linux, so there is an additional {{LF}} at the end, and existing test {{testJksProviderPasswordViaConfi}} can cover the scenario., ok. In fact it is simple and straight forward change.

+1, I will commit it shortly.
