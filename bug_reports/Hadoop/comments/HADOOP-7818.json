Nit: the indenting on the new line is off, see the surrounding code, and the new test needs a newline before it, I'll fix these before committing, for future patches please indent according to the convention.

Thanks for contributing!, Actually, looking closer, testCheckDir_notExecutable is the same as the following test, it and the new test pass w/o this change. Can you come up with a change that fails w/o your fix and passes with it? Looks like there may be an issue with the mocking in the tests/_checkDirs., Also, not due to your change, but the checkDir header comment trails off, let's fix with something like:

{code}
-   * Create the directory if it doesn't exist and
+   * Create the directory if it does not exist, and check that dir is
+   * readable, writable and executable.
{code}
, Hi,
 The test-case is little confusing. As of now the test case never calls checkDir(File file) .It only calls checkDir on localFileSystem which already has executable check.Is this the correct test case to add the code or any other map/reduce test case call's this method?, I'd add another set of tests which uses the DiskChecker#checkDir(File) method, since you're right this one only tests the checkDir(LocalFileSystem, Path, FsPermission) method., updated patch with test cases and comment., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Eli, since you have the context of this jira, can you please review and commit the patch, if you have time? If you are busy, I will commit the patch., Please follow the coding conventions - http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/CodeReviewChecklist . I fixed it for other patches. Some examples:
# Please fix the indentation - {{if (!dir.canExecute)}} has an extra white space preceding it
# please name _checkDirs as checkDirs
# Please use space before and after "+"
# Catch should be in the same line as try blocks enclosing {

This message is automatically generated., Message "directory is not â€¦: " can be improved further. Can we not tell _what_ the role of the directory is? And Please also capitalize the sentence, for neatness' sake.

Remove the e.printStackTrace(); as well when you're at it.

Otherwise, looks good., I improved a little bit on your patch.
# Capitalized all the thrown messages
# Removed some unnecessary whitespace around the changes I made

I kept the strace-print since its still a test.
I do not think the role tip is possible, given this is a common class.

All tests pass, no other changes made:
