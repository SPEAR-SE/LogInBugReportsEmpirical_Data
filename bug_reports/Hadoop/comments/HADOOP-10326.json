[I also met with this issue today. Need to check with the patch any way. [~mdeferran] you want create and attach patch?, With the above mentioned change I am able to disctp data to S3 when security is enabled also., I encountered this bug while using DistCp to S3. The patch fixed the problem. Thanks!!!, [~mdeferran] - want to take a stab at this, post a patch?, The fix would work, but silently ignores the fact that we won't be using security. May be, we should add a config that users should enable to allow this, just so the users know what they are doing? , Patch from Manuel:

This patch seems to fix it.

{code}, Spoke to [~tucu00] and [~atm] offline. Both believe, YARN/MR and SecurityUtil should be agnostic to how the underlying filesystem handles tokens. The S3 client should handle ignoring these tokens. Moved to a Common JIRA to address that., Adding patch "0001-HADOOP-10326.-s3-s3n-does-not-support-tokens.patch". Tested on secure cluster, running distcp and wordcount against s3 data., Patch looks good to me. +1 pending Jenkins.

For some reason I can't seem to add bc as a Hadoop contributor at the moment. [~tucu00] - would you mind taking care of that in the JIRA admin console?, JIRA console funny, getting "The JIRA server could not be contacted.  This may be a temporary glitch or the server may be down." pop up when trying to add him, Yea, me too. Curious, but not a big deal. Can fix that up later., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
