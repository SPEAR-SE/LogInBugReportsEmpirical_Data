[looks like you've gone into a corner of the code nobody else has. 

Following the stack trace, its failing as a FS has to have a port if an authority is needed, and that is determined if uri.getAuthority()!=null, something that's not really the case in object stores. Now, for AbstractFS integration, HADOOP-11262, [~PieterReuse] had s3 declaring that it didn't need authority. Somehow view FS isn't picking it up, no doubt from this extra indirection

Pieter? Any thoughts]
