[This doesn't appear to be done for any hadoop-core artifacts. Javadoc artifacts are also not published. See [the search results|http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache.hadoop%22%20AND%20a%3A%22hadoop-core%22]. It really would be great to have this for future and past Hadoop releases., Created pull request to fix this issue for future 1.x releases: https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/pull/8]
