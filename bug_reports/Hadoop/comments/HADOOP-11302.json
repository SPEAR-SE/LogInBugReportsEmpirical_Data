[Attaching the patch., So, the reasoning behind final properties is that you might want to set a configuration key in one XML file and not have other XML files that are loaded later overwrite that key.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see why {{Configuration#set}} should honor final properties, since the same concerns don't apply there.  This is also a highly incompatible change that will break many people, since final properties in XML files have been around for a long time with the current behavior.  I'm sure it breaks a lot of our code as well, since there are places that assume that if the user sets an unreasonable value, the code can set a reasonable one, and so forth., Thanks for providing the background. But there is one thing I still don't understand. Let's say admin has created an XML file with some final properties to make sure that it does not get overridden. Now, what is the difference between a user loading his version of XML file by adding it as a resource and instead just programmatically overriding all properties using the set method? It seems like we are trying to protect against the first case and not the second case. That is why I thought this needed to be fixed., To be honest, I don't see the value in protecting against the second case.  If users want to load a configuration and modify it, they always can... if by no other way, then by making a copy with the differences they want.

{{final}} Configuration keys were about making XML files work better (for some definition of "better"...), OK. As per your comments, I am going to close this bug as not needed., Thanks, [~rkannan82].]
