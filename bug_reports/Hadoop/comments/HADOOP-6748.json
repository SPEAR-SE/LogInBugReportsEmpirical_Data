[As per [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-1542?focusedCommentId=12862574],

This message is automatically generated., I propose we get this into 0.21, otherwise we'll need a compatibility story for 0.22., The patch needs a very minor merge in the testcase, it doesn't apply cleanly. Otherwise, there is only a trivial improvement for the patch - please add/retain the javadoc for the existing constructor in HttpServer., 
Also to be forward compatible with changes planned in HADOOP-6715, can we change the exception message for invalid access to
{code}
 "User " + remoteUser + " is unauthorized to access this page.
 Access control list for this page: " + adminsAcl.toString() + "."
{code}
instead of the present message?, bq. can we change the exception message for invalid access ...
