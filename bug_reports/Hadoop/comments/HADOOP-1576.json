[I haven't been able to reproduce this, however I have a pretty good idea why this happens:

When the speculative task of an already completed {{TIP}} reports in to the JT as 'successful' the {{JobInProgress.completedTask}}   doesn't mark the task as {{KILLED}}, but as {{SUCCEEDED}} which leads to the above behaviour.

I'll continue test this patch and try to reproduce this, meanwhile I'd appreciate if Christian could help test this and any reviews..., Here is a patch which marks successful tasks of already completed TIPs as {{KILLED}}.

The jobdetails.jsp bug is captured separately in HADOOP-1594., Need an updated patch due to recent changes to trunk..., Updated patch, and fixes jobdetails.jsp too..., I'm guessing any failures will be due to TestSymLink (HADOOP-1596) ..., I just committed this.
