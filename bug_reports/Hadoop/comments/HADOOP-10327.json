+1., I can try this out on my Windows VM later.

[~vinayrpet], thanks for picking this up.  HDFS-5746 added {{TestSharedFileDescriptorFactory}}, {{TestDomainSocketWatcher}} and {{TestShortCircuitSharedMemorySegment}}.  Do you know if any of those tests are failing on Windows?  It looks like they're all set up to skip running on Windows, but I haven't confirmed yet.  I'll confirm when I review this patch., bq.
