[Rename member ._dict to ._hod_dict to remove conflict with identically named ConfigParser member., Hi, Jonathan.  I applied the patch cleanly to branch-1 and reviewed the code.  The changes look correct to me, just from the perspective of reviewing Python code.

I'm not generally familiar with HOD though, and I don't have a test environment ready to go for it.  To the wider community: is there a HOD expert out there who can take a look?, I am not an expert, but I downloaded and compiled Python 2.5.6 from python.org and tested HOD from 1.1.2 with my patch on our Torque cluster, and it appears to work in the same way as with Python 2.6.1.

I tested the "allocate", "deallocate", "list", and "info" HOD commands. I didn't test the "script" command because I'm just getting started with Hadoop and I don't know what the script should be or do.

All of these commands appear to work in the same way as with Python 2.5.6 and without the patch., +1 for the patch.  The change looks safe, and thank you for the thorough testing!

I couldn't assign the issue to you (so that you get credit for the patch).  When a committer picks this up, they'll need to take care of configuring your jira account as a contributor so that it can be assigned to you.]
