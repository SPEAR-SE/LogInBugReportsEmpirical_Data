[This is more of an INFRA ticket; Even http://www.alliedquotes.com/mirrors/apache/ does not list anything so that mirror is currently dead. We do not control the mirrors list ourselves downstream (i.e. here at Apache Hadoop)., From IRC, "hadoop can't do anything about it, and we have an automated system that detects+fixes it"., I raised it with infrastructure

# the mirror list is http://www.us.apache.org/mirrors/
# after 3 days it stops being suggested to anyone
# after 28 it is dropped off the mirror list at all

Alliedquotes has been down for 12 days, so it shouldn't be suggested as a default link -another two weeks and it won't get listed at all]
