[I'd be happy to work on this., Please review.

I also would like to see this back ported to the 2.8.0 branch., [~chelin] - thanks for reporting and working on this. Could you comment on any testing done to verify the patch works? , Sure

I've run the complete set of tests (mvn test) for MapReduce but also the Common, HDFS and Yarn, with both surefire 2.18.1 and 2.17 without any regressions between the two different versions.but also no regressions compared to the HEAD of trunk.

, This appears to be a subtle change to the semantics of probably one of the most important APIs in Hadoop.  I don't think it's a backward compatible change that can go into branch-2.  So, at least for me, I'd be against it., Sorry if I'm missing something, but IIUC that surefire change affects parsing of java system properties when running a test. Why are the fixes happening in Configuration, vs. in a test class or the pom or something?, [~andrew.wang] So one of the changes in Surefire pertains to how it treat null value properties what it does is that it takes these system properties and turns them into empty strings. 

[~aw] I agree that there is a change in semantics, I was unable to figure out though how these were supposed to work in the case of substitueVars, as the documentation states:

{panel}
Value strings are first processed for variable expansion. The available properties are:

1) Other properties defined in this Configuration; and, if a name is undefined here,
2) Properties in System.getProperties().
{panel}

which appears to be completely reversed to how the current implementation actually works? As for the getBaseLogDir() the difference between null and "" is:

- "" will be treated as the root of the filesystem, '/'
- null will be treated as the current working directory

, I talked with [~chelin] about this offline, seems pretty complex. Charlie's current thinking is that surefire is somehow passing some properties incorrectly when running in fork mode, leading to some expected variables like hadoop.log.dir being unset, and then us running into this surefire behavior change. That sounds like a more fundamental issue than null vs. {{""}}. The cleaner fix seems like setting these variables properly rather than relying on null/{{""}}/default parsing, and will avoid modifying non-test and non-pom code.

Thanks again to [~chelin] for the discussion and working on this issue., \\

This message was automatically generated., Nice, this pom change fixes it? Only nit is that we should keep test.build.dir with its comment, broken by the reordering, i.e.:

{noformat}
<!-- TODO: all references in testcases should be updated to this default -->
<test.build.dir>${test.build.dir}</test.build.dir>
{noformat}, Yeah the fixes to the POM appears to do the trick.

Ahh, yes fixing!, \\
