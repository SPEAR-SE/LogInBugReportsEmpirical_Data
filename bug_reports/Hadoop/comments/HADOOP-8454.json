[Patch attached., +1, looks good Chuan. Make sure to cover this case in tests for HADOOP-8453., ran patch through dos2unix, @[~sanjay.radia] Thanks! I only converted source files to Unix format, but did not notice the patch itself also saved in DOS format. I will run patches through dos2unix in the future., Reviewed and committed patch to Hadoop-1 windows branch.
