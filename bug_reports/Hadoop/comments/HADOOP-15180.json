[This problem will come when there are no blocks to move(i.e exiting the balancer immediately)
I am planning to fix like below
1.Putting sleep
 {code}

    if [ $command = "balancer" ]; then
    sleep 20;
    fi
{code}
2.Redirecting to seperate file

would like to provide the patch for same., This seems to be issue with all daemons started using hadoop-daemon.sh in branch-2.

Changing the title., Correct fix would be to create the daemon's out file by using the "redirection with append" in +hadoop-daemon.sh+ as mentioned below
