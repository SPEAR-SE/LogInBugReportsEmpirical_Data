This message is automatically generated., Yarn tasks are supposed to load the credentials into the conf, and then job submission is supposed to write them back out from the conf.  It's supposed to be transparent.  This patch is assuming private knowledge of the aforementioned inner workings by hardcoding a yarn env var ({{ApplicationConstants.CONTAINER_TOKEN_FILE_ENV_NAME}}), and hardcoding a mapreduce conf key ({{MAPREDUCE_JOB_CREDENTIALS_BINARY}}).

Are you sure the conf isn't being mishandled which is losing the tokens?

, Hello, Daryn. Thanks so much for reviewing the fix.

I'm pretty sure that DistCp handles tokens correctly. This code-path was introduced purely for the case where DistCp is invoked via Oozie. I wish there were another way to transfer delegation-tokens from Oozie's launcher over to DistCp. (This is also the way Pig and Hive actions work in Oozie.), Actually, the fact that multiple projects need to make a similar change is indicative of a bug in the core.  The passing along of tokens should be an invisible service provide by the hadoop security framework.  Distcp and other tools should not know or care whether it's being run via a real user, proxy user, via oozie, or something else.

I briefly investigated a bit more, and the env var actually originates from UGI which internally uses it to automatically load the tokens, hence tools should not know about this internal implementation detail of UGI.  I think the issue is the tokens are being loaded into the login user instead of the real user.  I believe no tool will require changes if the UGI is modified to load the tokens into the real user., I think this one-liner should "fix" the problem, but it's completely untested.  I think the whole token file handling needs to analyzed and cleaned up on a separate jira., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This is actually caused by multiple bugs:
# MR job submission requests tokens it already has
# MR job submission doesn't always pass all tokens (JHS, MR, HIVE, etc)
# Oozie is using a devious way to detect the exit code of an action

Details:
# The reported exception occurs when a task tries to get tokens it ALREADY has.  Job submission gets missing tokens for input/output paths and adds them to the UGI for RPC connections.  Job submission doesn't check the UGI, so it doesn't think it has the token, thus requests another.  The NN connection uses the token that the job doesn't think it has!  The NN squawks that you can't use a token to get a token.
# Similarly, distcp also does some prep work to acquire tokens prior to job submission.  So again, a task tries and fails to get the tokens it already has....  Invoking a command like distcp directly will "work" (masks the bug) because it uses the TGT to get another token even if it already has one in the UGI.
# Job submission doesn't appear to propagate non-FS/MR tokens in the task's UGI into the new job submission.
# Oozie uses a security manager to intercept an action's System.exit, throws a SecurityException containing the exit code, and later catches that exception to determine success/failure.  Devious!  Distcp calls System.exit(0) inside a try block which catches oozie's SecurityException, logs it, and then calls System.exit(-999), again generating an oozie SecurityException.  Due to the try/catch, distcp will ALWAYS appear to fail.

Solutions:
* #1,2,3: Seeding Job with existing UGI tokens
* #4 Distcp calls System.exit OUTSIDE of the try block

I seeded the Job's credentials with the existing UGI tokens because it seems unreasonable to require all apps that launch jobs to be aware of running as a task.

This message is automatically generated., Approach LGTM. Regarding the devious way for Oozie to trap System.exit() calls, it is the only way we found we could use tools that don't have a programmatic entry point but the main() method,  and relay on System.exit() to indicate success/failure., Daryn, are you planning to write a testcase to complete the patch?, How about s/devious/diabolically clever/? :) I can't think of another way to do it either.

Yes, currently writing tests., Add a bunch of tests.  Corrected {{NamedToken}}'s equality impl., Marking as blocker since distcp and other apps that launch jobs can't work under oozie., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
