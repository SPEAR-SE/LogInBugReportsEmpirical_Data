[Here are some preliminary diffs for the FSDataInputStream#isEncrypted doc and the AbstractConcreteOpenTest update. There is no equivalent to fsdatainputstream.md for the output side. The closest is filesystem.md. Let me know where you think the FSDataOutputStream doc should go.
, This patch adds the test case to AbstractConcreteOpenTest, and sections on FSDataInput/OutputStream.isEncrypted() to filesystem.md and fsdatainputstream.md., This looks good, though if there are plans to extend {{FileStatus}} with some encrypted flag, that should be integrated in the spec.

e.g if the status says "encrypted" then the stream's {{isEncrypted()}} flag must  be true, and vice-versa.

This could then be added as a new test for all filesystems, HDFS and non-HDFS.

Also, though it could be a separate JIRA, I'd like to see the contract tests for the Crypto support. HADOOP-11042 shows that it isn't consistent with HDFS, something those tests would have thrown up., One more thing, does {{isEncrypted()}} issue any guarantees about encryptedness. e.g if it is true, does it guarantee that some form of non-trivial encryption has been applied?

 Maybe say

The encryption mechanism may be specific to the filesystem and the specific installation of the FS; no guarantees of quality can be made. {{isEncrypted()==true}} does not guarantee that the file cannot be read by others, merely that some form of encryption has been applied.

Similarly {{isEncrypted()==false} does not imply the file is unencrypted â€”it may be a filesystem-wide encryption system such as an encrypted hard drive, an encryption that is not visible to the Hadoop FS APIs., The doc changes were included in HDFS-6843., Closing old tickets that are already shipped in a release.]
