This message is automatically generated., +1 looks good to me., A further test shows that rename-onto-self can play up; need to incorporate this into the patch too with a src.equals(dst) check, This turns out to be harder than expected because of the requirement for POSIX return codes.

#rename file->file = true
#rename dir->dir = false
Also, we need to check the destination after the full destination is calculated, not upfront, so that when the full pathname is calculated as parent+filename, the equality check needs to be made then. 
# rename (path/file,path) returns true (shortcutting the copy)
# rename (path/dir, path) fails 
, There's enough changes here that we do need rigorous review.
The previous patch saw copy-onto-self and bailed out early -but these checks were made before the destination path was fully generated -because if you specify a destination directory, the source goes in under there. Which means you could set the dest dir to be the parent of the source file, so generating a rename(src, src) after the equality check had taken place -a rename that would return false.
Now the value is checked once up front -for fast exit without talking to S3, and then just before the operation actually takes place.
I also added lots of inline comments to make it clearer what is going on., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
