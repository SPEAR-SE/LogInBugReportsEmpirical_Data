[* refactor getLeaf a bit

* the exception getLeaf() throws for an invalid Node now includes the offending Node as a string, and a helpful error message.

, Patch for trunk and test case in TestNetworkTopology?, * Add unit test of rejecting a bad topology with a sane error message, rebase patch against trunk, attach branch-1 variant, - Why report the entire topology as json in the message? This string is likely to be very big on a real cluster right? Probably better to make that accessible via the NN web UI (can punt to a separate change)
- An error message like "Invalid network location for Datanode: Datanode given rack-level network location can not be at rack-level" is probably more clear than referencing class names not visible to the user
- In testCreateInvalidTopology in the catch clause let's assert the contents of 
e.getMessage, ie that it indicates that h3 is the bad node
- How about adding test cases for other invalid toplogies (eg 3 or 4 level deep topology, null, empty string)
- Nit: bracket for catch InvalidTopologyException goes on the same line

, address eli's comments, The 1st, 3rd, and 4th bullets still need addressing, otherwise looks great. , * validate exception text in test

* don't put topology text into exception-- just log it.

* simpler, less invasive change which just checks invariants in NetworkTopology::add, Looks great

Two nits:
- The invalid topo exception references "data node" but can be used for MR too. Can just say "node".
- Let's define INVALID_LEVEL = -1 and use that (can put next to DEFAULT_HOST_LEVEL).
