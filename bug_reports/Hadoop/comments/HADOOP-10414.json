This message is automatically generated., I manually verified that the updated parameter in hadoop-policy.xml matches what's in the source code. I don't think a test is needed., I agree - no test needed for this simple fix.

+1, the patch looks good to me. I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
