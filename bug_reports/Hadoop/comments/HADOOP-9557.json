This message is automatically generated., +1 (non-committer)! This is also required for submitting jobs via LocalJobRunner from, for instance, Eclipse. I've seen it used to do this quite a lot, and the inclusion has not caused any problems in my experience. I've been unable to track down the original reason for the exclusion., Can anyone please review/commit this., +1 (non-committer), +1 for the patch.  I'll commit this.

No tests are required, because it is a change in the build.  I tested manually by running the build and verify that the exclusion was not present in the resulting artifact., I have committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.1-beta.  Lohit, thank you for the contribution.  Also, thanks to Sean and Sangjin for code reviews., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4413 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4413/])

, This appears to allow in http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/ which has been end of life for a while. I believe this is creating potential runtime errors in the use of the replacement (http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/). ]
