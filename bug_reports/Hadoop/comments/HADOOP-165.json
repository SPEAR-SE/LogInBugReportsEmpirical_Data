[Can you please try placing 'Server.LOG.setLevel(Level.FINE);' in the tasktracker and 'Client.LOG.setLevel(Level.FINE);' in the child.  That should provide some details about where the delay(s) are.
, I guess I should have made it clear that most of the times aren't this bad. This is the head of a long list. For example, the tail of the ping times look like (count, time):

      2 134
      1 123
      1 116
      1 108
      1 101
      1 79
      1 62
      1 56
      1 55
      1 37
      1 30
      1 15
      1 12
      2 4
     11 3
     90 2
    312 1
   9836 0

so by far most of the pings take 0 or 1 ms to execute., Did fixing HADOOP-160 help this any?, This has been fixed primarily by moving the pulling part of the shuffle from the task tracker to the reduce's jvm. Previously, we saw task trackers burning 100% cpu and now it is much better.]
