[Code coverage reports provided by Clover runs (e.g. [here|https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk/clover] show the information about covered classes, methods, and so on.
However, no tests info is shown. It simply says

Apparently, Clover can't find and instrumented any tests classes in the source code. 
Same issues is found in HDFS and MR., Fix for the problem, Patch for y20-security (should work for 0.20 branch as well)., I have ran patched build and can confirm that it works both for 0.20 branch and  0.22 Common - all tests are running as expected (some are failing, but they are failing for a long time). There's no way to verify it via {{test-patch}} so I think it just has to be committed as is. , +1 Looks good.
Tested on 0.21 and 0.22, I have committed this to the trunk and 0.21.

This chance requires Clover 3.0+ to be used for test coverage runs., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #395 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/395/])
