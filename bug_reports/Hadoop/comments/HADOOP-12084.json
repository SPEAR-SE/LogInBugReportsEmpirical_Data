[I see the class name being {{com.suning.cybertron.superion.util.FSDownload}} which is not same as FSDownload in Hadoop distribution. Is the code same ?, This looks like an issue with {{FTPFileSystem}} implementation. It should not be setting the configuration in {{initialize()}}., yes.it's same, Ok...I have moved the issue to HADOOP common from YARN and also updated the issue. You can change the description. This would need a fix in {{FTPFileSystem}}., GitHub user RebornHuan opened a pull request:
