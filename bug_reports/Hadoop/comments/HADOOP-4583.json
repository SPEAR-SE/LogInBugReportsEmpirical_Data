[Thanks Nicholas for pointing out, GenerationStamp cannot be reused. But the Block object can be reused., >Instead of getting the edit stream length in termination condition, a local variable should be used to do the same

Won't the Java compiler do this on its own?, I am not sure if the method call in termination condition is optimized. I know that loops may be optimized from condition < len to condition <= 0. Based on the tests I ran, moving the method call out of terminating condition improves the performance., Codes look good but the patch is out dated.  Need sync with trunk., New patch uploaded.
