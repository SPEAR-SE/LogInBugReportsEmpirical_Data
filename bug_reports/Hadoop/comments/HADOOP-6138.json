Does anyone know why we got "-1 release audit."?, Looks like it was jdiff, which shouldn't really be checked by RAT. (Correct link is http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch-vesta.apache.org/575/artifact/trunk/patchprocess/releaseAuditDiffWarnings.txt, see also HADOOP-5935.) , Thanks Tom for the info.

No new tests needed because the changes is simple.  I will commit this soon., I have committed this.  Thanks, Yongqiang!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk #30 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk/30/])
