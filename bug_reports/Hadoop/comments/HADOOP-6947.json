[There is no automatic test capability for keytab logins, so I wrote a manual test that can be run in a kerberized environment. The test takes as arguments the paths and principals for two separate keytabs and tries to login as each in turn and verify the resulting UGI.

Without the refreshKrb5Config option, it fails with this error:
