[Patch that includes unit tests which demonstrate the issue., FWIW, I discovered this issue when I started leveraging the code in HadoopScheduledThreadPoolExecutor for an external project. I made a few unsuccessful attempts to fix the issue in the code as it's currently implemented, but in the end found that it was a lot easier to just re-implement HadoopScheduledThreadPoolExecutor and HadoopThreadPoolExecutor to just wrap all submitted Runnables and Callables with a wrapper which catches and logs any exception thrown from the underlying Runnable/Callable. 

This is the approach that I would suggest here -- if that sounds good, let me know and I'll add a patch to do this.]
