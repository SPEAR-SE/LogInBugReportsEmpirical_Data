[Do you think it should be synchronized on the DataInput or on the writable itself? It seems to me it would be the responsibility of the one calling read to ensure synchronization, not the writable's., I agree with Todd; the caller is responsible for thread safety., I agree with Todd too. Like the java.util Container classes, it is better for the calling context to enforce the proper level of locking.]
