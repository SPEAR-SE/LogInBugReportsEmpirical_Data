[Nice addition, but are you sure the examples work?  Historically I've seen exceptions if a curly-braced list contains a /.  Also, some of the expansion look wrong, at least with respect to the shell.  Ex. "{a/b,c/d,{e,f}}     - a/b, c/d, {e,f}" should expand as "a/b, c/d, e, f", {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

bq. Nice addition, but are you sure the examples work? Historically I've seen exceptions if a curly-braced list contains a /. Also, some of the expansion look wrong, at least with respect to the shell. Ex. "{a/b,c/d,{e,f}} - a/b, c/d, {e,f}" should expand as "a/b, c/d, e, f"
Daryn, I cannot be wrong :-)

I just took it out of TestGlobExpander#testExpansion(). The document could be even better with perhaps more examples. But this is a good start., +1 I hope you can find a way to forgive me for doubting you :), I committed the patch to trunk., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2919 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2919/])
