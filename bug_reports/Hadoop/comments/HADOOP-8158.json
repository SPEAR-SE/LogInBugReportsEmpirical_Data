[I recently heard of a related case. According to Rohini who has dealt with this problem in the past, the delete issued after failed/interrupted create may also fail due to a short NN outage. In this case, the lease is kept being renewed and normal retry won't work. It appears the client-side lease handling needs a bit of improvement., @Kihwal
I think that case can actually be handled.  {{IOUtils.copyBytes}}, even when passed the close-stream flag, does not appear to reliably close the streams...  The {{try}} block that deletes the temp file can also close the stream if it's open.

@Todd
I think is actually an issue {{FileSystem}} since {{FsShell}} doesn't get a chance to cleanup when SIGINT blows it out of the water.  The FS shutdown hook is going to delete all temp files (ie. copy in progress file), and then call {{DFSClient#close}} which will close the stream to the temp file after it has been deleted.  Trying to do signal handling in java seems a bit messy, so may the shutdown hook behavior could be modified., It looks like a combination of {{FsShell}} possibly deleting an open stream, plus {{DistributedFileSystem}} trying to delete tmp files (that might be open) before closing open streams., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Need to investigate the odd failure of org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.TestPersistBlocks that may be related., I applied patch locally and ran the tests a few times continuously but always received success:

Seems like a transient failure.
