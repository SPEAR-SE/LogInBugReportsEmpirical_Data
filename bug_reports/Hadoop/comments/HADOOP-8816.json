[128K as header buffer size seems a bit too big. 

Could this be related to this? http://www.novell.com/communities/node/11516/kerberos-authentication-may-fail-access-manager-identity-server-users-large-group-members

Would be possible to get the actual header size that is making things to fail?
, Also, if we tweak the header buffer size, we should doing it in a configurable way. , No, Kerberos tokens do not contain group membership information, but tend to get pretty large, 4-8k base64 encoded.
I guess 16kb header size would be enough.

Making that configurable is your choice, I personally wouldn't as I know no things that cause header sizes larger than Kerberos, but then if it was configurable already this ticket wouldn't exist.
, attached is a patch that changes the header buffer size to 64kb.

32kb is the highest suggested value that I found in the following pages that deal with the same problem:
https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/ALF-13810
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42003

I know no disadvantages of a higher header buffer size limit.

How about adding a comment to the test where you check the 63kb length that the buffer size set is for ALL headers which is why you're only adding a 63kb header when the limit is 64kb (leaving 1kb room for other headers).  No need to spin a new patch for just adding this comment IMO., Thanks Mortiz.

, I pulled this back into 23.  We may want to consider marking this an incompatible or making it a config option because the new 64K buffer causes the tests to hang on OS X, whereas it's fine up to 32K.  I haven't debugged why yet., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #553 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/553/])
