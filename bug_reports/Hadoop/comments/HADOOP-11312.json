This message is automatically generated., Though I think this patch fixes the tests in question, I think there may still be more to fix, e.g. TestRpcProgramNfs3, TestEncryptionZonesWithKMS, and TestReservedRawPaths.

Andrew, could you please look into those as well? Thanks much., Thanks for looking ATM, one more try. I checked through one of our internal test runs, and I think your additional enumeration is complete., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Maybe we can add this to the jira description area?

Thanks.
, I filed HDFS-7405 for the TestDatanodeBlockScanner error, since it happens on trunk for me also. The rest passed for me locally.

Could I get a re-review?, Also, Yongjun I think your comment will suffice for JIRA searchability :) no need to edit the description., +1, the latest patch looks good to me.

Thanks for taking care of this, Andrew., Thanks Andrew, I looked at the patch, it looks good. 

One minor comment, TestKMS.java uses string ".ALL" at quite a few places (for the key), And similarly ".MANAGEMENT", ".READ" etc appear in other code.
It'd be nice if we have this kind of string defined as constant in KeyAuthorizationKeyProvider, in parallel with 
{code}
public enum KeyOpType {
    ALL, READ, MANAGEMENT, GENERATE_EEK, DECRYPT_EEK;
  }
{code}
but it's ok to defer this to later.
Thanks.

, Thanks for reviewing ATM and Yongjun, I've committed this to trunk and branch-2., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6567 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6567/])
