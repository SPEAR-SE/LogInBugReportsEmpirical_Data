[Fixes all instances I could find of the wrong class being provided to the logger.  This seems like something Findbugs or another static analysis tool should catch., * I think some of these are intentional. The metrics logs should go to the same place, that the Child logs to the TaskTracker log is deliberate, as are the test cases for filters. A few of the others make some sense, though they do look suspicious.
* This should use the version of getLog taking a class, not a String, to avoid exactly this issue., Based on comments, 
   * Changed the metrics so they're all pointing at the base class, instead of individual classes
   * Eliminated correction of intentional 'wrong' logger
   * Changed all of the logger instantiations to use the class rather than a string, > I noticed the wrong class was being provided for the logger instantiation (LOG = LogFactory.getLog(UserGroupInformation.class, should be LogFactory.getLog(PermissionChecker.class););.  Probably a copy-and-paste mistake.

Actually, I did this on purpose: so that we could grep "UserGroupInformation" for all the permission related log messages.  I am fine if you want to change it., This is an incompatible change since it changes the log output.  I am not sure whether this is a good thing to do since it may break client scripts which read log messages as input., Based on Nicholas' recommendation, not going to fix.  Closing.]
