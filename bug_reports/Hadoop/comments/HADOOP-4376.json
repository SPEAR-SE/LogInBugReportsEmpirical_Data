[Although this is quite trivial, I marked it as blocker to be included in 0.19 (can also be considered as documentation improvement).

 , Attaching patch. No need to submit through hudson. , I just committed this. Thanks, Enis!, The formatting in hadoop-default.xml are not consistent, even after the patch.  One example is dfs.namenode.logging.level.

There are mainly two styles, (1) no EOL within a paragraph and (2) having EOL within a paragraph.  It is not clear me that which one we should use.  (2) is more human readable but (1) is more machine readable.  Since this is xml, there are probably programs reading the descriptions and output them to other formats.  Personally, I like (1) better.

I probably is too late to comment here.  Thank you for working on this.  :), Actually, (1) or (2) did not bothered me as much as the lines longer than 80 chars. I guess we can live with these.  , Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #634 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/634/])
