This message is automatically generated., [~cnauroth], since you were looking at KMS supportability issues. Wondering if you think this is worth getting in ?, Sorry, it's not clear to me why this results in {{UndeclaredThrowableException}}.  Is there any additional context in the stack trace?, Don't remember the specifics (since its been a while since I filed it). But it looks like it can be thrown by {{UGI#doAs()}}

In anycase, what happens is :
# On the client side, the {{DelegationTokenAuthenticator}} uses the {{KerberosAuthenticator}} to start the SGNEGO authentication of the real user (yarn).
# On the server side, this is intercepted by the {{DelegationTokenFilter}} which uses the {{KerberosHandler}} to authenticate yarn, but control is then passed back to the {{DelegationTokenFilter}} which also checks the proxy config which fails authentication of the proxy user.
# Unfortunately this happens at the filter layer (before control is passed to Jersey) so the {{KMSExceptionProvider}} is not invoked to log this exception.
# Back at the client side, the {{KerberosAuthenticator}} thinks authentication has failed because it was a kerberos issue (which it is not), and throws away the Exception and message, and control passed back to the {{DelegationTokenAuthenticator}}, which tries the {{PseudoAuthenticator}} which also fails.
# All this happens inside a {{UGI.doAs}} which only knows about a PrivilegeActionException, but since another CheckedException was thrown, this is sent back as an {{UndeclaredThrowableException}}

The fix I had posted essentially patches the DelegationTokenFilter to add an extra header in the response when Authentication has failed due to a bad proxy config. This header will then be intercepted by the KerberosAuthenticator which throws it back as a proper IOException (with the correct error message), [~asuresh], thank you for the explanation.

The problem as I understand it is that we would like in addition to the HTTP 403 Forbidden response, some kind of "sub-status" that provides more details about why there was a 403 response.  In this specific case, it's a proxy user misconfiguration, but perhaps there could be other kinds of problems too.  It seems unusual to use a custom HTTP header for this.  It seems more typical to encode that kind of information into the HTTP response body.  Do you think that would be feasible?

I'd prefer that we also get one more code reviewer on this patch in addition to me.  I have always found the error handling around this code to be pretty complex., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, [~cnauroth], I agree adding a response header for this particular case seems a-typical, and to be honest, am not much in favor of it as well..
The patch and JIRA was motived by me spending quite some time debugging an issue on a running cluster :)

But in any case, I think we need to find a better way to surface these errors meaningfully to end users. I quess I will keep the JIRA open till I find a better way to dealing with this.
