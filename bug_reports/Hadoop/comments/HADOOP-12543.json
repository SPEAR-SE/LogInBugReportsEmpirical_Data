[I think the method should be like the attached patch. I tested it only in a Linux environment., What happens in the case when you're in /tmp and create a Path from ".."?, Hi, thanks for the comment.

{{new Path(new Path("/tmp"), new Path(".."))}} equals {{new Path("/")}}. {{new Path("/").isRoot()}} equals true. This is OK.

The behavior for relative path is misreading. {{new Path("..").getParent()}} equals {{new Path(".")}}.  {{new Path(".").isRoot()}} always return true in the current implementation.

A Path class object doesn't know the working directory. It can not say whether it repesents the root directory for relative path.

Just seeing the method name and the comment, I misunderstood it returns true iif the path is "/". ]
