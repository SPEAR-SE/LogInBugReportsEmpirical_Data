{noformat}, Looks fine. Minor nits:

- Typos in Javadocs: initializatino should be initialization. threasd should be threads
- Also, it is better to mention the units of the INITIALIZATION_THREAD_POLLING_INTERVAL in the Javadoc itself.
, Attaching patch correcting typo's and incorporating Hemanth's comments., 2 minor comments.
- _assertTrue()_ in the catch block is not needed.
- typo : _miliseconds_ should be _milliseconds_.
