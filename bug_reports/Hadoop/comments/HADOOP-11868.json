This change is related to logging so there is no need for tests., +1. While this jira is regarding a custom KerberosAuthenticationHandler, I agree with the excessive logging. Failing to login shouldn't cause an exception. Exceptions in the log should be confined to unexpected conditions that are unhandled.

, [~jlowe] could you please help do a final review of this patch and help commit it? Thanks, +1, committing this., \\
