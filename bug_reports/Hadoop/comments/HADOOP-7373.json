[This also applies to the hadoop-daemons.sh when it is looking up slaves.sh, This patch fixes hadoop-config.sh to use a different variable name, so that the other scripts don't get their environment clobbered., We can probably remove the entire block for 0.20.20x:

{noformat}
# convert relative path to absolute path
bin=`dirname "$this"`
script=`basename "$this"`
bin=`cd "$bin"; pwd`
this="$bin/$script"
{noformat}, I think you'll need these if you want the init scripts to run on boot., +1 looks good, thanks Owen., It looks like trunk didn't have the problem., Hadoop 0.20.204.0 was released today.]
