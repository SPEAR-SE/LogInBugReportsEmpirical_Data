This message is automatically generated., Hey Jun, what Java version are you using?, This appears to be a type inference quirk that can arise in some javacs and eclipse; it isn't in openjdk7 or java 1.6.0_51, or -clearly- whatever jenkins is using. This patch doesn't break any of those, and as it fixes Jun's build:

+1 -after I fix the findbugs

, Hi Steve, I am still using an old version Oracle/Sun JDK 1.6.0_22. Shall I turn to something new like 1.7.0_15? 
Yes. I just verified that build on trunk works fine now on my env. Thanks for review and get this patch in., btw, just check this error again and seems like the root cause is the bug of JDK: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6302954, which is fixed in 1.7 and backport to several 1.6 rev versions. , FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #347 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/347/])
