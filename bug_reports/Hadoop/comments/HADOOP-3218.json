[How about moving it to the FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath() from the RecordWriter?, This check is necessary to avoid temporary files getting created by speculative tasks when the job is already complete. 
Please see http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2391?focusedCommentId=12566183#action_12566183

This check can be removed once HADOOP-2759 (creating a file in hdfs should not automatically create the parent directories) goes in.
, This shouldn't be removed, given Amareshwari's comment.]
