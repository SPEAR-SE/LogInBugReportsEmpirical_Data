[Here's a log from a run that failed., Dhruba and I looked similar output. The problem is that close(DFS_FILE) waits for dfs.replication.min to be satisfied before returning. But this test requires all replicas to be present. For this test, may be we could set dfs.replicaion.min to same as max. This test is done right after closing the file.
