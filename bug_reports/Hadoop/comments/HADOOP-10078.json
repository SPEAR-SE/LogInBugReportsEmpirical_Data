, After HADOOP-10078, oozie kill/suspend and proxyUser service throw "user[?] null" error under non-secure environment while not using auth-token file. The root cause is that Kerberos Authenticator fails to fall back to PseudoAuthenticator to set the token for user, therefore the server side code doesn't know who the user is., [~tucu00], can you please responds to [~bowenzhangusa]?, [~tucu00], can you please take a look?, I filed HADOOP-10398 for fixing the problem Bowen reported.]
