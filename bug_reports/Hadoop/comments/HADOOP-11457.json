Make sense. [~rkellogg], would you please remove it?, Removed my existing installation of FindBugs and Windows FINDBUGS_HOME environment variable.  When done, it generates the following error message:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-antrun-plugin:1.7:run (site) on project hadoop-common: An Ant BuildException has occured: stylesheet C:\hadoop-2.6.0\hadoop-common-project\hadoop-common\${env.FINDBUGS_HOME}\src\

Upon reviewing my Maven repository, it appears it has downloaded:

com.google.code.findbugs.findbugs 1.3.9
com.google.code.findbugs.findbugs 1.3.9
org.codehaus.mojo.findbugs-maven-plugin - 2.3,2

No signs of FindBugs 3.0.0 using automatic download.

Please confirm you are seeing similar behavior.

com.google.code.findbugs.findbugs 1.3.9
com.google.code.findbugs.findbugs-ant 1.3.9
org.codehaus.mojo.findbugs-maven-plugin - 2.3,2, During the preparation of the site (in hadoop-project-dist\pom.xml), the default.xsl located in the FINDBUGS_HOME directory is used.

<xslt style="${env.FINDBUGS_HOME}/src/xsl/default.xsl"

                          out="${project.build.directory}/site/findbugs.html"/>

It appears the default.xsl file exists embedded within the findbugs-1.3.9.jar file., {quote}

Hadoop 2.6.0 uses the above versions, but trunk and branch-2 now use FindBugs 3.0.0.

Removed my existing installation of FindBugs and Windows FINDBUGS_HOME environment variable. When done, it generates the following error message:
{quote}
What command did you execute? I did not reproduce the error after removing {{FINDBUGS_HOME}} environment variable., Used the following command:

    mvn package -Pdist,native-win,docs,src -DskipTests -Dtar

I assume you did not include the docs profile.  As such I don't think you would have seen the error.
, Awaiting consensus., Removed references to FindBugs.  The Maven FindBugs Plugin automatically downloads this dependency., Confirmed that against trunk the downloaded version of the Maven FindBugs Plugin & FingBugs jar files were indeed 3.0.0 as previously stated.

Against Hadoop 2.6.0 FindBugs must be installed and the FINDBUGS_HOME environment variable must be set in order to build the site (-Psite).  If one does not build this profile, FindBugs can safely be ignored., Thank you for the comment, [~rkellogg]. I could reproduce the error.
I'm thinking it would be better to remove the dependency first.
# Create a .xsl file in the source tree.
# Fix pom.xml to use the file instead of default.xsl.

I'll create a separate jira for removing the dependency., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Filed HADOOP-11468., Hi [~rkellogg], unfortunately we couldn't remove findbugs dependency due to license problem. Let's document that running test-patch.sh and `mvn package -Pdocs` require installing findbugs., +1 for describing the dependency on findbugs 3.0.0 in BUILDING.txt. In addition to that, it's better to describe "we need to configure FINDBUGS_HOME correctly" for the commands Akira described. On Mac OS, FINDBUGS_HOME is /usr/loca/Cellar/findbugs/3.0.0/*libexec* when findbugs is installed via homebrew.
