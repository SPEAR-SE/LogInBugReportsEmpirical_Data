[Hi Robert. Would you mind posting your test program as an attachment, rather than the JIRA description? It's difficult to read code in this context. Best would be a failing unit test case that shows the problem as you understand it., Here's an update to TestSequenceFile with a new Unit test as you requested.
the test suceeds; it should fail.

PS Re 6512
By your argument, there should be no synchronized prefixes in the SequenceFile user I/O methods,
but there are.
I respectfully disagree with your conclusion., Rob: can you please post this test as a patch that just adds the new test case and doesn't comment out or modify other parts of TestSequenceFile? You can generate a patch using "svn diff".  It's difficult to review what the test is doing when you've uploaded the entire modified file. See http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute

As for the other JIRA, please keep discussion on each issue within the comments for that issue. One of the central foundations of the Apache process is open discussion and the ability to see how decisions were made. If you put comments in this JIRA that pertain to another, people may not see them, and down the road they certainly won't find them.]
