[This is the original ticket., This is the proposed patch to Client based upon trunk. There are no compatibility issues., The fix is isolated to the close() method. It does not change the normal flow. It only affects the RuntimeException flow., This should resolve a host of unexplained issues by providing problem source information, Is this a dup of HADOOP-6724?, It appears to be a duplicate. 
The proposed fix is different. The patch insures that close does not percolate a RuntimeException, and checks the socket and associated streams streams. This appears to be more inline with the implied contract for Client.close().]
