[The default behaviour of the nnbench benchmark is to measure a file system without checksum. If the "-useChecksum" option is specified, then it measures performance with checksums switched on., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12354470/nnbench.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/hadoop/trunk/523072. Results are at http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch, +1 code review

This is just a test fix., -1 This patch may be rendered obsolete by HADOOP-1134.  And, the way it is written, the 'useChecksum=false' mode will silently fail to work once HADOOP-1134 is completed.  So, if we feel we'll want to continue to support this feature after HADOOP-1134, then we should add an explicit way of constructing an HDFS FileSystem that does not perform checksumming, rather than relying on 'instanceof ChecksumFileSystem'., We will continue to run NNbench with the checksum file system.]
