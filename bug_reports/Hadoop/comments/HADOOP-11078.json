[Attaching a patch for branch-2.5.1., Thanks for reporting this and working on it, Akira. 

While it is true that 2.5.1 is a point release on top of 2.5.0, I think there is merit to mentioning the new features and improvements that went in after 2.4.1 as users would adopt it more for that reason. I would leave out the bug fixes, especially those related to the build, since the users don't really care about them. , I understand. I'll close this ticket and leave out the fix. Thanks [~kkambatl] for the comment.]
