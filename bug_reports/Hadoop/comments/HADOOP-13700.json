[bq.  public API, specifically TrashPolicy.getInstance() has been changed in an incompatible way. 

The API compatibility guidelines allow for the API to change in a major release.,  the new method in question HDFS-8831 (dec 2015/Hadoop 2.8); the old one deprecated in HADOOP-13538.

so...its an API change which is coming in without any shipping ASF Hadoop release being able to use it.I think that's a bit, well, drastic. Just because we say we're allowed to remove things, doesn't mean we should â€”all it does is increase cost of migration.

, bq. without any shipping ASF Hadoop release

Ahh. I see!  Good catch. Timeline is important here.  2.8.0 was supposed to be out months and months ago. With that branch hitting it's 1 year anniversary soon and the increasing likelihood of it being abandoned/effectively DOA, yeah, I can see that we might want a different approach.  We should probably audit all of the 2.8.0 deprecations vs. the 3.0.0 removals to see how bad the damage currently is., 
> 2.8.0 anniversary

yeah, might be time to fork off 2.9 and release that, Thanks for the discussion Steve, Allen. Here's my proposal:

* We revert HADOOP-13534. I can open a new JIRA to do this for changelog purposes, since it's been released in 3.0.0-alpha1.
* We remove the "throws IOException" from the initialize and getInstance methods added in HDFS-8831. This is similar to HDFS-9799. This also gets backported to branch-2 and branch-2.8; HDFS-8831 hasn't made it into a release yet, so this seems safe., Regarding auditing incompatible changes, I revved the JACC patch at HADOOP-13583 recently, and would appreciate a review to get that in. Running the tool and looking at the output would also be helpful., Trivial patch attached to remove "throws IOException" from the new methods in TrashPolicy, since they don't throw IOException., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
