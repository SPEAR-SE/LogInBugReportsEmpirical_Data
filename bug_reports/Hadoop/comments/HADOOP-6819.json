This message is automatically generated., As far as I can see all javadoc warnings are related to {{warning: sun.security.krb5.*}} and there are 6 of them. So, I don't think the patch in question could raise the number of javadoc warning considering the scope of the patch., Cos, It was there in patch available state quite a long time.Please commit it., I have committed this to trunk and 0.21 branch.
