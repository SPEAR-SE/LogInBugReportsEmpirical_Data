[HADOP-1569 attempts to resolve these as follows:

1) Usage updated to include explanation of options
2) URIs are handled by the FileSystem classes
3) Relative paths are interpreted using whatever is defined in the config; if it's the local filesystem, it should work
4) This was fixed in HADOOP-564
5) In the case above, the file is copied to the user's home directory. It probably shouldn't be copied to the local filesystem
6) I'm not certain what the correct error message would be in this case, but UnknownHostException should be explicit enough.
*7) Query (and fragment) strings are not supported in Path URIs. This probably isn't a distcp issue.
*8) While this is true, one should use FsShell for copying local files, anyway. Should we make a special case of the local filesystem?

(* = not or partially resolved), Fixed by HADOOP-1569.]
