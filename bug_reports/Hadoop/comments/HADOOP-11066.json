[There's a config for this: {{excludeSubProjects}} that you can set to false.  However, it doesn't use all of the (many) excludes we have in the different subprojects' pom files, so it ends up failing with
{noformat}
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:0.7:check (default-cli) on project hadoop-main: Too many unapproved licenses: 99 -> [Help 1]
{noformat}

I don't think we want to also list all of the excludes from the different subprojects in the root pom, right?, Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0.]
