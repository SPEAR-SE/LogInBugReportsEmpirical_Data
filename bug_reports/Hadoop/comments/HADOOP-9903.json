[From a binary tarball, and from a build from the source tarball, {{hadoop version}} works just fine for me:

{code}
$ bin/hadoop version
Hadoop 2.1.0-beta
Subversion https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common -r 1514472
Compiled by hortonmu on 2013-08-15T20:48Z
Compiled with protoc 2.5.0
From source with checksum 8d753df8229fd48437b976c5c77e80a
This command was run using /Users/tucu/Downloads/hadoop-2.1.0-beta/share/hadoop/common/hadoop-common-2.1.0-beta.jar
{code}

It may be you have some incorrect environment settings. Please verify and close this as invalid.
, Do not set {{HADOOP_HOME}}. It is invalid to use that in 2.x. Instead set {{HADOOP_PREFIX}} and the auto-discovery of the classpath will work fine.

Please run a {{export HADOOP_PREFIX=$HADOOP_HOME; unset HADOOP_HOME}} and retry., my bad. I had HADOOP_HOME and HADOOP_PREFIX pointing to two different directories.]
