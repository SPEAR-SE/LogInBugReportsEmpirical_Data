[After reading the core code of hadoop 1.2.1,  and the root cause is clear now.  
the details is :
During startup , the tasktracker will open an child process  to by executing the script  "taskjvm.sh",  and this script will run the main method in   org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Child.  In this main method,  there has below code :   
   -----------------------------------------
    String pid = "";
    if (!Shell.WINDOWS) {
      pid = System.getenv().get("JVM_PID");
    }
    JvmContext context = new JvmContext(jvmId, pid);
    .......................
    final JvmContext jvmContext = context;
    try {
      while (true) {
        ..........................;
        JvmTask myTask = umbilical.getTask(context);
  ----------------------------------------------
Obviously , that the pid saved to JvmContext is empty under windows platform,  an this pid will send to tacktracker via RPC interface "getTask" .
But in the kill method of JvmManager of parent process , only the null value checked for pidStr . So when parse the pidStr to int , the NumberFormatException happed likes it showed in log.
     ----------------------------------------------------------
      synchronized void kill() throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        if (!killed) {
          TaskController controller = tracker.getTaskController();
          // Check inital context before issuing a kill to prevent situations
          // where kill is issued before task is launched.
          String pidStr = jvmIdToPid.get(jvmId);
          if (null != pidStr) {
            String user = env.conf.getUser();
            int pid = Integer.parseInt(pidStr);
            try {
              // start a thread that will kill the process dead
              if (sleeptimeBeforeSigkill > 0) {
                new DelayedProcessKiller(user, pid, sleeptimeBeforeSigkill, 
                                         Signal.KILL).start();
                controller.signalTask(user, pid, Signal.TERM);
              } else {
                controller.signalTask(user, pid, Signal.KILL);
              }
            } catch (IOException e) {
              LOG.error("Catch Exception caused by lack of user information to prevent inconsistent state: ", e);
            }
          } else {
            LOG.info(String.format("JVM Not killed %s but just removed", jvmId
                .toString()));
          }
          killed = true;
        }
      }

-------------------------------------------------
The solution i used in my local is : the null value check instead of "!StringUtils.isBlank(pidStr)" .  
 But i have another question is why the pid is hard code to empty in window paltform ?  


, Hadoop is not supported on Cygwin.

Please see [these instructions|https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hadoop2OnWindows] for how to run Hadoop 2.2+ on Windows natively., Never mind, I missed that this is Hadoop 1.2.1 although it is right there in the title.

I would recommend upgrading to Hadoop 2.4 unless you have a compelling reason to stick with 1.x. It is stable and works natively on Windows., It's obsolete. 1.x is not supported. ]
