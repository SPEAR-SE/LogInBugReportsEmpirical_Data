[This patch is for trunk/2.0. I will look at putting up a similar patch for 1.0., This patch is intended for branch-1., Tiny nit:

{quote}
+# NOTE: these should be set to a directory that general users do not have write
+#       permission.
{quote}

I think you should invert the direction of this sentence, similarly to the other warning, i.e. "these should be set to a directory that can only be written to by..."

This message is automatically generated., This is one of the things that the packaging takes care of. Not sure what's the story with Hadoop native packages, but Bigtop puts everything in /var/run... so this is not a problem, Roman,

Most of Hadoop's packaging also sets the default up properly, I believe that I saw /var/run... in the setup scripts too.  It is not a big issue hence it is just a major bug, and we could drop it to minor if you want.  There is still a potential security hole if you are installing from the TGZ, and it is good to warn users about it so they don't misconfigure it themselves.  If you want me to change the text of the warning accordingly, I am happy to do so.

Aaron,
