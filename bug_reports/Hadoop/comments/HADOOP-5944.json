[This should be fixed separately and promoted to earlier versions., Storage already has Apache license header., Sorry, I meant StorageInfo not Storage. Changing the summary now., Since this is just adding header to the file, I ensured the code compiles. Not planning to run test-patch or unit tests to save time. , +1, BlockManager was added in 0.21 (HADOOP-5015) but StorageInfo was added in 0.19 (HADOOP-2885).  It may be hard to fix them together in a single jira., New patch that adds the banner for BlockManager only. Here is the test-patch result:
     [exec] -1 overall.
     [exec]
