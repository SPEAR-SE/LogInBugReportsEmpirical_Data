[This patch creates a new configurable variable mapred.jobtracker.completeuserjobs.maximum, which defaults to 100 (the current hard-coded value).  

When this many jobs are completed (failed or succeeded), hadoop deletes finished jobs from memory, making them accessible only through the information-poor jobhistory page.   This limit is supposedly per user, but I submit all jobs as the same user.  (this is the current behavior, which is unchanged by my patch)

I have tested this patch, and it seems to work.
