[Oops, this got moved to common this morning. This patch no longer applies., Sort of related: I'm not sure of the wisdom of exiting the VM in ExpiredTokenRemover when a Throwable is caught.

This message is automatically generated., # I think the check should maybe include one for null-ness, not just is-running. Just to be sure
# I can envisage a fairly straightforward test for this problem too 
# any call to System.exit() is bad and will only get picked up and rejected by a security manager. Best to make handing explicit -and have a separate bugrep for it., changed to a null check instead of checking the running boolean as Steve suggested

not adding a unit test - this is just a trivial fix that's obvious and not likely to regress. Plus, if it causes a problem in "real life" it should be exposed by other functional level tests, imo., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
