[After this patch is applied the progress information is correct., This is a good catch. A couple of other points:
  1. start should be set to the position in the stream after the sync, so that the "real" start point is used.
  2. the result of the division should be compared to 1.0 to make sure the getProgress never returns numbers bigger than 1.0f. This can happen because of the way that splits are chosen blindly and then adjusted to the sync boundaries. (Both the start and end boundaries are pushed back to the next sync boundary.), I've incorporated my suggestions into the patch., I've just committed this. Thanks Espen, Andrzej, and Owen!]
