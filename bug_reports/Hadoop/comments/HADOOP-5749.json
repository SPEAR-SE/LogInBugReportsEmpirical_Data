Was the default filesystem HDFS?, sorry - i do have a patch for this (but haven't figure the testing part out). will upload something later today., Joydeep, your patch probably also fix HADOOP-2835., forgot to add file., Patch needs regenerating following the project split. , this issue is fixed in HADOOP-7207]
