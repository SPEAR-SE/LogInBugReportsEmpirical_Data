[I have tracked down the source of this bug.

The GenericOptionsParser is called to process the -libjars parm.  It is called with the args[] array that is passed to the class's main() method.  That arg array starts with two unnamed arguments representing the input and output directories.  Sadly, those are not legal GenericOptions and the GenericOptionsParser quietly fails.

A workaround is to call the GenericOptionsParser yourself after having first removed those 2 leading parms.

I believe a satisfactory fix would be to add two optional unnamed leading parms to the CLI Options list for GenericOptions and have the GenericOptionsParser ignore them.  I don't know the CLI well enough to know if that is legal., Argh!

My bad.  Trying to put an example together I saw that putting the generic args in front of the input and output directory parms fixes the problem.
