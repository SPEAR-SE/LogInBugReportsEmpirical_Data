[Perhaps a different property should be used for the actual number of tasks allocated., It certainly surprised me that conf.getNumMapTasks() didn't return the right number and I _should_ have known better. It seems like if we want to leave access to the desired number of maps, we should change it to getDesiredNumMapTasks() or something closer to the real semantics.
