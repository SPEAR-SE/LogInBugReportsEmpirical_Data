This message is automatically generated., I think the exclusions should be done directly in the hadoop-auth module. Else it may trigger excluding those dependencies for the hadoop-mini-kdc. the version, yes it belongs to the hadoop-project POM., That's a good point.  I've uploaded a new pair of patches that puts the version in hadoop-project's pom and the exclusions in hadoop-auth's pom., +1 pending test-patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
