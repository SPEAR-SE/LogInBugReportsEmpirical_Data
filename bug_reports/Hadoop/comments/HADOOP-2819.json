[I think we should un-deprecate get/set SpeculativeExecution and make them call the new ones:

getSpeculativeExecution = getMapSpeculativeExecution or getReduceSpeculativeExecution
setSpeculativeExecution = setMapSpeculativeExecution adn setReduceSpeculativeExecution, bq. getSpeculativeExecution = getMapSpeculativeExecution or getReduceSpeculativeExecution
Is this a boolean OR operation? i.e. getSpeculativeExecutaion returns true when one of {map/reduce} speculative executation is set to true ? , I think that makes sense, doesn't it?, ok. that makes sense.
