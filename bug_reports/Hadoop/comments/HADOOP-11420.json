, Did this patch also mean to remove markdown support?, Test locally with and without the patch, it looks like that under the new patch maven still processes the markdown files correctly., Markdown is available by default since m-site-p 3.3
see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSITE-661
then dependency configuration is now redundant (and would cause updates problems since Doxia version has to be updated in sync with Doxia used in m-site-p, or it causes known issues), FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8 #45 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8/45/])

, OK.  So should doxia-module-markdown get removed from the other pom files that mention it?, yes, once maven-site-plugin 3.3 or more is used, adding markdown dependency can and should be removed as it is here by default (and the default version is guaranteed to be the good one)

notice I just saw that there is m-site-p configuration in ./hadoop-tools/hadoop-azure/pom.xml and ./hadoop-tools/hadoop-openstack/pom.xml: why? it's already inherited from parent poms, so the whole m-site-p configuration should be removed, bq. notice I just saw that there is m-site-p configuration in ./hadoop-tools/hadoop-azure/pom.xml and ./hadoop-tools/hadoop-openstack/pom.xml: why? it's already inherited from parent poms, so the whole m-site-p configuration should be removed

Agreed. Can you please file a follow up jira to clean them up as well?, done in HADOOP-11431]
