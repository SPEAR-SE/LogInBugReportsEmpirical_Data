[[~jlowe] please help review, thanks!, This code change covers more than Linux.  We need to verify it on Solaris/Illumos at a minimum., [~aw] thanks for review. Uploaded .2 patch which will only cover Linux. , Is throwing an exception really the correct thing to do when a netgroup doesn't exist?  That seems particularly drastic., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~aw] thanks for providing opinion. But I still think it's reasonable to thrown an exception because when setnetgrent returns 0 in linux it's not saying the netgroup is empty, but it's actually saying the passed netgroup name is invalid (misconfigured) or if any error occurred.  , bq. Is throwing an exception really the correct thing to do when a netgroup doesn't exist? That seems particularly drastic.
Throwing an exception makes sense to me given the context in which this is used.  This code is only called in one place, and here's what it does:
{code:title=JniBasedUnixGroupsNetgroupMapping.java}
  protected synchronized List<String> getUsersForNetgroup(String netgroup) {
    String[] users = null;
    try {
      // JNI code does not expect '@' at the begining of the group name
      users = getUsersForNetgroupJNI(netgroup.substring(1));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
        LOG.debug("Error getting users for netgroup " + netgroup, e);
      } else {
        LOG.info("Error getting users for netgroup " + netgroup + 
            ": " + e.getMessage());
      }
    }
    if (users != null && users.length != 0) {
      return Arrays.asList(users);
    }
    return new LinkedList<String>();
  }
{code}

As it is today, setnetgrent errors are silently ignored.  The C code behaves as if the netgroup exists but is empty.  No error or warning is logged, so if someone accidentally specifies a bogus netgroup in some ACL conf property (e.g.: who has access to this scheduler queue) or if there's a problem performing the lookup on a particular netgroup then there will be no diagnostic whatsoever.  That's not very helpful when someone is trying to figure out why permissions aren't working properly.  If we start throwing an exception when setnetgrent fails then we will still act as if the netgroup exists and is empty, but at least we'll log a message indicating something went wrong with that netgroup lookup.

[~lichangleo] have you tested this change?, [~jlowe] thanks for review! Actually after test .2 I found out that it didn't use the THROW macro right. Uploaded .3 patch with right usage of THROW and also change some misleading naming in the c file. I test that the .3 patch throw the right exception and also get logged correctly.  Below is log I get for the test. {code}  Error getting users for netgroup @lasVegas: no netgroup of this name is known or some other error occurred{code}, \\

This message was automatically generated., Latest patch looks good, at least from the Linux perspective.  Can anyone comment on the other architectures that are returning a value from setnetgrent?  Seems to me that we would want to report an error for the other architectures that are returning an error, otherwise we are silently _not_ loading anything for the netgroup on those platforms.  As I mentioned above, the only difference in practice is whether we log a message when this occurs or not, so I think we should remove the __linux__ check.  Thoughts?, [~jlowe], thanks for review and valuable feedback! But for architecture of Solaris/Illumos, setnetgrent return 0 upon success. So should we limit the scope of fix of this patch only to linux? , bq. But for architecture of Solaris/Illumos, setnetgrent return 0 upon success.
Argh, looks like that is the case.  So helpful that the two architectures decided to do the exact opposite on the return value.

I'm +1 for the .3 patch then, since at least Linux will log something when an error occurs.  Will commit this tomorrow if there are no objections., bq.  So helpful that the two architectures decided to do the exact opposite on the return value.

Given netgroup was in Sun operating systems since before Linux even existed...., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
