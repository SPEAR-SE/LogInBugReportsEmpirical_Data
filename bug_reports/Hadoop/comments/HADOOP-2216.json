[From the description of HADOOP-2226:

{quote}
jobtasks.jsp wrongly classifies _Running_ TIPs as _Completed_ and vice-versa. A bug introduced by HADOOP-1839.
{quote}, The bug was related to the ordering of the tasks ({{JobInProgress.getMapTasks(), JobInProgress.getReduceTasks()}}) and task-reports ({{JobTracker.getMapTaskReports(), JobTracker.getReduceTaskReports()}}). Fixed now by first collecting                       taskids of the tasks which match the given filter ({{complete, killed, running, pending}}) and then using these ids for filter the reports., +1 overall.
