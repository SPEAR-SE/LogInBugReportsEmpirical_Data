The attached patch fixes the initialization. This patch does not apply to trunk. I will run test-patch myself.

Thanks to Nicholas for help with tracking this., This problem is related to misuse of static variables (again).  See also HADOOP-2413.

+1 patch looks good., Thanks Nicholas.

'ant test-core' is successful. I could not run 'test-patch' (it fails saying java5.home is not specified, though it is provided on the commandline). For this trivial fix, I think it is ok., I just committed this.
