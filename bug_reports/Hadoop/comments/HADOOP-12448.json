This message was automatically generated., This is a good idea.  It's probably helpful for stable parallel test execution.  (HADOOP-11984).

However, -1 for patch v001.  This would fail on Windows.  The path strings constructed for the files would not be valid URI syntax due to the drive spec.  There is a point in the tests where the path strings are converted back to a {{URI}}, and this causes an exception to be thrown.

I took the liberty of making a small tweak and verifying that it passes on Mac and Windows.  I'm attaching it as v002.

Thanks, [~cmccabe]!  Maybe another committer can review and +1, since I have sullied myself by touching the patch?  :-), \\
