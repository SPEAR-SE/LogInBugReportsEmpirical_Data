[Actually, I would vote for HDFS to make flush cheaper again. Flush should *not* mean that your bytes have reached the disk. It should only mean that they have been sent to the operating system., 
Then the dfs (and maybe sequence file too) need to provide an api similar to sync.

, I agree. I think we should revert back the semantics of DFSOutputStream.flush() to what it was in 0.16. Also, introduce a new call DFSOutputStream.sync() that actually waits for packets to get acknowledged from datanodes. Patch coming soon...., How expensive really is current flush()? 

Of course, lighter flush() is better. I think we should do this irrespective of how much it saves., I agree that even if the flush call in 0.17 is much more heavyweight that earlier, I still do not understand why it is causing the task to hang. I wonder if there is a bug in the implementation of DFSOutputStream.flush() that is causing the observed problems!, Renamed DFSOutputStream.flush() to DFSOutputStream.fsync(). This ensures that programs that were invoking OutputStream.flush() lavishly would continue to work as before., +1., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
