[# there's no obvious place for it to close unless MetricsSink added a close method that was called on shutdown.
# the {{FileSink}} would need to differentiate {{System.out}} from streams it should not close, either explicitly or by some {{Writer}} subclass that didn't relay {{close()}} methods.

If someone really wanted to use {{FileSink}} in production, the class should be set up to close the file on a {{flush()}} and re-open with an append on demand.]
