[Two things I'll need to investigate here before proposing to remove such a check:

- What are native libs doing in lib/, when you can't guarantee their platform/arch without using external tools?
- What utilizes their presence in lib/ in 205 today.

Clearly, using 'file', tells you that those under lib/* are 32-bit binaries in the tar we ship today. This breaks native code loading in all 64-bit deployments., Got insufficient feedback on this and HADOOP-6453 to make it into 1.0.0.
Setting target version to 1.1.0., Moved to 1.2.0 upon release of 1.1.0., It appears no work is being done on this, so removing the target version.]
