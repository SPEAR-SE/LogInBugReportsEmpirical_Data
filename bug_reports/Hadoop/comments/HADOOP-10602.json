[I found occurrences of this in docs for multiple sub-projects, at least HDFS and MapReduce, so I'm filing the jira in Common for now., Attaching a patch., Thanks for taking this, Akira.  It looks like you're taking the approach of deleting the links.  I think this is fine, because we have all the direct links in the left nav, and the user always has the browser back button too.  It streamlines the pages a bit too.  Does anyone else out there object to removing the Go Back links?  If not, let's go ahead with this approach.

To make this change comprehensive, we'll need to update some additional files.  Here is what I turned up in a grep of  'Go Back' across the whole repo:

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~cnauroth] for the comment. The approach of the v1 patch was to delete the only "dead" links.
bq. we have all the direct links in the left nav, and the user always has the browser back button too.
Now I agree with you. I'll update the patch to remove all the "Go Back" links.

By the way, removing all the "Go Back" links makes hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/index.html not linked from anywhere. I think we can remove the document because hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html is a superset of it., Attached a patch to remove all the "Go Back" links., Updated the patch to remove 'Go Back' link from XAttr document., +1, pending Jenkins run for the latest patch.  I built the site, and it looked good.  Thanks, Akira.  I'm going to hold off committing until Tuesday, 5/27, just in case anyone objects to removal of the Go Back links., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
