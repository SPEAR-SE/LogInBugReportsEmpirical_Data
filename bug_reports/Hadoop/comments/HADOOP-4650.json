[Code review for trivial change requested., Dont know whether DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE is set to 1 MB purposefully. 

Comments on the patch:
1. The change in Changes.txt will be done by the committer. Patch need not do it. 
2. Changes done in DistributedCache doesn't look necessary. The change required would be 
{code}
-  private static final long DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE = 1048576L;
+  private static final long DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE = 10737418240L;
{code}, Yikes, previous patch picked up a bunch of whitespace changes made by my .emacs file. This patch has constant value and comment changes only., Sorry about that, moved my .emacs file and redid the patch. Also, if the CHANGES.txt entry is not meant to be made by the patch submitter, http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute should be updated or clarified to reflect this information, as I was following along with the instructions there., I just committed this. Thanks, Jeff

In the future, large numbers are usually more readable as products in the source (e.g. 1024L \* 1024 \* 1024)., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #661 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/661/])
    . Correct a mismatch between the default value of
local.cache.size in the config and the source. Contributed by Jeff Hammerbacher.
