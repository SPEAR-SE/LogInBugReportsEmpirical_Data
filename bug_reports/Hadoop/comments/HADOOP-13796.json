[Jira is for bug reporting. Please use mailing lists for questions., The failure detection works for the scenario you described. However, failover may not work unless the fencing is configured properly.

Since the graceful failover won't work, the fencing will kick in to make sure the failed node won't come back and act as an active. If you haven't configured a proper fencing method, fail-over won't happen.  E.g. if the only configured fencing method is ssh-based, it won't work for this case.  To fence off a completely unresponsive node, the fencing script should be capable of cutting the power.]
