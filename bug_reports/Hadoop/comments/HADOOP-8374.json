[Patch which makes tests pass with fsutil. However this requires admin privileges to run fsutil. mklink provides hard link creation but not hard link count. Need to write a utility to get hard link count without admin privileges., Targeting for release 1.1.0, since 1.0.3 is released., Attaching patch that fixes the problem with elevated permissions being needed for hardlinks to be created/counted.

The fix is to use newly introduced winutils hardlink support instead of relying on fsutil as fsutil requires elevated permissions., Same patch run through dos2unix., +1 on patch, Committed to windows branch.]
