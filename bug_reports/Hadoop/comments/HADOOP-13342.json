, Committed to trunk, Thank you!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10051 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10051/])
HADOOP-13342. ISAL download is breaking the Dockerfile (raviprak: rev 9560f252cf1f6ac0f029f92f85fa710c191c177d)
* dev-support/docker/Dockerfile
, Hi guys,

Why the support was simply removed without any sync up or notifying? If you don't like ping, probably you could do a simple check and will obviously find in http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libi/libisal/ that the library was upgraded. The fix would be rather simple by changing the revision number ({{2.16}}), instead of removing block of codes.

As we discussed somewhere, please notify the relevant guys when you revert someone's work. Thanks!, Oh! Sorry about that Kai. Please create a new JIRA and I'm happy to +1 it. Also, I thought the Dockerfile was Allen's work. Didn't realize you'd added to it. My apologies., The basic problem is that the package needs to be reliable for an extremely long length of time since eventually this Dockerfile will end up in a release.  Requiring a change every 6 months (was it even that?) is simply not good enough.  With the build effectively being broken, it was much more expedient to just remove it rather than spend the effort to come up with a long term solution.  It's also worth pointing out that the PowerPC version of the Dockerfile (HADOOP-13329) will also not be including ISAL., Thanks [~raviprak] for the clarifying, and your suggestion to bring it back. I will think about this and figure out a better way to do this, how to download and update new ISA-L library revision., Hi [~aw],

Thanks for your thoughts! 

bq. It's also worth pointing out that the PowerPC version of the Dockerfile will also not be including ISAL.
Do you see any error on the platform? Did you mean the ISA-L library package couldn't be installed or it won't run? In your view, why is it being different when come to the ISA-L library, from the existing ones such as OpenSSL, Snappy and etc.?

You mentioned a long term solution, do you have any idea besides the way to install it in the dockerfile?

Thanks again.]
