, Yes, this is the reason we briefly had a requirement that all tests have an {{@timeout}} annotation. In [this comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9112?focusedCommentId=13528469&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13528469] I also suggested a way that we could make test-patch detect timed out tests automatically based on exactly the sort of output you pasted here., Sure, that sounds reasonable.  If that's not reliable I'm even OK with test-patch simply commenting along the lines of "-1 tests.  The test build failed" and leave it up to someone to dig through the console output to figure out what happened.  The worst thing to do is ignore the build failure which is what it does today.  Maybe a combination of the two approaches?  Look for tests that timeout and call them out individually if found, but even if none are found don't allow a build failure to result in a +1 for the patch., All makes sense to me. I'm cool with any of these approaches. Agree that the current state of affairs is the worst scenario., Patch to try to implement the double-pronged approach.  Maven is now executed with {{-fae}} rather than {{-fn}} so we can get a proper exit code for test builds.  The test build output is also collected for post-processing to look for tests that timed out., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Ok, TestUberAM terminated and the build failed, but it still posted overall +1. It seems the patch no longer works after HADOOP-9186.

HADOOP-9853 might fix this instead., I misunderstood what HADOOP-9853 does. After experimenting with it, I realized it would be helpful if test-patch runs tests in multiple modules in a single build. If a patch touches two modules and there was a known test timeout in the first module, the build won't continue to the second module. The author may be misled to believe that the known failure is the only failure. With HADOOP-9853, surefire timeout cases can be dealt with, but 1) the script cannot rely on the exit code for failures and 2) any other types of test process failures are not covered (e.g. something causing System.exit()).

Regardless of HADOOP-9853, it might be better to have the script also post something indicating that not all tests were run if something like this happens., bq. Ok, TestUberAM terminated and the build failed, but it still posted overall +1. It seems the patch no longer works after HADOOP-9186.

I believe we're being bitten by HADOOP-8875, as test-patch currently doesn't have a way to test itself.  So the output above is from the original test-patch before the change.

I manually ran the updated test-patch, and it correctly identified the test timeouts and reported an overall -1 result., bq. With HADOOP-9853, surefire timeout cases can be dealt with, but 1) the script cannot rely on the exit code for failures and 2) any other types of test process failures are not covered (e.g. something causing System.exit()).

The separate modules are run as separate Maven invocations, so we should be fine there.  If one module build fails it should proceed to the next one.  Also surefire runs all the tests in the module even if one or more times out or exits unexpectedly, so as long as we're not telling surefire to ignore those cases it should continue to return a non-zero exit code., bq. The separate modules are run as separate Maven invocations.
Then it should be fine.
