[It would be irresponsible of me not to urge the hadoop community to consider using the following tools for helping to prevent/diagnose these types of bugs...

* https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis/wiki
** to identify places in the code where {{java.lang.*}} methods are used that implicitly the default Locale
* https://labs.carrotsearch.com/randomizedtesting.html
** to randomize the Locale (and other platform defaults) used when running automated tests.

...the Lucene community finds them invaluable.]
