[The modification is simple.

In FSDirectory, the original code is 

  public FSDirectory(FSImage fsImage, FSNamesystem ns, Configuration conf) throws IOException {
    rootDir = new INodeDirectoryWithQuota(INodeDirectory.ROOT_NAME, 
        ns.createFsOwnerPermissions(new FsPermission((short)0755)), ns.getDefaultReplication(),
        Integer.MAX_VALUE, -1);
    this.fsImage = fsImage;
    namesystem = ns;
    initialize(conf);
  }

the modified version is:

  public FSDirectory(FSImage fsImage, FSNamesystem ns, Configuration conf) throws IOException {
    rootDir = new INodeDirectoryWithQuota(INodeDirectory.ROOT_NAME, 
        ns.createFsOwnerPermissions(new FsPermission((short)0755)), ns.getDefaultReplication(),
        Integer.MAX_VALUE, -1);
    this.fsImage = fsImage;
    namesystem = ns;
    initialize(conf);
    updateCountForINodeWithQuota();
  }

, This is the patch against the latest trunk revision., I think the problem is that constructors of {{INodeDirectoryWithQuota}} do not initialize the {{nsCount}} member, which incorrectly sets its value to 0. So ti should be explicitly set to 1 in all the constructors. {{updateCountForINodeWithQuota()}} is relevant when you really update something in the the subtree., Thanks Konstantin.

I will modify the patch., the new patch, +1 This looks good., Add replication factor for Directory need correct the bug, Konstantin, is there any chance to commit this soon?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Is this related?, Thanks Zheng Shao

I check the failed test. Maybe it is not related to this patch!, Hi, all

is there some issues to be solved?

This is a small patch!, I just committed this. Thank you Ruyue Ma.

Does not look the test  failure has anything to do with the patch.
I ran it several times with the patch locally - no failures., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #698 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/698/])
