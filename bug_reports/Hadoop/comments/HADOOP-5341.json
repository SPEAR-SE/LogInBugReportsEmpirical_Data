[made the sub system script argument as optional. the default value is bin/hadoop
also fixed the bin/hadoop script. using exec to launch bin/mapred and bin/hdfs, Looks good. One minor nit. I think the check "if [ $# -gt 1 ]" can be removed as the start/stop argument is anyhow expected at that point., incorporated jothi's comment v2., +1, all core tests passed. Also did manual testing by starting and stopping the cluster on my local machine.
