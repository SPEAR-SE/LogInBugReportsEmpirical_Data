[This problem begins from build #3572.  See
- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-3770?focusedCommentId=12646480#action_12646480
- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4459?focusedCommentId=12646509#action_12646509
- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4616?focusedCommentId=12646530#action_12646530, I am investigating if this was caused by HADOOP-4634, Or rather, HIVE-6, Hive is moved to a subproject at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/hive/trunk. if these warnings were created by Hive, then this issue can be safely closed., Build #3578 seems back to normal.]
