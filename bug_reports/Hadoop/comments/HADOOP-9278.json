[The invalid HAR URI is caused here in {{TestHarFileSystemBasics}}:

{code}
  private static final Path rootPath = new Path(
      new File(ROOT_PATH).getAbsolutePath() + "/localfs");
{code}

On Windows, this creates a path that includes the drive specifier.  Later, this gets used to construct a HAR URI for testing, which isn't valid, because it doesn't adhere to the the protocol-host format used by HAR URIs.

The file handle leak happens in {{HarFileSystem#HarMetaData#parseMetaData}}:

{code}
     private void parseMetaData() throws IOException {
      FSDataInputStream in = fs.open(masterIndexPath);
{code}

This method opens the _masterindex file, but not all code paths guarantee that the file will be closed.  For example, parsing an invalid version throws an exception before the _masterindex file gets closed.  There is a test that covers this case, so it leaks a file handle when that test runs.  On Windows, this ultimately causes tests to fail during their post-test cleanup, because Windows file locking behavior causes the delete to fail., The attached patch strips the drive specifier from the test working directory path on Windows and ensures that we close file handles that were opened in {{HarFileSystem#parseMetaData}}.  The patch looks bigger than it really is at first glance because of indentation changes.  The actual parsing logic is unchanged.

With this patch, I ran {{TestHarFileSystemBasics}} on Mac and Windows, and it passed on both platforms.
, I also meant to mention that this patch can apply to trunk and then merge to branch-trunk-win.
