This message is automatically generated., We did this deliberately to detect misbuilds, where {{libhadoop.so}} did not exist.  Running the tests with partial coverage is the exact opposite of what we want.

There is code in {{test-patch.sh}} designed to address this scenario.  If it's not working, we should fix it, not rip out native test coverage.  See:

  # If we are building hadoop-hdfs-project, we must build the native component
  # of hadoop-common-project first.  In order to accomplish this, we move the
  # hadoop-hdfs subprojects to the end of the list so that common will come
  # first.
  #
  # Of course, we may not be building hadoop-common at all-- in this case, we
  # explicitly insert a mvn compile -Pnative of common, to ensure that the
  # native libraries show up where we need them.
