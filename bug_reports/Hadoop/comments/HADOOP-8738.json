, This broke the mapreduce jobclient tests which ship in the distro, see MAPREDUCE-4644.  I'm assuming it would also break the other *-tests jars that ship in the distro., For now I propose we revert this to unblock 2.0.2-alpha., Tucu?, Agree, we should put back junit JAR and mockito JAR to be able to run things like TestDFSIO until we toolize those., Thanks Tucu - I've reverted this to unblock 2.0.2-alpha., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2862 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2862/])
