[SingleNodeSetup.html is deprecated and not linked from the left-side menu page. You can use SingleCluster.html for single node setup.
SingleCluster.html is also deprecated, however, it will be updated in HADOOP-10139 (2.4.0). You can download 2.4.0-rc0 (http://people.apache.org/~acmurthy/hadoop-2.4.0-rc0/) or go to my documentation build (http://aajisaka.github.io/hadoop-project/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html) to get the new document.

By the way, I suggest to remove SingleNodeSetup.html, which makes users confusing. I'll create a patch shortly., Attaching a patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
