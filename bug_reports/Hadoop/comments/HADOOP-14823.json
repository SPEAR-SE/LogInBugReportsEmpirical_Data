[the HADOOP-14809 003 patch contains the test for this, but doesn't work in yetus, The key problem is that they only get processed when -Pdist is activated.  Nothing in the Hadoop personality keys off of -Pdist.  So there's probably a few things that need to happen:

* Yetus should probably have a generic package test.  In that test, -Pdist would get passed.
* verifying hadoop-dist in the pom.xml should also be tied to the dist profile, otherwise it's going to false positive all the time, I see, yes, I can make the test a Pdist profile option. FWIW, we could add more tests in ant, but checking things like execute perms are beyond the scope of the java APIs, hence the tool. Maybe the real test is to exec target$hadoop/bin/hadoop -version  and, if the native libs were built, that they load]
