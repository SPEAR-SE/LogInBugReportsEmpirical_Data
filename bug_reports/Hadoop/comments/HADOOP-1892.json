[The problem was in the difference between a null array and an array of size zero. Instead of a null array, an array of size zero was passed which pass the "not null" test and crashed., I can't see how any array of size 'zero' could cause a problem, I'd like a little more investigation into this before we commit this patch..., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Yeah. The problem occurred only when there were no error reports and hence 'null' was getting converted to an array. So a check before the conversion solves the problem., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
