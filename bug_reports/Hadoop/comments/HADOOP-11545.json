* I prefer {{checkArgs(int, String[])}} to {{checkArgs(int, int)}} since the name of the method is to check the number of "arguments".

+  private boolean checkArgs(int index, String[] args) {
+    if (index == args.length) {
+      printCredShellUsage();
+
+    }
+    return false;
+  }
{code}
1. The method always returns false, so {{init()}} does not return -1 if the length of args is wrong. I'm thinking it is sufficient to add the code into {{init()}} as follows:
{code}
if (i == args.length - 1) {
  printCredShellUsage();
  return -1;
}
{code}

{code}
-        "delete <alias> [-provider] [-f] [-help]";
+        "delete <alias> [-i][-provider provider-path]";
{code}
2. "-i" is not supported, so would you remove "-i" and keep "-f"?

{code}
-    public static final String USAGE = "create <alias> [-provider] [-help]";
+    public static final String USAGE =
+        "create <alias> [-v value][-provider provider-path]";
{code}
3. "-v" should be undocumented. The option is used only by test.
4. Would you add a test to confirm the return value of {{init()}} as specified by passing right/wrong arguments?, [~ajisakaa] updated the patch based on your review comments..

+          printCredShellUsage();
+          return -1;
+        }
{code}
1. Would you return 1 in {{init()}} instead of -1? Sorry for my mistake... Javadoc says
{code}
   * @return 0 if the argument(s) were recognized, 1 otherwise
{code}

{code}
+    assertEquals("Expected help argument on " + command + " to return -1", -1,
+        shell.run(command));
{code}
2. We should use {{init()}} instead of {{run()}}.

Three minor nits:
{code}
+        "delete <alias> [-f][-provider provider-path]";
{code}
1. Would you add a whitespace between \[-f\] and \[-provider provider-path\]?

{code}
-import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
-import static org.junit.Assert.assertFalse;
-import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;
+import static org.junit.Assert.*;
{code}
2. Would you keep the imports as is?
3. {{testcheckForEmptyArgforCommand()}} looks redundant. I'm thinking it's suficient to use {{testEmptyArgForCommands()}}., bq. will raise separate jira to undocument these options(-i from delete and -v from create)..
Thanks. Would you please comment the issue number when you file a jira? (Creating a link to the jira would be better.), Thanks [~ajisakaa] for review comments..Attached updated patch..
