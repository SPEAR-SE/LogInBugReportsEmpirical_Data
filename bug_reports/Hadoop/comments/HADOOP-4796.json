[Chukwa test cases were divided into 5 categories:

chunk
input tools
agent
collector
demux
database

There used to be test target for each components.  Instead, this is changed to the same structure as Hadoop.  Unit test can be executed like:

ant -Dtestcase=TestChunk test
ant -Dtest.include=adaptor/Test* test, Remove legacy test targets, test components are called dynamically., The patch looks good, but the following should be omitted:
{noformat}
+              <!-- FIXME: Fix incompleted test cases -->
+              <exclude name="**/TestDemux.java"/>
+              <exclude name="**/TestAgentCollector.java"/>
+              <exclude name="**/TestChukwaAppender.java"/>
{noformat}

Assuming the tests themselves are invalid, they should be removed from the distribution and added back in a separate issue once they're fixed. Removing them as part of this patch would make sense., Same patch as above plus:

Removed incompleted test cases for:

- Agent to Collector communication test
- Demux test (can't run without test data)
- Log4j appender test case

Removed unused library:

ant.jar, ant-README.txt, ant-LICENSE.txt, +1 Looks good

I just committed this. Thanks, Eric, Thank you Chris. :), Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #683 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/683/])
