[Code is duplicated in both projects, I confirm the bug, and the bugfix works as expected., This patch includes the fix from Olivier, and updates the hash to Murmur 2.0A that provides better handling of empty keys., It would be nice if the update to 2.0A was also done on HBase's side. Is it common to run a version of HBase not in sync with the matching version of Hadoop-common? If not, could the few classes using org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.Hash use org.apache.hadoop.util.hash.Hash instead?, Does this mean that HDFS data blocks that were checksummed using this algorithm is now unread-able with this bug fix? How likely is this possibility?, I was not aware hashes from util.hash were used for HDFS checksumming. Could you point me to the code using them?, I was referring to recent changes via HADOOP-6148 and HDFS-496, But you are right, that was mostly a Crc32 computation change and has nothing to do with murmur hash., I just ran into this problem as well.  Are there any plans to release a fix?]
