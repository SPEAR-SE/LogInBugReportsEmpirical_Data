[Hello Arun,

Please use the user mailing lists for MapReduce for your usage related questions. This JIRA project here is to track development activities of the project instead.

Head over here: http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/mailing_lists.html#Users and subscribe + shoot a mail to mapreduce-user@, am sure there are loads of people ready to help you out with your issue at any time if you use the right channels!

Resolving JIRA as Invalid., Thanx for your comments]
