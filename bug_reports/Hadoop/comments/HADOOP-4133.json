[Should the new property go into the test conf instead. Otherwise anytime we add new tests we have to do the dance of setting it up for the test .
, I thought about but Hive does't set the config properties into System properties which is where derby looks at. Unless we take all config properties and add them to be System properties, this can't be done automatically. Or is there a way?, Is it not possible to set sysproperty in the junit target in build-common.xml?
, i think by adding this property into build-common.xml's junit target, this would work., here is the patch with build-common.xml fix, +1
