[This patch:
  1. replaces the host name in the persistent job log with the task tracker name
      (for lost task trackers, the host name is no longer available and was getting a null pointer)
  2. adds try/catch blocks around the job tracker's main threads to catch similar problems, log the error and continue., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
