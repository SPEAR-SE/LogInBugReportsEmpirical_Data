[Ah - mystery solved.  It turns out that there actually was a large-scale corruption event that took out half the hadoop data nodes, but no one realized it until the above recurred.

We have a "scratch cleanup" script which did a "rm" on all of the hadoop data directories for about 100 nodes.  So, starting at midnight, all the block verification attempts started failing because there were no blocks to read; when I restarted the namenode, the data nodes suddenly had new block reports saying they all had no blocks.

Please close.]
