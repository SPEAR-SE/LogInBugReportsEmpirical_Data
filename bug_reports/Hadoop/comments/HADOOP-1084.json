[With the block-level crc's coming, we should move to filestamps rather than checksums. It is less precise, but the crc information is going away. , With HADOOP-1134 slated for 0.14, we need to fix this since crcs are going away... hence I'm marking this as a BLOCKER., First take on using filestamps in lieu of md5 of crcs for the filecache, I'll continue testing this..., Patch updated due to changes in trunk and added checks to ensure that changes to the files to be cached on hdfs _after_ job has started are caught, and punished! *smile*, +1
