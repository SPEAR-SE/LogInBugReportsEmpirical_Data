[This patch looks for the checkstyle jar in "lib/excluded" and also excludes this directory from the build classpath., -1, because 3 attempts failed to build and test the latest attachment http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12352750/checkstyle.patch against trunk revision http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/hadoop/trunk/514892. Please note that this message is automatically generated and may represent a problem with the automation system and not the patch. Results are at http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch, +1 This looks fine to me.  We might check for "checkstyle*.jar" so that upgrades don't require changing the build.xml., I've just commited this with the suggested change., I'm moving this to 0.12.1, since it is a bugfix, and also since trunk currently has all the patches destined for 0.12.1 and this will simplify merging these from trunk to the 0.12 branch.]
