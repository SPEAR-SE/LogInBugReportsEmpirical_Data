[Patch to move the conversion of relative path to absolute path after symlink following, An earlier issue was fixed with the hadoop-config.sh to convert a relative HADOOP_HOME path into an absolute one.  However the code in the hadoop-config.sh that follows symlinks can still return a relative path after following the symlinks.  The attached patch just moves the relative to absolute path conversion code to after the symlink following code., I just committed this.  Thanks, Lee!]
