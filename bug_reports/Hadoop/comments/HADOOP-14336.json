[I linked [HADOOP-14337] here for easier tracking., Hi I just created 2 other tasks for yarn and MR, I volunteer to help on this 2., [~cheersyang] thanks for working on this.
HADOOP-14338 address all the YARN related spot bugs (even this can be moved to YARN..?).I think, we should close YARN-6512,YARN-6513 and YARN-6515 as duplicate to HADOOP-14338..?, Hi [~brahmareddy]

It is done the other way around :), per discussion with [~ajisakaa] and [~Naganarasimha]. Created separate yarn jira per yarn component and marked related to this umbrella. I close HADOOP-14338 as duplicated and will split the patch to several separate ones per component. Thanks for your comments., FYI:

Running through some of these JIRAs, despite Yetus having been in use for almost two years now (!), there still seems to be some confusion over it's output.  I've opened YETUS-500 ., Thanks [~aw] for filing that ticket, that is really helpful.]
