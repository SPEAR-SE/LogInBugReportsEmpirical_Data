This message was automatically generated., Minor nitpick, but it would be nice if the doc's usage string matched what the shell prints:

Usage: hadoop fs [generic options] -getmerge [-nl] <src> <localdst>

i.e. swap the -nl to be the first, not last, arg., Thanks for your review [~templedf] ,please find the updated patch, review the same, \\

This message was automatically generated., New patch looks good.  +1, [~jagadesh.kiran] thanks for updated patch..It's looks good me..+1 (non-binding), Looks good to me. 

bq. Optionally -nl can be set to enable adding a newline character at the end of each file.
Would you document that the newline character is LF? Adding (LF) between 'character' and 'at the end' is fine to me.
, Thanks [~ajisakaa]  for your review,Updated with Review comments ,please check, \\
