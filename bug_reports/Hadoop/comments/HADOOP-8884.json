[-First pass changed the nativecodeloader.java to throw a warning instead of a debug message when attempting to load native-hadoop but fails loading.

- Local unit tests failed, this is my first patch and I may have missed something, any comments / feedback are appreciated, Anthony, thanks for the patch. Making these logs from debug to warning makes sense. 

I suggest combining both those logs into a single log, along the lines:
{noformat}
        LOG.warn("Continuing after failing to load native-hadoop - java.library.path=" +
            System.getProperty("java.library.path") + " with error: "+ t);
{noformat}

This message is automatically generated., The test failure is spurious and unrelated, so don't worry about that.

I agree with Suresh's suggestion of making the log one line, except that I recommend you pass the Throwable as the second argument to LOG.warn, so that the full stack trace is printed, i.e.:

{code}
LOG.warn("Continuing after failing to load native-hadoop - java.library.path=" +
    System.getProperty("java.library.path") + " with error:", t);
{code}, Thanks for the feedback.  I agree with both recommendations, will consolidate feedback and re-submit an updated patch.

This message is automatically generated., The latest patch looks good to me, except that our style guide says to indent 4 spaces for continued lines, not 9 spaces. Here's an updated patch which just changes the amount of indentation.

+1, I'm going to commit this momentarily since the only difference between this and the last is white space., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

, Does this result in a WARN for any operation where the native libraries aren't available? eg if a client doesn't install the native libs (eg on a platform that doesn't support them), will he get a WARN on every "hadoop fs -ls" type operation? If so, I don't think this is a good idea., Great point, Todd. I should've thought of that.

It doesn't actually happen for every `hadoop fs -ls' operation per se, since that doesn't try to load the native libs, but it will happen for any command that would try to do so, e.g. `hadoop fs -cat':

{noformat}
$ hadoop fs -cat bashrc
12/10/08 14:17:27 WARN util.NativeCodeLoader: Continuing after failing to load native-hadoop - java.library.path=/home/atm/Downloads/jdk1.6.0_30/jre/lib/amd64/server:/home/atm/Downloads/jdk1.6.0_30/jre/lib/amd64:/home/atm/Downloads/jdk1.6.0_30/jre/../lib/amd64:/usr/local/lib:/usr/java/packages/lib/amd64:/usr/lib64:/lib64:/lib:/usr/lib with error:
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no hadoop in java.library.path
{noformat}

I'll go ahead and revert this commit for now. Perhaps we should try to find a way to print this warning only when the native libs fail to load for some reason other than them being not present entirely., I've reverted this commit., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2826 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2826/])

, Yea, I think it would be worth distinguishing between the reasons. For example, if they fail to load due to a platform mismatch (eg 64-bit libs on 32-bit JDK) or due to a dependency mismatch (eg built against a different glibc than available on the system), it's worth WARNing.

, Removing Fix-version. Please use Target-version for the intended release and let committers set the fix-version at commit time., I believe it's still a useful feature to have a warning message when native libraries are enabled but not available, although there's some additional work needed to properly implement this., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
