[Ok, so this is NOT a problem in RawLocalFileStatus as much as it is a mismatch between newer code in Path handling that deals with resources mainly as URIs and older code in Nutch which deals with local files as File objects.  The solution to this is to change older code to be translated first into URIs then from there to local files.  This is an example:

URI fileUri = file.toUri();
new File(fileUri).toString()

I will mark this issue resolved and it can be closed., Issue resolved.  Not a hadoop bug.]
