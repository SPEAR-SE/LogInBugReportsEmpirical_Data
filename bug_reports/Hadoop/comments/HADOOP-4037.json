[Patch fixes the contrib failure., +1, I just committed this. Thanks, Nigel!, Ok, now I committed it for *real* this time!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #589 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/589/]), This problem happens again since the eclipse files are not tested by developers.  See HADOOP-4244.]
