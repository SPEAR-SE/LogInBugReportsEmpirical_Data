[See below for example output from getfacl on Linux.  The logic for this would be:

{code}
Find the mask entry within the scope, either access or default.
Go back and iterate through all entries.
If entry is named user, named group, or unnamed group
  Calculate effective permissions by applying the mask from the same scope using {{FsAction#and}}.
  If effective permissions are different from actual permissions
    Also display effective permissions.
{code}

The effective permissions are not displayed if the mask doesn't turn any permissions off.

{code}
> getfacl dir1
# file: dir1
# owner: cnauroth
# group: cnauroth
user::rw-
user:bruce:rwx                  #effective:r--
user:diana:r--
group::rw-                      #effective:r--
mask::r--
other::r--
user::rw-
default:user:bruce:rwx          #effective:r--
default:user:diana:r--
default:group::rw-              #effective:r--
default:mask::r--
default:other::r--
{code}
, I'm attaching a patch to display effective permissions from getfacl as needed.  While I was in here, I also fixed a bug that caused getfacl to print the group entry with "mask" as the label when the file has only a default ACL (no access ACL).  I've also added 2 new tests to testAclCli.xml to cover both of those fixes., +1 for the patch., Thanks for another code review, Arpit.  I committed this to the HDFS-4685 feature branch.]
