output of ant test-patch.... am still running ant test and will post the results.... , I just committed this to 0.20 branch. thanks tom and ben!, Isn't this really an improvement (not a bug).  Can you write a release note for this?, nigel,
  This is really a bug, given that multiple archives in a single wont work without this patch. Please look at HADOOP-6097 for more details.
  I will add a release note on this.

thanks, sorry pressed enter too soon,
 I meant "multiple archives in a single jvm wont work"
