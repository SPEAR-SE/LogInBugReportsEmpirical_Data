[We should also resolve some errors showing up in the javadoc build, that look like this:

{code}

I think upgrading all the tests from junit 3 to junit 4 should resolve this., Attaching the output of "mvn site findbugs:findbugs" with findbugs-maven-plugin 2.5.5 (latest version)., Hi [~cmccabe], can I create a separate jira for resolving javadoc warnings?

Colin, that FS contract base test is probably forever stuck in java3-land, as we don't know which external filesystems have subclassed it for testing. Pity. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I tried "mvn compile findbugs:findbugs" in hadoop-aws module, but it didn't output any warnings. I'm thinking updating findbugs version is relevant., Cancelling patch.
[~stevel@apache.org], can I close this issue and create a separate jira for fixing the compiler warnings?, â€”sure, Closing. Thank you, Steve.]
