[[~rchiang] thanks for reporting this jira.. Even I noticed findbug warnings where report shows "0' warnings., I guess its not limited to a particular component. Same thing is happening with YARN builds too. Noticed it yesterday when I submitted one of my patches. Can be seen here. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3051?focusedCommentId=14580961&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14580961, {quote}I guess its not limited to a particular component{quote}
Yes,it's for all the components..IIUC recent chnages on test.ptach ( HADOOP -12030 ) might lead this issue.., The problem is that your branch fails compilation while attempting to run findbugs before applying the patch.

For example, on YARN-3051 It's this line:

-1	pre-patch	17m 26s	Findbugs (version ) appears to be broken on YARN-2928.

If you go to the [full set of output files from the test|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/8234/artifact/patchprocess/], you can click through the ones named "YARN-2928FindBugsOutput%module%" to see what's gone wrong.

* [yarn common compile error|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/8234/artifact/patchprocess/YARN-2928FindBugsOutputhadoop-yarn-common.txt]
* [yarn server timeline service compile error|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/8234/artifact/patchprocess/YARN-2928FindBugsOutputhadoop-yarn-server-timelineservice.txt], [~brahmareddy] pointed me to MAPREDUCE-3384. There's definitely a bug.

In that ticket, the relevant findbug outputs are:

* [pre patch|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/5782/artifact/patchprocess/trunkFindbugsWarningshadoop-mapreduce-client-core.html]
* [post patch|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/5782/artifact/patchprocess/patchFindbugsWarningshadoop-mapreduce-client-core.html]
* [diff|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/5782/artifact/patchprocess/newPatchFindbugsWarningshadoop-mapreduce-client-core.html]

You can see by looking at pre and post patch that it did introduce a findbugs warning, but the diff didn't pick it up properly., [~busbey] thanks for reply.., I'm fairly certain I've gotten this fixed upstream already, given that the newer version does a better job of checking the result code of maven after a run and pointing to the log file that shows the break., Guess not.

, This is fixed in the yetus branch under HADOOP-12312., Closing this as a duplicate. ]
