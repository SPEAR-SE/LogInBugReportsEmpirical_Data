[Update on this : you see it if there is a proxy in the way and the returned message is not JSON

# the ADL SDK should be checking content-type for being JSON and content length >0 before trying to parse the JSON; reporting the failures differently.
# reporting proxy settings at debug level would also be useful.

see also [[https://github.com/steveloughran/cloudstore]], which was used to track down this issue, New SDK with requested changes has been published to Maven Central, the corresponding update to the ADLS connector is tracked in HADOOP-15342., thanks, will mark this one as a duplicate]
