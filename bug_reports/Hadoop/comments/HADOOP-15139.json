[+1 for this. 

now that hadoop-aws has cut out s3n:// then it mostly depends on the aws-sdk JAR, which is preshaded: we shouldn't have to reshade the 50+MB JAR, and instead deal with the smaller things like slf4j. Jackson is no longer explicitly used here, as the aws SDK has its own copy, [~bharatviswa], are you still working on the fix? If this is not a blocker/critical or cannot finish by Feb 18, can we move this to 3.2.0?, Hi [~leftnoteasy]

For this Umbrella Jira, only opened task as of now is HADOOP-15137, I have provided patch for it. Waiting for review. Could you help in reviewing the patch?, [~bharatviswa] 

Seems both sub tickets are completed. If you feel there are no more sub tasks, pls help to close this ticket. Thanks]
