[Dupe of HADOOP-12083..? please correct me , If I am wrong.., HADOOP-12083 definitely sounds related but I'm not 100% certain.

One clarification: in both YARN-3706 and YARN-3792, there are *no build errors*. The above output clearly says it's not finding file named {{/home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/workspace/PreCommit-YARN-Build/patchprocess/YARN-2928FindbugsWarningshadoop-yarn-server-timelineservice.xml}}, and that is the cause of this failure., FWIW, testing YARN-3706 with current yetus code base doesn't appear to exhibit the bug and only reports 26 checkstyle errors as problems.  (which isn't surprising since the checkstyle handling is better too)]
