This message is automatically generated., patch is for branch-0.23. QA bot tried to apply it to trunk., The branch-0.23 isn't being maintained by the whole of the community anymore. It remains and continues to get fixes by maintainers at Yahoo! but all of the mainstream development is currently occurring on branch-2.

Whats stopping you from using branch-2 at this point Radim? Does it not work on FreeBSD? Cause as I see it, branch-0.23 is now a subset of branch-2. Correct me if am wrong., I am using branch-0.23 for production because it does not changes that fast as branch-2, so retesting before upgrading deployed snapshot is not needed. I have also set of patches for better resource management developed on top of branch-0.23; i didn't tried them on branch-2.

You are right that branch-0.23 is subset of branch-2., branch-0.23 does not seem to build for me after applying the patch.  I am using RHEL 5, mvn 3.0.3, the sun JDK 1.6.0_26.

I get some classpath errors like 
{noformat}
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:2.5.1:compile (default-compile) on project hadoop-hdfs: Compilation failure: Compilation failure:
[ERROR] branch-0.23/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/DFSClient.java:[105,63] package org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.proto.DataTransferProtos does not exist

Radim, did you see anything like this?, Oh I see now  hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-httpfs/pom.xml

{noformat}
 $ diff --ignore-space-change hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-httpfs/pom.xml ../branch-2/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-httpfs/pom.xml

It looks like there was a mixup in the cygpath line "2>" got changed to ">>" but still with invalid XML. , Tested with mvn compile openJDK7, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
