[The tests failed on my Windows machine:
- TestMiniMRMapRedDebugScript
- TestTaskTrackerMemoryManager, I am looking into TestTaskTrackerMemoryManager's failure. This is what I've observed from the logs that Ramya sent across to me. It seems that it is failing to list the process directories from /proc.
{code}
[junit] Exception in thread "org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskMemoryManagerThread" java.lang.NullPointerException
[junit] 	at org.apache.hadoop.util.ProcfsBasedProcessTree.getProcessList(ProcfsBasedProcessTree.java:269)
[junit] 	at org.apache.hadoop.util.ProcfsBasedProcessTree.getProcessTree(ProcfsBasedProcessTree.java:96)
[junit] 	at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskMemoryManagerThread.run(TaskMemoryManagerThread.java:193)
{code}

Also, TestProcfsBasedProcessTree is failing(HADOOP-4173) perhaps for the same reason. Will look into both and get back with the reasons for failures and the pertinent fixes., Since they are related, I recommend HADOOP-4173 also fix the TestTaskTrackerMemoryManager, and this issue be handled for the other test cases., Tests are handled in HADOOP-4392]
