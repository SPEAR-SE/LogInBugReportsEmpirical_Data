[If an interrupt is noticed while sending the request, {{Client#call()}} catches {{InterruptedException}}, wrap it in {{IOException}} and throw.  Since {{RetryPolicies#FailoverOnNetworkExceptionRetry}} regards all {{IOException}}s as local exception, it prescribes {{RetryAction.FAILOVER_AND_RETRY}}.  We can make the client bail out early in {{RetryInvocationHandler}} before it even consults {{RetryPolicies}}.

Another potential place of hang is after making the call. In {{Client#call()}}, when waiting for a response, it catches {{InterruptedException}} to sets a local variable and continues to wait for a response. The connection thread has to either get a response or get shutdown and notify the client for it to exit the loop. It allows graceful termination, but may cause extra delay or hang during shutdown. I am not sure what is the harm in throwing right away when an {{InterruptedException}} is received., \\

I've seen the situation where a blocked/hanging HDFS client won't shut down...this may be related., Linking to the issues I've seen with hanging on shutdown. Do these stack traces match what you've seen?

We could have a test for this BTW: find a free port, create an hdfs client of hdfs://localhost/$port, try to use it and then try to shut down the FS, HADOOP-12418 may be a race condition where this intermittently surfaces (especially on Java8), The client hang during making connection (HADOOP-10219) is a different problem. The thread that is making connection is never interrupted. I posted a patch there., +1 â€”I'll let you do the commit, Thanks for the review, [~stevel@apache.org].
