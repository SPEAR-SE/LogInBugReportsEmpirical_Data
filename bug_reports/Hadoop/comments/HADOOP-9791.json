[Attaching the branch-1-win compatible patch. Will attach trunk patch as well., That's MAX_PATH for non-UNICODED paths in NTFS; paths that don't begin {{\\?\}}

see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#maxpath], Thanks Steve for taking a look.

Yes, MAX_PATH is the limit you are referring to. In this specific case, we already properly handle this case in native code by adding the long path {{\\?\}} prefix.
