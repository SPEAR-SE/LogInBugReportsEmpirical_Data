[This is fixed in HADOOP-2336. I would like HADOOP-2336 to be committed. I am tempted not to port it here :) but may be we should. See the diff for RawLocalFileSystem.java., This patch takes only first 10 letters from 'mode'. Use of 'ls' has been source of multiple issues recently.. hopefully we will find a better solution for reading permissions for local files.
