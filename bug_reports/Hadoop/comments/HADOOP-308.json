[This still happens. I identified a taskTracker which has 4 disks, of which only one is read-only, and seemingly submits any task to the read-only disk (no job got successfully submitted since Nov 30), although mapred.local.dir in hadoop-site.xml specifies local directories on all 4 disks. This node has 3 good disks, still accepts tasks, but cannot execute any of them, de-facto an unusable node without being detected as such.

The reason seems to be that the localizeJob method in TaskTracker defines a path localJarFile
always on the same disk, because the hash is just based on 'taskTracker/jobcache/', independent on the job id,
and when the disk has become read-only after that directory got created, then the checking in getLocalPath in Configuration.java does not help to identify the disk as read-only.


Exception(s) look like:
