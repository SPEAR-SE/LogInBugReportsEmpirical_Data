[I can take a look at the root cause., The root cause is that {{PathData.getStringForChildPath()}} will return a path string that is encoded, i.e. ' ' will be encoded as '%20'. This path string will later be used again in the Path constructor to pass to URI constructor, and lead to double encoding. The wrongly encoded path will later lead to a copy failure, because the wrongly encoded path is on longer the original user input path. I suspect Unix/Linux also has this problem unless the Java URI implementation is different on Unix/Linux platform. Attaching a patch that address the issue. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
