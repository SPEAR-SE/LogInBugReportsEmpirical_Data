[Hi Giri, this seems like it might be a duplicate of HADOOP-7435. Do you agree?, [~atm] this jira fixes the admin script for any project that's included in the jira filter and figures out the branch name from the name of the patch and schedules a pre-commit job by passing in the branch info and the attachment id to the test-patch job for that project.

I think HADOOP-7435 is making changes to the test-patch.sh script for hadoop and specific to trunk and any branch after 0.23 and I don't think it's a duplicate. 

, Thanks for the explanation, Giri. Perhaps this is not quite a duplicate, but the JIRAs do seem to have somewhat overlapping aims, this part in particular:

bq. figures out the branch name from the name of the patch and schedules a pre-commit job by passing in the branch info

The goal of HADOOP-7435 is to allow patches named appropriately to have their pre-commit tests be run against the correct SVN branch. That JIRA goes about this by making test-patch.sh detect the right branch and take the appropriate action. As I understand it, this JIRA would move the branch detection code based on the patch name into the admin job and then pass this info to the test-patch.sh script. Then, HADOOP-9573 aims to amend test-patch.sh to take the branch name as an argument from the admin job and check out the appropriate branches, etc.

If that understanding is correct, then it would seem to me that this JIRA + HADOOP-9573 supersede the work done in HADOOP-7435, though some of the work already done in that JIRA may be useful here., [~atm] I agree with you, this jira's goal seem to supersed the work done on hadoop-7435. Thanks for pointing that out. Let me upload my patch to HADOOP-7435 and get this working with the test-patch. , Sounds great.

BTW, thanks a lot for working on this. I'm really looking forward to this working., Closing this out as contained by HADOOP-11746 based upon the previous comments.]
