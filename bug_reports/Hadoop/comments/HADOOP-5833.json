This message is automatically generated., The current patch does not compile as it references the super from a static method.
Also, OutputFormat.setOutputPath is a static method and it sets the output path on the job configuration as expected. The child classes don't need to override this functionality., setOutputPath should not set the output format class. Its better if users set that explicitly. Resolving this issue. Please reopen if anyone thinks otherwise.]
