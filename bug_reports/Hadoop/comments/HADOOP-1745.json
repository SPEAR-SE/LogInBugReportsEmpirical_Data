[In HADOOP-1553, I had to take out the user log split code because if anyone actually wrote to stdout or stderr, it was causing a 10x slow down for the maps and reduces. (Seriously. In the word count example, it was going from 6 seconds/map to 3 minutes/map. With the HADOOP-1553 patch, it goes back to 6 seconds.) If you want the logs immediately you need to set the mapred.userlog.purge.splits to 0. Otherwise, it is using the tail program to keep the tail of the logs.]
