[This seems like the easiest fix:
{noformat}
-  public void setOutputFormatClass(Class<? extends OutputFormat<?,?>> cls
+  public void setOutputFormatClass(Class<? extends OutputFormat> cls
{noformat}

The problem is that SequenceFileOutputFormat is also a generic type, so OutputFormat<?,?> is not a subtype.

This will also be an issue for generic mapreduce.Mapper and mapreduce.Reducer types, as the set methods also use this convention., I just committed this. Thanks, Chris!]
