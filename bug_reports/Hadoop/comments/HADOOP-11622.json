This message is automatically generated., I chatted with Arun about this a bit offline, and we're going to hold off for now. ACLs are read from configurations elsewhere too, and changing it just for the KMS is weird.

You can workaround this by doing something like {{nobody g1,g2,g3}}, with a dummy user.]
