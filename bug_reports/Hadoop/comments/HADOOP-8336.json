[See HBASE-5885 for the hbase discussion., Since this was reported against branch-1 (assumedly) I wrote a test on that branch, but couldn't get it to fail. Elliott, can you describe the way to reproduce the issue? Or contribute a test case which reproduces it?, We were seeing this when reading 64k blocks.  So the file was opened.  Then read 64k.  Then seek to 128k then try and read.

I'll try and come back to this with a test or more detailed info in a little bit., Resolved as duplicate of HADOOP-9307, since I'm pretty sure that solved this issue., Thanks [~tlipcon]]
