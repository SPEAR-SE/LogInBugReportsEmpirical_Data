[doesn't sound like a deliberate design decision. Maybe there should be a catch() clause to reset the timestamp on a failure, The decision to prevent immediate reLogin is per design . This is especially desirable under error scenarios like heavy load or expred keytab.
{code}
  private boolean hasSufficientTimeElapsed(long now) {
    if (now - user.getLastLogin() < kerberosMinSecondsBeforeRelogin ) {
      LOG.warn("Not attempting to re-login since the last re-login was " +
          "attempted less than " + (kerberosMinSecondsBeforeRelogin/1000) +
          " seconds before.");
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
{code}]
