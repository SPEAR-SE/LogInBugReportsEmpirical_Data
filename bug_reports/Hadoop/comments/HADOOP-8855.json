[+1 lgtm (I just filed HADOOP-8856 for the same, will close that)., Sorry - forgot to mention, we should update the javadoc for openSecureHttpConnection to remove the mention of SPNEGO as this method is independent of Kerb and SPNEGO., LGTM., I'm trying to test this and it doesn't seem to entirely fix the issue... will report back with more when I know., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., This turned out to be more complicated:

- actually need to use the secure URL open code when either SSL or krb5 is enabled (or both), since it's also used for SPNEGO
- the SPNEGO client code had a bug where, at least on my test setup, the JDK itself was performing the SPNEGO negotiation. So, by the time it got back to our code, it was already complete and the Set-Cookie was present with the auth token, and a HTTP 200 result. This was causing fallback to the PseudoAuthenticator, which had a separate bug that it wasn't setting the SSL configuration in its connection

- I also found a separate bug that the dfsadmin -fetchImage code needed a doAs to work properly in this type of secure cluster

With this patch in place I'm able to fetch the image on a krb5+ssl cluster. I'll swing back and double-check that it also works on a krb5 (no ssl) and ssl (no krb5) cluster.

I'd also like someone who knows this code to comment whether we need the SPNEGO code in KerberosAuthenticator at all. In my environment at least, it's not running at all, since JDK itself supports SPNEGO auth., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Good find! [~tlipcon], quick question - this patch will work even on JDKs that have no inherent support for SPNEGO, right?, retrying patch upload - the patch depended on HDFS-3972 for some utility method in SecurityUtil, and that was just checked in a minute ago, Yes, I think so, but I don't have access to such a JDK. If you have one, do you have time to test?, I tested Todd's patch on a cluster with various permutations of krb5 and SSL. With the patched JAR, all of my tests passed.
- hadoop.security.authentication=kerberos hadoop.ssl.enabled=true: dfsadmin -fetchImage works.
- hadoop.security.authentication=simple hadoop.ssl.enabled=true: fetchImage works.
- hadoop.security.authentication=kerberos hadoop.ssl.enabled=false: fetchImage works.

I also duplicated Todd's observation that {{dfsadmin -fetchImage}} does not work on krb5 without the doAs., +1, patch and testing look good - modulo two small things:

Nits:
- openSecureHttpConnection javadoc shouldn't mention SPNEGO only since there are other authenticators
- Think you mean to remove this debug statement
{code}
   private void sendToken(byte[] outToken) throws IOException, AuthenticationException {
+    new Exception("sendToken").printStackTrace(System.out);
{code}, Further to the above, I've also verified that using the patched JAR, the 2NN is able to retrieve the fsimage from the NN with config
{code}
    <name>hadoop.ssl.enabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
...
    <name>hadoop.security.authorization</name>
    <value>false</value>
...
    <name>hadoop.security.authentication</name>
    <value>simple</value>
{code}

, > Think you mean to remove this debug statement ...

Hi Eli/Todd, in branch-2, [KerberosAuthenticator|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/common/branches/branch-2/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-auth/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/security/authentication/client/KerberosAuthenticator.java?annotate=1513688] somehow still has the debug statement.  Could you fix it?  Thank you in advance., Let me fix it as well; filed HADOOP-9899.]
