[These HTTP servers built on top of HttpServer2 are affected:
* NameNodeHttpServer
* SecondaryNameNode InfoServer
* JournalNodeHttpServer
* DatanodeHttpServer
* Nfs3HttpServer
* ResourceManager
* NodeTimelineCollectorManager
* TimelineReaderServer

The exceptions are KMSWebServer and HttpFSServerWebServer. Even though they are also built on top of HttpServer2, they provide their own authFilter in web.xml., bq.{noformat}
kdestroy
curl --negotiate -u: -k -sS 'https://<nn-web>:9871/jmx'
{noformat}
bq. Expect curl to fail, but it returns JMX anyway.

when {{hadoop.security.instrumentation.requires.admin}} configured as {{true}} also same behavior...? I think, can ensure only admin can access when this enabled..? did I miss anything..?
{code}
// If user is a static user and auth Type is null, that means
      // there is a non-security environment and no need authorization,
      // otherwise, do the authorization.
      final ServletContext servletContext = getServletContext();
      if (!HttpServer2.isStaticUserAndNoneAuthType(servletContext, request) &&
          !isInstrumentationAccessAllowed(request, response)) {
        return;
      }
{code}
