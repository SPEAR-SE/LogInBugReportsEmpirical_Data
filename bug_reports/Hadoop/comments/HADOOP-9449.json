[I don't have a stack trace for this as it's been discarded -I wasn't expecting it to suddenly start working again this evening. The laptop is the same, the source tree has not been updated (I was working in yarn, not common).

This makes me wonder if there is some network problem -the test routine is calling {{InetAddress.getByName()}} deep down in the resolve logic: what if the failing network is resolving the names/IP addresses to "something", which is then mapping to {{/default-rack}}? ]
