{noformat}, Make sure you also update TestCapacityScheduler.setup(int, int, int), which sets the value of "mapred.capacity-scheduler.reclaimCapacity.interval" in conf, so that the reclaim thread does not interfere with the tests. , Attaching latest patch incorporating Vivek's comment.

I am returning a large value from FakeResourceManager class, so the reclaim capacity interval would be large enough not to interfere for all the tests., The TestCapacityScheduler is failing with the current patch, will upload a patch once i fix those issues., Attaching the patch, by correcting the test case. The test case was failing because, of the hard-coded reclaim capacity interval. Made the same configurable and set it to 500 from reclaim capacity interval tests.

All capacity-scheduler test cases passed when running test-contrib, chuwka test cases failed and it is reported at and worked upon here [HADOOP-4860|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4860], Looks good. Some minor comments. 

# In _TestCapacityScheduler.java_: 
#* _FakeResourceManagerConf.reclaimCapcityInterval_, the new member variable you've introduced, is misspelt (missing an 'a' in 'Capacity'). It should be _reclaimCapacityInterval_. 
#* As I commented earlier, remove the code in setup(int, int, int) which explicitly sets "mapred.capacity-scheduler.reclaimCapacity.interval" in the configuration. This call is unnecessary. Remove the followling lines: 
{code}
    // set interval to a large number so thread doesn't interfere with us
    conf.setLong("mapred.capacity-scheduler.reclaimCapacity.interval", 500);
{code}
# In _xdocs/capacity_scheduler.xml_, use the following writeup: 
{noformat}
      <section>
        <title>Configuring the capacity scheduler</title>
        <p>The capacity scheduler's behavior can be controlled through the 
          following properties.  
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
          <th>Name</th><th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>mapred.capacity-scheduler.reclaimCapacity.interval</td>
          <td>The time interval, in seconds, between which the scheduler
            periodically determines whether capacity needs to be reclaimed
            for any queue. The default value is 5 seconds. 
          </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

    <description>The time interval, in seconds, between which the scheduler

, Attaching latest patch incorporating vivek's comments., Attaching new patch incorporating Vivek's offline comment, 

1. Corrected the forrest documentation for capacity scheduler. Previously had copied only the description of the property, now changed the section title and description appropriately., This is looking good.

Can you please upload test patch results on the last patch so I can commit ?

Thanks !, attaching output of ant test-patch

ant test-contrib passed locally., I just committed this to trunk and the Hadoop 0.20 branch. Thanks, Sreekanth !

I have only committed the documentation source (the xml files), and not the generated Forrest documentation following the new practice for committing documentation]
