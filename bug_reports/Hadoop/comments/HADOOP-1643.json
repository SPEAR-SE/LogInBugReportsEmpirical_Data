[This was done in HADOOP-618., +1  When there's critical client-side functionality, the RPC protocol should generally not be public.  If we someday intend to support multiple clients, then we should either have all clients in the Hadoop core (so that they can be maintained and tested as the protocol changes) or we should explicitly test the protocol independent of any client.  But, for now, both of those are outside Hadoop's scope.  Currently the only supported way to submit a job is with JobClient, so JobSubmissionProtocol should be package-private.
