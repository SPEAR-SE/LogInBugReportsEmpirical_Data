[This warning is because {{tokenKindMap}} is initialized through service loader of {{TokenIdentifier}} and _token kind_ is const for each one. But for {{org.apache.hadoop.security.token.delegation.web.DelegationTokenIdentifier}}, it has not been added to provider-configuration file and the _token kind_ is variable, so service loader can't find it.

dt for KMS is in this case.  It works fine since server side construct that kind of token identifier directly, this warnings happen in client side where try to log the token and need to decode it. 

The patch simply suppresses the warnings to debug message, otherwise there are too many such warning and will confuse user., This is a bit outside of my area of expertise; [~tucu00] or [~atm] do you know why DelegationTokenIdentifier differs from all the other subclasses wrt the kind? If this is unavoidable, we should stick with Yi's patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
