Because according to manpage this is impossible., Thanks for looking at this, Dmitry.

bq. Because according to manpage this is impossible.

I'm afraid we need to be paranoid when checking the result of this call.  We've seen some odd behavior in the past.  man pages may not always be correct, even when referring to their own operating system, let alone all possible operating systems we support.

Can you post your comments as a patch for us to review?  We can't review JIRA comments (or at least we can't commit them to the codebase), I am attaching a patch in standard format for review., +1.  Thanks, Dmitry., Can you please hold off committing?  More comments forthcoming..., I'm sorry, Chris, I committed before I saw your message.  Perhaps we can open a follow-up JIRA?, Oops, looks like I was too late.  :-)  No worries.

I wanted to bring up that this changes the error handling behavior on Linux too, and I wonder if it has reintroduced the segfault that had been seen earlier.  I believe the problem is that we'd get a 0 return code from {{getgrouplist}}, we'd treat that as success, and then that would drive us into a {{realloc}} based on {{ngroups}}.  However, {{ngroups}} could be 0 at that point (or perhaps random uninitialized memory), and then we'd get the segfault.  Admittedly, this was happening with buggy implementations of nscd, but we wanted to be conservative in the error handling.

[~kihwal], I know you had spent the most time looking at these problems.  Do you think we need to revert HADOOP-10781 and find a different way to do this patch for FreeBSD?, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5843 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5843/])

, According to the manual:
----
If user does not refer to a valid user on the system, getgrouplist() shall return 0, and set the value referenced by ngroups to 0.
----


But at that point we already checked that this is valid user (at the beginning of that function), so this should be valid user and getgrouplist() should return positive value., Unfortunately, we were dealing with a situation where the underlying library implementation had deviated from the man page., Thanks for that information, Chris.  I guess the key question is whether {{getgrouplist}} returning 0 is an error under Linux.  This seems like an odd design decision for Linux to make, since then there would be no way to indicate that there were no groups associated with a user.

Still, if you want to revert this and then do a new patch where you have an #ifdef BSD or something, I have no problem with that.  It is OK for us to treat a return value of 0 as an error on Linux, since our error handling strategy is to assume there are no groups anyway., Thanks, Colin.  I'd like to wait for [~kihwal] to chime in first to confirm before we proceed.  I wouldn't want to put in an ifdef that wasn't really needed.

It looks like this was not merged down to branch-2.5, correct?  If so, can we please change the target version and fix version, and also move attribution to the 2.6.0 section in CHANGES.txt?, bq.

Correct.  Thanks for spotting this; I updated the CHANGES.txt in trunk and branch-2, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5845 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5845/])
