, Would you fix the indent for YARN-3877? I'm +1 if that is addressed.
In addition, would you rename the patch to HADOOP-14356-branch-2.7-XX.patch to run precommit job for branch-2.7?, The patch looks good to me as well, modular what [~ajisakaa] said.
Thanks for tracking this [~brahmareddy].
May be we should keep it open in case other inconsistencies with CHANGES.txt emerge. Make it the last commit before the release?, [~ajisakaa] thanks for review.. Updated the patch.

[~shv] thanks for looking into this issue.

bq. May be we should keep it open in case other inconsistencies with CHANGES.txt emerge. Make it the last commit before the release?

As of now, can we commit with this current missed list and track the commits till the release(which I used to do,then there I will try to update,so that every committer will be knowing)?

Or

will wait till release,as you mentioned..?

anything is ok for me.

,  I think we should commit this now. I think we were quite meticulous and I don't know of anything that is missing in CHANGES.txt except this., Pushed to branch-2.7. [~ajisakaa] and [~shv] thanks a lot for your review. hope we did n't miss anything.. ]
