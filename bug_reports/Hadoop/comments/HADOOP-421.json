[Attached patch that replaces String with Text in hadoop-record I/O. Also changes xml-encoding of strings. Earlier it used url encoding to encode and decode strings. Now it uses xml 1.0 compliant character entities., Earlier patch had a bug in xml escaping of special chars. I have removed that patch from the bug reports, and have added this fixed patch., I just committed this.  Thanks, Milind!]
