[The conf/ directory within the Hadoop tree is intended to hold the sample/default configuration.  During development, custom configuration changes are not intended to be placed in that directory, as those changes will be overwritten during builds.  Usually custom configuration is placed in a separate directory, outside the Hadoop tree, and conveyed to Hadoop via the HADOOP_CONF_DIR environment variable.  You can also specify a config directory via the --config option to the hadoop front-end script.  With a separate config directory, your changes won't be overwritten during compilation., Closing as won't fix.]
