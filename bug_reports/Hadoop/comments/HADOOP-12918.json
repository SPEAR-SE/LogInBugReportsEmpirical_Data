[So, as it turns out... at least some of what I saw was actually being caused by a bad masquerade configuration on my firewalld service. MiniDFSCluster listens on the loopback address which, as it turns out, has been a bit buggy in the past with firewalld: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=904098 (Seems like the problem persists for RHEL/CentOS even though it's fixed in Fedora). Turning off masquerading (or turning off the firewall) made MiniDFSCluster happy again.

However, regardless of the firewall, the storage ID continues to be based on the host's eth0 IP address, even though it's only listening on the loopback. That's probably actually desirable, when I think about it, because different servers probably shouldn't be colliding there. And, in any case, it seems like it only stands out in the case of MiniDFSCluster.... any other deployment wouldn't matter.

So, the short answer is... all symptoms were my firewalld's fault, except the storage ID, and none of the symptoms seem like they present a real problem which needs to be addressed.]
