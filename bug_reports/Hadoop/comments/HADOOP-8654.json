, I am also facing the similar issue, Please help me to re create the fixed code using patch
, Please update the patch with a Testcase., Moving to project Hadoop Common since that's where the patch needs to be applied.

In the future, please don't set the Reviewed flag unless the patch has been reviewed and approved by someone in the community.  I see no record of that occurring, so I've cleared that flag.  Also the Fix versions flag is intended to mark where the patch has been integrated, please don't set this field.  If you'd like to indicate what versions you'd like to have the patch committed to, use the Target Versions field., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Hi Gelesh,

If there is any test failure, one can access them through *Test results* URL.

bq. -1 core tests. The patch failed these unit tests in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common:org.apache.hadoop.ha.TestZKFailoverController

The above test failure seems to be unrelated to this patch. 

The patch does not contain any testcase. Please update your a patch with a testcase., Could you please share a Java Test file or a link to refer the same.
The confusion is, this error is inPut file based, and we need to supply a error case based input.
A link for the existing test case, which is as per the would help, which follows new the test case rules as per Apache-wiki, I could write a Map Reduce, for testing
with the below code in Map Reduce Driver 

    Path inputDirectory = new Path("TestDirectory", "input");
    Path file = new Path(inputDirectory, "InputFile.txt");
    Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(localFs.create(file));
    writer.write("The Reruired Very Big Input String");  // Fingers crossed 

    Path outFile  =  new Path(outputTestDirectory, "part-r-00000");
    Reader reader =  new InputStreamReader(localFs.open(outFile));

Is this okay ?, I was searching for resolved issue,
And for that I clicked on Resolved issue.
My appologise, Since by my mistake , I clicked on Resolved button, I have reopned the issue.
To change the Status to Patch Available I am re submiting the same patch,
I appologize , bq. The confusion is, this error is inPut file based, and we need to supply a error case based input.

We don't need a full-blown MapReduce job to perform a unit test of the fix.  The issue is localized to LineReader, so let's write a unit test for that.  Rather than using a file as input, we can feed it a string of characters written into the test code directly.

Hope we can close this.
