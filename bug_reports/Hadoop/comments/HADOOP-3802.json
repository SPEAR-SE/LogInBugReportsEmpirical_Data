[The datanode (10.0.0.93) still has version 0.16.(3|4) running (I think) and thus injecting wrong versioned heartbeats into the system.  I.e. it has become a rogue node., There is a fix for in HADOOP-3758 and will be release in 0.17.2., This sounds like a bug.
Data-nodes should shut down if their versions do not match the required one.
I believe we had this behavior in the past.
In DataNode.offerService() the IncorrectVersionException should be treated the same way as
UnregisteredDatanodeException and DisallowedDatanodeException.
May be we should introduce a base type of exceptions like CriticalDatanodeException that would require 
data-nodes to shutdown., HADOOP-3758 fixes the the DataNode so that it shutsdown shutdown.]
