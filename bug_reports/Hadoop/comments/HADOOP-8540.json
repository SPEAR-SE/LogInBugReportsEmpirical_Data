[Once we port Hadoop native libraries (including ZLib classes) to Windows, GZipCodec will be fully supported., Support for zlib compression library was added with HADOOP-8564. 

To enable zlib compression codecs on Windows:
 - Download zlib sources and set ZLIB_HOME in the environment before building Hadoop on Windows (this step is needed for build to generate the corresponding stubs in hadoop.dll)
 - Install zlib1.dll to system32 (with HADOOP-8907 you can also install it next to hadoop.dll)]
