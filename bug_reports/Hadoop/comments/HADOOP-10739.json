[For example:

{noformat}
$ hadoop fs -ls foo bar delme
-rw-------   3 somebody somegroup          0 2014-05-30 20:27 foo
-rw-------   3 somebody somegroup          0 2014-05-30 20:27 bar
Found 1 items
-rw-------   3 somebody somegroup          0 2014-05-30 20:28 delme/foo
$ hadoop fs -mv foo bar
mv: `bar': File exists
$ hadoop fs -mv foo delme/
mv: `foo': Input/output error
{noformat}

The error should be consistent.  In both cases we should report a file exists error., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks chang for the patch!  Looks good overall, just a minor nit about the test case.  Most of the static class members that look like they really should be local variables for the specific test case method, e.g.: cmd, cmdargs, myuri, src/target vars, etc.  The only things that look appropriate for the class are mockFs and conf since that is what the static methods and classes need, and the others are specific to the test case.  Other test cases added later are unlikely to need these variables., style fixed by removing not general global variables, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
