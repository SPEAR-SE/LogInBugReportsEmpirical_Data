[Roman - pardon me if you already know this and are configuring your BigTop test correctly. If you take a look at HDFS-4646 and HDFS-4858, I have observed similar failure to timeout issues with both the HDFS Client to NameNode ipc (HDFS-4646) and the Datanode to NameNode ipc (HDFS-4858).

By default ipc.client.ping is true. The meaning of this is that the IPC layer is to send out a periodic ping but to never timeout.

In order to timeout, ipc.client.ping needs to be configured false and ipc.ping.interval needs to be set to some value e.g. 14000. This configuration means that the IPC Client should timeout in 14000. Is BigTop configuring hadoop so?
, [~jagane] as a matter of fact I didn't know that -- thanks a million for bringing this up! I can definitely give your suggestion a try (the NN keeps OOMing -- which gives me a perfect testbed for this).

I do have a question for the rest of the folks here though -- a client that never times out doesn't strike me as a great default. Am I missing something? Should we change the default for the client to actually timeout?, +1 for [~rvs]

I think we can introduce a new default *ipc.client.timeout* property which can be used in case the ipc.client.ping=false(which is default now)
-1 is not a reasonable timeout value, we can set the new property to may be say 3600 seconds.? reasonable.?, Is it same as HADOOP-11252?, +1, As per [~rohithsharma] comments, the issue is same as HADOOP-11252
So suggest we can close this, as much of the discussions are in other jira., Closing the issues, if anyone disagree, please feel free to reopen]
