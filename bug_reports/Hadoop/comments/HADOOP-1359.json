[Why is this a Blocker?, I don't think null check is even required. LocatedBlock does not expect 'locs' to be null. For e.g. LocatedBlock.write() does not check for null.

, Certainly not a blocker. I think the fix should be to remove the null check on line 191.

, The constructor LocatedBlock(blk, locs) does allow "locs" to be a null pointer. If LocatedBlock does not expect 'locs' to be null, it needs to do an argument check in the constructor., +1. Looks good.
