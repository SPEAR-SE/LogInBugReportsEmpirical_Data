[Why is this a blocker?  I don't think we should hold up 0.15.0 for this.  If we have a 0.15.1 then I think this should make that release, or if we find other more serious problems with 0.15.0 then this could be included in the final version of 0.15.0, but I don't see it alone as sufficient for holding up 0.15.0., Removing this as a blocker for now.  If HADOOP-2087 is deeemed to be a blocker (currently under consideration), then this should also be fixed., I just committed this. Thanks, Nigel!, Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #283 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/283/]), I've merged this into branch-0.15., Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #286 (See [http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/286/])]
