[I see no benefit to changing it.  The {{AtomicReference}} is internally using a volatile and the getter/setter will be inlined by the jvm so it's functionally equivalent. Even though CAS methods aren't currently being used, past experience is people may be prone to removing a volatile keyword.  The atomic ref is harder to accidentally change and slip through a review.

Unless there's a compelling reason I'm overlooking, please close as not a problem.]
