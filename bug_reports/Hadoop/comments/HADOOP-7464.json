[Did you check it on trunk?

This may be similar issue on 20.x versions https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7174, Closing as dup of HADOOP-7174.
Please note that hadoop fs -stat \{file1,file2\} is different from {{hadoop fs -stat '\{file1,file2\}'}}.
The first case will be translated by shell to call hadoop fs individually with file1 and file2.
The second case will send to Hadoop \{file1,file2\} which is in fact a glob and means something else. Please check {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.GlobExpander#expand}} for the details.]
