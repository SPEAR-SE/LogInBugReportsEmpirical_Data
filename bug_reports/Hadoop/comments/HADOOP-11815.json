{noformat}, While starting HttpServer2, SignerSecretProvider is added to webAppContext in attribute. SignerSecretProvider is creating the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor and scheduled but never stopped explicitly while stopping HttpServer2 which causes MRAppMaster JVM to hung after unregister with RM., Attached the patch for stopping ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor using {{SignerSecretProvider#destroy}} API. Tested the patch in cluster, it is working fine.

This message is automatically generated., This seems like a big issue, thanks for working on this [~rohithsharma].

Do you know in which version of Hadoop, this issue happens?, I am using trunk version for test. I encountered in trunk version., I met the problem in 2.7. [~rohithsharma], would you please confirm? If it consistently happens, I'm afraid it's a blocker issue., I confirm that it is happening every time in my env. I have verified in both SuSE linux and OS X. It is occurring all the time., bq. I met the problem in 2.7.

Sorry, I go back to check my history the problematic run is on trunk too. IAC, would you mind verifying if it affect 2.7?, I believe it must be there in 2.7 also. I will check for the check in history and confirm., It is there in 2.7. The issue breaks is HADOOP-11754 which is fixed in 2.7, Linking the issue to which breaks this., Let's move it to Hadoop project given bug and fix are all happen in Hadoop side. Will kick off Jenkins test again., The general approach looks good to me. A cleaner way is to store {{SignerSecretProvider}} in a final field in {{HttpServer2}} and to call {{destroy()}} on the field., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
