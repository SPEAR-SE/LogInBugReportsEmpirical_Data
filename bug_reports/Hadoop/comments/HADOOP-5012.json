[Patch for problem as described.

I do have an example of this problem happening in a logfile if someone's interested., Which version of Hadoop you are using? NumCurrentReplica does exclude corrupt replicas. Is it possible that your problem is caused by HADOOP-4742?, Hey Hairong,

This is 0.19 + a few unrelated patches.

I have attached the relevant logs below.  I guess this patch is another way of solving HADOOP-4742, as you point out.  It effectively does the same thing, but 4742 correctly identifies the source of the problem better.

I'll close as a duplicate.
