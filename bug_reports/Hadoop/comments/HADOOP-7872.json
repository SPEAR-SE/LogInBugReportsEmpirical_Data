This message is automatically generated., I think this is because patch applies to hadoop-project and not common.  , what features of 1.9 or bugs of 1.8 this update takes care of?, Good question. I don't remember exactly.  It might be I just started out with 1.9 in mapreduce and changed this to match.  Let me retest mapreduce ws with 1.8 to see if this is really needed.  Will close this if not really needed.
, tested with jersey 1.8 on mapreduce side and it is working fine for now. So closing this.]
