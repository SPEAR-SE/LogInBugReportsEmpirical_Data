[using the analogy of the animal kingdom - the larger the beast, the slower the heartbeat, it would perhaps be optimal if the heartbeat interval were proportional to the size of the cluster, rather than configurable.
One less config item, one less thing to get wrong.
namenode could inform datanodes what the cluster size is.
A formula such as interval=max(nodes/10, 1) seconds could work., I agree that the heartbeat should be configurable.  Setting it automatically would be nice.  But we must not be careful to let the heartbeat interval get too long, as other actions are dependent on it.  Currently block replications and deletions ride on heartbeat responses.  So the heartbeat interval determines the speed of re-replication and deletion., agreed, the dfs needs to be responsive.
but the larger the system, the more frequently datanodes hit the name node.
a block that awaits re-replication will get replicated to the first node that sends a heartbeat and makes sense as a replication destination. Overall the system is very responsive even though each individual data node sends infrequent heartbeats.
as for deletions, they can wait a bit, especially with undelete functionality in mind.
The formula max(nodes/10, 1) maintains heartbeat rate at a constant 10 per second at the namenode. We can tweak the denominator to change that rate, but this seems like a good rate to get responsiveness, while limiting the load on the namenode.
, Work started by milind., Mde heartbeat configurable, in seconds, though., Attached patch., I just committed this.  Thanks, Milind!]
