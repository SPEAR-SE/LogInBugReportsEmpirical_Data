{code}, Thanks for the contribution Zhihai! setAllowNullValueProperties seems to have been added to support unit test cases downstream. Is there a unit test case you can point me to which is causing this?

I'd be wary of opening up the access level of a Configuration method (even if it is labeled @VisibleForTesting) . Are you sure we can't unit test without changing the access level?
Also please log the exception in testLoadProperty(). , Hi [~raviprak], thanks for the review! The current unit tests don't trigger this issue.
bq. I'd be wary of opening up the access level of a Configuration method (even if it is labeled @VisibleForTesting) . Are you sure we can't unit test without changing the access level? Also please log the exception in testLoadProperty().
Good suggestions! fixed in the new patch.
I uploaded a new patch HADOOP-12117.001.patch, which addressed all your comments, please review it., \\

This message was automatically generated., As [~raviprak] said, since setAllowNullValueProperties was added to support unit test cases downstream, I change the issue to minor from major. Ravi, Is the latest patch ok for you?, Hi [~raviprak], Do you have time to review the patch? If you don't mind, I will ask other people to review the patch. thanks, Hi [~zxu],
I have one nit in test.

No need to catch {{Exception}} and then fail. Let it fail directly with NPE.

Otherwise +1., Thanks [~vinayrpet] for the review, I uploaded a new patch HADOOP-12117.002.patch which addressed your comment. Please review it., \\
