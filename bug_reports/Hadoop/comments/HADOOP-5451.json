[xmlenc is in the main repository; it should not be expected to fail.

1. Which version of ivy are you using? Have you your own ivy JARs in $ANT_HOME/lib?
2. what is in ~/.ivy/cache/xmlenc/xmlenc  ?, I had nothing in ~/.ivy/, but I did have a ~/.ivy2/cache/xmlenc/. Removing this directory first made ant work again..., What may have happened is some download got interrupted and then Ivy was using the (incomplete) cache, rather than fetching it remotely.

If you only have .ivy2 and .ivy, it means you aren't using the latest ivy version, which appears to have switched back to ~/.ivy for it's storage. This may have fixed this incomplete caching problem, but there is no easy way to find out. Just remember, there's nothing wrong with purging your Ivy cache from time to time. I have ant targets to do that; it's a good way of checking that everything really builds cleanly.]
