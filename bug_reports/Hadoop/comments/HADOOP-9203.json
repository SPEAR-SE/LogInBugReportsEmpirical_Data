[Attached patch allocates a free port when asked if one wasn't specified., Andrew, the patch looks good. However, could consider moving getPort() method to NetUtils.

We could create a newbie jira for moving MiniDFSCluster to use this NetUtils method., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
