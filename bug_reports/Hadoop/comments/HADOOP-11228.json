This message is automatically generated., Yes, non-secure Windows clusters are broken as the code will unnecessarily check for the wsce-site.xml file and throw an error., Ok, on windows unsecure the tez orderedwordcount fails without the fix and succeeds with the fix, so I believe this fix is good to go.  Remus, I don't have a quick way to test this on windows secure, I assume you have tested it there? 

In any case, given the breadth of the impact, I think the fix is good to go., [~cwelch] just tested on secure cluster, passed fine, thanks [~rusanu] and [~cwelch], committing this., moved to hadoop-common, as this is a common change., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
