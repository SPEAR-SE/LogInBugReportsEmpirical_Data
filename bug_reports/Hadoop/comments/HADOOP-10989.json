[See the comments on HADOOP-10781 for more background.  We have seen buggy behavior from {{getgrouplist}} on Linux.  Here is a patch that conditionally uses the new return check only on FreeBSD, as discussed earlier.

I tested this by running native tests on both Linux and FreeBSD.  Note that for FreeBSD, I needed to piece together a version of the codebase several months old, but still containing the earlier HADOOP-10781 patch.  It appears that the new OpenSSL cipher stuff can't compile on FreeBSD, so I needed to work around it., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12663222/HADOOP-10989.1.patch
  against trunk revision .

    {color:green}+1 findbugs{color}.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs (version 2.0.3) warnings.

        {color:red}-1 release audit{color}.  The applied patch generated 3 release audit warnings.

    {color:red}-1 core tests{color}.  The patch failed these unit tests in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common:

This message is automatically generated., The test failures are unrelated.  The release audit warnings came from a few new classes that just got merged into trunk for data-at-rest encryption, so these are unrelated., Patch looks reasonable to me.  Just out of curiosity, was there a specific operating system or environment you found that had this problem?  I haven't seen it yet, but there are a lot of libraries out there.

{code}
+  // Return value is different on FreeBSD vs. Linux.
+#ifdef __FreeBSD__
   if (ret >= 0) {
+#else
+  if (ret > 0) {
+#endif
{code}

Let's describe *how* the return value is different in the comment.  My understanding is that on Linux, the return value is supposed to be the number of groups found, whereas on FreeBSD, it should be 0 for success and -1 for failure.  We should also include a reference to this JIRA in the comment, or else someone might try to "optimize" by just replacing it with ret >= 0 for all cases, as has happened before.  It's a very reasonable thing to do after reading the man page.

I also feel that we should be special-casing Linux here, not FreeBSD.  In the absence of bugs, checking for ret >= 0 should be enough to verify success, and we're aware of such bugs only on Linux.  (Of course this isn't Linux's fault... probably some 3rd party library), Thanks, Colin.  Here is patch v2 with the ifdef inverted to focus on the Linux special case and more comments.

bq. Just out of curiosity, was there a specific operating system or environment you found that had this problem?

We saw this happening in 2 different environments, one RHEL 6.2 and the other RHEL 6.3.  Upgrading to RHEL 6.4 solved it, so we've recommended upgrading to RHEL 6.4 or later as a workaround.  The specific sequence of events involved nslcd issuing an LDAP query that timed out.  I suspect whatever version of nslcd shipped with RHEL 6.2/6.3 by default had a bug in its error handling, such that an LDAP timeout could result in returning 0 from {{getgrouplist}}, but leaving the other out parameters in an indeterminate state.  Then, we'd use those bad parameter values in a {{realloc}} and segfault.  Unfortunately, I no longer have the information on the specific nslcd version numbers.  I agree that it's not exactly accurate to blame an OS version.  It's more about the nslcd library version., Weird.  I was expecting a third-party library (that's what it's been in the past for us), but I guess even nslcd can have bugs :P

Thanks, Chris.  +1, Thanks for the review, Colin.  I'll commit this after a Jenkins run., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Once again, the release audit warnings are unrelated.  No new tests are included, because this was covered sufficiently by existing unit tests.  I ran on both Linux and FreeBSD.

I committed this to trunk and branch-2.  Thanks again to Colin for the code review., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6095 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6095/])
