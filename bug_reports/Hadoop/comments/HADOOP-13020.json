[isn't this HADOOP-11918, Sorry, missed it in searching for duplicate. Was wondering why nobody reported such a simple case. Add component {{fs/s3}} to HADOOP-11918 to help duplicate search., no worries: I've been known to file duplicates of bugs I've already files. Better to report than leave out. 

could you do a build of 2.8 and verify the command works there?]
