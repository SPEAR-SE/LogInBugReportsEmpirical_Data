[BlockSender's constructor contains the following:
        offset = (startOffset - (startOffset % bytesPerChecksum));
        if (length >= 0) {
          // Make sure endOffset points to end of a checksumed chunk.
          long tmpLen = startOffset + length + (startOffset - offset);
          if (tmpLen % bytesPerChecksum != 0) {
            tmpLen += (bytesPerChecksum - tmpLen % bytesPerChecksum);
          }
          if (tmpLen < endOffset) {
            endOffset = tmpLen;
          }
        }
The line "long tmpLen = startOffset + length + (startOffset - offset);"
makes BlockSender send more data than necessary. It should be
replaced by "long tmpLen = startOffset + length;".

All unit tests pass. No additional test is needed. Do I need to submit
a separate patch file? It's a one-line fix., +1. The existing code reads 0 to 511 bytes more depending on startOffset.

yes. please., The patch is attached.
