[This is because of incorrect type of buf_sz variable in 
hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/native/src/org/apache/hadoop/security/hadoop_user_info.c,
function hadoop_user_info_alloc(void):

Currently it's type is size_t (which is unsigned), and during assignment
buf_sz = sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX);
syscont() can return -1 (and it does on FreeBSD).  So buf_sz gets very large positive value (equivalent of signed -1), and then malloc() fails with OutOfMemory.

The correct solution will be to change type of buf_sz to long (because sysconf() returns long)., Thanks for that analysis, Dmitry.  I think you're right.  Can you post a patch for us to review?, Here is a patch in standard format for review., this one looks very straightforward.  +1.
