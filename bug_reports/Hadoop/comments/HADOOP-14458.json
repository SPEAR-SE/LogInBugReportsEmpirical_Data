[Ping [~ajisakaa]. I've no idea why the Jenkins did not complain about this but I can not compile on my local machine., Ping [~uncleGen]. Can you kindly help test this? We recently refactored the base contract test class. Thanks,, I can compile successfully, but my IDE cannot. Anyway, I'm +1 for your patch to add missing imports. It's better to write the import statements in the java file instead of relying on the superclass., Committed this to trunk. Thanks [~liuml07] for the contribution.

, Thanks [~ajisakaa] for review and commit. I was also wondering why this was not reported by Jenkins or anyone else. [~xyao] told me offline that the aliyun test jar was not built. Maybe there is a misconfiguration\(?) in the pom.xml there. I'll create separate JIRA if I have anything new., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #14057 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/14057/])
