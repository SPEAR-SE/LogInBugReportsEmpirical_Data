["Unable to connect to host-10-18-40-101 as user myuser port 22"
Check ur config whether "ssh myuser@host-10-18-40-101" works on ur standby node. 
I think this is not a bug, but wrong configuration., [~beckham007], Thanks for looking this issue

Yes in my machine "ssh" is working.

and "Unable to connect to host-10-18-40-101 as user myuser port 22" coming because ANN machine is not reachable
, Ideally Fencing methods should be configured to not to allow multiple writers to same shared storage.

QJM supports the fencing feature on its own. i.e. it wont allow multiple writers at a time. So external fencing methods need not be configured.
You can remove the SSH fencing method from both machines configuration and restart the cluster.
Then failover will happen successfully.

You can just set the below configuration for fence methods to skip SSH fence.
{code:xml}<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.fencing.methods</name>
  <value>shell(/bin/true)</value>
</property>{code}, @vinay

Thanks

Its working fine
