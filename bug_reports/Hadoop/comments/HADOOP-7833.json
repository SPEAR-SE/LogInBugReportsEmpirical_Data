This patch does not have any new or modified tests because it was modifying a findbugs filter file. It was tested by running mvn compile findbugs:findbugs in the hadoop-common-project sub-directory and I verified by examining hadoop-common/target/findbugsXml.xml file for the absence of any org.apache.hadoop.ipc.protobuf.HadoopRpcProtos related warnings. Additionally, this build received a +1 findbugs indicating the absence of org.apache.hadoop.ipc.protobuf.HadoopRpcProtos related warnings.

The -1 javadocs is an issue which is unrelated to this patch, as no Java code was updated., John, thanks for doing this. The warnings were introduced by me :-)

Can you remove the previous section, where I had tried to suppress these warnings (that did not work)., Removed the findbugs filter match for org.apache.hadoop.ipc.protobuf.HadoopRpcProtos, as requested by Suresh Srinivas., Probably will still get -1 due to -1 javadoc, but no Java code was introduced in this patch., Hi Suresh,

Updated the filter to only match the inner classes now.
Thanks for taking a look at this.
