[JobTracker does exactly what your suggested: acknowledge the duplicate status-update without processsing; it resends the 'prevHeartbeatRespone'  i.e. the lost heartbeat response to the TT. Maybe the log message there is misleading?, Andrzej, would just fixing the comment/log-message work for you? As in the previous comment, the {{JobTracker}} does exactly what you propose already..., Yes, thanks - from a user's perspective it's comforting to know that even though something is happening it's fairly innocuous., Attached fix to comments/log-messages..., +1
