[This patch fixes the build issues by correcting the includes.  I also changed a few sprintfs to snprintfs (I can split those out into a separate patch if desired)., My mistake, I think I clicked "Submit Patch" too early.  Could I get a code review for the patch?, What gcc version are you using? , I'm running gcc version 4.3.2 20081105 (Red Hat 4.3.2-7) (GCC), There has been a dependency move in gcc 4.3. The related bug in gnu is [28080|http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28080] also, [http://www.cyrius.com/journal/2007/05/10#gcc-4.3-include] but I don't know if we are currently supporting gcc 4.3 in the source. 

Plus I the patch is incomplete HadoopPipes.cc also needs to be changed.

Why don't we use {{#include <cstring> #include <cstdio> #include <cstdlib>}} instead of  c style headers? We are anyway modifiying c++ source right?, This patch allows the C++ files to compile without errors for me.  This one also uses new-style includes as well., The patch looks fine to me., Thanks for the review, trying to submit this for testing again., Somebody else got a fix in for this.]
