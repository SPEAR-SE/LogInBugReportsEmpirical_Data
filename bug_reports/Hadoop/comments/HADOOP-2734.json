[A patch to update links to lucene.apache.org in docs to hadoop.apache.org., Could we use png or gif for the logo instead of jpg?  They are better than jpg for small graphics with <=256 colors since they use lossless compression., Doug, saw your comment on HADOOP-2727.  Will work on the logo later., +1, -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The link http://hadoop.apache.org/core/api/ does not work in hdfs-design.xml . It should be ext:api/index .

Even there is no such link as <hadoop-default href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/hadoop-default.html" /> , which is used in cluster_setup.xml. This can be removed from cluster_setup.xml since we have reference later from the API doc., Use of docs/current/.. should be fine. I withdraw my comments.
+1 on the patch., I just committed this.  Thanks Doug!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #384 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/384/]), Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #385 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/385/])]
