This message is automatically generated., +1 works well for me. My only concern would be, what about other linkers (for example older versions of GNU ld or other brands of linkers) that do not support --no-as-needed - would they throw an error?, Yes, linkers will error if the flag isn't supported.  The problem is really in the library check function, not the linker.  Other open source packages typically compile a test program that:
* includes a header for the library
* externs a function or variable from the library
* main tries to reference/call the extern-ed thing

I think that's the better fix, versus trying to stop the compiler from doing the right thing., This patch fixes the issue using the approach suggested by Daryn: it outputs configure test code that makes use of the library being detected for both zlib and snappy., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., +1 Looks good!  I'm not sure if the objdump check is still necessary, but it probably doesn't hurt., I was surprised that supporting three different tools was necessary, but I wasn't bold enough to assume it was safe to remove any. ;-)

As a bit of context for someone thinking about committing this patch (please do!), it along with HADOOP-8370 and HDFS-3383 enabling building on Ubuntu 12.04 ARM Server., +1 Works for me

(and +1 to including the other two patches that Trevor identified for building on ARM server)., +1 Works for me.

Looks reasonable., +1 looks good. I tested the native build with this patch on Ubuntu 12.04, 10.10 and Centos 5.5., Thanks guys. I've committed this to trunk and merged to branch-2 and branch-2-alpha., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2218 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2218/])

, Should this jira be closed, or is something pending?, Left it open because there's a 1.1.0 target version and there's no branch-1 patch yet. , Same patch just different paths also works for branch-1.
