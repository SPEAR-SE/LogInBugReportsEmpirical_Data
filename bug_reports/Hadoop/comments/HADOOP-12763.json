[Hi Stephen, I think this has been fixed in HADOOP-11918. Closing as duplicate, please reach out if that doesn't resolve your issue., Thanks Thomas for the quick reply - HADOOP-11918 looks very similar...! 

I notice though that HADOOP-11918 is in the 2.8 release and not a 2.7.x one - any idea when 2.8 is penciled for release?

Thanks,
Stephen]
