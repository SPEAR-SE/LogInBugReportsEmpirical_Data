[*  HADOOP-13079 provides an option for users to use if they so chose.  
* It's pretty much impossible without limiting the character set that FileSystem, FileContext, job names, and who knows what all to prevent non-printable characters from ever appearing on the screen. This goes way beyond just HDFS.
* This is not a security issue with Apache Hadoop.  This is a security issue with certain types of terminal emulation.  Even though this has been a known issue for decades, UNIX and POSIX has not sought to require that implementations strip control characters from command line utilities.
* GNU and some BSD implementations have limited ls and ONLY ls in certain contexts.  They have NOT limited or even provided the capability to limit control characters from other programs that print directory and file names.  (Keep in mind that ftpd traditionally used ls to read content, thus it may have been possible to use ls as a malicious attack against a root process.)]
