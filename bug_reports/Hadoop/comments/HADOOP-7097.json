[Are you actually running it out of the build directory?  If so, that's the problem., Yes, I'm running Hadoop from outside the source tree. However, in 0.21 and in trunk this issue doesn't seem to exist.




, I tracked down the problem in the trunk. It comes down to an old usage of HADOOP_CORE_HOME vs HADOOP_COMMON_HOME. That seems to fix it, and HADOOP_CORE_HOME isn't returned by any grep, so, is it special?
