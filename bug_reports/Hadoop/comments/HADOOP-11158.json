This message is automatically generated., [~tucu00] is on vacation but he told me offline that this patch won't quite work as-is, so canceling it for now. Hopefully he can comment with some details as to what we should do when he returns., Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0.]
