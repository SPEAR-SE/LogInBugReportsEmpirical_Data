[In a past project I've had a thread base class that would be set up to send a callback on completion (with any exception); with something like that here a handler could be set up in each of the parents & let them deal with it. They do need to differentiate planned exit from unplanned exit though, which is straightforward in a YARN service, less consistent for the others]
