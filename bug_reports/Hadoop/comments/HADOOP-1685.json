[This is caused by misunderstanding of the config system in a way that should be fixed by HADOOP-785. In particular, hadoop-site.xml does NOT set defaults. The values in it are forced onto the client. So by forcing the number of reduces on some of the machines, but not others, you got bad results. Basically, the number of reduces is a client value that is being overridden by the server's configuration file.

That said, a lot of us are looking forward to a lot less confusion once HADOOP-785 is done. The current situation is very confusing with lots of strange corner cases. 

The proper place to define the default number of maps and reduces is in mapred-defaults.xml.
