This message is automatically generated., Aren't both defaultResources and finalResources deprecated?  Eventually, all that we should print is 'resources'.  Perhaps it's time to sweep out some deprecated code rather than to embrace it., Not a blocker for 0.15.1, bq. Aren't both defaultResources and finalResources deprecated? Eventually, all that we should print is 'resources'. Perhaps it's time to sweep out some deprecated code rather than to embrace it.

I agree, though I had to keep them in for 0.15.1 (that was the original target-release I intended). 

Since folks feel this isn't critical enough to make it 0.15.1, I'll rework it for 0.16.0 and incorporate your suggestion., Moving this to 0.17.0., Is this invalid now?, Nicholas - Yep, looks invalid given current state (0.23/trunk) of Configuration. Resources and Default Resources are now loaded during toString ops.

{code}
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("Configuration: ");
    if(loadDefaults) {
      toString(defaultResources, sb);
      if(resources.size()>0) {
        sb.append(", ");
      }
    }
    toString(resources, sb);
    return sb.toString();
  }
{code}

Closing as Not-a-problem (anymore).]
