[This is part of what I intended for HADOOP-2902.  There are lots of these in the code.  We should sweep through every place that calls Configuration#set("fs.default.name", ...) and fix these to (a) call FileSystem.setDefaultUri() and (b) make sure the URI passed is a valid FileSystem name., resolved by  HADOOP-2902.]
