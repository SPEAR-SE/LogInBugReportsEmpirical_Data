[Just to echo [~rkanter]'s comments on HADOOP-10670:

{quote}
I took a look at AuthenticationFilterInitializer and you're right; that appears to be how it worked before. When working on HADOOP-10868 and HADOOP-10791, I didn't realize that. The motivation for that work had been Oozie HA, and we didn't have the code in AuthenticationFilterInitializer, so it had previously been reading a secret string directly from the configuration (which I know is bad). It's good that we have that sorted out now though 
{quote}, {{StringSecretProvider}} is heavily used in our existing unit tests, in {{o.a.h.security.authentication}} packages and {{o.a.h.fs.http.server}}. Maybe we want to keep it as {{VisibleForTesting}}, and disable all configuration related initializations? One step forward, if we can eliminate its usage in {{TestHttpFSServer}}, we can further reduce the visibility of this class. Please feel free to let me know your preference. , Did some work to change the {{StringSecretProvider}} class to be test only. Most work done but TestAuthenticationFilter is failing because we're changing the default filters. In a comprehensive fix we need to change the mockito settings in TestAuthenticationFilter to create {{StringSecretProvider}}s in {{config}} objects. , Continue on [~gtCarrera]'s work and to fix the unit tests., Thanks [~wheat9] for continuing on this. The fix on TestAuthenticationFilter looks good to me. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
