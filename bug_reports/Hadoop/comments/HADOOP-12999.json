[the original s3:// fs is deprecated to the extent of probably being cut from hadoop 3; data natively stored via s3n/s3a being the way modern applications work with the storage.

are you really trying to work with s3:// data, or is this a regression test?, Thanks for the quick response [~stevel@apache.org] . This was indeed a regression, using the s3n:// driver seems to work fine.. Cheers]
