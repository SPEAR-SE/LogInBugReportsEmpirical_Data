[Here's a fix for both these problems. With the patch and HADOOP-9258 all the tests in Jets3tS3FileSystemContractTest and TestInMemoryS3FileSystemContract pass., I applied the patch locally and verified that it fixed the new tests from HADOOP-9258.

{code}
-    InputStream in = get(pathToKey(path), true);
+    String key = pathToKey(path);
+    if (isRoot(key)) {
+      return true;
+    }
+    InputStream in = get(key, true);
{code}

With this change, a query for root always resolves locally without interacting with S3.  This could mask some other kinds of S3 errors, such as AccessDenied, ExpiredToken, or NoSuchBucket.  Is that a concern?
, chris -good point. But it responds really fast -and round trip time is always visible on S3, especially remotely.

I'm +1 to this patch -it's not going to break anyone's existing code as the operations would always fail to date. And as nobody has ever reported it yet, its possibly never been encountered before., +1

Thanks, Steve.  I expect a realistic usage scenario wouldn't stop at querying root, so the client would just see those S3 errors a little later in the sequence.
, Thanks for the feedback. Here's an updated version which creates a root inode on S3 in case it doesn't exist., +1 for the new patch

I repeated the tests and they passed.

Just to clarify, I was not objecting to the prior patch.  I just wanted to mention the error handling issue for consideration, and Steve made some good points to justify the behavior.
, There's enough changes here that we do need rigorous review.

The previous patch saw copy-onto-self and bailed out early -but these checks were made before the destination path was fully generated -because if you specify a destination directory, the source goes in under there. Which means you could set the dest dir to be the parent of the source file, so generating a rename(src, src) _after_ the equality check had taken place -a rename that would return false.

Now the value is checked once up front -for fast exit without talking to S3, and then just before the operation actually takes place.

I also added lots of inline comments to make it clearer what is going on. , ignore the last comment, it's referring to HADOOP-9261, Steve, have you reviewed and agree this can be committed?
