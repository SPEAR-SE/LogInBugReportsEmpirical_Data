[Why the classes are different in your case, ideally both the ways should give same class. It looks like class versions are different for the same name which might be because of wrong version of jars in both the class paths.

Can you share your use case if the different classes are desired.

, Druid (http://druid.io/) provides pluggable "deep storage" to store source of truth about its indexes. In side druid configuration, you can specify the specific module you would like to use. When I specify druid-hdfs-storage, Druid will dynamically download everything related to druid-hdfs-storage (that would include hadoop client jars too) via an URLClassLoader . Druid would put that classloader inside hadoop configuration (https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/8795792dba9aa35874d951c28d3c809fab88df43/extensions/hdfs-storage/src/main/java/io/druid/storage/hdfs/HdfsStorageDruidModule.java#L86) with the expectation that hadoop is going to use same., BTW, I understand that this is a corner case and Druid community is also working to improve the way pluggable extensions are managed so that there are less of these weird scenarios. However, I feel like it would be nice to fix this case in hadoop code as well, as Configuration.setClassloader(..) advertises same in its javadoc., OK seems reasonable to try first with class loader from {{conf}}. 

Patch attached currently does null check on the class loader  {{config.getClassLoader() == null}}, which gives a non null always. 
We should verify {{ServiceLoader<FileSystem> }} from conf class path and try with current thread class loader as fallback

If you want to update the patch and follow up the changes, please feel free to assign the JIRA to you., Thanks Kanaka.

I updated the patch to actually become more like override the "scheme name -> impl" map if there is same in the config classloader. this should cover all the cases included when something is there in thread context classloader but not in config classloader.
I don't mind taking a shot of fixing it myself, will assign the jira to myself. However, I will definitely need some help from seasoned contributors to get it finished all the way., Thanks for the updated patch [~himanshug]. LGTM +1 (Non Binding), -1

the existing codepath handles the {{config}} parameter being null. This patch assumes it is non null. This is exactly the kind of thing a good test would throw up, which is why we have that "tests unless its impossible to write a test" policy.
# add test for the null and non-null operations. {{TestFileSystemInitialization}} would be the class to add the tests too.
# fix the patch to handle both cases, \\

This message was automatically generated., [~stevel@apache.org] Thanks for the review. It is my fault. When I prepared the patch and tried to run build it failed for some other reason unrelated to this patch and needed for me to setup my dev machine appropriately to be able to do hadoop builds. I "thought" it was a "simple" change and went ahead with it.
I will fix my dev env to be able to do the build and update the patch soon., Don't worry about it: it's what the review process is for.

If there is one one lesson all of us working on Hadoop eventually learn, there are no "simple" changes -a one-liner may not add a major new feature, but it is at much risk of breaking things as the bigger patches. Hence the obsession with tests, Is this a compatible change?  It seems like changing the classloader that is in use might break some people who were relying on the existing one being used., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~stevel@apache.org]  HDFS-8750.004.patch should work, I couldn't figure out the unit testing for this given that static variable "FILE_SYSTEMS_LOADED" only lets loading happen once, so if any other unit test might end up calling the initialization and it will never be called again then.

[~cmccabe] yes, it might be backwards incompatible. I am not sure what is the right way to deal with that (may be include this only in a new major release of hadoop? ). Or, probably add a new configuration property , say "fs.use.config.cl", and load using config classloader only if that property is set to true. By default property value would be false to keep things backward compatible., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
