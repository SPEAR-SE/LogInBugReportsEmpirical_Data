Committing to 0.20-security and 0.20.205.
Thanks, Devaraj and Eric!, Note glitch in naming convention:  The first "HADOOP-7685.patch" is targeted for 0.20-security, while "HADOOP-7685-trunk.patch" and the second "HADOOP-7685.patch" are targeted for trunk.

I am committing the first "HADOOP-7685.patch" to 0.20-security and 0.20.205 now.
I will commit the other to trunk and 0.23 shortly., The patch for 0.20-security incorrectly incorporated the patch for HADOOP-7684 also.  The patch I actually applied after conflict resolution is now attached.
I'm assuming it is actually dependent on HADOOP-7684 being applied first, so marking it as a blocking bug., Committed to 0.20-security and 0.20.205.
