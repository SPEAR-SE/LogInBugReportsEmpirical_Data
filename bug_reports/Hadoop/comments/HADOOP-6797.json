[In case we would add or replace the fallback with :
{noformat}
InetAddress.getByName(ips[ctr]).getCanonicalHostName()
{noformat}

the default ip would match up again with the default dns., adding code to catch when {{InetAddress.getByName(ips[ctr])}} was null, presumably?, not sure if this could happen, but probably a good idea., Anything can go wrong with networking given a sufficiently large number of machines. 
HADOOP-3426 covers machines throwing exceptions on getting their local name, HDFS-116 is an NPE triggered by the same machine's "issues"
, I'm going to close this as stale at this point.]
