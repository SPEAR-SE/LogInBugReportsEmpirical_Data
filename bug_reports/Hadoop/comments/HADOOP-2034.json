[Arun, I'm afraid i cannot see the problem. Are you refering to the task count numbers below the x axis ?, Enis, if you look closely, the lines for some reduces seem to be charted for different scales i.e. the colours bleed into previous phases (copy, sort, reduce colours)., What is referred in this issue is that the red "sub-bar"s appear just below the 33% of the bar height. 

Each sub-bar averages the completion progress of its corresponding phase over several tasks, and each sub-bar is stacked on top of each other. So this is actually a feature, rather than a bug.

As per discussion in the IRC channel, closing this issue. If it causes confusion, one can reopen this issue.
