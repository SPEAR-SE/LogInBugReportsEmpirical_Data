This message is automatically generated., +1 (Nice Mockito test.), I've just committed this. Thanks Todd!, Patch for 20 attached., Think we should commit this to branch-20 as well. It's pretty nasty and a simple fix., I ran test-patch and committed this to branch 20., Why didn't you apply this to 0.21?, Because it was already committed to the 21 branch.]
