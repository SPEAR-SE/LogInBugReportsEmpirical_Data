[There's no checking for limits in the code; the configuration is got, expanded, @taskid@ replaced and then split on spaces. 

If something is happening here it may be related to command line length rather than java opt parsing. A quick trace shows that no attempt is made to glue together a string from the parsed pieces; the array is passed as is down to Sun's ProcessBuilder class; if something is playing up there -which is not impossible- then that's a serious problem

Paul, you'll have to do some research to see how replicable this is, include OS/JVM info in the bug report. If a test can replicate this, then it can be fixed., I added details of the environment in which this bug occurs.  This bug is *not* intermittent, it is easily reproduced.

Perhaps the most unusual thing about the runtime env is that Xen virtualization is involved.  The host OS seems to be fc8xen with the guest OS Ubuntu (Debian).

, I'm closing this as won't fix since this parameter is mostly deprecated in lieu of map and reduce specific environment vars.]
