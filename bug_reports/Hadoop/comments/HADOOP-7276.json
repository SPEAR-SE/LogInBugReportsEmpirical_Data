[This patch introduces an AM_CONDITIONAL called SPECIFY_DATA_MODEL that is disabled when host_cpu starts with "arm" (and is easily extensible for other CPUs). -m$(JVM_DATA_MODEL) is only added to AM_CFLAGS and AM_LDFLAGS when SPECIFY_DATA_MODEL is true., -1 overall.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/439//console

This message is automatically generated., No tests included because this change just fixes a build failure. Manually verified that x86-64 builds unchanged (-m64 is properly specified) and that ARM now builds (-m32 is not specified).

Findbugs issue seems to be a configuration issue unrelated to change. From console output:

Also, the precommit build queue (https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/) seems to be hanging multiple recent jobs at "Recording test results". They're still running at >1hr.

Would a committer please review the change and let me know if I need to resubmit it?, +1 looks good. I also verified the x64 native build still works.  , I don't see the findbugs warning locally. Don't think a test is needed since this to get the code compiling.
