[Looks like the reverting of the patch for HADOOP-1622 caused the testcase to break. Attaching the build.xml.diff file that is the output of the diff of build.xml files after and before reverting the patch.
diff build.xml.588771 build.xml.588585, Reassigning the issue to Owen since Owen did the patch revert which caused this issue., 
Looks like the revert (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=588771&view=rev) made a minor hash of build.xml... it removed 3 lines from a previous patch it shouldn't have:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/hadoop/trunk/build.xml?r1=588585&r2=588771&diff_format=h

I've checked to ensure that no other files were hurt by the revert:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/hadoop/trunk/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/filecache/DistributedCache.java?r1=588585&r2=588771&diff_format=h

One option to fix this is to go back to the revision before HADOOP-1622 got in and retroactively apply the later patches. Given that this is a minor fix (3 lines were lost from build.xml) I prefer to just supply a new patch and be done. Here it is...
