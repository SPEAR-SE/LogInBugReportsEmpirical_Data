[Hello,

Just to let you know: I'm having the same issues. As long as I have a semi-distributed 1 node setup, everything goes fine; it stalls with similar problems while Reduce'ing when I make a 2-node setup of it.

Did you manage to find the cause of the problem, and/or a fix/workaround?, Had this problem. Solved it by opening port 50060 in the firewall between nodes]
