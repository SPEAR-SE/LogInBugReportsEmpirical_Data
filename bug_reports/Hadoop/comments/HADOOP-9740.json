, Hey Doug,
I don't see this patch going into branch-2 release.
This patch just went into trunk.
Can anyone from the community please check in this patch into branch-2 ?, Since this is a fix to a feature that shipped in 2.0.3-alpha I committed this to branch-2 and branch-2.6 as well.  Thanks again, Allan!]
