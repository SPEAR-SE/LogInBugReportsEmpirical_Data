[This patch fixes 2 issues with jobtracker history logging. 
1. JobInProgress.kill() now logs jobs as failed instead of finished. 
2. For failed task attempts, the failure is not propagated to Task page until the taskAttempts fails max(4) no of times. Earlier the failed task attempt's error would be visible on task page even when a subsequent task attempt succeeded, which was confusing. 
, Submitting one more patch related to history with this bug ID. 
With this patch analyze history on WI will not attempt to analyze in case job did not succeed. 

note: it doesnt replace the existing patch, its in addition to that. , I think that we should push this to 0.8.0 since it is not a stability issue., I just committed this.  Thanks, Sanjay!]
