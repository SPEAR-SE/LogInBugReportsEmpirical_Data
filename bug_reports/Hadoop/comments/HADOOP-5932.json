[Discussed with Karam regarding this and looked at the logs. The bug happened due to a misplaced local variable myVmem initialization in MemoryMatcher.getMemReservedForTasks().

Quick patch for testing., Updated patch that completes the test-cases., +1 for the fix. There are comments I stumbled upon independently in the test cases which I've already raised in HADOOP-5934. So, I am not repeating those here under the assumption these will be fixed there.

Can you please upload the results of test-patch and capacity scheduler tests ?
Also, can you please make sure there's a patch that works for the 20 branch ?, ant test-patch passed. All capacity scheduler tests passed except TestQueueCapacities which is tracked at HADOOP-5646., The same patch applies for branch-0.20 also., I committed this to trunk and branch 0.20. Thanks, Vinod !]
