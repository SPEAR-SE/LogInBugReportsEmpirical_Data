[I've met the same test failure also. The cause of the test failure in my machine is that I enabled ACL in my macbook. After disabling it the test passed. 

But in the meanwhile, do we want to loose the check a little bit for the unit test? , Hi, [~yzhangal].  Thank you for the bug report.  I don't have a repro locally for this.  I suspect that you're running with Smack enabled on your local file system.  I believe the extra '.' indicator in the permission string indicates the presence of a Smack label.  For Jing, it would be a similar situation with '+' appended to files with an ACL on the local file system.

I suspect I know the root cause of this bug.  I'll post a patch later tonight., Hi Jing. 

Good to know that you also saw the same problem. I guess most developers take the default setting of ACL. I think it would be nice if the unit test is self-contained so its success/failure is not subject to which env setting we are running. So I wonder if the test itself can be modified to loose the ACL restriction, rather than to change the setting of a specific machine. 

What do you think?

Thanks.



, Hi Chris,

I was writing my last update and just saw yours. Cool you figured out the root cause of this bug! Thanks for following-up!

--Yongjun

, I'm attaching a patch with what I suspect is the fix.  [~yzhangal] or [~jingzhao], would one of you please try the patch in your environment to see if it works?  I'm not set up for a repro at the moment.

Here is a bit of background on this.  HADOOP-10220 enhanced {{FsPermission}} on the feature branch to add an ACL bit, indicating if the file has an ACL.  We then realized that the ACL bit had some problematic effects on the rest of the design, so we reverted it in HDFS-5923 and did something else.  However, we forgot to revert a change I had made in {{RawLocalFileSystem}}.  Previously, there had been a special case for ignoring the extra character on the permission string for local file systems using Smack or ACLs.  We can simply restore the old version of that code now that the ACL bit is gone.

Jenkins will -1 this patch for no new tests, but there isn't any way to write a reliable test for this, since it depends on the semantics of the dev environment's underlying local file system., Hi Chris, 

Thanks a lot for your quick patch.

I actually have tried to hack
{code}
  public static FsPermission valueOf(String unixSymbolicPermission) {
{code}
earlier today to allow length 11 and it worked for me.

I just tried your patch, and it works too.

One suggestion,  I think we can define "10" as a constant somewhere so it can be 
shared by multiple files involved for this implementation. I saw it appears multiple
times at different places.

Thanks.

HI,

I'm seeing trunk branch test failure locally (centOs6) today. And I identified it's this commit that caused the failure.
