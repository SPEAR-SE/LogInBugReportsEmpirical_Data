This message is automatically generated., I just found out that you have to be a full JIRA administrator to make fetching the custom Release Note field work the way it did before the upgrade.  I think I am going to try and switch this over to use the new REST API directly., A new version that uses the JIRA REST API.  No password/user name needed, it is much faster then jira.sh.  The parameters are left with username and password for backwards compatibility but they are ignored. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good overall, couple of minor comments:

* I suspect Python provides a built-in way to quote/escape HTML rather than having us do it manually in the script
* dictUnion(a,b) can be written as {{dict(b, **a)}} or if you prefer, {{ret = dict(b); ret.update(a)}}
* List comprehension syntax could simplify a lot of the small for loops, e.g.: strs = [ str(p) for p in self.parts ].  This is more of a style thing, some people are averse to the list comprehension syntax.
, Thanks for the review. I have addressed your comments with this latest patch.  cgi will support html escaping, so I use that.  there is a newer html lib in python 3, but I don't have that on my box., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the update!  One more thing -- I took a closer look at the Version class, and I think it could be simplified.  We're basically converting a version string to a list of numbers and comparing them in order.  Python already knows how to compare lists, so we can simply let it compare the lists directly.  For example:

{code}
class Version:
  """Represents a version number"""
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.parts = [ int(p) for p in data.split('.') ]
    # backfill version with zeroes if missing parts
    self.parts.extend((0,) * (3 - len(self.parts)))

  def decBugFix(self):
    self.parts[2] -= 1
    return self

  def __str__(self):
    return '.'.join([ str(p) for p in self.parts ])

  def __cmp__(self, other):
    return cmp(self.parts, other.parts)
{code}
, New version that addresses your latest comments.  It fixes version to allow arbitrary strings in addition to numbers, so 2.0.2-alpha works.  It also fixes some issues with unicode so users with non-ascii names should work too., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
