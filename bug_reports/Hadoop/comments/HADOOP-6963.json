This message is automatically generated., Thanks Bobby! The findbugs warning is because I am ignoring an IOException. I can do that because I am already setting isSymLink to false during initialization. , I can see that, but we need to filter it either by bumping the findbugs count in hadoop-common-project/dev-support/test-patch.properties

or by adding something to 

hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/pom.xml

similar to 

{code}
    </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>findbugs-maven-plugin</artifactId>
         <configuration>
          <findbugsXmlOutput>true</findbugsXmlOutput>
          <xmlOutput>true</xmlOutput>
          <excludeFilterFile>${mr.examples.basedir}/dev-support/findbugs-exclude.xml</excludeFilterFile>
          <effort>Max</effort>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
{code}

I would prefer the second because it is less likely to mask other errors, but I am fine either way.

Please also update the 1.0.2 patch similarly so test-patch will work there too., Thanks Bobby! I modofied my own code to include a statement in the catch clause. I ran findbugs on my local computer and it did not generate any new warnings. Hopefully this should pass, Uploading a new patch for 1.0.2 with the same change to get rid of the findbugs warning, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, I just wanted to come back and say this was a very peculiar case too.
- The cycle has to be nested within another cycle. Inside the inner cycle an ELOOP is thrown by the kernel, which (I don't understand how) causes it to abandon that branch and come back to the outer loop. This probably also clears the stack, so that the JVM stack doesn't exhaust the memory either. (In our case, the process had been running for 9 days without getting an OOME)., A guess at why an Exception is not thrown when an ELOOP is received. File.exists() is the first method called with the path which should trigger the ELOOP and this is probably returning false which then causes the recursion to unroll until the outer loop., Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.0.3., Looks like we forgot to update the upgraded commons-io version in hadoop-core-pom-template.xml, which breaks downstream projects (e.g. HBase)., I see HADOOP-8417 has been filed! Thanks for reporting this Luke]
