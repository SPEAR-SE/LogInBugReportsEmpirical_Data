[[~zjshen] Thanks for filing the issue. The context/use-case for this came about when looking at trying to integrate Tez with Timeline for ACLs. Given that Timeline today does not support incremental updates to ACLs, to update ACLs one needs to parse the original ACL string and update it with additional users/groups. The AccessControlList class being made public would be very useful for this. , Thanks for describing a concrete use case. I've uploaded a simple patch to mark the class \@Public and make getUsers/Groups public, too., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
