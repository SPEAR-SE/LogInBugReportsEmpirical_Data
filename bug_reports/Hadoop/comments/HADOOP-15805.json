[Attach the screen-shot in my local. In the top of left side, we can see hadoop logo isn't showed correctly., Looks like we'd need to update 10224 locations with the new url.

[~elek], Is it ok if we add hadoop logo to images directory inside [static|https://github.com/apache/hadoop-site/tree/asf-site/static] to make the old url's work with [http://hadoop.apache.org/images/hadoop-logo.jpg]?, Sure, let's copy/move the logo to the right location inside static/ to get exactly the same url as before.

[~Sandeep Nemuri] Are you working on a patch? I can review/commit if you have one..., [~elek], I got a patch with necessary changes, However i don't have permissions to upload it here.

Could you please help me with the permissions? , Unfortunately I can't give you permission.  [~anu] or [~arpiagariu] can do it. (AFAIK), [~Sandeep Nemuri] Added you to the Contributors group. You should be able upload patches now., Thank you [~anu] :) 

[~elek], Attaching the patch (binary) with necessary changes. [^HADOOP-15805.001.patch] Kindly review. , | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~Sandeep Nemuri] for fixing this. I agree to copy the picture rather than update so many wrong urls. Let's wait [~elek] for the review since he will be more familiar with this, :)., +1. Let's try to be backward compatible, when possible. There is no cost of keeping the image in the old location.
, Just committed to the asf-site branch of hadoop-site repository. The url is working again: https://hadoop.apache.org/images/hadoop-logo.jpg

Thanks [~linyiqun] the report and [~Sandeep Nemuri] the patch., Thanks for the review and commit [~elek]]
