[Trunk patch for eliminating the configuration names that start with "OLD_", since they never existed in a Hadoop release.  We should try to get this in for 2.6.

Testing: I ran "mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pnative" from top-level, as well as "mvn test" from hadoop-tools/hadoop-aws with the FS contract tests configured.

This patch should also apply cleanly to branch-2., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
