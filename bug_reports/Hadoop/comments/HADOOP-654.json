[# failures should be visible by node on the job tracker UI.
Nodes that are not getting jobs should be highlighted on the UI.
, The number of failures on each task tracker is already on the web/ui.

I propose a very simple mechanism where each job can configure the maximum number of task failures that it will tolerate from a single node.

JobConf gets:
   void setMaxTaskFailuresPerHost(int newValue);
   int getMaxTaskFailuresPerHost();

JobInProgress keeps a Map from task tracker id to counts of failures. Each task failure increments the count for the responsible tracker. (Should lost task trackers count as 1 failures or lots of failures?)

When the tracker is asking for new tasks, if it has failed too many times, it is not given a new task. Note that these counts (and penalty boxes) are per a job.

Does that sound like a reasonable starting point?, We also need the web/ui for a job to list the black listed nodes for that job.

The job needs to be killed if there are no non-blacklisted task trackers., that would be a great starting point.
later on JT could instruct TT to shut down based on a more global error rate/number, Looks like Owen's nailed it for a decent first-cut which can be enhanced at a later point for features like global error-rate, asking TT to shut-down etc. 
I'll get on with the first-cut..., Early patch for review while I continue further testing and add the webui to view the black-listed nodes..., Here is a complete patch with necessary enhancements and webui.
 Appreciate any f/b while I continue testing..., Updated patch for review..., A new patch with slightly better diagnostic messages..., I just committed this.  Thanks, Arun!]
