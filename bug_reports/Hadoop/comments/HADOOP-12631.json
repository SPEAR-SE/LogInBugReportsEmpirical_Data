[Yes, UNC paths are not supported currently.  Unfortunately, this is unlikely to change soon.  The {{Path}} class is in wide use throughout the whole Hadoop ecosystem, so any changes there have a high burden of testing and investigation for backwards-compatibility impacts.  In the meantime, I have successfully used mapped network drives (i.e. using the "net use" command) as a workaround., Thanks for your response, i will use the mapping at the moment., Hi [~cnauroth], I need to access the same URI from both Windows and Linux, which requires leading double slash in path.  Is there a way to workaround this bug?, Hi [~cnauroth], in {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path#initialize}} you shouldn't call {{java.net.URI#normalize}}, which is known to be buggy and destroys UNC path.]
