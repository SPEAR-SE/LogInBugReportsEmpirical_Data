[The whole point of having KEYS, sigs, etc come from a different server is to make sure that the mirror site didn't get compromised.  This is why httpd, maven, etc, are all doing the same thing--we all point to dist.apache.org to download these files.  These files are lightweight compared to the rest of the content and should be fine to be downloaded from apache.org.

, I meant that the files need to be served from the ASF mirror *sources*, i.e.

https://www.apache.org/dist/hadoop/...

That is an ASF host, just as is:

https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/hadoop/..., Note that KEYS, sigs and hashes are deliberately not synched to 3rd party mirrors.]
