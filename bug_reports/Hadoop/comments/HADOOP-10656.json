This message is automatically generated., Hi, [~brandonli].  Nice catch, and thank you for fixing it.

This is not directly related to your patch, but I noticed that the {{LdapGroupsMapping#extractPassword}} method is susceptible to a file descriptor leak.  If one of the {{Reader#read}} calls throws an {{IOException}}, then we won't close the {{Reader}}.  Do you think we could fix this while we're in this class?  I think we'd just need to move the {{Reader#close}} call into a finally block., Thanks for the review, [~cnauroth]. Let's use this JIRA to fix both issues. I've uploaded a new patch. , {code}
    } finally {
      if (reader != null)
        try {
          reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
          LOG.warn("Could not close password file: " + pwFile, e);
        }
    }
{code}

Minor nit-pick: In the above, can you please add curly braces after the if statement, just to clarify the nesting?  Alternatively, you could replace that code segment with {{IOUtils#cleanup}}.  +1 for the patch after that small change.  Thank you again, Brandon!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
