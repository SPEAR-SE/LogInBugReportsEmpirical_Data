[any ideas [~asuresh]?, looks like the underlying issue is CURATOR-221, I'm investigating if there is a workaround we can use., Here's a patch that addresses the issue and has a test.

Here's a description I wrote in CURATOR-221:
{quote}
Yes, although in my case it's a bit complicated. If you look at HADOOP-11973, to keep the external vs internal client impl similar, I want to initialize the final CuratorFramework object in the constructor, which means I want to use the namespace-aware version. So, I could create the nodes before I call usingNamespace, but then I have to deal with exception handling, which I don't want to do in the constructor. So essentially I have to do:

    call usingNamespace(ns) in the constructor
    in startThreads, call usingNamespace(null) and then create the parents manually.

This message was automatically generated., Fix whitespace/style and unset thread local at end of test so other tests are not affected., Thanks for the patch [~gchanan],
