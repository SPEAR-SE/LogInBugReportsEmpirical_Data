[Marking this as a blocker for 0.17.0; build-contrib.xml wastefully sets maxMemory to *1.2GB* - needs to be fixed, along with TestUlimit.java., Patch which fixes TestUlimit by reducing the 'maxMemory' of the src/contrib's junit tests, and ensures that it is respected by StreamUtil.makeJavaCommand (which has been broken for a long while...).

I had to also fix TestStreamingExitStatus which has an unnecessary 'tearDown' which occassionally fails; removed it completely., > I had to also fix TestStreamingExitStatus ...
