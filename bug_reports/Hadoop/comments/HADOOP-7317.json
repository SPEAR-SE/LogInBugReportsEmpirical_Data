This will create issues when clients are trying to switch the NNs in HA.
We used to get the EOFExceptions when we just do stopProxy and recreate again. Observation is that, sometimes it was getting old references as well. Call on that old referances were getting EOFExceptions.
Shall we provide an API on client which will destroy completely?


-Thanks
 Uma, Hi Todd,
Any comments on this?, I got bitten by this at MAPREDUCE-3333. MR AM creates lots of connections to NodeManagers to launch containers and on a big enough cluster, MR AM is hitting the #processes limits set on nodes (2048). I am working around temporarily by setting the RPC client maxIdleTime to zero.

Any ideas on how we can fix this?]
