[let's try this on jenkins., I think you also may want to convert amd64 to i686.  Just as a comment: although not changed in this jira (it's in the patch context), I don't think -m32 is really applicable to the linker flags but it doesn't hurt anything., Yeah, you're right.

It seems that CMake gets CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR from the output of "uname -p", and on some older versions of Linux this could return "amd64."

As for passing -m32 to the linker... there are some online sources that recommend doing this for a 32-bit-build-on-64.  The GNU ld documents themselves seem silent on -m32 itself, although they do talk about some other options to -m.  So it's probably best to leave this for now, until we can determine that it's not needed..., This was fixed as part of HADOOP-8368]
