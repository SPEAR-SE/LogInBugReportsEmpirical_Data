[Number of maps is now computed as follows:

numMaps = max(1, min(numFiles,  numNodes*10, totalBytes/256MB, 10000)).

Plus added reporting status for every file (or every 32MB - approx 10 seconds) so that tasks dont timeout while copying huge files.

This fix is part of the patch attached to hadoop-220.]
