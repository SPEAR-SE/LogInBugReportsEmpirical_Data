[I went to the website to see if I could find the link, and indeed it seems to be missing. 

I did find it after looking for it under the developer documentation section in the Wiki [1].

[1] http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GitAndHadoop, The GitAndHadoop Wiki page is a bit ambiguous; I guess it started when Hadoop had only a read-only Git mirror, and has only been partly updated.
The introduction should make it clear that Hadoop now uses Git for development, as it appears at first glance to be only about 3rd party use.

It's fine to use the Wiki for documenting developer info, but there really ought to be links for SCM - and the developer info - on the main website.
These can of course point to the Wiki., BTW, someone just renamed
HowToCommitWithGit to
HowToCommit
This has broken the link in GitAndHadoop.]
