[I'll try to keep things properly classified here so that we can see what the actual fallout of the change was, RE: bugs vs. new features, etc., FYI, updated the release notes on HADOOP-9902 to the current state of the world, mostly reflecting the work done in the children here., An update!

Only 8 issues remain open that are still listed as children of this one. Most of these could be considered optional or fix later or whatever, but hopefully the progress will continue to close these. :D, Over a year later and there are only a handful of tasks left.  I'm going to raise them to full issues and close this one.]
