[This patch is getting stale.
Is there any reason for not committing this?
I'm getting FD related exceptions in my windows nightly build.
, Wouldn't it be better to change DF to do 'new File(path).getCanonicalPath()', rather than change the caller?, This would also work. But there are 2 other places that already pass canonical paths.
So we will have to change these two callers in order to avoid repetitive parsing of already 
canonical paths. , > there are 2 other places that already pass canonical paths

Wouldn't it be better to change these?  That would minimize code replication, a good thing., I did two variants.
- DFConstructor.patch converts path to the canonical form inside the DF constructor.
I also changed FSDataset() to just simply return the path without canonicalizing it.
- DFPath2File.patch changes the path parameter type from String to File.
I String version constructors are deprecated.
I like this version better for 2 reasons: it makes it clear for the callers what needs to
be passed, and it does less File to String conversions.
, I just committed this.  Thanks, Konstantin!]
