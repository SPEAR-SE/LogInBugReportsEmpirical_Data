[Maybe just update BUILDING.txt to indicate snappy.lib is required? Seems like with this patch we could end up copying two snappy lib files and think it's fine to just doc the required dirs., Looking at our code again, I think it requires the library to be dynamic, so I can just skip the {{.a}} stuff.  We use {{dlopen}}, and I don't think that works with {{.a}} (static) libraries.

At that point, there no danger of making two copies of the {{.so}} file, since the second copy would overwrite the first.  If the developer puts two different copies of libsnappy.so in {{$\{snappy.lib\}}} or {{$\{snappy.prefix\}}}, I think we can safely discount that as user error., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., After thinking about it, I think I agree with Eli's suggestion here.  Let's just update the docs.  It's the easiest option for everyone.

The docs need to be updated anyway because they're missing a few of the newer options., slightly improved version, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good, minor nits:
- "-Dsnappy.prefix or -Dsnappy.lib" should be "and"
- "if Snappy is missing" should be  "and snappy is not installed on your host"
- "Most of the time, these options should not be necessary" should be something like "These options are not required if the snappy libraries and headers are installed in the system lib and includes directories.", I reworded this a bit.  Thinking about it, I realized the snappy options might look better in a single section.  Also there should be some intro text about what the heck snappy is before launching into these details.

bq. "-Dsnappy.prefix or -Dsnappy.lib" should be "and"

Seemed better to give each option its own section, I got rid of the 'or' completely...

bq. "Most of the time, these options should not be necessary" should be something like "These options are not required if the snappy libraries and headers are installed in the system lib and includes directories."

I replaced this with "You do not need this option if you have installed snappy through... a package manager", +1 looks great. Attaching a slight updated version with some small tweaks., I've committed this, thanks Colin!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #1151 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1151/])
