This message is automatically generated., hdfsproxy tests fails with the following stacktrace.. 
I doesnt looks like a classpath issue with commons-cli, as we already have commons-cli in the classpath .. 


can someone take a look at this failure:
Here is the stack trace for the error:
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Patch-vesta.apache.org/479/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfsproxy/TestHdfsProxy/testHdfsProxyInterface/

tnx, For  Zhiyong Zhang:

Can you tell me which Hadoop version is it?

Seems it dated back to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5961


The DataNode change caused some in-consistency as TestHdfsProxy used the
DataNode. 

I cannot reproduce the error in my dev machine. 

Thanks.

zhiyong, This happens on the latest trunk code.. 
here is the report.
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch-vesta.apache.org/479/testReport/

I can reproduce it in my machine.. , steps to reproduce:

checkout the latest trunk
apply this path(this patch fixes the streaming test failures introduced by the DataNode changes)
ant test-contrib 

test-junit target of hdsfproxy fails !


, updated Affected version/s , Hi,
Could you tell me which machine are you running to get the errors?

I tried several machines without any error. 

Here is what I did. 
svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/core/trunk/ hadoop-5989
cd hadoop-5989
patch -p0 <../HADOOP-5989.patch
ant test-contrib

Thanks.

Zhiyong.


, Even I'm not able to reproduce the failure with the latest code updated from svn trunk.

This message is automatically generated., It's the same failure happening again for hdfsproxy tests. 
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch-vesta.apache.org/487/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfsproxy/TestHdfsProxy/testHdfsProxyInterface/



, I'm thinkin of opening a different jira for hdfsproxy test failure.
Its been long time since the streaming tests on trunk is failing, so I'm going to commit this and let trunk run the streaming contrib tests..  


, I just committed this!

Opened jira hadoop-6007 for disucssing the hdfsproxy test failures.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6007, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #863 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/863/])
