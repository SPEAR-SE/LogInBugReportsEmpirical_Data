[MacPort includes md5sum, so that is the easy way out. But code to detect and use the appropriate md5 tool would be fine., cygwin also has a md5sum command.

Actually, it is easy to write a little java program to compute MD5. One way is to add a main method in org.apache.hadoop.io.MD5Hash., saveVersion.sh was replaced with create_release.sh which does some... interesting... things to work around this problem.]
