This message is automatically generated., +1 Although I'd suggest breaking out some of the code into a new method to allow a unit test to be written., This would also impact fsck as it goes through the same code path.

@Dayrn i will take a look and see what can be done to add the ability to write a test for it., oops meant Daryn :), Yeah, I agree that it would be good to make a separate function., branch-1 patch where i have created a method in KerberosUtil to get service principal. Let me know this approach looks good and will do the same for trunk., Here is the output of test patch for branch 1

Findbugs warnings are unrelated to this patch., Looks good, but I'm curious when it would be legitimate to pass null or an empty string for the host?, @Dayrn

I just replicated what we do in SecurityUtil.replacePattern for the same, +1 Ok., Will work on a trunk patch that follows the same approach., patch for trunk.

Instead of using SecuirtyUtil.getLocalHostname add a similar method in KerberosUtil as hadoop-auth depending on hadoop-common creates a circular dependency., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
