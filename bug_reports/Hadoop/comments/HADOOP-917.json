[Attached patch reproduces the NPE in trunk version of hadoop:

java.lang.NullPointerException
        at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter$MergeQueue.merge(SequenceFile.java:2392)
        at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile$Sorter.merge(SequenceFile.java:2087)
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask$MapOutputBuffer.mergeParts(MapTask.java:498)
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask.run(MapTask.java:191)
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.LocalJobRunner$Job.run(LocalJobRunner.java:109)
, It looks like if a map output sorter has to do a multi-way merge, it crashes with a null pointer trying to create the temporary file name., The problem was that the merge code was assuming that outputFile was set and it wasn't in that context. I've changed the API to the merge code so that the methods that don't have an output file pass in the tmpDirectory where files should be created., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12350504/multi-level-merge.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r503864., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!, Thanks Owen! patched fixed the problem. ]
