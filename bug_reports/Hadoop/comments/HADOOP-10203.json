This message is automatically generated., [~stevel@apache.org] I've moved the StorageObject because I've switched to s3Service.getObjectDetails. This method will perform a HEAD request rather than attempt a full file download. , +1, the patch looks good to me. I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks a lot for the contribution, Andrei., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5042 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5042/])
