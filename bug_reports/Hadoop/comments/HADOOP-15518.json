[This is a race condition if multiple instances of AuthenticationFilters are chained together by accident, and the token has already been checked once by first instance of AuthenticationFilter, and the token has not been committed to HttpResponse.  "authenticate" method will get called twice.  The javadoc is not wrong, except how to go about validating the current request is already authenticated is not trivial when token has not been received by browser yet.  It might be possible to add checks for either HttpRequest.getRemoteUser() or HttpResponse header committing state to see if Authentication had already occurred to prevent the race condition., +1 The patch looks good to me., [~eyang] - it is unclear to me where the race condition is. My assumption is that the filters are invoked linearly so a second filter shouldn't be invoked until the request state is set properly.

[~kminder] - this seems an appropriate change to me and worth adding tests for.

[~owen.omalley] - are we missing anything in this implementation and assumptions about the HTTP client only being authenticated once by AuthenticationFilter?, [~lmccay] {quote}it is unclear to me where the race condition is. My assumption is that the filters are invoked linearly so a second filter shouldn't be invoked until the request state is set properly.{quote}

Your assumption is correct, and the diagram might help to explain the race conditions.

HIgh level of the sequence of events of a normal setup:

| Time | Browser | HttpRequest | HttpResponse |
| 1 | Send WWW-Authenticate 1 | | |
| 2 | | AuthenticationFilter checks WWW-Authenticate 1 |  |
| 3 | | Call authenticate to verify WWW-Authenticate 1 ticket with KDC | |
| 4 | | Set User principal and remote user via Java security callbacks | |
| 5 | | | AuthenticationFilter writes WWW-Authenticate 2 |
| 6 | | | Business logic |
| 7 | Received WWW-Authenticate 2 | | |

Events of duplicated AuthenticationFilters are:

| Time | Browser | HttpRequest | HttpResponse |
| 1 | WWW-Authenticate 1 | | |
| 2 | | AuthenticationFilter Instance 1 Check WWW-Authenticate 1 |  |
| 3 | | Call authenticate to verify WWW-Authenticate 1 ticket with KDC | |
| 4 | | Set User principal and remote user via Java security callbacks | |
| 5 | | | AuthenticationFilter Instance 1 writes WWW-Authenticate 2 |
| 6 | | AuthenticationFilter Instance 2 Check WWW-Autnenticate 1 | AuthenticationFilter Instance 2 rewrites HTTP status with 403 |

Browser has never retrieved WWW-Authenticate 2 header from server because HttpResponse is still buffered on server side.  The race condition is between HttpRequest at time 6 is still using existing ticket 1 without using the new ticket 2 that is issued at time 5.  Second Filter is invoked at time 6 using out dated data., [~eyang] < Can you please clarify if your comment about a race condition is a criticism of the patch?  I'm having trouble rationalizing your +1 with your other comments.  Are you really trying to say that the patch solves the race condition?, [~kminder] Race condition is not a criticism of this patch.  It is byproduct of having multiple instances of AuthenticationFilter that authenticate method is called more than once due to lack of checking that the current request is already authenticated.  My above comment is showing the states prior to this patch.  Thank you for the patch., Thanks [~kminder]

I checked this change in below cases.
 # Accessed RM old UI and new YARN UI from kerberized browser when AuthenticationFilter is configured and Http Auth Type was kerberos.
 # Both UI were accessible when Http Auth Type was configured as JWTRedirectAuthenticationHandler.

Before this patch, we were getting replay attack for Ui2 as multiple auth handlers were present. For ui2, I have found that initial /ui2 will get 401 from Auth handler and then later it ll accept request as proper cookie were present in new request. But jetty will do a next redirect (not from client side) to access /ui2/index.html which will not have this cookie. Hence was getting GSS exception.

Since this patch checks for principal as well, I think it looks fine. cc [~vinodkv] [~eyang], This looks good, [~kminder]. +1, One foot note about this change.  If multiple AuthenticationFilters are configured, and service principal names are different.  TGS granted to remote client is the principal name of the first AuthenticationFilter that gets triggered.  This may look unexpected when auditing where user has been through klist.  The ability to configure different HTTP principals on the same server port configuration shouldn't exist, but developer should be aware of the API imperfection to avoid getting to this hole., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

{code}, [~eyang] This latest issue (Problem accessing /proxy/application_1528498597648_0001/) is a different problem, correct?

bq.If multiple AuthenticationFilters are configured, and service principal names are different

Are you mentioning a case where AuthenticationFilter is added multiple time (like Spnego Filter and authentication) but will use different keytab? , [~sunilg] Multiple AuthenticationFilters configured with different service principal names is a corner case that shouldn't exist but the code is allowing this to happen.  Comments in this JIRA and YARN-8108 should explain why this is unsupported use case.

The casting problem is using the same HTTP principal and YARN code is activating multiple filters that based on AuthenticationFilter.  Token casting issue didn't exist prior to this patch.  This patch is making assumption that filters based on AuthenticationFilter would make compatible tokens, which RMAuthenticationFilter and AuthenticationFilter don't make the same type of token.  Thus, the casting problem occurs.  This problem can be eliminated by applying same type of AuthenticationFilter on a server port.  YARN-8108 can fix YARN resource manager.  There might be other places in Hadoop that might have similar problems, like KMSAuthenticationFilter and DelegationTokenAuthenticationFilter that need to be reviewed to understand the impact of this change., Thanks [~eyang] for the pointer as per offline discussion. I have changed *getUserPrincipal* to *getRemoteUser* and this change seems working fine. GSS exception could be avoided like the patch attached here. Moreover since we check for getRemoteUser, class cast exception also wont happen as in the case Eric pointed above. So i think this patch could be improved by checking for getRemoteUser. , bq. I have changed getUserPrincipal to getRemoteUser and this change seems working fine. 
That was my first solution too. [~kminder], would that work?]
