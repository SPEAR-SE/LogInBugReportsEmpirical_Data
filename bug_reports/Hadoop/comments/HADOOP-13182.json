[There is no direct link to it in http://hadoop.apache.org, but if you clink the "Wiki" tab, there is a developer documentation section.
May be we could add a section below "Download Hadoop" that contains the link to the wiki page., I would expect to find the link near the "Issue Tracker" menu item, e.g. as the next link.
It's not as important as the Download link.]
