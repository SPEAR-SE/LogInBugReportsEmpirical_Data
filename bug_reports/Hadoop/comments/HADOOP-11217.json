[The patch sets the sslEnabledProtocols to TLSv1,TLSv1.1. I would have also added TLSv1.2, but Java 6 doesn't support it (we can add it when we drop Java 6 support).

This message is automatically generated., I was accidentally testing with Java 7 instead of 6.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me. Discussed with Robert offline, and he clarified my one concern with the second output: it says {{Protocol : SSLv3}} and {{Verify return code: 0 (ok)}}. 

Can some security expert eyeball the changes as well? 
, +1, this change looks good to me as well.

, Addendum patch re-enables "SSLv2Hello", which is required for older clients (e.g. Java 6 with openssl 0.9.8x) so they can't connect without it.  Just to be clear, it does not mean SSLv2, which is insecure., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
