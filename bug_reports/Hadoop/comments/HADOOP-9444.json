[[~cos], this doesn't seem to indicate missing securityInfo, but we can confirm. I need a little more information:
 - What is security.resourcetracker.protocol.acl set to in your hadoop-policy.xml?
 - What is yarn.nodemanager.principal in yarn-site.xml ?
 - Must already be the case, but can you verify if RMNMSecurityInfoClass.class and the text file org.apache.hadoop.security.SecurityInfo are on the classpath of ResourceManager?, This is from Bigtop testing so I can make the cluster available for you (I'll need your public ssh key -- please send it to me offline pref. PGP encoded). Now, to answer your questions:

bq. What is security.resourcetracker.protocol.acl set to in your hadoop-policy.xml?

${HADOOP_YARN_USER} which acording to the process environment translates to yarn

bq. What is yarn.nodemanager.principal in yarn-site.xml ?

yarn/_HOST@BIGTOP

bq. RMNMSecurityInfoClass.class and the text file org.apache.hadoop.security.SecurityInfo are on the classpath of ResourceManager?

Yes it is.

Please let me know if you need any more info or if you'd like to get access to the cluster., So it appears that $substitution in hadoop-policy.xml is broken. 

I propose that we simply change all the $value into '*' which will make the entries in hadoop-policy.xml fully consistent and also seems to fix the problem.

Patch attached., I think it works around the problem rather than fixes it, doesn't it?, I totally agree that it needs to be investigated. That said, if we have to rush 2.0.4-alpha I'd say the proposed patch might be a reasonable workaround., Guys, I've updated the the description of the JIRA to be better reflect the latest findings. I'm leaving it as a blocker for now expecting somebody else to chime in and propose whether we apply a patch I provide or RELNOTE this if there's not enough time to get to the bottom of the issue., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Apologies, this one slipped through.

I see that HADOOP-9178 added this file in src/main/conf, but cannot trace the history back to when the variable thingie was added.

+1 for the patch. eclipse:eclipse is failing for me even without the patch.

Checking this in., I just committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.0.4-alpha. Thanks Roman!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3538 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3538/])
