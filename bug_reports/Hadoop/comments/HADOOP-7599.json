[Setup scripts for setting up secure Hadoop cluster.

For usage of the scripts run:

{noformat}
hadoop-setup-conf.sh -h
hadoop-setup-hdfs.sh -h
{noformat}

*Prerequisite*

keytab files are pre-generated and placed in /etc/security/keytabs.

*Setup sequence*

{noformat}
# Run on all nodes
sudo hadoop-setup-conf.sh --java-home=...
# Run on nematode
sudo hadoop-setup-hdfs --config ...
# Run on datanodes
sudo hadoop-daemon.sh --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR start datanode
# Run on jobtracker as mapreduce user
hadoop-daemon.sh --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR start jobtracker
# Run on tasktracker as mapreduce user
hadoop-daemon.sh --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR start tasktracker

This message is automatically generated., Some comments:
1. The mapred system dir should be 700ed 
2. The -format is always called by default in hadoop-setup-hdfs. Can we make the formatting done based on command line option (-format) provided by the user running the script. I really don't want implicit namenode formatting.
3. We could let the directory /mapred be group owned by the system group.
4. The --datanodes & --tasktrackers options - could they be made optional? They might be already optional. Please confirm.
5. Could we live with namenode-url instead of replacing it with namenode-host (ditto for jobtracker-url). I also see you changed a couple of other places in a backward incompatible way (like HADOOP_JT_HOST, taskcontroller ownership). Want to avoid incompatible changes.
6. Why did we remove the call to hadoop-setup-config.sh from src/packages/hadoop-setup-conf.sh
7. The group is hardcoded to 'hadoop' in a couple of places. Can we avoid that?
8. I see commented-out lines in hadoop-setup-conf.sh. Please remove those.
9. I don't think we should blindly overwrite the conf files in the config directory. We probably should warn & exit if the conf directory already has some files within. The user can probably use --force if he wants to avoid the warning.
10. All the components in the path leading up to taskcontroller.cfg has to be owned by root. Have this checked.
11. Where is HADOOP_SECURE_DN_LOG_DIR used?
12. A whole lot of configuration options that you added in the *-site.xml files are already there in *-default.xml. We don't need those. We only need the security related ones. Also, we don't want to play with the non-security configs like mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum.,  # I will polish this.
 # I will polish this.
 # I will polish this.
 # --datanodes and --tasktrackers are already optional
 # this is a bug fix.  namenode-host is more widely used than namenode-url.  It is better to make the name changes.  This script was only working internally in RPM post installation script.  Therefore, it does not break backward compatibility in this name changes.
 # I don't understand this.
 # I will polish this.
 # I will polish this.
 # By default, hadoop tar ball ships with empty configuration files.  Consequencely, if --force flag is implemented, --force  flag becomes mandatory in order to run the script.  This is counter productive to have this flag because user will always use --force flag in order to run the setup script.  User will take this for granted and --force loses it's ability to safe guard user from making mistakes.
 # I will polish this.
 # HADOOP_SECURE_DN_LOG_DIR is used in hadoop-daemon.sh
 # I will polish this., bq. 6. Why did we remove the call to hadoop-setup-config.sh from src/packages/hadoop-setup-conf.sh

Previously, hadoop-setup-conf.sh refers to $PREFIX/libexec/hadoop-config.sh to source existing HADOOP environment variables.  It is safer to make hadoop-setup-conf.sh independent from existing environment to avoid recursively append of environment variables, i.e. HADOOP_LOG_DIR=/var/log/hadoop/root/root., Addressing Devaraj's concerns in bulletin item 1,2,3,7,8,10,12., -1 overall.

1. Don't chmod the keytab dir contents to 755. The keytab files should be owned by the user running the respective daemon, and 700ed.
2. On the bullet#9 in my last comment, you can do a check for empty config files (like if the strings '<property>' and/or '<value>' occurs, the config file is not empty). Not pretty but safer.. Long term, Hadoop could stop shipping the empty config files., - Make sure keytab file ownership are setup correctly., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I believe that for a simple setup what Eric is doing is okay, and I would like to have it in 205.  Please go ahead and commit, and we can continue making it better in the next release, perhaps by using rpm and deb upgrade/update features as Devaraj mentioned.  Thanks., Please remove the config properties that aren't generated by the scripts in this patch (bullet 12 in my first comment). I also noticed now that there are references to 'hadoop' group still present.

Lets discuss.., I am going to commit the patch in 0.23. When Yarn stabilizes, we can raise another jira and do the appropriate fixes., Committed the patch on 0.23 and trunk.

, I think that by including the contents of the {{templates/}} directories, this patch introduced several release audit warnings. See [this for pre-commit Jenkins run|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/186/artifact/trunk/hadoop-common-project/patchprocess/patchReleaseAuditProblems.txt] for an example.

Was the inclusion of these files intentional? If so, should we just add the relevant directories to RAT's exclude list(s)?, Aaron, inclusion of the files are intentional.  However, we probably want to put license on the files.  I filed HADOOP-7641 to track the license changes.  Thanks, Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0]
