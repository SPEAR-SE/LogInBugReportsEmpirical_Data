[The v1 patch uses proper barrier for thread coordination., Hi Luke. I think the CountdownLatch should be a local variable in newSleepingConsumerQueue -- otherwise, the latch gets reused between test functions., I was planning to use the latch for other tests as well. The latch will not be reused because junit creates a new instance of the test object for each test method: http://martinfowler.com/bliki/JunitNewInstance.html
, aha, I guess I learn something new every day :)

Nonetheless since it's only used in that local scope for now, why not minimize it? Makes it easier to understand that it's only triggered from that thread and awaited from the other., Patch v2 make the barrier local for better readability., +1. Will commit to trunk momentarily (manually ran the one changed test case), Committed to trunk., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #604 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/604/])
