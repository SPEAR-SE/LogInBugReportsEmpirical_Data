[Instead of {{mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true}}
 try {{mvn install -DskipTests}}


{{-Dmaven.test.skip=true}} will avoid compiling tests and installing test jar, which is what its expecting, {{hadoop-auth:jar:tests:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT}}

where as {{-DskipTests}} will just skip running the tests, but compiles and installs test jar to local repo., thank you!]
