[I disagree that we should remove this. It may be noise to a developer, but its good information for those who need to maintain and support them. Its a great indicator sometimes that the client configs are tweaked or are out of sync. There are a lot of other benefits I've seen as a result of this in the field.

However, we (very recently) did stop logging that if the overriding value is the same.]
