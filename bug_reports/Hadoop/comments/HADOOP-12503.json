[The solution here could be: ActiveStandbyElector could take a additional constructor argument to give the users option on whether they want the retry on establishing zk connection or not. So, we will not break any previous behavior, especially for HDFS ZKFC.

We will fix this together in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4243]
