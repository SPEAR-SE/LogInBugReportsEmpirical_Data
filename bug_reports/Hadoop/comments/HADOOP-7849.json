[hadoop-env.sh which is already present is supposed to be active and the new hadoop-env.sh installed with the rpm is supposed to be installed as .rpmsave file. From the previous comment I think that is what has happened. In this case the active hadoop-env.sh (old hadoop-env.sh) is updated.

Reason for the updated hadoop-evn.sh is that ; template_generator is getting called as part of the rpm installation which re-generates hadoop-env.sh again.

this is by design., should it then not update all the other config files in the dir like core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml etc. Why is the file hadoop-env.sh the only one that gets updated with new data., As I mentioned before its by design. Its only hadoop-env that requires the log dir and pid dir with the right set of ownership and permissions and be added to the default hadoop-env.sh.
