[doesn't appear to happen to branch-2, even with HADOOP-14520 in. 

Assumption some other change outside the azure module has triggered this, of which POM changes are the likely one.

Who wants to play git bisect to track this down? , git bisect points the blame at HADOOP-14654; commit 1118ca9b07f8a

reverting, reverted the relevant commit in trunk & branch-3; tests should be good again, output of jenkins test run for posterity, Looks like HTTPCLIENT-1803 tightening of how HttpClient UriBuilder builds URIs is breaking mock wasb store, in which case: mock store will need fixing]
