[This looks like a bad misconfiguration - what is the JVM heapsize (mapred.child.java.opts)? Can you try bumping it up to *-Xmx512*?, yeah, its working now.
Now i am having a doubt.
i submitted the sort job and it finished successfully.
When i see the xml  file , it shows one map is killed and so it is reassigned in other replicate and finished ther.
But when i see the time it takes, it shows in negative.
Will different time in different machine will have significant effect in the calculation time?]
