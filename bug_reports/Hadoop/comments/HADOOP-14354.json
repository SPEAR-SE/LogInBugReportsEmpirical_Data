[Making {{refreshIfNeeded()}} synchronized., In the NodeManager there are two threads that indirectly read values from {{SysInfo}}:
* {{NodeResourceMonitor}}
* {{ContainersMonitor}}

We have seen some cases where values get to weird values once in a while.
The reason is that once in a while two threads try to get a value and both get into {{refreshIfNeeded()}}.
Even if the refresh was thread safe, there is no point on two threads trying to refresh these values at the same time., +1 lgtm

I committed this. Thanks Inigo, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #11644 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/11644/])
