This message is automatically generated., [~tedyu@apache.org], latest patch passes Jenkins. If you have additional comments, please let me know., Hi guys.  Thanks for looking at this.  Although we could fix it like you did, by taking the lock in {{NotificationHandler#handle}} and {{DomainSocketWatcher#kick}}, I would prefer to ensure that the lock is already taken in the watcher thread before these functions are invoked.  The lock is supposed to be already held at that point-- the only exception is that I forgot to hold the lock in the cleanup logic of watcherThread's run method.  It seems more consistent to just fix the cleanup logic.

I posted a v3 where I just take the lock there, and add assert(lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) in {{NotificationHandler#handle}} and {{DomainSocketWatcher#kick}}., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
