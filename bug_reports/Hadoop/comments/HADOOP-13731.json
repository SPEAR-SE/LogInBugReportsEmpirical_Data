[Please ask in user@hadoop.apache.org maillist with the command line you run, software version (e.g. maven). This is not likely a bug. Before that, please read through the {{BUILDING.txt}} file in the source package., Hi Mingliang,

Following is the configuration:

JDK: OpenJDK 7
OS: Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)
Protobuf: 2.5.0 (Built from source, backported aarch64 dependencies from 2.6)
Maven: 3.3.9

Let me know if you need any other details. I will also ask in the maillist.

Thanks, It's very unlikely a hadoop issue. The java compiler is throwing a NullPointerException.
It is hard to believe, although not impossible, the compiler is that broken.  It could be other conditions (out of memory, etc.) manifesting like this., I think you should try to use oracle JDK, maybe it's a issue of OpenJDK, Going to have to close this as a wontfix I'm afraid; bug in Javac. Nobody else has reported this, so file with the javac team, as the stack trace says, then try with oracle jdk

Please file a bug at the Java Developer Connection (http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport) after checking the Bug Parade for duplicates. Include your program and the following diagnostic in your report. Thank you.
{code}, I presume the java was packaged by Ubuntu. You could file a bug with Ubuntu. They do work with upstream to fix bugs.]
