[Trivial patch to remove the absolute path to {{kinit}}, and instead rely on {{kinit}} being in the {{PATH}} of the process., This is at the very least an incompatible change, since any site that doesn't have kinit on the hdfs and mapred account's path will break.

That said, I think it is the right direction.

Please update the release note field in the jira to describe that., Thanks a lot for the review/comments, Owen. I've updated the release note and marked this as an incompatible change., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., While we're at it, would you mind adding the hadoop.kerberos.kinit.command config option to core-default.xml? Now that it's mentioned by the release notes, I think it's worth putting in there with an explanation that it should be overridden if not on the PATH, +1 with the addition of the option to the core-default.xml, Thanks for the comments, Todd and Owen. Updated patch to address comments., Hey Aaron. Sorry, one nit -- the renewal thread is explicitly *not* used for keytab-based logins:
{code}
      if (user.getAuthenticationMethod() == AuthenticationMethod.KERBEROS &&
          !isKeytab) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
{code}

So the docs should not reference NN/JT. Typically the use case is for users running long-running processes which need to interact with Hadoop over the course of many hours without the user manually renewing the ticket., Good catch, Todd.
