This message is automatically generated., Thanks for finding and submitting this [~dian.fu], this is a good improvement. The functionality looks good, just a few small comments:

* Would be good to print a message when we load a bad ACL like this, so the user knows not to configure this
* Would also like a test for whitelist key ACLs, in addition to the default key ACL test.
