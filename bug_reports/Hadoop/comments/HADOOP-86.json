[I just committed something that should help tremendously in fixing this.  One can now get the RPC server context in code that runs under a server.  This will let us, when we encounter an error in MapOutputFile, instead of using LOG.severe(), to get a pointer to the TaskTracker instance and call a method that will propagate the error back (over the InterTrackerProtocol) to the JobTracker, where it belongs., Here's a completely untested patch.  It does compile!

I don't think we need to add a new method to the InterTrackerProtocol, rather we just need to get the failure propagated in the next heartbeat to the TaskTracker.
, Testing over w/e., +1 on patch.  It works for me.

Here is failure over on a tasktracker:

060318 190019 Reporting output lost:task_m_4eop89

Reducers must be getting the message fast because after above  no one else comes looking for the corrupted part (No FileNotFoundExceptions in TT log).

Meanwhile over on jobtracker I see following sequence....

060318 184356 Adding task 'task_m_4eop89' to tip tip_ccbgb1, for tracker 'tracker_14754' on ia109307.archive.org
...

...
060318 184716 Task 'task_m_4eop89' has completed.
...
060318 190028 Task 'task_m_4eop89' has been lost.
...
060318 190029 Adding task 'task_m_7mdx9h' to tip tip_ccbgb1, for tracker 'tracker_61554' on ia109333.archive.org

...
060318 190329 Task 'task_m_7mdx9h' has completed.
...

i.e. Task completes successfully.  Subsequently a message comes in that its been lost and a new task is scheduled which in turn completes.

, I just committed the fix for this.  Thanks, Michael, for helping to debug it.]
