[Looks like uploading aws-sdk client to 1.10.41+ fixes the issue, ok. Can you submit the patch to update the POM for this?, + how about a test for this?, This depends on HADOOP-13050. However, the restrictions there (http component versions) also apply, We've updated to a newer version of the SDK. When the 3.0 beta comes out, can you test this to see if is fixed? thanks, closing as cannot reproduce; upgrading the SDK appears to have made it go away]
