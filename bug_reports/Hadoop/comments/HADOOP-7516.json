[I think this patch needs to change a little now that HADOOP-7515 has been committed.  (uses hadoop-project & hadoop-annotations instead of root & doclet), The problem was that 'root' and 'doclet' didn't exist so the 'cd' failed and built the whole project (including running tests). This was fixed as a part of HADOOP-7515 to only build hadoop-project and hadoop-annotations, so I think this issue can be closed now., HDFS-7515 takes care of the issue reported here.]
