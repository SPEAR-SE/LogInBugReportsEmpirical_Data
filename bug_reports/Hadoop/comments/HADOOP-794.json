[This patch protects against requesting 0 maps. The sort benchmark still will have problems if it is run with 0 task trackers because it will request 0 reduces. The proper fix for tat is to wait until there are a reasonable number of task trackers before submitting the job. This patch also adds a test case that requests 0 maps., +1, http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12347050/div-zero.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r486399, I just committed this.
