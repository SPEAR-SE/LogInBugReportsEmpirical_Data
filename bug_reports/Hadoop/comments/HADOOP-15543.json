[It'd probably be good to stick that up somewhere? home.apache.org? so we can have a look at it. 

what happens if you try and use the OS unzip tools?

I think we need to work out if this is something wrong with the reader code, or the writer has generated something bad. Then find out who knows the native code well enough to fix.

FWIW, I don't see any changes in the native bzip code since 2015 (HADOOP-10027).

Looking at the java code, the only 3.1 change in the area is HADOOP-6852 and the BZip2Codec. Going to tag that as the cause unless we can see otherwise.
, Hi [~stevel@apache.org], how can I read a SequenceFile with the tool bzip2? It starts with the SequenceFile header {{SEQ}} and the key and value classes. Of course, it might be that the file is wrong. Would be worst case because this would mean I have to rewrite some amount of data. Hope it's the reader: line 496 in BZip2Codec is suspicious:
{{result = this.input.read(b, off, off + 1);}} Why to read offset+1 bytes. Does not make sense for odd offsets such as 477658. HADOOP-6852 was also one of the upstream changes which went into CDH 5.14.2. I'll send you a link to download the large sequence file. Thanks!, [~wastl-nagel]  thanks for the URL. Others: ping us if you want that data

bq. how can I read a SequenceFile with the tool bzip2

aah, good point. you win.
, [~zvenczel], I think this would be an interesting bzip issue.]
