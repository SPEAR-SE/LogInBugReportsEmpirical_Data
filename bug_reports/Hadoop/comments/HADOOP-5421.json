[I fixed compilation errors by making the calls to TestJobTrackerRestart methods instead of UtilForTest in branch 0.19. But the test fails (timesout) waiting for tasktrackers to be idle, though it passes on trunk.
Should we remove the testcase from branch 0.19 to fix compilation errors for now?, +1, +1 on removing the testcase if incorporating the changes in 0.19 is asking for a lot of change.. , I removed the testcase from the 0.19 branch.]
