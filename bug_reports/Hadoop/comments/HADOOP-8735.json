[Hi,

Please see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8727 on how this came to be, and a patch to resolve it. If you agree its the same issue and 0.23 backport can be done on it itself, we can close this as a dupe?, Yep, a dup of HADOOP-8727.  Sorry for the noise, and thanks for the pointer!]
