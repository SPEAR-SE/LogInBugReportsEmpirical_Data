[what happens if you just try hod.clusterdir=~/clusterdir? withouth the quotes?, Same Error with or without quotes, However, hod allocate --hod.clusterdir ~/clusterdir --hod.nodecount=5 works. *sigh*

Will look at this to see why there's a difference between --hod.clusterdir=~/clusterdir and --hod.clusterdir ~/clusterdir. These are meant to be the same as per python option parser, I thought., this looks like the shell is expanding out the ~/clusterdir for you in the second case., I see the issue. Basically hod isn't doing anything special to normalize paths. It relies on the shell to do it. When we specify an option as {noformat}--hod.clusterdir=~/clusterdir{noformat} the shell is not expanding it, while it is, when we specify it as {noformat}--hod.clusterdir ~/clusterdir{noformat}. And this not just with hod. Try the same with standard linux commands like tar, cp etc. For e.g. {noformat}cp --target-directory=~/abc{noformat} doesn't work.

So, closing this as not a bug.]
