This message is automatically generated., This patch simply adds several empty methods in AbstractDelegationTokenSecretManager, and add them in corresponding places where create/remove tokens/keys occur. 
Also, implement hashCode and equals method in DelegationKey. 
And copy hdfsDelegationTokenSecretManager.addPersistedDelegationToken to AbstractDelegationTokenSecretManager, Want to move forward with this for the sake of YARN-638.

Mostly looks good to me. Can you add tests to make sure these new APIs are correctly called? You can modify TestDelegationTokenSecretManager.

Also, a couple of simple tests for DelegationKey changes will be great.
, Add tests to ensure new APIs are called, and test for DelegationKey, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
