[Attaching the patch. Patch contributors are Steve Maine, Ramya Nimmagadda, Chuan Liu, Brad Sarsfield and Ivan Mitic.

To compile the windows package run:
 {{ant winpkg}}

This will result in a {{hadoop-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.winpkg.zip}} target which contains all binaries/scripts needed for install.

To install Hadoop on the box, unpack the zip and run:

{{hadoop-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.winpkg\scripts\install.ps1 -username <username> -password <password>}}

where <username>/<password> represent an account in which context the services will be running in. Please refer to install.ps1 for additional details on how to setup this account.

Hadoop services will run as Windows services meaning that they could be controlled through the Service Control Manager (services.msc). Alternatively, one could use %HADOOP_HOME%\bin\ start_daemons.cmd/stop_daemons.cmd to start and stop the services. 
, +1 Reviewed, Tested these changes locally.

Things to improve for better performance â€“ 
The whole install is taking 4-5 mins on a single box because of.
1) Inclusion of src & other temp folders (IVY etc..) in the winpkg so it is taking longer time to decompress the zip folder
2) Nested zip files in the winpkg. If we remove the nested zips then after manual unpack everything will be a xcopy install and reduces install time.
, Thanks Kanna for the review and suggestions!

We will definitely address #1 and #2, however, that will be a separate Jira. 
, Thanks Ivan. I agree., Thanks Kanna for reviewing. +1 for the patch.

bq. We will definitely address #1 and #2, however, that will be a separate Jira.
Ivan can you please create the jiras to address these comments and link it to this jira?, I committed the patch to branch-1-win. Thank you Steve Maine, Ramya Nimmagadda, Chuan Liu, Brad Sarsfield and Ivan Mitic.
, Thanks Suresh, I filed HADOOP-9096 to track the install performance enhancements on Windows., This is committed to branch-1-win, resolving. ]
