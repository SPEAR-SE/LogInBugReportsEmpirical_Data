[pendingTransfer removes a block from neededReplications if that block already has the required number of replicas., Dhruba meant to assign this to 0.12.1., pendingTranfer does not cause any replication if the replication factor has already been achieved. Also, addStoredBlock() removes blocks from neededReplication if the replicationfactor has already been achieved., The patch looks good. It is better to remove the logging because neededReplication has already done it., Removed some logging messages from previous patch., Code reviewed by Hairong., I've just committed this. Thanks Dhruba!, Why not wait for Hudson/Jenkins?, Sorry, wrong issue., Doesn't this break the rack policy? We should only remove a block from neededReplications when it has sufficient replicas both in terms of replica count and rack count.
