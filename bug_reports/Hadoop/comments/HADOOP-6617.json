[So , is the HBase team as well. So - setting up an artifact release process for 0.20.x and beyond would be useful to pick up the integration. 

As far as I see - since there is already a snapshot of 0.20.2 (in apache snapshot repository) , with relevant targets available in build.xml , it should be a matter of policy change to get this published to the primary maven repositories. 

Any other information / status on the issue much appreciated and can also count for any help needed as necessary. 

, Hai Hadoopers,

Just checking if there is any one working on it. Mahout is kind of blocked by it. If this doesn't go forward we would have to push our version either on the repo or bundle it along with the release file. But that would be an ugly way to solve this. Hoping to hear from you guys soon

kthx
Mahouter
