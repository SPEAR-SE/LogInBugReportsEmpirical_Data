[This patch fixes the problem by removing the logging when a namenode "fails" to create a parent directory. It also adjusts the logging level of some logs., On a second thought, the right approach to this problem should distiguish different cases when create a directory and then log them differently. When the mkdirs function  is called, either the directory is successfully created, or the directory already existed, or the directory is not able to created due to its parent's problem.

Currently FSDirectory.addNode returns null when a directory exists or a directory is not able to be created. I am thinking to add a PathNotFound exception. When a directory is not able to be created, addNode throws a PathNotFound exception. When a directory exists, it returns null. Otherwise, returns a new node.

When the function mkdirs catches a PathNotFound exception, it logs it as a failure and returns. When it gets a null, simply continues., Just attached a new patch to this issue. Sorry that I forgot to log in., I'd like to apply this now, but it has conflicts.  I'll try to work through them..., Sorry.  I am unable to get these into 0.3.1, they'll have to wait for 0.4., Doug,  I rebuilt the patch and here it is. I hope that you are able to apply it., I just committed this.  Thanks, Hairong.]
