[I probably should have phrased this one differently, but it does seem to be standard practice to provide the context classloader when calling Class.forName.

I can submit a patch with the one line change. but I do not know if there should (or even could be) an accompanying unit test for this. please advise., added 0.19 as an affected version, initial attempt, without unit tests, Wouldn't it be better to use the class loader associated with the configuration rather than the current thread? Basically, use

{code}
   conf.getClassByName(name);
{code}

Clearly the conf for the serializer would need to be saved from the constructor.

, agreed., delegates classloading back to Configuration, delegates back to Configuration, +1, All but org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestLocalDirAllocator tests pass. 

I think this is unrelated:
shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory, via ant test-patch...

seems to be down on lack of tests. unsure, per previous comment, how to test classloader issues.
