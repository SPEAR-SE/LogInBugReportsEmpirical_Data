This message was automatically generated., Reproduced the bug with JDK 8u45. +1, committing this shortly., Committed this to trunk and branch-2.

HADOOP-11916. TestStringUtils#testLowerAndUpperStrings failed on MAC due to a JVM bug. Contributed by Ming Ma. (ozawa: rev 338e88a19eeb01364c7f5bcdc5f4b5c35d53852d)

, Thanks [~ozawa]., JDK-8047340 explicitly calls out BSD-like systems, should not we just exclude those systems instead of enabling solely Linux?
{code}
Assume.assumeFalse("Avoiding JDK-8047340 on BSD-based systems", Shell.FREEBSD || Shell.MAC);
{code}

However, I don't think this is the right fix. Shell on BSD-like systems is broken with the TR locale. Shell class initialization happens only because StringUtils references Shell.WINDOWS. 

We can simply catch Throwable in Shell#isSetsidSupported instead of IOException. If we want to be pedantic we can rethrow
{code}
if (!(t instanceof IOException) && !(Shell.FREEBSD || Shell.MAC))
{code}

With such a change the test can run unchanged., [~jira.shegalov] good catch, I overlooked the other operating systems. I think many developers use Mac OS for Hadoop, so this fix is useful for them as a workaround.

Can we create new JIRA to exclude BSD-like systems correctly? Or, should we revert it?, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8 #184 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8/184/])

, Hi [~ozawa], let us fix it in the follow-up JIRA HADOOP-11924 instead of reverting here. We should revert the test change in  HADOOP-11924 and it will continue to serve as a good regression test., [~jira.shegalov] sure, thank you for following up., Thanks [~jira.shegalov] for the good point. Sorry didn't get time to respond.]
