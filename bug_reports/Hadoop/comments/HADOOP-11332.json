[A simple patch attached to solve this issue. Any comments would be welcome. Thanks very much., This patch currently only considered the clients which use principles in kerberos cache, have not considered the clients which use principles in keytab, such as NameNode (NameNode connect to KMS as client).

This message is automatically generated., +1, the patch looks good to me. I'm OK forgoing tests in this instance since doing so would require a fairly complex Kerberos setup.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks a lot for the contribution, Fu Dian., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6647 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6647/])

, Hi [~atm], thanks for review and commit. This JIRA try to solve the authentication issue in this kind of cluster setup: hadoop services are configured as "simple" and other services such as KMS, Zookeeper, etc are configured as "kerberos". The patch in this JIRA currently solves the authentication issue between clients which use principles in kerberos cache and KMS/Zookeeper Server, while have not considered the clients which use principles in keytab, such as NameNode (NameNode connect to KMS/Zookeeper as client). I'm not sure if this kind of cluster setup should be considered. If so, I will create another JIRA to track it., Hi [~dian.fu], yea, not sure how I feel about that. It doesn't seem like a super reasonable cluster setup to me, so I'm personally inclined to ignore that situation for now. I don't feel super strongly about this, though, and certainly could be convinced otherwise. Your call., Hi [~atm], thanks for review and commit. Agree that currently this cluster setup is not so reasonable and we can reconsider this if it has requirements in the future.]
