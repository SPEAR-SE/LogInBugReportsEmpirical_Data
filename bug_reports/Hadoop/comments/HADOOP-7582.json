[IMO, this is an eclipse:eclipse plugin bug or Eclipse itself.

The manual step you describe are already in the wiki (http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/EclipseEnvironment)

(<ad>not that I'm suggesting to change your IDE, but IntelliJ does the right thing here. Actually it opens the POM directly, no need to run a plugin</ad>).

, Thanks for the explanation Alejandro. Closing as 'wontfix'.]
