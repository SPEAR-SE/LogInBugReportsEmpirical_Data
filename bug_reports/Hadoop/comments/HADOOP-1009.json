[The rack-aware chooseTarget method was not handling a case when decommissioning a Datanode causes the Namenode to go into an infinite loop., +1 code reviewed., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12350981/chooseTargetLoop.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r506778., I just committed this.  It belongs in 0.11.2, I think.  Thanks, Dhruba!]
