[Why can't this be in _both_ categories?, I don't have issues with having an issue description message in two sections if that makes things more readable/precise. What do others think? , I think putting the descriptions in twice wound be really confusing. Just put it in the most important category., > I think putting the descriptions in twice wound be really confusing. Just put it in the most important category.

+1  We should only list each change once in CHANGES.txt.
, Listing only once makes sense. Now for the next release there will another hunt to find "new features". May we should allow multiple tags [new, incompatible.. etc] to each change log entry.. rather than "sections". But that discussion does belong here I guess., Strictly speaking, HADOOP-1231 isn't a incompatible change. Here is a patch which only moves HADOOP-1851 to the INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES section for 0.15.0., bq. Strictly speaking, HADOOP-1231 isn't a incompatible change. 

The conclusion that Doug, Owen and I came to during an offline discussion is that:
a) Deprecating code doesn't mean it is an incompatible change.
b) Removal of deprecated code means that the change is incompatible.
