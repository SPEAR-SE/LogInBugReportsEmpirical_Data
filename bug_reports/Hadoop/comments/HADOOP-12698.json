, JAVA_HOME also needs to get set., I've been building trunk with JDK 8 for almost a year now and without any issues. I have some concerns on moving the default towards a JDK that has been marked as EOL.
, The error was caused by Javadoc error. Use of '_' induced only warning.

So currently building with javadoc option causes error. My build command was this.
{code}
$ mvn package -Pdist,native,docs,src -DskipTests -Dtar
{code}, It seems to be fixed thanks to YARN-4438. I'll close this.
