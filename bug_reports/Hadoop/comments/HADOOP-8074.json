[patch attached

Try to help users who specified a command without the mandatory leading dash., +1 looks good pending jenkins, Forgot to mention, Colin tried to add a test but ran into HADOOP-7360 / HDFS-2038, I'll ping those jiras. We'll test the output of TestHDFSCLI w/ and w/o this change for sanity. Given that it only updates the error handling path it shouldn't have an impact., -1 overall.

, I guess my request to review got overlooked.  FsShell is not designed to enforce a leading dash, it's actually completely generic and it just happens that commands today start with a dash.  The more correct patch would have been:

, Hey Daryn,

Sorry, missed your comment in the stream of comments!  Mind filing a jira for your suggested improvement?  I'd be happy to review / commit.

Also, how about filing a jira for your idea of making the leading dash optional?  It's currently not optional in FsShell (all hadoop commands must have form <cmd> <-cmd>) which is why I think the current change is reasonable.

Thanks,

, Hi Daryn,

I like your idea of accepting the commands without a leading dash.  It makes sense to me.

Another improvement we could consider is enhancing FsShell to do a more general "did you mean" type search.  You could point out the one or two commands with the shortest Levenstein distance from what the user entered.

For now, this change catches the fairly common case where a first-time user types the command without a dash, and then is mystified when it doesn't work.  I know that this can happen because I was that first-time user at one point!

, Levenstein is a very cool idea for suggesting alternatives!  Apache Common's StringUtils even has a method for it.  It's a handful of lines to implement, so I can post a patch with it later today if you can please help me out with updating the hdfs tests since I've got more demanding priorities..., Agree. Let's knock out your (Daryn's) suggested improvements and at least file a jira for accepting commands without a leading dash as well.]
