ur opinion ?
, please also give file names where the whitespace including lines are., I believe that the jenkins output should only contain important information that requires developers to look at in a case by case basis. I'm yet to see the value of printing out how to fix the whitespace as it's unlikely that developers will fix all the whitespace issue manually.

To fix all the whitespace issue automatically, you can apply the patch with {{git apply --whitespace=fix}} and create a new patch based on the result.

, How about a list of impacted file names and a suggestion to us {{git apply --whitespace=fix}} to make a clean version then? that sounds wonderful, presuming verifying the fix is straight forward., Thanks for the comments [~wheat9] & [~busbey],
+1 for suggestion in the output file, as many like me might not be aware of {{git apply --whitespace=fix}} option, 
IMO If it was small number of white space issues then {{git apply --whitespace=fix}} would be little more work than manually correcting, so i would prefer to have line numbers to be printed so that i can do the required changes faster. 
 [~busbey], IMHO just the filename is not so useful, file name and followed with the actual lines number within that file would be useful else line numbers based on the patch would be better. IMO later approach was simpler and better, hence updated the patch with the later approach and  header for checkstyle output, (!) A patch to test-patch or smart-apply-patch has been detected.

This message was automatically generated., A few things:

a) shellcheck is complaining about the multi-line echos redirecting to a file.  It's generally preferred now to group them into a subshell and then redirect the shell.  But I think the message should really be directed to the patch author in the footer table via an add_footer_table call.

b) I think it'd be worthwhile to do quite a bit more hacking on the checkstyle module.  When I looked at checkstyle, I was clearly asleep. There are actually quite a few things we can do to make this much more usable:

* Switch from the aggregate report to a per module report.  (This should also reduce the run time and it makes the other things we should do easier.)

* Rip out the python code.  We aren't going to need it anymore.

* Add -Dcheckstyle.output.file=blah and -Dcheckstyle.output.format=plain to both mvn command lines, where blah is the file we want for that module for that part of the run.  Strip a large chunk of the leading pathname (${BASEDIR} at a minimum, but probably all of ${BASEDIR} and modulename, since the file is already broken up by module).

* Now we can perform diffs and such like we do for some of the other tests (see shellcheck, for example).  This has the advantage of pointing out the exact error on the exact line that broke without having to deal with giant HTML files. 
, -checkstyle.patch:
* Here's a modified version of the checkstyle.sh plug-in. It still needs some work, but gets us most of the way there.

A few things:
* It looks like output.file doesn't actually work.  So I opted to play games with the console output. 
* New method written in shell to determine if there are actually new issues.  I think it works?
* Showing what is actually different is significantly harder than I thought it would be because of magically changing line numbers.  An sdiff -s output *might* be better here.  

Anyway, some code to play with and fill in the gaps if you want., (!) A patch to test-patch or smart-apply-patch has been detected.

This message was automatically generated., If further filter for checkstyle is needed beyond the current patch, we could consider the hunk line number ranges in the patch itself (Not the patch file itself, but the effective patch -> the diff after patch apply). Only checkstyle warnings within the lines should be considered to flag a patch as not checkstyle compliant. Using the same filter, a filtered version of the checkstyle output could be the artifact that will be used to eliminate to non-compliant code., There likely will be. The checkstyle code in this patch does an extremely naïve match against the diff file. One will get a lot more output than may be necessary, but at least something more meaningful will show up.

I was really trying to avoid parsing the patch file, but I guess we may not have much of a choice. :(, Let's get this in and then we can have a follow up to address that hurtle., Hi [~jeagles] & [~aw],
     can we get this patch in  and address other check-style issues in either HADOOP-11869 or HADOOP-11778 ?
, I've been playing with this patch for accuracy over the past 24 hours.  In many ways the naïve approach is even worse and not very accurate.  

If [~Naganarasimha] doesn't mind, I'd like to take this JIRA over and update (potentially) all of the plug-ins  to take advantage of some new code I've been toying with based upon [~jeagles]'s suggestion. , Hi [~aw], 
I don't mind you taking over this jira, but i feel its annoying to see patches having the white space issues and not able to make use of the output & i seldom remember the {{git apply --whitespace=fix}} option.  So try to get these small changes as part of your useful modifications in as early as possible :)  , -05:
* added a new support file for plugins that gives a listing of files and lines changed after the patch is applied
* fixed an issue with ${CHANGED_FILES} where extra cruft from the patch was being added due to differences in how patches are formatted.  This may have resulted in some patches having tests run twice or even skipped.
* checkstyle errors are now calculated per module.  this speeds up this particular test quite a bit and means that it is less likely to NPE for certain classes of patches.
*checkstyle now shows errors before, errors after, and the filename + line number where the new errors are being reported.  Unfortunately, this uses GNU diff extensions. :(  
* whitespace now prints the name and line of the source file that has the whitespace
* fixed _all_ of the shellcheck errors.  newer versions of shellcheck now understand line continuations! So all those false reports triggered by awk are now gone!

NOTE: I have a suspicion that the current checkstyle code in test-patch is actually reporting the wrong number.  Patches can trigger checkstyle errors that appear outside of the lines that are patched.  MAPREDUCE-6165, for example, has only 1 reported, but there are actually 8 new ones.  (4 were removed by the patch.)

Given the aggravation, etc, these issues are causing, this should probably be committed ASAP.  If someone could do a quick test+review, that'd be great., (!) A patch to test-patch or smart-apply-patch has been detected.
