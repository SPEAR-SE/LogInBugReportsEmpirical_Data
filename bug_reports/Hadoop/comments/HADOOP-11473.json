[This appears to be caused by HADOOP-11352.  A check was removed but the corresponding (( RESULT = RESULT + $? )) code was not.  That left two math operations in a row, and the result code of the first is non-zero leading to RESULT being non-zero even when all checks return zero result codes., Attaching a patch that removes the extra (( RESULT = $RESULT + $? )) code.
