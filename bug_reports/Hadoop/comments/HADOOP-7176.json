[Pig project uses FsShell to export HDFS commands to the users. Things that are important to us:

(1) Backward compatibility
(2) Better error handling. At this point if command fails it seems to always return -1 so we can't tell different problems apart., Definitively maintaining backwards compatibility.  Let's discuss #2 offline., What do you mean by offline?  Design discussions should be on JIRA., My apologies, we are both yahoos so I figured we could internally discuss and then summarize for approval., > What do you mean by offline?

Hey Jakob, I seems to recall that you sometimes have design discussions with other people privately.  No?, This bug is implicitly fixing bugs in all the commands regarding handling of globs and exit codes of 0 when multiple args and/or globs are supplied and have errors.  If anyone has available time, I'd like to please request reviews for the linked bugs.  Thanks in advance., These changes were completed long ago.  Closing., This had already gone in 0.23.0 (per the tag sources). 0.24 is a non-existent version, so changed the Fix Version to point to 0.23.0 where this was apparently already completed.]
