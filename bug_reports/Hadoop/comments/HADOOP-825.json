[This patch fixes the DataNode.createSocketAddr to handle both the old style and new style default.fs names. It also fixes fsck., +1, since http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12347226/namenode-uri.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r486901., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen!]
