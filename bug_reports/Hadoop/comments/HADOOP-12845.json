[You need to install {{openssl-devel}}, not just {{openssl}}., Yes, that what i said before, and again for me it's not supposed to install -devel package on production server., There was a long discussion about this on HADOOP-11216.  Basically, we don't want to have to build custom packages for each minor release of each Linux distribution.  But, on the other hand, there is no standardized naming scheme for openssl... some distros have libcrypto.so.10, some have libcrypto.so.1.0.0, some have libcrypto.so.1.0.0e.  That's why we settled on just linking against the no-extension version (i.e. the devel version).

We could potentially have it check for whatever full library name it found during building, in addition to checking for the no-extension version., Then user should be able to link it to the desired openssl library name. I tried "-Drequire.openssl -Dopenssl.lib=/usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.10" for example but then compilation failed. Anything else is needed to get it working ?, you can add a link to solve the problem.
cd /usr/lib64/
ln -s libcrypto.so.1.0.1e libcrypto.so]
