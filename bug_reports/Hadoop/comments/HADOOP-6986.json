[2 patch versions: one works for 20-append branch, the 0.21 works for both 0.21 & 0.22, To fix this issue, I kept all the existing error types & messages, but I added ParseException as the cause to all parsing-related IOEs.  None of the changed exceptions had an associated cause prior.  This will allow us to maintain 100% backwards compatibility (in case any users were doing deep inspection of the IOE text) while allowing new users and easy way to check:  if(ioe.getCause() instanceof ParseException), -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Sorry to come in very late here, but could you rebase the patch onto the 0.23/trunk branches? 

I think this is a good change, and +1 to the idea. I trust you've also covered all spots where we can tweak to also add in parse exceptions., Cancelling patch, as it is woefully out of date.]
