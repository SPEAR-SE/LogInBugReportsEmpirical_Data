Testcase: testWithCounters took 0.133 sec
        Caused an ERROR

The output directory was not cleaned up after the test is done., patch for testcase  that cleans up at setup and teardown.

strange that the failure was not happening in Mac OS X, nor in the Hudson servers.
, I tried the patch.  The test still fails.

The problem is that there is a typo in line 180 (after the patch).  "reader.close()" should be "seqReader.close()".  It works fine after fixed the typo.

Also, the "@SuppressWarnings({"unchecked"})" before _testMultipleOutputs(...) is not needed., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
