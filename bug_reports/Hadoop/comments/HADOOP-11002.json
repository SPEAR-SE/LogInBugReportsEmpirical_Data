[After playing with this for most of today, I've come to the conclusion that we're going to have to drop support for directories with spaces.  There's simply no, 100% reliable way to make them work with a global var like HADOOP_OPTS without doing some really bizarre tricks that break other things.  Support for metacharacters like < is significantly more important.  
, This removes support for spaces., (It's worth pointing out that directories with spaces are completely broken in branch-2.  HADOOP-9902 made quite a few things work, but without fixing this issue, not enough to be usable.), The reasoning here looks sound.  If spaces-in-directories don't work for branch-2, we don't need to support them here.  And the eval obviously is problematic.

+1, Thanks! I'll commit this as soon as git opens up!]
