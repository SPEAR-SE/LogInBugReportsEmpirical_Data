, Hi folks! I think ignoring *.orig was fine. However, I don't think ignoring *.rej is a good idea. Moreover, it seems you could have set a global .gitignore file : https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ . Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a way to set a global override to the rule (so that despite the repository .gitignore, I would be able to see *.rej). Do you know of a way? , Is there any particular reason we want to allow *.rej files into the repo? , Hi Karthik. Files in .gitignore can still be added (albeit with -f). When I apply a patch and there are many rejects, a git status would have shown me the rejected hunks. Granted I can still do a `find . -name *.rej` for exactly the same information, but I'll have to remember to do that now after the `git status` . I was just wondering if anybody knew a way I could override these .gitignore rules globally ?
I was just pointing out that you could have added the "\*.rej" rule in +your+ global .gitignore file . But I couldn't find a way for me to set "*!*\*.rej" in my global .gitignore file and make it override the repository's "*.rej" rule
, [~raviprakash] - I hear you. I am having to do a find for the same. I am open to options here - the reason behind this change was to avoid .orig and .rej files getting into the repo and failing the rat-check at release time. If people are okay with removing this and allowing no-review commits to delete .orig an .rej files, I am fine with reverting this patch. 

Just curious, are .orig and .rej files created if we apply patches using {{git apply}} instead of {{patch <}}?]
