[Did you set fs.default.name in core-site.xml? This property should not be set in hdfs-site.xml., > If I create a hadoop-site.xml, it gives warning below but ...

hadoop-site.xml was deprecated but is still supported.  In your case, you may create core-default.xml, mapred-default.xml and hdfs-default.xml, instead of hadoop-site.xml.  Then, you won't see any warning., I have hdfs-site.xml.

As I mentioned, without hadoop-site.xml, I can see the hdfs files within web browser. So I think the configuration is ok. The problem happens in command line. After I created a link file hadoop-site.xml which points to hdfs-site.xml, command line dfs command works. , > After I created a link file hadoop-site.xml which points to hdfs-site.xml, command line dfs command works.

Try creating a link file core-site.xml (instead of hadoop-site.xml) pointing to hdfs-site.xml.  I guess you may have set some core properties in hdfs-site.xml as suggested by Hairong's comment above., I moved fs.deault.name property from hdfs-site.xml to core-site.xml. It works now. Does that mean fs.default.name must be in core-site.xml? Thx.

, Yes, fs.default.name belongs core-site.xml since it only can be found in trunk/src/core/core-default.xml., fs.default.name is a core property and must be set in core-site.xml., thx all., Still have problem:

  * If I set set fs.default.name in hdfs-site.xml, web interface works but command line not
  * If I set set fs.default.name in core-site.xml, command line works but web interface not

I have to set fs.default.name in both file to make both cmd line and web interface work., Not sure what is not working. Dfs needs conf to get started. But WebUI does not need a conf to communicate with dfs. , You mean namenode webui, right? Setting fs.default.name in core-site.xml should be sufficient. Can you give details about your setup?, I might made a mistake. I removed everything and installed again. No issue found. ]
