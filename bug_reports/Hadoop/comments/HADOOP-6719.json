This message is automatically generated., My understanding is that FilterFs should override all AFS methods, the FilterFs javadoc concurs: "The class <code>FilterFs</code> itself simply overrides all methods of <code>AbstractFileSystem</code> with versions that pass all requests to the contained file system." It currently gets away with not overriding these because its subclasses, ChecksumFs and LocalFs, don't need to override them. 
, Forgot to mention in the patch DontCheck should be removed  and the necessary methods overridden in FilterFs., Following Eli's suggestions., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
