{code}, Good summary of HTTP servlets by [~yuanbo] for HADOOP-13119: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-13119?focusedCommentId=15635132&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15635132, Thanks John, I think we can close this one as dup since HADOOP-13119 and related will fix it., [~xiaochen] HADOOP-13119 does not fix this issue because I just tested in SSL+Kerberos mode, /logs is still wide open for KMS and HttpFS, while the other servlets return error {{Authentication required}}. I don't think any follow up such as HADOOP-14077 provides the fix either., I was reading [comments|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-13119?focusedCommentId=15829038&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15829038] from HADOOP-13119 and was under the impression that /logs' no authz control was by design. Reading them again it actually didn't talk much about authz.

So feel free to reopen and work on, apologies for the churn., Here are my steps to reproduce in a single node SSL+Kerberos setup:
# git clone https://github.com/jzhuge/hadoop-setup-scripts.git, cd {{hadoop-setup-scripts}}
# You may want to replace a few hardcoded strings: GCE.CLOUDERA.COM => YOUR_REALM, jzhuge => YOUR_USER
# ./create_keytabs <kdc_host> localhost GCE.CLOUDERA.COM
# kinit -t ~/.config/kerberos/hdfs.keytab hdfs/localhost@GCE.CLOUDERA.COM
# export HADOOP_HOME=~/hadoop/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.0.0-alpha3-SNAPSHOT
# ./pseudo_dist start config/secure
# kinit -t ~/.config/kerberos/$USER.keytab $USER@GCE.CLOUDERA.COM
# PATH=$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$PATH TEST_SSL_ENABLED=yes bats ~/hadoop-bats-tests, all tests should pass
# Open a browser, can not open https://localhost:9600/jmx, error "Authentication required"; however, ok to open https://localhost:9600/logs.

Maybe I miss something in the config files?, [~jzhuge] Thanks for your details.
I can reproduce this defect with your steps
From a quick sight, I can tell that this defect is not related to access control, and it belongs to filter chain issue. I'm trying to enable kms debug mode and compare the filter chains of {{/jmx}} and {{/logs}} to find out the differences. , The filter chain of {{/logs}} is 
{code}
NoCacheFilter->safety->static_user_filter
{code}
while the filter chain of {{/jmx}} is
{code}
NoCacheFilter->safety->static_user_filter->authFilter->MDCFilter
{code}
The authFilter requires kerberos authentication, that's why the responses of {{/jmx}} and {{/logs}} are different., Add a temp patch for your reference.
highlight that this patch is not a complete solution for this defect.
kms use web.xml to define filter chain for web path, it works for {{WebAppContext}}, but {{/logs}} doesn't use {{WebAppContext}} to define its filter chain. So there are two ways to fix this defect:
* Change the context of {{/logs}} in {{HttpServer2.java}}, just like my temp patch
* Use a filter initializer to setup global filter chain for all the web paths in {{HttpServer2.java}}

Since {{HttpServer2.java}} is used widely in different hadoop components, I'd prefer #2 to reduce compatibility issues. But #2 is a bit complex and need some time to generate a patch., This issue can be found in any Hadoop web server built on top of HttpServer2. Thus rename the JIRA summary., Hi, [~daryn], [~kihwal], do you have an estimation about when this will be done?

Thanks!, Ping [~jzhuge], [~daryn], [~kihwal]., Sorry, don't have time to work on it now. Unassigned the JIRA., Thanks [~jzhuge], moved to 3.2.0., As this jira is marked for 3.2 as a blocker, cud u pls help to take this forward or move out if its not feasible to finish in coming weeks. 3.2 code freeze date is nearby in a weeks. Kindly help to check the same.

cc [~jzhuge] , No time for 3.2. Moved out.]
