Findbugs warning is because of passing the search string across calls., Tested the patch. Looks good. A few minor points
# Having a standalone :  to imply allusers:alljobs caused an ArrayOutOfBounds Exception
# I think the quotes surrounding the job numbers in the display (Displaying '1829' jobs from '1' to '1829' out of '1829' jobs) can be removed
# Adding a "First Page" link similar to "Last page" might be useful. This is not important though, we could get back to the first page from the filter if this option is not there.
# On Choosing "Last page" option from a "Show all" result page, it gives the first page and not the last page.
