[Patch adding MAP_INPUT_BYTES counter to LineRecordReader and SequenceRecordReader.

, Please apply the patch after commiting HADOOP-5717, because compilation would break., I propose that we remove MAP_INPUT_BYTES from the framework counters as it is specific to file based input formats only. With new api, the framework no more calculates this. It is getting calculated in lib. So we can move  MAP_INPUT_BYTES to FileInputFormat class. That seems to be its more logical place., That sounds reasonable, Sharad., Attaching patch which moves MAP_INPUT_BYTES to org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat, Patch looks good. Few minor points:
should we rename the group and counter to more readable and intuitive value. Say Group name as "FileInputFormatCounters" and counter name as "BYTES_READ", Because anyway we are calculating the bytes read from the file, not really the bytes input to the map (there may be some bytes skipped while reading so these two may not be same).
include a deprecated warning in the old Counters API while mapping the old name to new name., Patch incorporating review comments. Earlier patch had findbugs warning saying Unchecked/unconfirmed cast fromTaskAttemptContext to MapContext . Added the warning to exclude list, since the warning is unavoidable.

This message is automatically generated., Contrib test failures are not related to patch. They fail on trunk also., one minor bit: In LineRecordReader and SequenceFileRecordReader, counter lookup is happening for each key. This can be avoided if we keep counter instance as the member variable as opposed to keeping MapContext., Patch incorporating review comments.
