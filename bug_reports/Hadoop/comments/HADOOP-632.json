[Since Raghu is already working on dfs -report, it is better for him to take it., There are 2 different methods in the NameNode
datanodeReport() and DFSNodesStatus(), which have the same purpose.
It would be good to join them and use the same function for reporting
nodes through DFSShell and web UI., Fixed by two other jiras. Starting with 0.15.x, Namenode does not store datanodes persistently (HADOOP-1762) and there is a way to control how deadnodes are listed (HADOOP-1138)]
