[Hi [~Sunilkc], I don't expect any of the connectors (E.g. WASB, S3A) to honor _fs.trash.interval_. The purge functionality works for HDFS because it is implemented in the HDFS namenode. The cloud object stores have no idea about this setting., no, they don't.

this is something which could be covered in documentation.

For S3a: better to use Versioning than trash, as trash uses rename, and of course rename takes forever.

I don't see wasb supporting that; you'll have to do it by hand]
