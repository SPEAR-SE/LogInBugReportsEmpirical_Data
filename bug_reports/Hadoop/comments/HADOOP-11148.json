[That test should only be running if {{hadoop-aws}} has the file {{src/test/resources/auth-keys.xml}}. Have you got one and so are trying to test the AWS support?, I'm getting this error in 2.5.0 and 2.5.1, which doesn't have the hadoop-aws module. , In these versions, is it advisable to just skip this test, or if there are any instructions to run this in 2.5.0?, All hadoop tests that are auto-run end in {{Test}}; that one starts with the prefix as it should be manually set explicitly.

if you do want to run it, you are going to need to provide some AWS login details. That's whats failing -â€”though it clearly isn't any good at reporting this fact sensibly.

# get your AWS account credentials
# create an object store
# In hadoop-common/src/test/resources/core-site.xml , add your AWS login details
# same file, fill in the stub {{test.fs.s3n.name}} entry

run the test, Thanks. The test can be made better by reporting it in a better way but thats ok., Resolving as 'Not a Problem']
