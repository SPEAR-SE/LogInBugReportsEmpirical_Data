[My .hadooprc
{code}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
hadoop_add_classpath /root/hadoop-tools-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
{code}, Correct.  .hadooprc is the basic equivalent of the hadoop-env.sh file.  To quote the UnixShellGuide.md file: 

{code}
 This file is always read to initialize and override any variables that the user may want to customize.
{code}

There is no mention of the functions working inside of it.  None of the _HOME vars are guaranteed to be set either as a result.

In any case, HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH should be used to do what you're trying to do., Today's shower thought:

What if we turned the current .hadooprc support into .hadoopenv and add a new .hadooprc hook that gets called after the initialization is done such that functions work?, Thanks Allen for the comments.

I got it.

I thought that .hadooprc was where to use unix shell API, but it's not. Where can/should we use the API? If there are some places to use the API, I'll use there. I'd like to avoid a new .something, which maybe misunderstanding. If there are no places to use that functions, I'm okay to introduce a new .something., Yeah, there really isn't a place.  hadooprc was built as a way to override hadoop-env.sh and set things up prior to the bootstrap.  But it makes a  lot of sense to have *something* that user's could use to trigger the api.  It's a simple change.  I'll write it up here in a sec., bq.

Agreed. Thanks a lot!, -00:
