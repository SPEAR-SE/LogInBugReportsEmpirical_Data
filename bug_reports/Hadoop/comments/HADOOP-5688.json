[The problem is that HftpFileSystem does not construct the url correctly if the path contents scheme and authority information.  For example
{code}
Path p = new Path("hftp://localhost:2750/foo");
FileSystem hftpfs = p.getFileSystem(conf);
FileChecksum cs = hftpfs.getFileChecksum(p); 
/*
The url constructed above will be
  http://localhost:2750/fileChecksumhftp://localhost:2750/filechecksum/foo?ugi=...
However, the correct url is
  http://localhost:2750/fileChecksum/foo?ugi=...
