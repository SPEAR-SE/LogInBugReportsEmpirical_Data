[  I did the changes for locking ReflectionUtils. Here static synchronized method is replaced by a method in a class object. This would not be conservative locking now., Removed Synchronized for the method and introduced synchronized block in the method., Instead of previous patch changes of introducing a new class, now we do it by introducing a synchronized block in the method. 
Any comments on the patch?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This looks right, but I'd suggest a minor style change in the patch:

{code}
boolean dumpStack = false;
synchronized (ReflectionUtils.class) {
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    if (new - previousLogTime > minInterval * 1000) {
        previousLogTime = now;
        dumpStack = true;
    }
}
if (dumpStack) {
  ..
}
{code}, Submitting patch again with suggested change., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
