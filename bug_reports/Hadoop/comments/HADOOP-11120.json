[I believe you might have got the full error message as below
{noformat}rm: Unknown command
Did you mean -rm?  This command begins with a dash.{noformat}

I feel its correct. ''rmr" and "rm" are commands. And to use any commands with fsshell we should prefix them with '-'.
, bq. I believe you might have got the full error message as below

Nope.  See this screenshot.  (which, as an added bonus, also features HADOOP-11119!)

We clearly have two code paths in play, which makes this even worse.

bq. And to use any commands with fsshell we should prefix them with '-'.

...which is why we should be explicit to users about what we want them to do.  Hoping they correctly guess our intentions is terrible design., Oh, you meant with the the hadoop fs rm. Yes, I did get the condescending 'Perhaps' message.  , This doesn't seem too egregious... I've never been a fan of the dash prefix, but both error messages are correct.

The proposed fix is for for the deprecation message to include the dash prefix, so a user gets the correct command in one hop instead of two?, Yup. At least until we can start changing all of the commands to be sane., Suggests that the correct replacement for the deprecates `-rmr` command is `-rm -r`, not `rm -r`, This should be reviewed, please., This is a change to the deprecation message for `hadoop fs -rmr` that corrects the suggested replacement command to be `hadoop fs -rm -r`, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
