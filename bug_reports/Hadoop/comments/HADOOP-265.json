[In this patch, if a task tracker finds out that any of its local directories becomes not readable or writable, it logs the error. If all of its local directories are not readable/writable, it reports the problem to its job tracker and then aborts. When the job tracker receives the error report, it logs the error. 

A task tracker detects disk problem at startup time and before it starts a new task. A task tracker will not start if all its local directories are not readable or writable.
