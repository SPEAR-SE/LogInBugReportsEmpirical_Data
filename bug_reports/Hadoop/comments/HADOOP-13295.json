[I don't think is is directly related to Hadoop at all: it doesn't use SSH at all.

How are you deploying it?, b.q. I don't think is is directly related to Hadoop at all: it doesn't use SSH at all.
agreed, probably not Hadoop. SSH isn't used on DN side. Only place I can imagine SSH is used is in possible fencing script used to fence a NN HA pair with the failover controller setup., Or using the start-dfs.sh , start-*.sh scripts. Right?, I know that hadoop uses RPC to request a service from a program located in another nodes. But start-dfs.sh and start-yarn.sh uses SSH to trigger the services in another nodes. The fact is my SSH Daemon will die/block after running one or two mapreduce program and it affects only datanodes., Mobin! Could you please answer Steve's original question?
bq. How are you deploying it?

I'm inclined to close this JIRA as invalid. We haven't seen this issue anywhere else, and is probably an error in deployment., bq. But start-dfs.sh and start-yarn.sh uses SSH to trigger the services in another nodes.
these requires that SSH to these nodes should be made password less using public-private authentication from where these scripts invoked.]
