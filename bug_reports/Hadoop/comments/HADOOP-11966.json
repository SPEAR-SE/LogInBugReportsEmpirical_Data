[The attached patch refactors setting the {{cygwin}} variable into hadoop-config.sh, where it can take effect for all the interactive scripts as well as hadoop-daemon.sh.  This is more like how the branch-1 code handled it.  Unfortunately, I missed it the first time.

I have retested Cygwin/Windows with this change.  I also retested hadoop-daemon.sh on Linux., +1 pending jenkins, You comment says that you tested hadoop-daemon.sh. Have you tested the hadoop,  yarn and mapred commands (your change affects all of them and yes it should work since they all source hadoop-config.sh, [~sanjay.radia], yes, I tested both hadoop-daemon.sh and all 4 of the interactive commands.  Thanks!, \\
