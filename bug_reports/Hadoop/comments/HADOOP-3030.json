This message is automatically generated., unreserveSpace should probably follow the locking semantics observed by reserveSpace, though you're already managing it explicitly, it's a private inner class, etc. etc. Most other methods on RawInMemoryFileSystem observe that pattern, so for consistency it might be worthwhile.
