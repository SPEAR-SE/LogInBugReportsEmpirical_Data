This message was automatically generated., Hey Everyone: 

This is related to a problem we are seeing in NUTCH, NUTCH-1084. Any chance someone could review. It looks like the test failures are actually orthogonal to this patch., [~ndouba], please use the "Target Version" field to express your intention. Fix-version is exclusively used by committers when a patch gets committed.

IAC, 2.7.1 is done, targeting this for 2.7.2/2.8.0., [~ndouba], is this happening inside a MapReduce job running on top of YARN? MapReduce does have job.jar in the system classpath, so that's not explainable.

The only way this may happen is if you are using the MapReduce JobClassLoader for this - please let us know the values for mapreduce.job.classloader in your job., Moving this out of 2.7.2 as there's been no update in a while., Hi Vinod,

I was running this on top of YARN with the default configuration enabled on top of Java 1.8 from Oracle. I think the new isolation strategy used in the newer versions of the JVM for class loaders prevents the system class loader from loading a job jar class. I didn't do anything fancy with configuration options or anything else. The only thing I added were the remote debugging options to allow me to attach to the map and reduce threads remotely and debug them step by step. I can tell you that the job jar definitely isn't in the system's class loader but in the current thread's context class loader. I verified this observation by manually inspecting the class loader object from the system and the one that comes with the thread context.

Cheers,

Nadeem, Hi [~ndouba],

I'm about to do a 2.7.3 Apache Hadoop release and finally got around to this again.

h4. Analysis
To make progress, I had to read up a bit on nutch and about how to run this so that I can reproduce the bug in order to rationalize your patch. I finally succeeded in doing so! Tested this with 2.7.2 release and nutch 1.11 and using the URL feed [given at NUTCH-1084|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-1084?focusedCommentId=13882771&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13882771]
{code}
~/tmp/common/hadoop-common-2.7.2/bin/hadoop jar apache-nutch-1.11.job org.apache.nutch.crawl.CrawlDbReader file:///tmp/nutch/apache-nutch-1.11/runtime/local/crawl/crawldb/ -url http://bappenas.go.id/
{code}

I can reproduce all the problems listed at NUTCH-1084 - with readdb, MR local-job-runner based job for crawling etc.

The real issue is that Nutch's readdb is client-only and *not* running a MapReduce job which was my question before. For regular MR jobs, the job-jar *is* on the system class-loader. For the client-only invocations using "hadoop jar" and local-job-runner, the job-jar is actually *not* on the system-classpath - that is why you are running into the issue.

h4. Summary
Your patch looks good to me. Clearly, the thread context-loader falls back to system class-loader where it is not overridden - so we are fine for all the ways of loading the classes in readFields.

I'll resubmit your patch with minor commenting related changes to Jenkins and commit if Mr.Jenkins is also fine., Updated patch fixing the code comment.., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Hi Vinod and Nadeem, thanks for taking care of this. At Apache Nutch, we're looking forward to 2.7.3!, TestReloadingX509TrustManager failure is not related, I'll see if there is an existing JIRA.

Checking this in now.., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7. Thanks [~ndouba]!

Forgot to mention that I've tested that the nutch code fails without the patch and passes with., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #9593 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/9593/])
HADOOP-12406. Fixed AbstractMapWritable.readFields to use the thread's (vinodkv: rev 069c6c62def4a0f94382e9f149581d8e22f6d31c)
* hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/io/AbstractMapWritable.java
, Closing the JIRA as part of 2.7.3 release., Merge the fix to branch-2.8.]
