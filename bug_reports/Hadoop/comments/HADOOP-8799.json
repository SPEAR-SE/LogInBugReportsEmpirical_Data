[could you pls list the steps to repro? I checked the ivy/libraries.properties and the commons-configuration pom for transient dependency, both has commons-lang version set to 2.4. 

I tried a local build and this is what I see;
{quote}
[ivy:resolve]   found commons-el#commons-el;1.0 in maven2
[ivy:resolve]   found commons-configuration#commons-configuration;1.6 in maven2
[ivy:resolve]   found commons-collections#commons-collections;3.2.1 in maven2
[ivy:resolve]   found commons-lang#commons-lang;2.4 in maven2
{quote}

could you pls try this with a clean .ivy2 .m2 cache ?, Sorry, there is no problem, my mistake.

commons-lang was set to 2.6 version in some parent pom of my project, and it was overriding the 2.4 version deduced from transitive dependency.

Sorry again ! 

Joel

ps : I think still me be useful to display the classpath used when running a job, if you think it is worth it I will create an issue for that.
,  @joel, If you think this is invalid, could you please resolve the jira as invalid?]
