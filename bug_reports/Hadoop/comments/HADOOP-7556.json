This message is automatically generated., I see my patch failed. Could some one tell me the correct branch (was using branch-0.20) and I will rebase. 
 , There's a couple of places the patch should go.

* if you want it in trunk & 0.23, then a patch against trunk will usually work in both
* for the 1.x branch, it'll need to be against hadoop/common/branches/branch-1/
, This appears to fixed in trunk. Closing.]
