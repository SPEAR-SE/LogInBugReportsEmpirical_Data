[During some pending yarn work, {{HttpServer}} was returning -1 for the listening port on some of the tests.  I found that -1 is only returned if the socket is not bound.  This simplifies the logic of ensuring the port is bound., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12525089/HADOOP-8334.patch

This message is automatically generated., The changes look good, and a lot simpler then they were before.  I like the new tests, and if everything passes I think it is OK.  Have you tested this on a cluster?, I haven't brought this up on a full cluster, but yarn tests appear ok.  This is only about successfully binding, so there aren't host issues to worry about., Yes, you are right once it is bound your really don't need to do any more then that. +1 (looks like there is already a JIRA for TestSequenceFile), Thanks Daryn,
