[Issue initially reported as an issue for Knox but should probably be fixed in HttpFS to be case insensitive., Hey [~tucu00] - any thoughts on this?, [~lmccay], HADOOP-11083 fixed this. Are you seeing the issue in a build with HADOOP-11083?, Oh, cool. Probably not a build that includes HADOOP-11083. I will follow up with the original filer on the KNOX-440 issue.
This has been committed to branch-2?

Thanks, [~tucu00]!, yes, in branch-2, it should be part of 2.6, Sweet - thanks!, Didn't realize that HADOOP-11083 addressed this for HttpFS. Closing as a duplicate.]
