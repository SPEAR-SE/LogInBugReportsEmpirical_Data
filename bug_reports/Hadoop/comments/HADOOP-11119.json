This message is automatically generated., [~aw] Let me know you opinion on this fix , Basically, interactive commands shouldn't show the message but daemons should.  Totally eliminating the message isn't going to work., Yes, I agree with you..can we print like "trash is enabled and going to move to /user/Trash/Dir ( per one delete call) "? Or might not require also since this is not a daemon command ( rm command )..Please correct me If I am wrong., bq.Please correct me If I am wrong.

You're wrong.

TrashPolicyDefault.init() is called by both the NN and the client process., \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. Basically, interactive commands shouldn't show the message but daemons should. Totally eliminating the message isn't going to work.
I think, moving the log message from {{TrashPolicyDefault#initialize(..)}} to {{TrashPolicyDefault.Emptier}}  constructor would do the trick. As Emptier would be running only in the ActiveNamenode and this Emptier constuctor would be called only in NN. So client will no longer have the log message.

What you say [~aw] ?, Thanks a lot for taking look into this issue.As you pointed Emptier will be called by only ANN, Client can git rid off this log.. Updated patch based on your comment.., \\

This message was automatically generated., Looks like the emptier log interval gets printed twice now., {code}      if (emptierInterval > deletionInterval || emptierInterval == 0) {
        LOG.info("The configured checkpoint interval is " +
                 (emptierInterval / MSECS_PER_MINUTE) + " minutes." +
                 " Using an interval of " +
                 (deletionInterval / MSECS_PER_MINUTE) +
                 " minutes that is used for deletion instead");
        this.emptierInterval = deletionInterval;
      }{code}
[~aw], I think you are referring to this log. Yeah, since by default {{emptierInterval}} is 0, and admin might mainly care about {{deletionInterval}}, just to enable trash, it prints two log messages.
But I think this is Okay as this is using {{deletionInterval}} if {{emptierInterval}} is more than {{deletionInterval}} or not configured.

Same two log messages will be present at NameNode side without patch too. Below log is from one of my machine, without patch.
{noformat}2015-05-28 18:38:36,042 INFO org.apache.hadoop.fs.TrashPolicyDefault: Namenode trash configuration: Deletion interval = 10 minutes, Emptier interval = 0 minutes.
2015-05-28 18:38:36,043 INFO org.apache.hadoop.fs.TrashPolicyDefault: The configured checkpoint interval is 0 minutes. Using an interval of 10 minutes that is used for deletion instead{noformat}, Seems this is duplicate of HDFS-6775, which was raised first and in patch available.
Resolving as duplicate., Thanks [~vinayrpet]]
