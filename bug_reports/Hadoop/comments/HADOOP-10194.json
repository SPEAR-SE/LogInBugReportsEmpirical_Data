[Shouldn't we just discuss this on HADOOP-6864?, er, I meant to say HADOOP-7147, HADOOP-10699 took care of {{setnetgrent}} portability issues while working on getting the code to build on Mac.  The code currently builds fine on Mac, so I don't believe there are any remaining issues to track here.  I'm resolving it as duplicate.]
