[Here is a trivial one-liner patch to update BUILDING.txt.  For reference, the reason for this is that earlier versions of CMake had a bug that prevented finding the JNI headers on Mac:

This message is automatically generated., Hi Chris, which problem when build using cmake 2.6? I am using cmake 2.8 and macos10.9, and can build current trunk successfully.
, Hi, Binglin.  Please see my prior comment for a link to the relevant CMake bug.  I'm on OS X 10.9.4 and running Oracle JDK 1.7.0_67.  The package places jni_md.h under a "darwin" sub-directory:

{code}
> tree $JAVA_HOME/include
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk/Contents/Home/include
├── classfile_constants.h
├── darwin
│   ├── jawt_md.h
│   └── jni_md.h
├── jawt.h
├── jdwpTransport.h
├── jni.h
├── jvmti.h
└── jvmticmlr.h

1 directory, 8 files
{code}

The fix in CMake 3.0 was to change FindJNI.cmake to look under the darwin sub-directory.

I'll hold off on committing this until tomorrow.  Let me know if you think I'm missing anything., Ooh, java1.7 I'm currently using java1.6 so that's why cmake2.8 works for me. Thanks for the explanation, please commit. 
, Thanks for the reviews, Allen and Binglin.  I committed this to trunk and branch-2., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6150 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6150/])
