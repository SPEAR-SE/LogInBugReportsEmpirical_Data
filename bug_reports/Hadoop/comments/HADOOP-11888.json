[As I debug, this patch can solve the problem, Attached patch. Please review. , This issue we got in java 1.8 but same is working in java 1.7.

This log is from kerberos server 

{code}
Apr 27 12:43:31 host-10-19-92-127 krb5kdc[9733](info): TGS_REQ (3 etypes {16 23 18}) 1.2.3.4: UNKNOWN_SERVER: authtime 0,  dsperf/huawei@HADOOP.COM for HTTP/1.2.3.4@HADOOP.COM, Server not found in Kerberos database
Apr 27 12:43:31 host-10-19-92-127 krb5kdc[9733](info): TGS_REQ (3 etypes {16 23 18}) 1.2.3.4: UNKNOWN_SERVER: authtime 0,  dsperf/huawei@HADOOP.COM for HTTP/1.2.3.4@HADOOP.COM, Server not found in Kerberos database
{code}

This problem is coming when standby namenode try to download fsimage from active namenode in bootstrapStandby command. SN will send HTTP request to AN and AN try to authenticate request.

AN will create SN spnego principal through this logic.

{code}
  gssManager.createName(
                      KerberosUtil.getServicePrincipal("HTTP", serverName),
                      KerberosUtil.getOidInstance("NT_GSS_KRB5_PRINCIPAL")),
{code}

But itâ€™s not able to get hostname of SN, here *serverName* is IP of SN machine. Principal should be like this *HTTP/hostname@HADOOP.COM*

It is blocked issue, updating the Severity.

Attached the patch, please review.
, Linked to HADOOP-11090; JDK8 support in Hadoop. Note that 2.6.0 has other JDK-8+ Kerberos issues, though your's looks like a new one.

What happens if the server name *is* an IP address? , The hostname must be canonicalized, not just resolved.  This is a dup of HADOOP-11628]
