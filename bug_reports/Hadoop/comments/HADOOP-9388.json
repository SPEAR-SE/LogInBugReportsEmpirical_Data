[Attaching the patch.

Test cases fail when they try to move a file from src to dst because the file handle is still open. Bug is in CommandWithDestination#copyFileToTarget as it is not closing the stream after copy., No need to add new unittest cases, as TestFsShellCopy already fails on Windows because of this bug., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
