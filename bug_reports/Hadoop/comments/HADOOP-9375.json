[the patch for branch-1 is the same as the one for branch-1.1, It may be a good idea to use the original jira if the patch is identical instead of opening a new one.

+1 for the patch. BTW this will become available in 1.2.0., Thanks a lot. I will just upload the patch (the file path changes a little bit) to the original jira next time., adding 1.2.0 to fixVersion, per CHANGES.txt and above comments.
Also marking this Resolved/Fixed, as that was presumably the committer's intention,
and unit test results on 1.2.0 build show this unit test failure no longer occurs., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
