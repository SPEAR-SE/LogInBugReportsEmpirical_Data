This patch fixes the above problem. 

Changed 'doUpgrade()' not to throw IOException so that we don't miss such exceptions. Also doUpgrade catches RuntimException, logs it and then throws if it ever occurs.
, # import Random can be removed.
# BlockCrcUpgradeObjectDatanode.doUpgrade() should not catch and re-throw RuntimeException, because the framework
already catches Exception and loops. I don't see the point of catching the same exception twice here.
# BlockCrcUpgradeObjectDatanode.doUpgrade() should be declared to throw an IOException as the abstract declaration does.
, Thanks for the review Konstantin.

Updated the patch with suggested changes.
