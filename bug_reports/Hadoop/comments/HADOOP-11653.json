[Can I take this Jira, if you are ok?, Sure.  This one is pretty easy really.  The file list filter needs to get modified and the existing profiles need to get renamed.  You'll want to build a git apply-style patch for it since we're doing a rename., Sorry, I am little confused here. 
do you mean adding .sh extension to shellprofiles, is renaming 'hadoop' to 'hadoop.sh' for example?, I specifically mean shellprofiles as introduced by HADOOP-11485., If this is solely motivated by forward-looking Windows compatibility, I don't think it's necessary.  I'm pretty sure cmd.exe requires script files to have a .cmd or .bat extension.  We could allow the *nix shell profiles to have no extension, and they could coexist with the corresponding .cmd files.

I have no objection to the change though if there are other good reasons for it, or if others simply prefer the clarity of having an extension., The current code uses *, which means it would pick up both the shell code and the .cmd/.bat files.  While it's certainly possible to just exclude those from the generated list, I feel it's better to just tie this down to .sh files for the clarity reasons, as you stated.
