This message is automatically generated., This is a fix for a non-deterministic bug (a thread synchronization issue). A unit test case for this fix would be flaky.
The verification was done by (i) running mvn compile/install/test, (ii) running Spark benchmarks and making sure there are no performance regressions, Thank you for taking this JIRA, [~nravi].

+1(non-binding), reviewed and confirmed it's a only critical section about finalParameters without lock within Configuration instance.

 [~cnauroth], can you take a look, please?, +1 for the patch.  Thank you, Nishkam and Tsuyoshi.

I can't commit this right now.  I'll aim to commit tomorrow.  If I don't commit it in the next few days, please ping me again in case I forget.  :-), Thanks Tsuyoshi and Chris., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5456 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5456/])
