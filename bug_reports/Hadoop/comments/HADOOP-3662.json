[I am trying to get familiar with the Hadoop project guidelines and procedures, so I wrote a small path the implement the changes described in this issue.

The message would become:
"BLOCK* Removing block " + block + " from neededReplications as it reached replication " + numEffectiveReplicas + "; required is " + requiredReplication + ".", Updated patch to conform to the max 80 chars per line rule., This issue is no longer valid.  Tomas, thanks for working on this.]
