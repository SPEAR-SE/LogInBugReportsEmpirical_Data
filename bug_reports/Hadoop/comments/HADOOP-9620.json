[Let me get it straight: the unit tests failures were invisible before and during the merge and then popped up once the commit was finished?, I think I put it in the wrong way. We only saw some unit tests failing in branch-2 on Windows while those tests are passing in trunk on Windows. Previously we are mainly focus on trunk failures. The commits involved are porting individual trunk fixes to branch-2. The unit tests failures happened in branch-2 were overlooked. This JIRA intended to track the work to make those branch-2 only failures passing on Windows. As some of them are not happening in trunk, we may directly fix them in branch-2. Does this make sense to you?, Oh, yes - that totally makes sense. Appreciate the explanation! ]
