[Currently all the comination of createFlag and the expected behavior is not clearly defined in FileContext#create(). Here is my proposal on how the combination must behave the behavior a user needs:

CreateFlag specifies the file create semantic. Users can combine flags like:
EnumSet.of(CreateFlag.CREATE, CreateFlag.APPEND)

Use the CreateFlag as follows:
CREATE - to create a file if it does not exist, else throw FileAlreadyExists.
APPEND - to append to a file if it exists, else throw FileNotFoundException.
OVERWRITE - to truncate a file if it exists, else throw FileNotFoundException.
CREATE|APPEND - to create a file if it does not exist, else append to an existing file.
CREATE|OVERWRITE - to create a file if it does not exist, else overwrite an existing file.

Following combination is not valid and will result in HadoopIllegalArgumentException:
APPEND|OVERWRITE
CREATE|APPEND|OVERWRITE
, Attached patch makes the following changes:
# Added test for various CreateFlag combinations
# Removed redundant RawLocalFileSystem#primitiveCreate(), as the based implementation FileSystem#primitiveCreate() is identical.
# Added documentation and validation in {{CreateFlag}}
 , +1, however I have the following minor suggestion for improvement.

Change the tests for exception to take advantage of Junit's @Test(expected=xxxx ...).
This will force you to create separate methods for each of the tests but it is easier to maintain., We should also check for empty set.  I know you got it already., Both comments taken care of in this new patch., Thanks. And thanks for documenting the flags and cleaning up the exceptions and tests., +1 overall.
