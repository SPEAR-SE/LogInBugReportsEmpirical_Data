[Links to java framework in the "mac" way instead of against libjvm or libserver directly.  Forces mac to compile a dynamic library., uses mac specific dynamiclib flag and share library install name.
I may have removed the "-m32" compile flags, whoops., Can you make it configurable? like with a #ifdef or somehow auto-confable?

, this is a good start to fixing some of our build problems.
, The fuse-dfs project uses autoconf and their build fails, so that alone isn't a fix.  The project just needs people testing mac.
I'm afraid this is all the time I can offer at the moment, and I don't have any make experience anyway.  It took a long time to figure this out..., Unfortunately, this can't be committed as-is; it breaks the build for other platforms., Fixed elsewhere.]
