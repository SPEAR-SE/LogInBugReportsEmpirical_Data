[Thanks for reporting this [~liguirong98].
I've seen the same failure locally on OSX within IntelliJ when trying to run unit tests that depend on hadoop-minikdc, and the workaround would be to:
- go to {{hadoop-minikdc}}'s Dependencies tab
- Edit the dependency {{Maven: org.apache.directory.jdbm:apacheds-jdbm1:bundle:2.0.0-M2}}, add {{DIR_TO_M2/.m2/repository/org/apache/directory/jdbm/apacheds-jdbm1/2.0.0-M2/apacheds-jdbm1-2.0.0-M2.jar}} to 'Classes' (initially only an entry with suffix {{bundle}} in there).

If I run those same tests from command line though, I don't see the problem. And considering jenkins never complained about it, I guess we don't need to change any pom.
Also see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSHARED-134 for similar discussions.]
