[Actually, the bug is not in rpc.Client.call(..) since it is not supposed to handle retry.  The bug is in one of the RPC.getProxy(..) methods which calls proxy.getProtocolVersion(..).  The retry handler is not yet set up at that point.

Revised summary and description., c9458_20130406.patch: adds a checkVersion parameter to RPC.getProxy(..)., I applied this patch to my cluster and ran through the pig tests where within 5 seconds of the pig submission the job tracker was restarted. With this patch the tests passed consistently., +1

I just committed this, thanks Nic! 

Also, thanks to [~arpitgupta] for verifying this!, Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
