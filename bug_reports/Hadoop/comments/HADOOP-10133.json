[Is HADOOP_HOME environment variable or Java property "hadoop.home.dir" been set? We are relying on these two methods to discover "winutils.exe". Also "winutils.exe" have no dependency on cygwin, so there should be no need to start the Hadoop processes from cygwin., Yes, both variables had been set. 
I have not been working on this for a while (gave up on windows version, as both cygwin and "direct" version had a host of different issues).
This particular issue I was able to pinpoint as a problem in variable declarations/initialization in util.Shell.java.
This line:
private static String HADOOP_HOME_DIR = checkHadoopHome();	
is missing a "final" keyword, as "final" variables are initialized before non-final ones, resulting that (in this case) HADOOP_HOME_DIR was still Null at the time of WINUTILS variable initialization.

Interesting thing though is that this particular issue does not appear on non-cygwin setup - must have had some extra patch somewhere.
, I have confirmed that I am having the same issue with Windows+cygwin setup., modifying this line in libexec\hadoop-config.sh helped me  to transform path to windows format for Java code to pick it up .

HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS -Dhadoop.home.dir="$(cygpath -pw "$HADOOP_PREFIX")"", hadoop on windows doesn't depend on cygwin any more. resolving as WONTFIX, HADOOP-11464, targeted to Apache Hadoop 2.7.0, reinstates support for launching Hadoop processes on Windows using Cygwin.]
