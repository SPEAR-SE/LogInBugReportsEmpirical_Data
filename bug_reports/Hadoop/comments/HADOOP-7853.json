[This was really "fun" to debug since it appears in specific cases.

The problem will cripple the JT's ability to accept incoming connections.  The JT will login and acquire a kerberos ticket on startup.  When the ticket is about to expire, the JT will logout & re-login to obtain a new ticket.  If the SPNEGO class has been loaded, the JT will logout and appear to re-login successfully.  Unfortunately the UGI's Subject will only contain unix credentials, but no kerberos ticket.  This is due to SPNEGO optionally requiring kerberos and not including the crucial HadoopLoginModule.

SPNEGO is unexpectedly loaded even if webhdfs is disabled.  What happens is that the token renewer service typically does not have to traverse into the webhdfs class to find a renewer.  We detected the problem when Oozie submitted a job with a hive token with a job.  The service loader walked all the renewer classes.  When webhdfs was loaded it triggered the loading of SPNEGO which stomped the security configuration.  At this point the JT refuses incoming connections., UGI and SPNEGO will now instantiate a LoginContext that explicitly uses their respective security configurations.  Even if another class sets the global security conf, UGI and SPNEGO will not be affected.

Extra log debugs are included that were invaluable in tracking down this silent problem. , Kihwal Lee also deserves credit for helping track down this very elusive problem., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Using instance Kerberos configuration makes sense.

What I'm failing to understand is why a submission to Oozie made JT to fail?

Also, in the UGI, the Hadoop kerberos configuration has renewTGT set to true, why does UGI then need to have a thread for renewal (in spawnAutoRenewalThreadForUserCreds method)? Why even has to use kinit? What am I missing here?, BTW, Nice hunting job.

And we need a patch for trunk and 0.23 for this., I agree to the approach taken in the patch. Some comments
1) Please wrap the LOG.debug statements with isLogDebugEnabled.
2) Indentation of logPriviledgedAction.
3) Change to SecurityUtil.java doesn't seem required.
4) DummyLoginConfiguration is a good idea. Please clarify in the comment that it is there to ensure that statically configured one is not used., bq. BTW, Nice hunting job.

Thanks!  You don't want to know how long this took to track this down.  The problem manifested on only one grid, and it took 20-24 hours for the problem to show up.  It was only this week that we made the association with hive and could reproduce the problem.

bq. What I'm failing to understand is why a submission to Oozie made JT to fail?

Sorry for the confusion.  Technically it had nothing to do with oozie; the oozie job happened to contain a hive token.  The hive token triggered the bug, but is not responsible for the bug.

Normally the token renewer service loader won't go past the hdfs, hftp, or mr renewers.  The hive token caused it to load all of the renewer classes.  The renewer classes are nested classes within the class that creates the token.  The webhdfs class stomped on the config when activated by the service loader.

bq. Also, in the UGI, the Hadoop kerberos configuration has renewTGT set to true, why does UGI then need to have a thread for renewal (in spawnAutoRenewalThreadForUserCreds method)? Why even has to use kinit? What am I missing here?

I wondered about that too, but it was out of scope for this show stopping bug.  Our env is using keytabs so it would have only been a distraction.  It might deserve another jira., Per Jitendra's comments:
# Added {{isLogDebugEnabled}}
# Fixed
# I reverted 2 of the log lines.  They made it easier to eyeball a noisy log but aren't strictly needed.  I left the one line that dumps the subject when no TGT is found.  The reason is this line is what finally led us to the problem when we saw that the subject contained only unix credentials., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me, except that "privilege" is spelled incorrectly in "{{logPriviledgedAction}}"., The *testDelegateJaasConfiguration()* method sets a global context other than the dummy one (which is been set once once with @BeforeClass), if the test run in different order this may create error situations.

The setup of dummy should be done @Before and @After each testcase to avoid this., and the *setupMockJassParent()* method should do something like:

{code}
  private static void setupMockJaasParent() {
    javax.security.auth.login.Configuration existing = null;
    try {
      existing =javax.security.auth.login.Configuration.getConfiguration();
      assertFalse("setupMockJaasParent should run before the Hadoop " +
                  "configuration provider is installed.",
                  existing.getClass().getCanonicalName()
                  .startsWith("org.apache.hadoop") && ! existing.getClass().getCanonicalName()
                  .endsWith("DummyLoginConfiguration"));
    } catch (SecurityException se) {
      // We get this if no configuration has been set. So it's OK.
    }

    mockJaasConf = mock(javax.security.auth.login.Configuration.class);
    Mockito.doReturn(new AppConfigurationEntry[] {})
      .when(mockJaasConf)
      .getAppConfigurationEntry("foobar-app");
    javax.security.auth.login.Configuration.setConfiguration(mockJaasConf);
  }
{code}

Although, I'd question the need for the *testDelegateJaasConfiguration()* method. And If you agree, then all this mock thingy goes., I wasn't sure if the {{testDelegateJaasConfiguration()}} and mocking is necessary, so I left it in.  After thinking about it further this morning, I agree with removal since the whole point of these tests is to ensure that UGI does not use the global config.  The tests with mocked objects verified that UGI was chaining the global configs, but that implementation is removed by this patch.

Since I'll remove those tests, I don't think {{@Before}} and {{@After}} are necessary?, Thanks for the reviews!
