[Saw another failure for this
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch/3191/testReport/, Linking this to HADOOP-2658, Gotta be in 0.19!, After several recent append bug fix patches are committed, this test seems not failing anymore.  We should observe this for a few days.  We could close this issue if the test does not fail again., No failure is observed after commited HADOOP-3883.  Closing this as a duplicate of HADOOP-3883., The test sometime fails again.  For example, see
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/657/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hdfs/TestFileAppend2/testComplexAppend/, Talking with Dhruba, this isn't a blocker for 0.19.0.  Assigning to 0.19.1 for now., This requires the append feature design and code fixes.  Closing as "later".]
