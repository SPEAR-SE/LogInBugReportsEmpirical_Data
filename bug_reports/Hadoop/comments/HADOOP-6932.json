[Boris, I'm curious what error did you see? Was is a complaint about Kerberos service principal name wasn't configured properly?, this one:
"Kerberos service principal name isn't configured properly (should have 3 parts)", You may want to consider adding the following to SecurityUtil.login(), just like UGI.loginUserFromKeytab() does. Also, shouldn't we throw an exception when keytabFilename == null?
{code}
    if (!UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled())
      return;
{code}, as per Kan's suggestion, ran ant test. All passed., Please make sure we don't break any existing code by throwing an exception when keytabFilename == null.
Otherwise, +1 on the patch., One minor nit, can we add a condition for keytabFilename.length() == 0 as well?, addressed Kan's comment and added test, +1., ran tests. all passed (except TestHdfsTrash, which fails anyway).
