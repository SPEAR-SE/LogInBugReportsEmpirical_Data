[There was a bug in the Hadoop scheduler that would schedule too many tasks on a node when the cluster was not full.  I fixed that in Hadoop-400, which has been committed after 0.5.0 was cut.

Another thing to keep in mind is that after the tasks are started, they can't be moved. So it is common to see the case where your last four (or 6 or 8) reduces are likely to be running on 2 (or 3 or 4) nodes (assuming 2 tasks/node).
, This was fixed in HADOOP-400.]
