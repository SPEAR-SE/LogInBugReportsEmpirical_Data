[Whoops, meant to open this against Hive., Does this mean that at run time, older versions of Hive will not run against Hadoop 2.7?, No, this just means that Hive will not compile against Hadoop 2.7. Run time should work on older versions., looking at the patch, there's enough referencing of the Hadoop class that there may be some link problems, Hmm, ok. If so, then this affects Hive-0.14. If you think this should warrant discussion about bringing the deprecated class back to the Hadoop code, then we can continue on this Jira; otherwise I'm going to copy this discussion to HIVE-9115, and would suggest we continue any such discussion there., Re-opening per [~stevel@apache.org] suggestion. I'll leave it to the Hadoop folks to sort out if it is appropriate to revert HADOOP-11356 for hadoop 2.7.

 I was thinking more of "revert that hadoop change from branch-2". We're looking at a minimal 2.7 release before the end of the month ("first Java 7 only") release, and don't want any regressions from hadoop 2.6. this would be one.
