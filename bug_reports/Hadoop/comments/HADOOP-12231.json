[the code in Hadoop, UnSupportedOperationException they do expect while calling setXIncludeAware() method,  get logged as error with full trace.
Hadoop code didnâ€™t throw that to the caller(getConfiguration() call). 

If we have application which calls Configuration.get() 100 times, this exception trace get logged 100times, 
Better it can be printed only once, that too warning message is enough, not necessary to log complete trace.


try {
 docBuilderFactory.setXIncludeAware(true);
} catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
 LOG.error("Failed to set setXIncludeAware(true) for parser " + docBuilderFactory  + ":" + e, e);
}



The above LOG.error() stmt suppose to be fixed.
