[This patch addresses the issue described, and also doubles the number of handlers for the TaskUmbilicalProtocol server to 2*maxCurrentTasks., i discovered an issue with the patch. Removing it and will submit another soon., Do we know why SocketTimeoutException is being thrown? Is the TT too busy responding to the call? How about increasing the socket timeout? I'm not sure you want to treat SocketConnectionTimeout and ConectException differently. What if the TT is hung, so that the former is thrown but not the latter - it might make sense for the Task to realize that and kill itself after 3 tries. , This issue is handled better in the related issue - HADOOP-1651]
