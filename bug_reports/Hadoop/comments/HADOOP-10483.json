[Please review patch. It's a very simple change, just wrapping a duration in milliseconds in a call to DurationFormatUtils.formatDurationHMS() instead of doing the math manually., Hi Alec,
I checked {{DurationFormatUtils.formatDurationHMS}} output.
Its not actually printing as you mentioned in description as "0d:1h:3m:2s:3ms". It just prints "01:03:02:003". 

In general, {{tokenRemoverScanInterval}} not expected to have values less than 1 min, though no strict validation is present., Hi Vinayakumar,

My bad, I can't believe I didn't check that. This output format makes sense to me, but I am more than willing to write a patch that prints in the requested format. Which solution is preferred?
