[I defined a public method, which results in two warnings, which don't make much sense:
{code}
<error line="645" column="3" severity="error" message="Method &apos;getUgi&apos; is not designed for extension - needs to be abstract, final or empty." source="com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.design.DesignForExtensionCheck"/>
<error line="645" column="3" severity="error" message="Missing a Javadoc comment." source="com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.javadoc.JavadocMethodCheck"/>
{code}

Moreover, {{checkstyle-result-diff.txt}} is not helpful, it doesn't list the detail of the additional checkstyle errors. On the other side, {{checkstyle-result-patch.xml}} and {{checkstyle-result-trunk.xml}} are to big to read efficiently., It's complaining about things I don't recall being part of the coding style guidelines, like every method parameter being declared final or every variable or method must have a javadoc comment., Closing this as a dupe of HADOOP-11866., From the description and patch posted to HADOOP-11866 it appears to be improving the ability to understand what checkstyle is complaining about rather than updating what it will complain about.  That doesn't sound like it will cover the issues raised here unless there are plans to increase the scope of that JIRA., Hi [~aw] ,

Is the scope of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11866 being increased? Unless that is the case, this JIRA needs to be re-opened.

thanks,
-Sidharta, I am re-opening this issue because the scope of this JIRA is different., +1 for fixing this.  checkstyle has become very difficult to use, and basically we are starting to ignore it because of all the false positives.  We also historically have not been that strict about whitespace in Hadoop.  Is there a convincing argument for changing this?  To put it another way, how many actual bugs have been caught by this thing?, A specific ask is to relax parameter number to ignore methods with \@Override annotation. Attaching a sample patch for that change., bq. Line is longer than 80 characters
Fixed by HADOOP-13603.

bq. "Missing a Javadoc comment." - for every private member including cases like "Configuration conf". 
Currently only {{JavadocType}} is turned on. So checkstyle checks Javadoc comments for class and interface definitions only., Submitting [~jeagles] patch. A two-year old JIRA crossed with other, subsequent fixes is too hard to track. If this is worth committing, let's push it. If there's still checkstyle tuning to be done, let's pick it up in another ticket., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
