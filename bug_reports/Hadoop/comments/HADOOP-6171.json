[Here is patch for hdfs subproject., Hey Ted. Thanks for providing the patches! Unfortunately with the way the project is currently structured, we need to have a separate JIRA for each project (common, hdfs, and mr). Could you open new JIRAs on those projects and "Link" them to this one? You can then upload the individual patches there., I think this JIRA is no longer needed after mavenization.]
