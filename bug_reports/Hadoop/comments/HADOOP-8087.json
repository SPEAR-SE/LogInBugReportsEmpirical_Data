[Paths are a subset of URIs.  A relative URI permits an authority even when a scheme is not present.

I'd expect "//foo/bar" to be interpreted as "${defaultScheme}//foo/bar".

, Seems like this might be related to HADOOP-7418., I did some tests and this bug is still present:

{code}
cmccabe@keter:~> /h/bin/hadoop fs -ls /alpha/beta

drwxr-xr-x   - cmccabe supergroup          0 2013-07-17 11:51 /alpha/beta/gamma
cmccabe@keter:~> /h/bin/hadoop fs -ls //alpha/beta
ls: No FileSystem for scheme: null
{code}

For consistency's sake, I think we should interpret {{//alpha/beta}} as the path {{/alpha/beta}} in the default scheme.

It's also worth pointing out that in shell scripts, it's a lot simpler to just do this:
{code}
./bin/hadoop fs -touchz /${FOO}/${BAR}/${BAZ}
{code}

without having to special-case the scenario where FOO is empty.  If you have do something different when FOO is empty (like omit a slash) the script gets complex.  This is the real win behind handling multiple slashes as a path separator, as we currently do., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I came across this issue as part of a 0.23 backlog review.

Will this issue be resolved in 0.23 or 2.0? If not, can we remove the 0.23.3 and 2.0.0-alpha targets and leave this JIRA targeted for 3.0.0?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., It's a simple change so I'd like it to remain targeted to at least 2.x., Wow, this is an oldie (and not goodie).

I agree that we should fix this in 2.x.  It should be a compatible change., While the previous patches resolved the double slash '//', it does not fix if there are more slashes, example:
[hadoop@localhost common]$ hadoop fs -ls ///user/
ls: No FileSystem for scheme: null
[hadoop@localhost common]$ hadoop fs -ls ////user/
ls: No FileSystem for scheme: null

Attaching a patch that resolves any number of slashes to be consistent as regular Linux systems. With the new patch:

This message was automatically generated., Strange, the whitespace info at

shows:
./start-build-env.sh:24:if [ "$(uname -s)" == "Linux" ]; then   

seems like some script error (?).

When I ran the dev-support/test-patch.sh on the latest 005 patch, it gave me no whitespaces errors:

, Looks like the issue is similar to HADOOP-7418. I'm closing as duplicate, please feel free to reopen if some one feels its valid.

[Reference discussion thread|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7418?focusedCommentId=14534243&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14534243], Reopened as Doug Cutting's comment about treating no scheme as default scheme is valid.. Rajesh Kartha has given patch recently. That can be tested and taken ahead., Thanks for the pointers, I have a query
Acc to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3
It says "If a URI does not contain an authority component, then the path cannot begin with two slash characters ("//")"

I find it conflicting with your comment. Please correct me if I'm wrong., The latest patch is ready for review, can someone please help review it., I see that patch parses the double-slash to proper path.

but  RFC links from the [~cutting] tells double-slashes at the beginning are valid. Its just that we are not handing in hadoop. 
RFC mentions in section 4.2 as below.
{noformat}A relative reference that begins with two slash characters is termed
   a network-path reference; such references are rarely used.{noformat}, Thanks Vinayakumar.

I agree, it could be a rare usage but seems valid. Linux for sure honors that:

[rajeshk@cloudred ~]$ ls -l //home///rajeshk
total 1176
[rajeshk@cloudred ~]$ ls -l ///home//rajeshk
total 1176
