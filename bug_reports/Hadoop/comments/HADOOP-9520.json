[_HOST on the server will use the canonical hostname of the host which is usually the first interface.  While using _HOST in a principal within the client's config is ok, the principal in the server's config should use the exact hostname on multi-interface hosts., FWIW, I'm fully expecting to fix this bug myself like I did for our branch-1 install.  People wanted me to file bugs.  I did and got the fully expected push back that ops teams are required to hard code everything (despite this being completely unnecessary and mostly unintuitive vs ~4 code change).

, I'm interested in the patch.  We currently hard code the hostname of the principal on multi-NIC servers, but not on clients.]
