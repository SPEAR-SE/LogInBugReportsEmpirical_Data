[[~anand_vihar] it looks like a problem related to class path. Could you send user at hadoop.apache.org? Closing this ticket as invalid for now., I have sent to user@hadoop.apache.org and no response from them., Hmm, unfortunately, I cannot find your email. Could you send it to user at hadoop.apache.org again with operating system you're using and classpath you configured? I'll reply it against your email., Dear Ozawa San:
Please find below
Following customizations made to hadoop-env.sh to get Hadoop started

, Please check the classpath you're using., Dear San:
I have not made any changes to hadoop classpath. Except for the five exports above, there is no change in hadoop-env.sh. Interestingly, if I do not include the above changes and run
hadoop version

I get java errors. But when I include above, hadoop version succeeds saying that it included required files from hadoop/share. Most of hadoop classes files are under the share directory. I am having a hard time de-bugging this issue. Your help is deeply appreciated.
Thanks

Can somebody help me resolve this rather then closing it. I have sent this to user@hadoop and that E-mail does not exist. This is a show stopper for me, and nobody here or anywhere has responded. Shall be very thankful if somebody can help. Thanks

Anand Murali, 

Anand, please look at the [Invalid JIRA Issue|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/InvalidJiraIssues] wiki page and recognise that these and the other JIRAs you are filing are not considered problems in the Hadoop codebase. 

# Nobody is going to help you via the JIRAs, it is not a support site. 
# The users mailing list is the probably the only place that is going to help you. Subscribe at [http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html#User]
# Your issue here isn't even a hadoop problem, its a "Java classpath for compiling code" problem. Nobody tries to compile java code on the command line like this, precisely because it is impossible to get the classpath right. Either download an IDE and set it up, or download a build tool like [Apache Maven|http://maven.apache.org/] and set up a command line build that works.

, Dear Steve:
Many thanks for your response. This is deeply appreciated. Assuming, I use Eclipse, Kepler to do write code and compile, I still need to configure Hadoop to talk to Keepler. I am having problems just starting the daemons, how do I get help to fix this and also configure Kepler to Hadoop-2.2.0. I have done google search on these issues without much use. Your advise is deeply appreciated.
Thanks,
Regards,
