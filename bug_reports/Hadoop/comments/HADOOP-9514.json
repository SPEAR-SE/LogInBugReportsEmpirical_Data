[It would be nice if we could make the usage across the commands consistent.  Its nice to have a GenericOptionsParser but we either need to pull out the things that aren't truly generic across the commands or better yet have a way for different commands to specify which apply and perhaps add to it so that the usage comes out nicely to differentiate subcommands from generic options.    We also need to remove the general usage of "bin/hadoop command [genericOptions] [commandOptions]"

Note that this came about from discussion on YARN-126.

Note that even within subcommands of particular CLI's are inconsistent. For example with yarn:
$ yarn rmadmin
Usage: java RMAdmin
           [-refreshQueues]
           [-refreshNodes]
           [-refreshUserToGroupsMappings]
           [-refreshSuperUserGroupsConfiguration]
           [-refreshAdminAcls]
           [-refreshServiceAcl]
           [-getGroups [username]]
           [-help [cmd]]

$yarn application
usage: application
 -kill <arg>     Kills the application.
 -list           Lists all the Applications from RM.
 -status <arg>   Prints the status of the application.


Another examples is hdfs dfsadmin and then look at hdfs fsck (which happens to be printing generic usage options twice on trunk/branch-2)
, It may be good to do this in 2.0.5, if it introduces any incompatible behaviors, especially for YARN., I agree.  I am kind of hoping we don't have to break backwards compatibility with 0.23 but lets try to do it right and then see what comes up.]
