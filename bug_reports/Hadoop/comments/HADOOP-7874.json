Why has the arch directory been dropped?, The ARCH directory was dropped when we the tar layout for common/hdfs was introduced.

While we could easily re-introduce it, IMO it is not the right thing to do for the following reasons:

* The ARCH used by is a mix of the OS type (ie linux, mac,) and CPU ARCH (i386,amd64). However, having the same OS type and CPU arch does not ensure things will work because of native libraries depedencies required/available  in different OSes (we can restrict ourselves to linux for practical purposes).

* The build system does not handle building/packaging for different architectures.

* Hadoop release distribution is a source TARBALL, you can easily build it correctly (talking about nativelibs here) in your target platform.
, Sounds reasonable. What testing did you do on the current patch?, verified that the generate TAR has the native libs in the expected place lib/native/ an that hadoop-config.sh is setting the right path to java.library.path (by testing hadoop script), +1, committed to trunk and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1428 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1428/])
