[the path exists due a fundamental expectation in filesystems: paths are lists of path elements separated by "/", all path elements being one or more characters long. This is how "real" filesystems work, and so how we try to make Hadoop's s3 client behave.

See: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.8.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/introduction.html

It's never going to be fixed; you'll have to accept that you can't use paths like that. Sorry,]
