This message is automatically generated., This is not good. TestViewFSTrash is writing into ~/.Trash . It has no business writing in there. Can we all agree? Seems like LocalFileSystem will need to be changed. Thoughts anybody?
, Cancelling patch while we brainstorm the fix to the tests., There's a very illuminating discussion on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7284. I'm not sure what the right way going forward is. I'm suspending work on this JIRA for now. If someone wants to take over, please feel free, Any updates on this issue?
I guess we can just automatically ignore this test when detecting that it is running from outside /home., Hi Ahmed! Unfortunately this slipped in my priorities, and probably will remain so until we find the conviction to go fix all the issues in the implementation of Trash + ViewFS. I'll unassign myself from this. 

I don't know if ignoring the tests which fail (signalling a legitimate problem) is a good long term solution, but if you want to make it so, to fix your builds, I'll not stand in the way., The issue can be reproduced by trying to run TestFSMainOperationsLocalFileSystem or TestViewFSTrash from any location not under the system home directory. 

Here is a patch. I have confirmed that both tests successfully run from locations outside or under the system home directory., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., It looks like this patch is basically reverting some of the changes HADOOP-8036 made, e.g. to [ViewFileSystemTestSetup|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/common/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/viewfs/ViewFileSystemTestSetup.java?p2=%2Fhadoop%2Fcommon%2Ftrunk%2Fhadoop-common-project%2Fhadoop-common%2Fsrc%2Ftest%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fhadoop%2Ffs%2Fviewfs%2FViewFileSystemTestSetup.java&p1=%2Fhadoop%2Fcommon%2Ftrunk%2Fhadoop-common-project%2Fhadoop-common%2Fsrc%2Ftest%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fhadoop%2Ffs%2Fviewfs%2FViewFileSystemTestSetup.java&r1=1245751&r2=1245750&view=diff&pathrev=1245751]. Is that right? Perhaps Colin and Eli could comment.

Also, see HADOOP-8110, particularly Daryn's comment about how TestViewFsTrash tries to delete the user's home directory. It would be good if this patch fixed that too.

, Yes, I brought back some of the changes that HADOOP-8036 deleted. Basically to be able to run the tests outside the home directory, we need to add back the link to the test root directory and not just the home directory. So HADOOP-8036 needed to add an additional link and not to replace the one I brought back.

Regarding Daryn's comment on  HADOOP-8110, this is part of the logic in the test that should fail and the test is confirming that it'll fail., +1 Looks good to me, I think HADOOP-8036 erroneously removed this code (establishing a link to the first component of the test dir)., Thanks for the explanation, Ahmed. I tried running TestFSMainOperationsLocalFileSystem and TestViewFsTrash from outside my home directory and they failed without the patch, and passed with it. Both still passed when run from within my home directory.

+1, The change looks good to me too +1, so with 3 +1s I will be checking this in., Thanks Ahmed for driving this over the finish line.  I put this into trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2458 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2458/])
