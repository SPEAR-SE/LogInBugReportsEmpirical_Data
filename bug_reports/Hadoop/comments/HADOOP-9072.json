[Hadoop-8930 configured the clover plugin.  One of the configuration items was to set the includeAllSourceRoots to true.  The default value is false (http://docs.atlassian.com/maven-clover2-plugin/3.0.5/setup-mojo.html).  There are two mvn calls for hadoop-common-project, the first  one builds the packages and the second one runs the clover test.  Changing includeAllSourceRoots to false prevents the clover from instrumenting generated test source code.  , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
