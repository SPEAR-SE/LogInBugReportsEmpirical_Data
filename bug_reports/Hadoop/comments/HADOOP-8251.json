[The bug was simple -- the string used for the name of the Krb5Util class was mistakenly just the package name instead of the class name.

It looks like the IBM implementation has the same bug, but googling around, I don't think there even _is_ a Krb5Util class in IBM's library, at least not with the functions we need. So I am skeptical that security support works when running on the IBM JRE., +1 nice catch Todd. HADOOP-7211 covers security and the IBM jdk. , -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Attaching branch-1 patch, which is identical but for the file paths. I'll commit this momentarily, Committed to branch-1, branch-1.0, branch-2, and trunk (whew!), Excellent catch, Todd! 

Could you please address the IBM code patch as well. I did a quick check again on the JDK I have:
java version "1.6.0"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build pxi3260sr10-20111208_01(SR10))
IBM J9 VM (build 2.4, JRE 1.6.0 IBM J9 2.4 Linux x86-32 jvmxi3260sr10-20111207_96808 (JIT enabled, AOT enabled)
J9VM - 20111207_096808
JIT  - r9_20111107_21307ifx1
GC   - 20110519_AA)
JCL  - 20111104_02, 

It seems Krb5Util is there. Also, the methods we are interested in seems to be there.

The jar that contains the Krb5Util.class is ibmjgssprovider.jar in the JDK. 

The output of javap on the extracted class is:

Compiled from "Krb5Util.java"
public class com.ibm.security.jgss.mech.krb5.Krb5Util extends java.lang.Object{
    public static javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket getTicketFromSubjectAndTgs(int, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.security.AccessControlContext)       throws javax.security.auth.login.LoginException, com.ibm.security.krb5.KrbException, java.io.IOException;
    static javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket getTicket(int, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.security.AccessControlContext)       throws javax.security.auth.login.LoginException;
    public static javax.security.auth.Subject getSubject(int, java.security.AccessControlContext)       throws javax.security.auth.login.LoginException;
    public static javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosKey[] getKeys(int, java.lang.String, java.security.AccessControlContext)       throws javax.security.auth.login.LoginException;
    public static javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket credsToTicket(com.ibm.security.krb5.Credentials);
    public static com.ibm.security.krb5.Credentials ticketToCreds(javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket)       throws com.ibm.security.krb5.KrbException, java.io.IOException;
}

Seems like the methods are there and with the desired signatures..

Did I miss something?, Hey Devaraj. Sorry, I already committed this, and I don't feel comfortable changing the code if I can't test it (I don't have ready access to an IBM JDK installation). I think rather than just fixing this bug, someone should run through the whole security test plan on the IBM JDK -- perhaps as part of HADOOP-7211?

I was basing it on these docs:

, Krb5Util is available in J9 SR10 (the current version of IBM JDK). I thought that I saw a TestSecurityUtil in ddas' patch. I guess not :)

Please have at least one simple test that fails without the patch., bq. Please have at least one simple test that fails without the patch.

I'm just fixing what the previous patch broke. I don't have time to write a test, since this depends on security infrastructure, etc, and I can't get that to work right (see my comment on HDFS-3016). The original patch should have had a test, I agree. But my options were to revert that patch, or just fix it, so I did the latter without a test., bq. Sorry, I already committed this, and I don't feel comfortable changing the code if I can't test it (I don't have ready access to an IBM JDK installation). I think rather than just fixing this bug, someone should run through the whole security test plan on the IBM JDK â€“ perhaps as part of HADOOP-7211?
