Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HADOOP-Build/1391//console

This message is automatically generated., Failure in TestZKFailoverController is caused HADOOP-8591., I'm not sure that we should prevent nulls for the various fields.  Although I'm fine with handling a null identifier even though that's really an invalid use case., I don't think it is important to distinguish between null and empty fields in the Token class. Default constructor initializes to empty fields. For consistency and to avoid checks for nullness, IMHO it is easier to prevent fields to be null altogether.

In the TestHftpDelegationToken test case both null and empty byte arrays are used to initialize identifier and password., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~kanaka] for taking this issue. Mostly looks good to me. Two comments:
1. For Token.addBinaryBuffer, we can drop null check for {{bytes}} since the variable is guaranteed to be non null.

{code}
+    assertEquals(token1, token2);
+    assertEquals(token1.toString(), token2.toString());
+    assertEquals(token1.encodeToUrlString(), token2.encodeToUrlString());
{code}
2. I'm thinking comparing {{Token.toString()}} is redundant and can be removed., Thanks [~ajisakaa] for review. I have updated the patch as per comments, please review., \\
