[The stack trace from my namenode log., A quick fix to hardcode the locale to English. It's not nice, but I think the whole FsShell and dfshealth.jsp page could use a bit of love., Upload patch again, this time with correct file suffix., Quick fix patch to use English locale to avoid number formatting trouble., If it is better, you can declare decimalFormat as a numberformat, then we don't need a cast.
