[The test was failing because it was checking for file sizes on disk and the sizes were hardcoded in the test. text file sizes can be different on different platforms based on character encodings etc. The fix was to read the actual file size from disk and then check values based on that instead of some hardcoded value. The test files are actually checked into the source as resources. Ideally, the test would generate these files on the fly instead of checking them in but I am leaving that re-organization of the code tree for later when the branch is merged back so as to simplify the merge., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
