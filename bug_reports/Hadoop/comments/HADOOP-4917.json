[Edited summary: "fs -ls" => "fs -lsr"

The problem is in lsr.  It can be reproduced when files are in different directories and the usernames have different lengths as shown in the description.  I think this problem also exists for group names although I have not tested it yet., Linux doesn't justify across directories on recursive ls either:

It could potentially be quite costly to gather the maximum spaces needed for justification across a very large namespace.  Perhaps it would be better to bring lsr closer in line with Unix, separating each listed directory with a header and allowing each directory to be justified relative to itself?, > Perhaps it would be better to bring lsr closer in line with Unix, separating each listed directory with a header and allowing each directory to be justified relative to itself?

+1 We probably should deprecate lsr and add a "-R" option to ls., Closing this as fixed, as -R was added.]
