[mapred-site.xml -> configuration, Jira is for reporting bugs. Not for asking questions. Please use user mailing list for questions. See http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html, But I think it's a bug (see my reference to other JIRA), If someone can confirm it isn't than that's sufficient to me. I've solved it by changing a parameter which shouldn't have an effect! So this implies that something is wrong with this parameter!, bq. But I think it's a bug (see my reference to other JIRA)
Sorry I could not find it. What is the jira number?, The correspondence I included in the link in the original message refers to:

"I filled MAPREDUCE-1571 to cover this issue"
