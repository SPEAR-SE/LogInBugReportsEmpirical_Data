[Proposed fix for 0.20:

Most of the keys in CommonConfigurationKeys.java are not used in 0.20, the variables
should be pruned down to:

    * FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY "fs.defaultFS", not in any xml file, should be fs.default.name which is in
core-default.xml

    * HADOOP_SECURITY_GROUP_MAPPING "hadoop.security.group.mapping" not in any xml file, add to
core-default.xml, default value is ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping

    * HADOOP_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION "hadoop.security.authentication" in src/core/core-default.xml

    * HADOOP_SECURITY_AUTHORIZATION "hadoop.security.authorization" in src/core/core-default.xml

    * HADOOP_SECURITY_SERVICE_USER_NAME_KEY "hadoop.security.service.user.name.key" not in any configuration
file, add a comment to core-default.xml, it has no default value

    * HADOOP_CLUSTER_ADMINISTRATORS_PROPERTY "hadoop.cluster.administrators" in src/core/core-default.xml

The javadoc comments will refer to core-default.xml file.
, Minor comments:
1. for javadoc comments, instead of "see core-default.xml", use a sentence to describe it.
2. last indention change is not needed., Re Hairong's feedback: we discussed this and decided to just use reference to core-defualt.xml (full filename) so that the documentation is not duplicated. As far as intendation goes it was consistent with other lines, however that config key was removed in the meantime so it doesn't matter anymore.

Other changes:

  - in the meantime HADOOP_CLUSTER_ADMINISTRATORS_PROPERTY was removed, see patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12443928/patch-1754-ydist.txt.

, should FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY be fs.default.name for the .20 patch?, For 0.22: issue of io.sort.mb and io.sort.factor should be resolved but is outside of scope of this jira, filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6801 io.sort.mb and io.sort.factor were renamed and moved to mapreduce but are still in CommonConfigurationKeysPublic.java and used in SequenceFile.java, For 0.22: seems like FS_CLIENT_BUFFER_DIR_KEY = "fs.client.buffer.dir" should be removed, filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6802 Remove FS_CLIENT_BUFFER_DIR_KEY = "fs.client.buffer.dir" from CommonConfigurationKeys.java (not used, deprecated), # In core-default.xml some new fields have been introduce without default values.
The default values should be there in order to define the default behavior and also as an example.
# Some fields new fields in core-default.xml are commented out. What does that mean?
If they are hidden (undocumented) variables, then they should not be core-default.xml,
if they are public, then they should not be commented out and have a reasonable default value.
# {{hadoop.security.group.mapping}} is listed twice in core-default.xml. 
Remove the one with empty value, and merge the descriptions.
# I think it makes sense to introduce the security section in core-default.xml and group all security fields under it:
{code}
 <!--- security properties -->
<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping</name>
...
{code}
# I did not understand the description of {{io.map.index.interval}}.
# In CommonConfigurationKeysPublic I am not sure where "See src/core/core-default.xml" should lead to.
I'd propose to use something like this:
{code}
/** See  <a href="{@docRoot}/common-default.xml">common-default.xml</a> */
{code}
# The comment in CommonConfigurationKeys
{code}
//TBD: Code is not updated to use following keys.
//These keys will be used in later versions
{code}
should be investigated in terms of which variables it is referred to.
In the least it is misplaced, because {{FS_AUTOMATIC_CLOSE_KEY}} and {{FS_FTP_HOST_KEY}} are definitely used.
If it is a legacy artifact, then let's remove it.

1, 2: some fields do not have reasonable defaults therefore are commented out and are without default values (I was told that empty values are not handled well by Configuration), if you can think of reasonable defaults for these please let me know

3: will fix

4: reasonable, will do

5: Let's discuss off-line and come up with something that makes sense, it's my best guess from looking at code

6: This is a bit tricky, there's core-default.html which is built by ant docs (not ant javadocs) and resulting core-default.html is outside of javadoc docRoot. It can be referred to using "{@docRoot}/../core-default.html" (note the parent directory of docRoot). This makes the end result ok for now but it's dangerous because it makes javadoc docs rely on docs built outside of javadoc.

7: This comment was there before, thought it's out of scope for this bug, i.e. I am trying to document existing variables, not decide which ones are used or not etc., Patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12446625/HADOOP-6756-0.22.0-1.patch resolves issues of previous patch as described in comment https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6756?focusedCommentId=12876461&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12876461

Description of changes:

1,2: we decided upon default values for previously commented out fields, all new config parameters are uncommented now

3: fixed

4: done

5: new description, hopefully it makes sense now

6: "{@docRoot}/../core-default.html" is used to refer to core-default.xml, it's a document created by ant docs (forrest generated docs)

7: made the comment clear, +1 on the patch., Patch HADOOP-6756-0.22.0-2.patch has a new improved  documentation for io.map.index.interval., HADOOP-6756-0.22.0-3.patch applies to current trunk on 2010/6/2, I just committed this.
