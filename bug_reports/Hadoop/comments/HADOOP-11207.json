This message is automatically generated., Looking at the patch for review. Can you link the original JIRA for DTAuthHandler?, Link HADOOP-10771, which brings DT auth stuff to common, Read up on the background - I was originally confused why HADOOP-10835 was not sufficient, I get it now.

Overall, there is proxy-user support for generic non-token calls, but there is no proxy-user for getting/renew/cancel tokens themselves.

I was surprised why HDFS didn't need it. It turns out HDFS doesn't depend on the common filter code, and instead duplicates the doAs code in JspHeper etc - that's why. Filed HDFS-7262 for this.

The patch looks good to me. Can you take care of the findbugs warnings?, bq.  Can you take care of the findbugs warnings?

One findbug will be fixed by HADOOP-11122. The other one is not related, and seems to be reported in several Jira's jenkins. Filed a ticket for it: HADOOP-11210, okie, makes sense. Checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.6. Thanks Zhijie!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6284 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6284/])
