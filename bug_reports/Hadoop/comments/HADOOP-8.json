[fixes the problem by connecting to the NameNode and using the address that the local socket is bound to instead of calling getLocalHost(), beware that this makes machineName in the DataNode constructor unused., The problem with this fix is that, if the namenode is down, the socket creation fails and we fail to launch a datanode.  So it would be great to have a better method than InetAddress.getLocalHost(), that tries harder to return the appropriate IP to advertise to the namenode, but that doesn't require the namenode to be up.

Perhaps this could use NetworkInterfaces.getInetAddresses() and find the first that is not a loopback interface?, This is a known JVM bug:

So let's let Sun fix it, rather than fix it ourselves.  One can workaround it by altering one's linux configuration.]
