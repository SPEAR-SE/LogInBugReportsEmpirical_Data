[Make the test wait till all replicas check in with the namenode,., I'd like to have the wait time bounded by 1 minute or so, so that if the test is broken that it doesn't hang the unit tests., So long as the timeout applies just to this test I'd agree.

There are a couple of HBase tests that take about two minutes or a bit more, so applying a universal timeout would be unacceptable.

However, if we could specify test timeouts on a per test basis, that would be a ++1., In general, I do not like the idea of having timeouts for each test. Especially because the same test can take different times to complete on different hardware platforms and different operating systems. Currently, the junit testing framework enforces a timeout for each test. If the test takes exceptionally long, then the junit framework kills the test and declares it as "failed".
