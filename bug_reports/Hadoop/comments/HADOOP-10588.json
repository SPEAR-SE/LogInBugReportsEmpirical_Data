{noformat}, I am not going to submit the patch because it is not meant for trunk and trunk only has HttpServer2., LGTM. We also run into this issue sporadically., +1. Checking this into branch-2 and branch-0.23 (not trunk), Thanks for the reviews, Sangjin and Jon. I've committed this to branch-0.23 and branch-2., Two years after this was committed, The Jetty in Hadoop 3 is still not upgraded. I think that either we bump Jetty's version (unlikely) or we cherry pick this fix to trunk., It was almost done in HADOOP-10075 at one point.]
