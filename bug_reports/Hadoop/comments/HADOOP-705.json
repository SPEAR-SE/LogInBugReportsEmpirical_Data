[this patch fixes the problem. The problem arose on a half execution of localizejob. this might happen when the namenode is very busy. The job.xml is copied but the job.jar isnt. So the job is not fully localized. The new task on the machine tries to localize the job but fails with the error mentioned. This patch deletes any presexisting job.xml if the job has not been fully localized and tries localizing the job again., +1

This patch fixes the issue.  In addition, "ant clean compile test tar" is successfull when this patch is applied against revision 473426., Wouldn't it be better to remove the job's entire directory at the outset?  That would cover failures in both job.xml, job.jar and whatever else ends up there.

Also, this patch uses tabs to indent, rather than spaces, with non-standard tab stops.  And there's a typo in the comment., made the changes. The whole job dir is deleted before we retry again. fixed the typo. sorry abt the tabs... just cleaned up my eclipse settings., I just committed this.  Thanks, Mahadev!]
