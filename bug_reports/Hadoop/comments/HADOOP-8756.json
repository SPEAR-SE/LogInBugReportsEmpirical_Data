[* remove HADOOP_RUNAS_HOME (runAs has been removed)

* remove SnappyCodec.java.  Instead, load the native code from SnappyCompressor.java and SnappyDecompressor.java.  This is similar to the way the zlib stuff works now.

* If we try to instantiate SnappyCodec, but snappy is not loaded, throw an exception.  Formerly, we might get undefined behavior like segfaults in this case.

* Be more helpful about why snappy could not be loaded: was it because the build was compiled without snappy?  Or some other reason found in the exception thrown from {{SnappyDecompressor#initIDs}} or  {{SnappyCompressor#initIDs}}?

* We don't need to call {{System.loadLibrary("snappy")}}.  It's irrelevant because libsnappy is not a JNI library.  Again, zlib shows how this should be done: just use {{dlopen}}, not {{System.loadLibrary}}.  Note that calliing {{System.loadLibrary}} does *not* make the symbols visible to {{libhadoop.so}} because the JVM does not use {{RTLD_GLOBAL}}. , -1 overall.

Unneeded whitespace change.

Other than that, the patch looks right and is a nice conceptual cleanup as well as fixing the SEGV. +1., * fix whitespace, This seems to be related to the HADOOP-8781. Just to make sure -- is the patches posted to this JIRA meant to provide an alternative fix for the issue that won't require us changing the value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH ? If so, shouldn't your patches include the changes that would restore the old behavior?, bq. Just to make sure â€“ is the patches posted to this JIRA meant to provide an alternative fix for the issue that won't require us changing the value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

No, you will still need to set {{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}.  The patch could be revised to manually search {{java.library.path}}, I guess.  Would that be worthwhile?

bq. If so, shouldn't your patches include the changes that would restore the old behavior?

The behavior hasn't changed.  You always needed to have {{libsnappy.so}} in your {{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}} or system library path in order to load it with {{dlopen}}., bq. The patch could be revised to manually search java.library.path, I guess. Would that be worthwhile?

Well, my concern is around all the clients that don't use hadoop launcher script but need to access snappy codec *on the client* side. Flume would be a good example here: since it launches the JVM directly it has to also makes sure it sets up LD_LIBRARY_PATH if we don't provide the manual search capability in core hadoop itself.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we have to have a solution for things like Flume. It would be nice if it worked automagically., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

bq. It would be nice if it [searched java.library.path]

Let's file a separate JIRA for that.  It's not really related to this JIRA, which is just about fixing a segfault.  Smaller patches are easier for people to review, as well., Filed HADOOP-8806 to discuss searching {{java.library.path}}, +1

I've reviewed HADOOP-8756.004.patch and I have no further issues.  This is a good localized fix that is not dependent on nor obsoleted by the other patches under discussion or checked in. Without this patch a local "mvn -Pnative,dist clean package -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests; mvn test -Dtest=TestCodec" fails.

Failed tests:   testSnappyCodec(org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.TestCodec): Snappy native available but Hadoop native not
{code}, +1 looks good to me as well

For those who haven't been following along, we're segfaulting because the compressor/decompressor ignore failures in initIDS, we now detect this failure and check for it in SnappyCodec so we don't run with snappy when we failed to load it. We still require that libsnappy is present in LD_LIBRARY_PATH (HADOOP-8806 improves how it is located)., Forgot to mention, I verified hadoop fs catting a snappy file works with a build with snappy bundled in.  , I've committed this and merged to branch-2.
