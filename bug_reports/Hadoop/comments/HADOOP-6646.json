[svn delete the files using:

svn delete --force src/test/core/org/apache/hadoop/fs/TestHarFileSystem.java src/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/HarFileSystem.java

, +1 on moving HarFileSystem to mapred.

Do we have har doc in common?, looks like we forgot to move the chinese docs.

so we will have to do 

svn delete --force src/test/core/org/apache/hadoop/fs/TestHarFileSystem.java src/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/HarFileSystem.java cn/src/documentation/content/xdocs/hadoop_archives.xml
, I just committed this. 

I only moved the two source files and left the chinese documentation in Common since mapreduce doesnt have any chinese documentation as of now!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #210 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/210/])
    . Move HarfileSystem out of Hadoop Common. (mahadev)
