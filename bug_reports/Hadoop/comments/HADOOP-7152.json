[Giri, assigning to you.  I still don't have access to hadoop3 build machine since Y! Ops rejumped it.

I suspect it may need more than just 'patch' installed., Nigel, 

I installed all the required libraries on h3 and successfully run mr hdsf and commons builds.
Also documented the lib installation details : http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToSetupUbuntuBuildMachine

P.S: you should be able to access h3 now.]
