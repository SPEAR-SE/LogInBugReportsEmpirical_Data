[Same for me when running "ant test-patch" with the proposed patch in HADOOP-2366., c6122_20090630.patch: test-patch.sh has a bug: ">" should be "-gt"
{code}
-      if [[ $patchJavacWarnings > $trunkJavacWarnings ]] ; then
+      if [[ $patchJavacWarnings -gt $trunkJavacWarnings ]] ; then
{code}, +1

The patch looks good.  Good catch.
-Gary, We still have problems in test-patch.sh: For an empty patch, why it says 64 javac warnings but not 124?, > ... For an empty patch, why it says 64 javac warnings but not 124?

Look like that this is another problem in common but not in hdfs and mapreduce., Filed HADOOP-6124 for the inconsistency problem.

Tried test-patch.sh with the patch.  It worked fine., I have committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk #13 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk/13/])
    . The great than operator in test-patch.sh should be "-gt" but not ">".
