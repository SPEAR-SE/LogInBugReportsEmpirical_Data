[As suggested in the discussion in HADOOP-10475, I synchronized the methods on the {{subject}} instead of the UGI.  I also added a test that runs a thread that repeatedly calls {{getTokens()}} while the test calls {{addToken(...)}} to cause the CME; it fails without the fix and passes with them., The patch looks good to me. +1 pending Jenkins (which I've just kicked.), {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Please give me a chance to review., +1 I think it looks ok.  I almost wonder if some of the concurrent protection should occur in the Credentials itself, but it's probably not trivial due to the iterators., Thanks a lot for the additional review, Daryn.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks a lot for the contribution, Robert., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5606 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5606/])
