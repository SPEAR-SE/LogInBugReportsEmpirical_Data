with this patch, these error messages do not appear
, You've made a lot more changes than the jira description suggests. 

In general, I'd rather have threads interrupt other threads rather than set a volatile boolean flag, but I haven't looked at your patch in the real context, just standalone., Owen,

I agree with you, but not knowing the internals of the JobTracker that well, did not know if there was a reason that JobTracker$ExpireTrackers and JobTracker$TaskCommitQueue were different from the other threads and intentionally let the exception escape rather than shut down.

Most of the other threads also use a class-level boolean but that is probably not necessary. A boolean in the method (or just breaking out of the loop) would work just as well.

I'll work up a more minimal patch along these lines and you (or someone else who knows JobTracker) can decide which patch you like.
