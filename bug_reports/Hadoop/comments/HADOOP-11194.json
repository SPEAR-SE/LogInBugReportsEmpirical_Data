This message is automatically generated., the only worry I have here is that somewhere I have a {{test/resources}} file tagged as .keep. Is mvn going to be happy if it is not there, Didn't realize there might be files ending in .keep. Update patch to ignore files strictly matching .keep under any directory. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~stevel@apache.org] - does that latest patch look good to you? , +1

FWIW my concern was that once the .keep in the test resources went away, test/resources would go away, which would confuse mvn. If that happens, I can stick a different stub file in there, some .properties thing, Or, you could use "dummy.keep" file and exclude that from the RAT check? 

You okay with me committing this, I can review any after-effects relatively "soon"? , Checking this in... , Thanks for the review, Steve.
