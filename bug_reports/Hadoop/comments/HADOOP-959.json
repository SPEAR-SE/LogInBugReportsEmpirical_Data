[Here is a patch for review., The comments "//renameTo fails on windows" should be more descriptive, e.g. // renameTo fails on windows if the destination exists, Added additional documentation., Code reviewed by Milind., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12349969/renameToWindows2.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r501616., I just committed this.  Thanks, Dhruba!]
