[I found this bug during runs of {{TestFileSink}} on Windows.  The test concludes by trying to delete the output file.  On Windows, the delete fails, because the file is still held open and locked.

Here is a patch that fixes it.  {{MetricsSink}} is public, and there can be custom implementations in the wild.  I didn't want to introduce a backwards-incompatibility by defining a {{close}} method right on the {{MetricsSink}} interface.  Instead, this patch adds JavaDocs to {{MetricsSink}} stating that implementations also may optionally implement {{Closeable}}, and then {{MetricsSinkAdapter}} does an instanceof check and calls close.

I verified on Mac and Windows.
