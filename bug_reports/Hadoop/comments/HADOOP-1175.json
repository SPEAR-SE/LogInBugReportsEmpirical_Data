Thoughts on how we fix this?
, Fixed a bug in tasklog.jsp where old values of some variables were maintained across calls (class variables), all of them are local variables in the function now... and are initialized from the values in the request object., I propose we push this into 0.12.3 since it's a usability issue... please mark it for later if others disagree., +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12354765/HADOOP-1175_20070402_1.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/hadoop/trunk/524659. Results are at http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Patch, I just committed this.  Thanks, Arun!, Integrated in Hadoop-Nightly #46 (See http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Hadoop-Nightly/46/)]
