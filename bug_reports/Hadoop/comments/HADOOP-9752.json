[It works for me with Ubuntu 13.10:

jbonofre@vostro:~$ kill -1 -4175
jbonofre@vostro:~$ kill -1 -4341
bash: kill: (-4341) - No such process

So, I think that we can close this issue., [~jb@nanthrax.net] can you please try /bin/kill.  kill is usually a built-in shell command and the built in command for Ubuntu works for me too (zsh and bash).  Additionally can you check /bin/kill --version. Mine is 'kill from procps-ng 3.3.3'., Good catch Robert.

jbonofre@vostro:~$ /bin/kill -1 -34243
/bin/kill: invalid option -- '3'
...
jbonofre@vostro:~$ /bin/kill --version
kill from procps-ng 3.3.3

I checked with:
jbonofre@vostro:~$ which kill
/bin/kill

and the output confused me.

I gonna take a look on that to see if we can find a workaround that work with "all" kill commands.
, This appears to be a bug in procps-ng based on http://www.freelists.org/post/procps/PATCH-33-kill-fix-PID-handling, and has been fixed in procps-ng-3.3.4 according to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/coreutils/+bug/1077796.  I will download that version and test., Downloaded 3.3.8 and tested the kill, seems to work

This message is automatically generated., The patch works for me on Ubuntu 13.04.  I successfully issued a kill request that actually kills the application.  This is a very trivial change, so it would be nice if we could get it in the next release if it's verified to work on other linux versions., Would be nice if we could fix the kill command in other places too.

, By the way, the version I tried that worked was the 2.1.0-beta release version., Any chance this can make it into 2.2.x?, I have run the 5 tests that failed on a Fedora VM and the tests all pass, but it does bother me that TestNodeManagerShutdown failed on the patch build., firing the jenkins build again, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

They are using Hadoop 2.4.1 with Debian GNU/Linux 7.8 (wheezy).

The log output looks like this
{code}
2015-03-05 16:51:39,570 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.launcher.ContainerLaunch: Sent signal SIGTERM to pid 27031 as user robert for container container_1425573565216_0002_02_000002, result=failed

The fix seems quite straightforward, the effects of such an issue are pretty annoying (resource leakage).]
