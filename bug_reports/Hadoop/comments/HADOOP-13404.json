[I think there are 2 solution

1) add ping response in RPC server, and check the response in client side. Need client side and server side modification, which may have some compatibility issue.
2) add thread to scan the  calls inside the connection, send timeout exception to the response if the call do not get response for a long time. This is only client side solution., There is definitely a timeout mechanism in the client. Depending on your release, ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms=timeout; or ipc.client.ping=false, ipc.ping.interval=timeout.  If you set ipc.client.ping=true, it will just verify that the connection is up, not that the other end is responsive.

After a failover, the client will get standby exceptions as the handlers drain the callq.  The standby to active transition should not have occurred until the former went into standby (which sends the standby exceptions).  The transition must have been forced and effectively created an active/active condition.  In this invalid state, yes, clients with no timeout will hang forever while the NN is hung - "Works as designed".  If the hung active was stopped, clients would failover.  

Please test the timeouts and close as invalid unless there's a bug in the timeouts or standby transition.

bq. Need client side and server side modification, which may have some compatibility issue.
Although not needed here, -100 for an incompatible change., Thanks for the explanation, issue is solved,
close the issue.]
