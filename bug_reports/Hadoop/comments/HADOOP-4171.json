[TestFileCreation not only fails on Windows, it fails once a while in Hudson and other OS.  See HADOOP-3883., TestProcfsBasedProcessTree also fails on my Windows machine., Jira says this incorporates HADOOP-4173. Should it be other way round?, HADOOP-4173 is just one part of this jira. Changing the relationship., We have separate issues taking care the append related tests, including TestFileCreation, TestFileAppend2, TestLeaseRecovery, TestLeaseRecovery2, TestDatanodeDeath.  See HADOOP-2658.

If other tests do not fail on Windows anymore, we should close this issue.  If problem still exists, we should fix this in 0.19.  I will check this., These test failures are covered by other Jiras.]
