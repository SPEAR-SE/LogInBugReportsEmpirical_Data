[Array out of bounds is because of the following line in FileInputFormat.java (Line 334)

BlockLocation last = blkLocations[blkLocations.length];

which should be

BlockLocation last = blkLocations[blkLocations.length -1];

However, even after this fix, we would still get an IllegalArgumentException. 

In getBlockIndex, the offset of blkLocations[0] != 0. Hence, offset of 0 is treated as an IllegalArgument., this is the patch that fixes the issue., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
