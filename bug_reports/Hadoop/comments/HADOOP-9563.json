, Suresh, talked with IBM hadoop dev team internally, we will push the patchset later after internal testing with other hadoop components successfully at first. So could you please revert the patch of HADOOP-9523 & HADOOP-9563? Thanks., bq. Suresh, talked with IBM hadoop dev team internally,
Both HADOOP-9523 and HADOOP-9563 look like reasonable changes to make. I am not sure I understand this and why the patch should be reverted in Apache?

bq. we will push the patchset later after internal testing with other hadoop components successfully at first
Please do create new jiras if you uncover more issues., Suresh, IBM internal team decide to have a whole testing of this patch. I am asked to undo this patch. So Suresh, please revert patch of HADOOP-9523 and HADOOP-9563 for me now. We will resubmit it later after whole testing. Thanks., This is a strange request.

As I said earlier, these are trivial changes to add a constant to be reused. I do not understand how this could affect any testing. "IBM internal team decide to have a whole testing of this patch. I am asked to undo this patch." is not a good enough reason for me to revert this patch. Please explain the technical reasons why this causes problems and hence should be reverted.


bq. We will resubmit it later after whole testing. 
Please make updated patches available in a separate jira when your testing completes. Feel free to change the code introduced in these two jiras in the new jiras, if they are issues.
, Thanks Suresh for your suggestion.]
