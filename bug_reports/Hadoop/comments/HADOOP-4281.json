[Shouldn't this be a blocker for 0.19.0?, The change introduces new definition of an item in the report and an additional item that did not exist. This certainly makes Web UI and commands incompatible. Since the report information is not used for building any critical functionality, it should not introduce any major issues.

Hairong, can you please comment?, I would prefer to make this change to be part of release 19. It's nicer to make the user-facing interfaces to be consistent in one release., All the unit tests passed. Here is the result of ant test-patch. The automated tests for this change was submitted as a part of 2816.

     [exec] -1 overall.  

     [exec]     +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

     [exec]     -1 tests included.  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
     [exec]                         Please justify why no tests are needed for this patch.

     [exec]     +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

     [exec]     +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

     [exec]     +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs warnings.

     [exec]     +1 Eclipse classpath. The patch retains Eclipse classpath integrity.

, Changed the priority to blocker. Without this change the capacity reports from the Web UI and the hadoop dfsadmin -report command is incompatible., Should this be a blocker of 0.19?, The patch looks good. I have two minor comments:
1. In DFSAdmin.java, it would be nice to switch the following two statements
+ long presentCapacity = ds.getDfsUsed() + ds.getRemaining();
+ long used = ds.getDfsUsed();
to be
      long used = ds.getDfsUsed();
      long presentCapacity = used + ds.getRemaining();
 2. In DatanodeInfo.toString, it would be nice to use dfs.getDfsUsedPercent() to calculate the %Used.

I think Suresh meant to mark this issue as a block to 0.19. I will mark it for him.

This message is automatically generated., HDFS test TestLeaseRecovery2 is failing. It is unrelated to this change (it is failing for other patches too), I just committed this. Thanks, Suresh, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #620 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/620/])
