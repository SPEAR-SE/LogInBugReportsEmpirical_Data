This message is automatically generated., Hi [~dian.fu],

In general this looks good, but I think it would be good to add a unit test for this.

, Hi [~clamb], thanks a lot for review and comments. Have added unit test and uploaded a new patch.

This message is automatically generated., That's a nice simple test solution. The only nit I offer is that you could use a final for the conf and kmsACLs, but that's my own hang-up. +1 (non-binding).

, Thanks [~clamb] for review. Could you help to commit this patch if you think it's OK?, I wish I could, but I'm not a real committer. I only play one on TV. (That's why my +1 was non-binding). [~hitliuyi], would you be able to help out here?

, Sure, sorry that I didn't pay attention to this JIRA.

The patch overall looks very good. One comment:
* Our purpose is to match the configuration properties prefixed with {{key.acl.}}, so the best way is to define a correct regex, not through a follow {{String#startsWith}}. My suggestion is we define a correct regex in KMSConfiguration as following:
{code}
  public static final String KEY_ACL_PREFIX = "key.acl.";
+public static final String KEY_ACL_PREFIX_REGEX = "^key\\.acl\\..+";
{code}
And use it KMSACLs:
{code}
Map<String, String> allKeyACLS =
        conf.getValByRegex(KMSConfiguration.KEY_ACL_PREFIX_REGEX);
{code}

+1 after addressing., Thanks [~hitliuyi]] for review and comments. Have updated the patch according to your comments., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Dian, it's better we don't add the suffix check ({{KeyOpType}}) to regex:
{code}
+  StringUtils.join("|", Arrays.asList(KeyOpType.values())) + ")$"
{code}

Since we also have this check in the code:
{code}
        String keyOp = k.substring(keyNameEnds + 1);
        KeyOpType aclType = null;
        try {
          aclType = KeyOpType.valueOf(keyOp);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
          LOG.warn("Invalid key Operation '{}'", keyOp);
        }
{code}
And if some {{KeyOpType}} is typo in the configuration file, there is warning log. I think the {{KeyOpType}} is easy for typo, right?  But the prefix ({{key.acl.}}) is simple., Thanks [~hitliuyi] for the comments. Agree with you that we should remove the suffix check, otherwise user will no longer receive the warning log if the a wrong operation is configured. Have updated the patch according to your comments. Thanks very much., Thanks Dian for update. One small nit, +1 after that and pending Jenkins:
{quote}
+import org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.kms.server.KeyAuthorizationKeyProvider.KeyOpType;
 import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;
+import org.apache.hadoop.util.StringUtils;
  
 import java.io.File;
 import java.net.MalformedURLException;
 import java.net.URL;
+import java.util.Arrays;
{quote}
These imports are unnecessary, and can cause Jenkins javac warning., Updated the patch to remove unnecessary imports., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
