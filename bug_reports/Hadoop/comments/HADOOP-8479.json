[Is this an error in the docs or error in the behavior?, I'm happy to be convinced otherwise, but presently I'm of the opinion that this seems like an error in the docs. Setting a quota is an administrative command, so if an administrator notices a user directory that's using too much space, they might want to set a quota on it which would then force the user to later clean up that dir as they see fit. I don't think the administrator should be required to clean up the dir before being able to set the quota.]
