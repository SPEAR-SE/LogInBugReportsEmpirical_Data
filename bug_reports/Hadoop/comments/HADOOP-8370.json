This message is automatically generated., +1 looks good to me. Seems like hadoop-annotations should be compile scope since it's not provided by the jdk., Rationale btw is that "provided This is much like compile, but indicates you expect the JDK or a container to provide the dependency at runtime" [1] and since we do not "expect the JDK or a container to provide the dependency at runtime" it should not be provided
because provided scope is not transitive it means eg the native build doesnt get the classes from hadoop-annotations.

1. http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html

Perhaps though the native build should instead add an explicit dependency on hadoop-annotations?, Tucu mentioned offline that the main motivation for making this provided is making sure we don't end up with jdiff in the hadoop classpath, need to check that., I'm not sure where to check for that. Does the classpath just contain all of the jars in the appropriate directory under share/hadoop?

With this patch, jdiff-*.jar shows up in the same place as the official CDH4 build, only under share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib:

$ find hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-2.0.0-cdh4.0.0 -name '*jdiff*.jar'
hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-2.0.0-cdh4.0.0/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/jdiff-1.0.9.jar
, Is there anything I can do to help resolve this issue?

Also, any idea why it works for everyone else with scope 'provided'? Am I using a newer Maven version?, I have the same problem, but only with JDK7. I see you're using JDK7 as well, maybe that's the culprit?, It is, this only comes up with jdk7.

Tucu, since Trevor confirmed that we don't end up with jdiff in the lib dir due to this change do you still object?, Btw I filed MAPREDUCE-4413 for the MR jdiff issue., Can we commit this?, +1 on commit (not that my votes counts, but anyway), +1, Thanks Trevor!
