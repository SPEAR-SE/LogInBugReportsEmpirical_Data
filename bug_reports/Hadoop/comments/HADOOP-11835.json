[This patch is for branch-2, branch-2.7.0 and branch-2.7
Trunk already has solution for this issue in JIRA HADOOP-11041
Solution is same 

System.out.println("Subversion " + getUrl() + " -r " + getRevision());

is changed to:

System.out.println("Source code repository: " + getUrl() + " -r " + getRevision());, Thanks [~kiranmr] for pointing HADOOP-11041. Looking into the issue, it's not safe to change the output format of the hadoop command. Therefore I'd like to close this issue as invalid. Sorry for confusion.]
