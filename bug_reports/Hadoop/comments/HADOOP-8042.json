[It is due to the change in the default behavior. FsShell for some reason now creates CRC files (.<filename>.crc) in the local file system by default. Unaware of existence of the .filename.crc, users can modify files stored in the local file system and make the CRC invalid. The default behavior needs to be reverted back to ingnoreCrc., Actually ignoreCRC is for disabling checksum verification. CRC copying needs to be disabled by default when -crc is not specified.
, Seems like the temp file use for the target is created using the CheckSumFileSystem(via RawLocalFileSystem) which unconditionally creates a crc file at the destination.

CommandWithDestination.java (copyStreamToTarget)
FSDataOutputStream out = target.fs.getLocal().create(tempFile.path, true);

Not sure if this is a systemic problem of the RawLocalFileSystem or not., Currently an instance of ChecksumFileSystem is used all the time for the target in local fs. It needs to be conditional.  I hear Daryn has a patch that is almost done, so I am awarding this jira to him., I will be out of the office until Feb 2nd.
