[bq.  As hadoop fs is deprecated, the help should show usage with HDFS

I thought "hdfs dfs" is being deprecated, not "hadoop fs"?  Both call FsShell which is in hadoop-common because it works with any filesystem implementation.  Requiring users to invoke "hdfs dfs" doesn't make sense for non-hdfs filesystems., Hi, I checked hadoop and hdfs commands. We have three ways to call FsShell, "hadoop fs" "hadoop dfs" and "hdfs dfs". Only "hadoop dfs" is deprecated.
So, I think we should print "hadoop fs" and "hdfs dfs" like this patch. Thanks., IMHO, "hdfs dfs" should be deprecated too unless it explicitly & artificially restricts access to only hdfs filesystems.  That's not reasonably going to happen, so I think it's fine for the usage to display the proper "hadoop fs" since "hdfs dfs" is essentially a compatibility wrapper., +1 for just "hadoop fs". There's a lot of confusion that its been
deprecated, but it is not.
