[My security hackles get raised by introducing a bunch of pseudo-security, like this, but I can see the point.

We should probably make a configuration option that completely disables the http browsing and hftp servlets in hdfs.

The hftp servlet should use the same user as the http browser, since they are roughly the same functionality in different formats., > My security hackles get raised by introducing a bunch of pseudo-security, like this, but I can see the point.

This one is just a short-term fix.  We have to introduce web login for long-term solution.

This is a good idea.  I will think about how to do it., It might be good if the browser can show the 'permission denied" message when a user tries to browse a directory or read the content of a file when the user does not the permission to do so., This one have better error messages., +1 The code looks good., +1 overall.
