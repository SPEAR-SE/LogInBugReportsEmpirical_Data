[Dupilcate of HADOOP-632. , We would like ot minotor dead nodes using a command line script that periodicaly invokes dfsadmin -report. In this case, we would like to somehow detect if a datanode is dead. We would like dead nodes to be displayed in the webUI (it already does this now).

I propose that we modify the output of dfsadmin -report to report the following:

Configured State: In Service/Decommissioned/Decommissioning/Out Of Service
Runtime State     : Dead/Alive

, This is already fixed in HADOOP-1627. Now decommission state is shown as " Decommission State : Normal" instead of "State : In Service"
, I think HADOOP-1627 replaced one confusing message "State : In Service" with another "Decommission State : Normal".
Doesn't it sound confusing for a dead node to have "Decommission State : Normal"?
This field should not be a decommission state but rather a state of the node, which includes states like
- In service
- Out of Service (dead)
- Decommission in progress.
- Decommissioned.

Should we reopen this issue or create a new one?

, I agree with Konstantin. I think there are two different states: one is the configured state of the datanode. This can be In-Service/Out-of-Service. This does not change even if the entire cluster is restarted.

Then there is a "Run State" for each datanode. This reflects the current state of the datanode. It can be dead/alive.
