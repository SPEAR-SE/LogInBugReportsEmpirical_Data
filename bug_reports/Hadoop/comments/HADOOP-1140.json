A simple fix in org.apache.hadoop.metrics.spi.AbstractMetricsContext.  The context object was holding its own lock when calling back into application code.  The fix is for it not to do that.

Note: I've also done some minor cleanups in this file - simply putting back the uses of Java 1.5 generic types  that I was required to take out when I originally checked the code in because of the need at that time to support Java 1.4.

I think this  fix should go in 12.2, since it is a serious bug with a pretty small, safe fix.  The bug showed up when using the Simon metrics implementation package, but I believe it could occur also with any other metrics implementation package, including the null one.

, I just committed this.  Thanks, David!]
