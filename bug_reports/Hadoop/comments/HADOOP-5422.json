[What seem to happen here is that 
{noformat}
hadoop dfs -lsr /*/*
{noformat}

Regular expression is expanded by the shell. 
So, you are seeing /bin and such as output.
Please try using '\' or quote the regular expression., Is this a regression?  I suspect not and that Lohit's suggestion needs to be followed.  Iyappan, please confirm., I tested this.  Globbing for /\*/\* works fine in HDFS.  Special characters like * need to be escaped as mentioned by Lohit., Iyappan, please confirm this is in the documentation.  If not, modify this Jira to reflect the need for documentation., Hi Nigel,All,

It works when escape charecters are given in front of star or the whole expression under double quotes.

bin/hadoop --config /tmp/cluster/ fs -ls /\*/\*
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.

The documentatation does not mention this anywhere in hadoop FS shell guide(FS_Shell.html). It will be nice if it is mentioned somewhere, say in examples.
I will change this to a  documentation jira.]
