[Good catch, [~ted_yu]. 
The close calls should actually be done inside of a finally block.
This will likely also be an issue in the credential provider as well., Fixed to use org.apache.hadoop.io.IOUtils.closeStream(is) in finally blocks., What about the following code inside loadFromPath() ?
{code}
    FileStatus s = fs.getFileStatus(p);
    keyStore.load(fs.open(p), password);
{code}, As [~lmccay] mentioned, org.apache.hadoop.security.alias.JavaKeyStoreProvider also has the same issue. Revised a patch to fix it., Good catch, [~ted_yu]. I'll update it soon., Updated to close streams in keyStore.load(fs.open(p), password)., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~ozawa], thank you for the patch. Would you mind import "org.apache.hadoop.io.IOUtils" in the beginning of this file and replace "org.apache.hadoop.io.IOUtils.closeStream(out)" with "IOUtils.closeStream(out)". , Hi [~airbots], thanks for your review. it's fully qualified because both of JavaKeyStoreProvider import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils., [~vinayrpet], could you take a look?, Attaching a new patch to use try-with-resources statement instead of closeStream., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
