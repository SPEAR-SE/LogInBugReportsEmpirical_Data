[After discussion with Sameer and Devaraj, marking this a blocker for Hadoop 0.20., Attaching a patch. Testing in progress., The earlier patch I submitted can be ignored. HADOOP-5247 addresses the problem better by broadcasting a KillJobAction to all trackers upon job termination. The attached patch is a testcase that currently fails but passes with the patch for HADOOP-5247., I just committed the testcase., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #766 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/766/])
    . A testcase that checks for the existence of job directory after the job completes. Fails if it exists. Contributed by Devaraj Das.
