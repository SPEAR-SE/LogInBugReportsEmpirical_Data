[This was one of the problems I ran into with RAT (incorrect targeting of file types for inclusion). There are other problems with RAT too. Check out DRAT: https://github.com/chrismattmann/drat/. I don't have a Maven plugin for it yet, but it's super simple to use:

# download source code you want to check into <local dir>
# download and install DRAT per Wiki instructions on Github
# ./bin/drat go <local dir>

Get results., This is a duplicate of YARN-3113.]
