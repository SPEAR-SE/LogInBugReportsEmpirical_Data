[Thanks Allen for reporting this. I would help with it and would you help give me some hints or steps do do so? Or is there any example in the code base I can learn about? Thanks!, The Dockerfile is in dev-support/docker/Dockerfile .  Just need to add whatever magic is necessary to get it installed., Thanks Allen for the guide. Let me do it., I've got my docker environment up and am working on it., As the official RPM package is still on the going and isn't available yet, I'm going to create one and host it somewhere first for the downloading and installation for this docker building support. When the official one is ready, it will be easily swapped out. This may be a better option than complicating the *Dockerfile* with kinds of things that build the ISA-L from the source codes considering there're some tools to be equipped first. , bq. As the official RPM package is still on the going and isn't available yet, I'm going to create one and host it somewhere first for the downloading and installation for this docker building support. When the official one is ready, it will be easily swapped out. This may be a better option than complicating the Dockerfile with kinds of things that build the ISA-L from the source codes considering there're some tools to be equipped first. 

Definitely not.  It's simply not sustainable to host random binaries some where and expect the system to support it. If this is blocked on Intel actually making these libraries usable, then it's blocked.  It also makes me REALLY question why this support was committed to Hadoop since it's clearly not ready for production if the binaries aren't out there.

It's probably also worth pointing out that our Docker image is using Ubuntu, so RPMs won't work anyway.  We need something that can be installed with apt., Hi Allen,

Sorry for my misunderstanding. May I clarify? Thanks.
Intel delivers ISA-L library in 01.org site and provides source package downloading, which I thought is a good practice, considering the customers expect to build from the source codes and install it themselves. It's mature and already widely used (Ceph is an example for open source). The docker building support would desire a binary package as I said above, it's fine and I have already made the request to the ISA-L team. It will be solved anyway, and I just thought before I can get the formal binary package to try the docker building, I'd like to try my work using a temporary resource. 

By the way, I almost got it work. The temporary package is provided here:
https://github.com/drankye/isal/tree/master/packages

And my fix is as follows:
{code}
diff --git a/dev-support/docker/Dockerfile b/dev-support/docker/Dockerfile
index e80df29..121c43d 100644
--- a/dev-support/docker/Dockerfile
+++ b/dev-support/docker/Dockerfile
+
+######
+# Install ISA-L library
+# It uses a temporary resource package, and it will soon be changed to use a formal one.
+######
+RUN curl -L https://github.com/drankye/isal/raw/master/packages/isa-l-2.14.0_amd64.deb \
+         -o /opt/isa-l-2.14.0_amd64.deb && \
+    dpkg -i /opt/isa-l-2.14.0_amd64.deb
+
 # Add a welcome message and environment checks.
 ADD hadoop_env_checks.sh /root/hadoop_env_checks.sh
 RUN chmod 755 /root/hadoop_env_checks.sh
{code}

Please comment, thanks., Please ref. ISA-L library here, https://01.org/intel%C2%AE-storage-acceleration-library-open-source-version. 

Intel ISA-L team is working on to provide binary packages, before that, please let me know if we need the fix like above as I suggested? Thanks.

, Uploaded the initial patch as discussed above., Update: ISA-L has been accepted into Debian unstable https://packages.debian.org/sid/libisal2 and you can pull debs from standard locations https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/libisal2/download, Updated the patch to use the formal ISA-L package., (!) A patch to the testing environment has been detected.

, The download needs to happen before the 'YETUS CUT HERE' line if you want to enable ISA-L testing during precommit..., Updated the patch according to [~aw]'s review comments. Thanks Allen for the review!, (!) A patch to the testing environment has been detected.

, Hi [~aw] or [~cmccabe], would you help review and commit this? I did a local test as well, with the docker environment set up with this change, I built successfully with ISA-L enabled. With this, I thought we can make a simple change in YETUS-222 to  trigger the building with ISA-L. Thanks., +1., Committed to 3.0, thanks!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #9475 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/9475/])
HADOOP-12626. Intel ISA-L libraries should be added to the Dockerfile (cmccabe: rev fbe3e86970cda0390eaf3c4820539a6dcb957926)
* dev-support/docker/Dockerfile
, Thanks [~cmccabe] for committing this!]
