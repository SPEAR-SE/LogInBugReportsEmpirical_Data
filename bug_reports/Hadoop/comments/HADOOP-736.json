[The files/directories which should be removed from the current version of trunk/lib are:
1) jetty-6.0.1.jar
2) servlet-api-2.5-6.0.1.jar
3) jsp-2.0
4) jetty-util-6.0.1.jar
5) slf4j-jcl.jar
6) slf4j-jcl.LICENSE.txt

The attached tarball contains the trunk/lib files/directories that need to be there for Jetty5.1.4., jetty5.1.4.patch is for updating the files StatusHttpServer.java and bin/hadoop., Is this different than doing 'svn merge -r 472202:472201 .'?  That's certainly a lot simpler, and the only conflict is CHANGES.txt..., If 'svn merge' is easier, I don't have any problems. Do I need to do anything on my part for this?, Actually, the Jetty developers found a probable fix: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-177#action_80644

Can we try the fix before rolling back?, Tried the bugfixed release but sort benchmark fails with it (I ran the benchmark twice and both the times it failed). A whole lot of reduces fail and finally the job is terminated. I have not analysed why but I think it is not safe to proceed with this version of Jetty (though they fixed one major bug yesterday but there might be more lurking around). My recommendation is to roll back., I agree. 6.0 is clearly not ready for us., Can someone verify whether 'svn merge -r 472202:472201 .' is sufficient?  If so, it's considerably simpler., I tried:

% svn merge -r 472202:472201 .
% svn merge -r 472349:472348 .

and the cluster works and runs jobs., I just committed this.  Thanks!]
