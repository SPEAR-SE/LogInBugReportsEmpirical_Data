[5226_20090212.patch: added license headers., At lines 731 and 274 it looks like diff might have got a bit confused and lost an extra line, which would end up without the spacing in the license.  Otherwise +1, > At lines 731 and 274 it looks like diff might have got a bit confused and lost an extra line ..

There was a empty line in the source.  So diff is correct to keep the original empty line and add the license from above and below.

Thanks, Jakob., This is an obvious documentation changes.  I committed this without submitting to Hudson., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #756 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/756/])
