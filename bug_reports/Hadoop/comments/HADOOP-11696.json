[Ran some stats today:
|| Version || Incompatible Changes ||
| 2.3.0 | 1 |
| 2.4.0 | 7 |
| 2.5.0 | 4 |
| 2.6.0 | 4 |
| 2.7.0 | 9 |
| 2.8.0 | 9 (not released) |
| 3.0.0 | 36 (not released) |

, are the above flagged changes incompatible in ways that the compat document says won't happen in minor releases?, Yes. (except for the 3.x ones of course)]
