[I'm attaching a patch.  This was discovered while testing HDFS ACLs with {{dfs.client.retry.policy.enabled}} set to {{true}}.  Running the ls command would print a stack trace if the NameNode does not have ACLs enabled, or if the NameNode is pre-2.4 and therefore does not have the ACL RPC endpoints defined.  The same log message is logged at both debug and info level.  Retries are supposed to be transparent to the client, so it's appropriate for this logging to be at debug level, and we can remove the redundant info level log., +1 patch looks good., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., I committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4.  Nicholas, thank you for the code review.

bq. -1 tests included. The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.

This was a change in logging only.  I tested manually by confirming that the redundant log message goes away when running ls, and I also confirmed that it can be turned back on by changing log level to debug., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5394 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5394/])
