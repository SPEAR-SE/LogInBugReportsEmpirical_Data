[I don't think the breaking change in the Azure Storage SDK impacts Hadoop, at least not yet.  Hadoop 2.7.1 ships with azure-storage-2.0.0.jar.  On trunk and branch-2, we have upgraded to 2.2.0.  There is no Hadoop version that has made the move to Azure Storage SDK version 4.x.  I just tested with Hadoop 2.7.1, and it worked fine after adding both hadoop-azure-2.7.2.jar and azure-storage-2.0.0.jar to my classpath.

This will become a problem whenever we do upgrade to version 4.x.  When that happens though, it will manifest as a compilation error, and we'll have to react by changing our code.

[~maikgroenewegen], is there anything I misunderstood about this bug report?, No you, are correct. Thanks for the update., Thank you, Maik.  I'll close this issue.]
