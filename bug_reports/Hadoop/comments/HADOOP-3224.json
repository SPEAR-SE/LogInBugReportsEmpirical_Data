This message is automatically generated., +1 .. i am curious to know how we broke this ... 
it seems we were just doing 
items[i].getLen());
?

did filestatus.getLen() return recursive lengths before?
, no, it was getContentLength() which used to work for files and directory. This was replaced by getLen() using within getContentLenght() wich works only for files. So, replaced it with the correct getContentSummary()., I just committed this. Thanks Lohit!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #457 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/457/])]
