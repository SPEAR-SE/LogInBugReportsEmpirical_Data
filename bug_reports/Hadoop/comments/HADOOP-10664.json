, HADOOP-8372 introduced a dependency on 3w.org to resolve via DNS. Apparently the host no longer resolves today., Hi [~rusanu], thank you for the comment, would you like to work on this JIRA?, The fix is a bit more complicated. For one, every branch affected must be fixed. But more important is to find a fix that does not suffer from the same issue (ie. not simply pick another host that could fail tomorrow). I for one would vote for the Apache foundation to register a DNS, eg. 1test.apache.org or similar, and then use that DNS name in the unit test. But such a solution is beyond my bandwith, and beyond my leverage with the foundation. So I would rather leave this for someone more experienced to pick up. I'm sure it will be a pretty hot issue soon if the 3w.org stays down, all patches uploaded will start fail..., FYI, 3w.org was updated recently:
{code}
>whois 3w.org
...
Updated Date: 2014-06-04T14:23:31Z
{code}
, Could we just use apache.org for our test host? I doubt it's going anywhere :), The DNS for 3w.org is back today: 213.175.197.40.

[~andrew.wang] it has to be a name that starts with a number, that's what the test is validating (regression test for HADOOP-8372). Of course Apache could register such a subdomain and then we could use that., Here's a patch which switches the hostname to one that should be more reliably up. It's a Google Apps URL for a site that I run, that's not going away for the foreseeable future., +1 thanks ATM, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
