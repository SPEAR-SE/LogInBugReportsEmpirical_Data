[I've upgraded this to Major in the hope that someone will pay attention.  This bug still affects 0.20.205.0, four months after the bug was filed.  It causes total failure when running in non-distributed mode. The fix is trivial for whoever manages the POM -- just add the missing dependency!  It's a bad sign that a bug like this has persisted this long.
, updated the core pom template to include the jackson dependency., Two comments:
First, to request/propose that a bug be fixed in a given release, please add that release to the "Target Version" field in the bug report.
Second, if the fix is trivial, please construct a patch for the fix, test it, and upload it to the Jira, rather than complaining that no one (else) has fixed it in four months., Giri, two typos:
+      <artifactId>jackson-mapper-asl</groupId>
should be 
+      <artifactId>jackson-mapper-asl</artifactId>

and the closing 
+    <dependency>
should be
+    </dependency>
, mybad , fixed the typos.

tested the patch by doing mvn-install and verified if the pom includes the jackson dependency.

steps:
ant -Dcompile.native=true -Dcompile.c++=true  mvn-install
check the mvn cache 
~/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-core/1.0.1-SNAPSHOT/hadoop-core-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.pom, +1.  Please commit to branch-1.0 and branch-1.  Thanks., committed to both 1 and 1.0 branches, thanks Matt, Closed upon release of version 1.0.0., This was indeed fixed in 1.0.0, so no need to note it as fixed in 1.1.0.]
