, I merged this back to branch-2.3 post swizzle as well., Thanks Andrew.
, Hi [~yzhangal], why copying ComparableVersion but not importing it?, HI [~szetszwo], That's a very good question.  I actually did try importing it in my earlier attempt, it turned out to be not clean, basically
we need to import the whole package org.apache.maven.artifact.versioning  though we just need this  single file. Plus it would create 
hadoop dependency on maven (they have different version too). At that point, it was decided that to make a copy of this file is a cleaner
and easier solution. I'm open for suggestions. Thanks.
