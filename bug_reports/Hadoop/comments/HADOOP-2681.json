[Nigel recommended to add a stack trace., Oh, i have a this issue in my internal projects.
Is this fixed (or known) ?
, >> Nigel recommended to add a stack trace.

or, won't fixed?, these look similar, Same problem (assumption of hadoop.log.dir being defined), different place, This problem still exists in 0.21 code,  not at line 401

    // Setup the log4j prop
    vargs.add("-Dhadoop.log.dir=" + 
        new File(System.getProperty("hadoop.log.dir")
        ).getAbsolutePath());

The value of hadoop.log.dir should be driven by the configuration, not a system property. That system property could be an default, but it should be sufficient for a value in the configuration to be defined., We should double-check *all* of the references to hadoop.log.dir.

HADOOP-9902 gives some guarantees that this properly set, but the Java code should be more forgiving., Closing this as a duplicate of HADOOP-3438.]
