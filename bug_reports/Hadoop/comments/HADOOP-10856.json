[IMO, HAR simply has to supports xAttrs.

If you are doing a HAR under .raw the same magic as for distcp will kick.

If you are doing a HAR outside of raw, everything is unencrypted in the HAR.

If your HAR file is within an encryption zone, the HAR file itself is encrypted., I agree with Tucu's assessment above, we don't need to do finer-grained encryption inside a HAR. It's a file, we can treat it like a file.
