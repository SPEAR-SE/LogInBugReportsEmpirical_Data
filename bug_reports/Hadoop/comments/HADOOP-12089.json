This message was automatically generated., [~cnauroth] Could you take a look? My change is to acquire lease before updating the parent folder rather than passing null to Azure Storage SDK.

I did not see any introduced findbugs warnings., Hi [~onpduo].  The patch looks good to me.  I ran all tests locally in both mocked mode and connected to the service.

I can't tell what happened with Findbugs, so I'd like to try another Jenkins run.  I'm talking with Apache infrastructure about a possible problem on the Jenkins hosts now.  After that's resolved, I'll submit another Jenkins run manually., \\

This message was automatically generated., I'm not sure why the Jenkins Findbugs report is empty, but I ran Findbugs locally and confirmed that there is in fact a warning.  After applying the patch, there is a dead store to {{parentKey}} on line 1564 of {{NativeAzureFileSystem}}.  We never read from {{parentKey}} again, so this is a legitimate dead store warning.

Duo, would you please provide another revision of the patch that removes line 1564?  I'll be +1 after that.  Thanks!, [~cnauroth] Sorry for delay. I have attached a new patch., \\
