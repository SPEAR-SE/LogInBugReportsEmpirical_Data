[Even on Linux, this test is taking longer than before. I remember it used to take less than 10 seconds on my dev box. Now it is taking on the order of one minute. On nightly windows build it took 4 minutes.

Konstantin, 

what is the output of jps when this is hung? If you can get stack trace of relevant java process when it is stuck (with jconsole), that would be very useful.
, Main reason for long test times is the fact that this test creates 40 files each with an average of 4-5 blocks. One fix could be to improve DFSTestUtil to create files from multiple threads. This introduces a little uncertainness in the tests but thats probably worth it. Other fix is to increase the block size for second part of TestCrcCorruption.
 , 
Regd actual test failure, it did not happen windows build machine (with -Dtest.output=no). On the machine where we saw this, two cygwin-du processes were taking 100% cpu. Du is run when a datanode starts.

, Closing this as stale.]
