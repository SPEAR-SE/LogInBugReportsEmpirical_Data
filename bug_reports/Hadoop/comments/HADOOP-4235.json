[The attached patch enhances hod help messages to include the accouting script information as an optional argument. This treats the accounting string as a special case, which is a short term solution. Longer term, we should have a way of printing optional arguments relevant to a command without making special cases.

The patch also changes how output from the verify-account script is returned. Specifically, it makes two changes:
- It prints the information and logs at a debug level. By printing, we make sure the output from the script is not prepended with an logger related strings like "CRITICAL" etc. The logging at debug level still ensures we print it to the log file also.
- It trims a trailing newline from the output.

hod help messages look like this now:

{code}
$ hod help allocate
Usage       : hod allocate -d <clusterdir> -n <nodecount> [-A account] [OPTIONS]
Description : Allocates a cluster of n nodes using the specified
              cluster directory to store cluster state
              information. The Hadoop site XML is also stored
              in this location.
              Depending on site policies, this operation may require
              a valid account string to be specified.
For all options : hod help options.
{code}

{code}
$ hod allocate
Usage       : hod allocate -d <clusterdir> -n <nodecount> [-A account] [OPTIONS]
For full description: hod help allocate.
{code}

, Printing and logging it too is showing duplicate information while running at debug level. Instead, we can just construct a string out of the messages array and append it to the critical log message., Incorporated Vinod's review comments., Verify minor edit to the previous patch, to print the help options for the account the same as the other options (for node count etc)., +1, For information, the help message looks like this:

{code}
$ hod allocate
Usage       : hod allocate -d <clusterdir> -n <nodecount> [-A <account>] [OPTIONS]
For full description: hod help allocate.
{code}

{code}

              Depending on site policies, this operation may require
