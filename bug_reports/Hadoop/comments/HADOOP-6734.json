[HADOOP-4422 removed bucket creation from S3 filesystems. Does this fix the problem for you?, Sure. I had to drop calling S3 straight from Hadoop code anyhow (due to us using S3 and  Amazon Elastic MapReduce in EU). I don't know what's Hadoop policy on making patches to older releases, so I won't mark this "won't fix".
