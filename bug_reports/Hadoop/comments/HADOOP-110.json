[The reason that new objects are allocated during map is so that new objects will be available for the combiner.  So fixing HADOOP-110 is easy, but HADOOP-2 must be fixed first, since it is the underlying problem., Moves the creation of the map input objects outside of the loop., I just committed this.  Thanks, Owen.]
