[To be clear, currently we ignore errors processing checksums (checksum file not found, too short, timeouts while reading, etc.) so that the checksum system only throws user-visible exceptions when data is known to be corrupt.  You're proposing we change this so that, if the checksum file is there, then we may throw user-visible exceptions for errors processing the checksum data (like unexpected eof).  Is that right, or are you proposing something else?, Out of date.]
