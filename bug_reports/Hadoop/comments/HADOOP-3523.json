[The attached patch fixes the issue described above. We now check for the exit code from qstat indicating that the job id is invalid (error code = 153) and treat that as equivalent to completed. By doing so, a previously allocated cluster who's cluster id is no longer present with Torque will continue to be auto-deallocated and allocated again. 

However, if any other torque error occurs, we treat that as an unknown case, and let the user handle the deallocation himself. , Just FYI, one of the ways in which we can quickly get a job id from disappearing from a torque server is to restart it. So, can easily be simulated on a test cluster. Another way is to set the torque server configuration keep_completed to a very, very small value or 0., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., To check the issue, did the following -:
1. 
   a. Allocate hod cluster with --ringmaster.idleness-limit=240. 
   b. Waited for 4 mins. 
   c .verified  the cluster dead from hod list and qstat. 
   d. Restarted torque. ran qstat to verify that it does return anything. 
   e. ran hod allocate using hod without patch using same cluster dir, hod thows error. 
   f. Again ran hod allocate using patched hod. Allocation was successful

2. 
  a. Allocate hod cluster with --ringmaster.idleness-limit=240. 
   b. Waited for 4 mins. 
   c .verified  the cluster dead from hod list and qstat. 
   d. Stopped torque
   e. ran hod allocate using hod without patch using same cluster dir, hod thows error. 
   . Again ran hod allocate using patched hod. hod allocation fails with following error -:
    [
        WARNING/30 torque:96 - qstat error: exit code: 255 | signal: False | core False. 
       CRITICAL/50 hod:310 - Found a previously allocated cluster at cluster directory '~/c_dirn'. Deallocate the cluster first.
    ]
3.  Also hod behavior when hod list shows clsuter as dead/mapred dead/hdfs dead but actually cluster is alive (related torque job status is R)..
4. Normal re allocation of dead cluster , The new patch makes a minor modification to the error message that is printed when HOD does not automatically deallocate the cluster. This change was made after an offline discussion with Karam after his testing of the first patch., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
