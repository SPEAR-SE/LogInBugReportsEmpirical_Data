[Ideally calling hadoop-env.sh multiple times should not create any problems.

Because hadoop-config.sh itself called from so many files. Ex: hadoop-daemon.sh, slaves.sh, hdfs, yarn, etc.

We can remove the explicit call of hadoop-env.sh from scripts other than hadoop-config.sh

HADOOP-8476 will resolve all the issues., And one more thing is, variables configured in hadoop-env.sh should not append to its own initial value. It should be absolute. Then calling multiple times will not be a problem at all., Won't we lose the ability to override values if it does an absolute set?  I'd think the script should only set the value if unset.  Ie. something like: {code}${KEY:=<default value or expression>}{code}

I agree that technically it would be safe to include hadoop-env multiple times although it would be good to avoid redundant and unnecessary includes where possible., Duping this to HADOOP-9902 which fixed this.]
