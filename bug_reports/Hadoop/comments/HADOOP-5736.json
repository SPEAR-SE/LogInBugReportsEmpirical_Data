There are no tests because this is a documentation patch.
The release audit warning seems to be in the generated documentation files. Hence, I think it can be ignored., I committed this to trunk and branch 0.20. Thanks, Sreekanth !, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk #827 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-trunk/827/])
