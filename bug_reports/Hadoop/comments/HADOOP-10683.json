[This is because AuthenticationMethod is hardcoded to SIMPLE in _UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser_

{code:title=UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser|borderStyle=solid}
UserGroupInformation result = new UserGroupInformation(subject);
result.setAuthenticationMethod(AuthenticationMethod.SIMPLE);
{code}
, Attaching a patch which overloads _UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser_  to accept AuthMethod as an additional parameter.
The current _UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser_  is modified to invoke overloaded method with AuthMethod.SIMPLE.
A test case is also added.

, Instead of creating yet another UGI method, why not just have Server call the existing setAuthenticationMethod?, [~daryn], thanks for taking a look.  I slightly prefer the patch from Benoy that has been committed already.  The new method better communicates the intent of the call site and doesn't create the object in a temporary incorrect state with {{AuthenticationMethod#SIMPLE}}.  If you feel strongly about it though, I won't object to the change you suggested.]
