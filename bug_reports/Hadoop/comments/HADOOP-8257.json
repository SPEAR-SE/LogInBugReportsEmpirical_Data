[This patch to the test should fix the issue., +1 pending jenkins, good catch, Jenkins won't run on this since it's on a branch. I verified by changing the test runtime to 3 seconds and looping it. Without the patch, it failed with the mockito error after 3 or 4 minutes. I then looped with the patch for 15 minutes without a failure.]
