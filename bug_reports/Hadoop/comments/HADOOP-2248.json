[This patch speed map/reduce up by about 10% overall wallclock. The changes are:

1. Introduce a cache from the counter enum directly to the counter using identity hash map.
2. Change the api of counters so that you can iterate through them using for loops.
3. Change the api of counters so that applications can keep a reference to the counter.
4. Change the serialization to use Text.writeString instead of UTF8.writeString.
5. Change the map/reduce framework to keep reference to its internal counters (counts of map, combiner and reduce inputs and outputs)
6. Adds to the counters api to do string based incrementing to support HADOOP-1915., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
