This message is automatically generated., The patch looks pretty good to me, but it should be pretty easy to add a little test case for this. See TestOptionsParser for some examples. There's even one in there which tests the bandwidth option.

Also, please don't set the "fix versions" field until the JIRA is actually committed. Use the "target versions" field to express what versions you'd like to see this JIRA committed to.
