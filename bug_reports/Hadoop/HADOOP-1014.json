        "description": "It appears that a random data corruption is happening between the map and the reduce. This looks to be a blocker until it is resolved. There were two relevant messages on hadoop-dev:\n\nfrom Mike Smith:\n\nThe map/reduce jobs are not consistent in hadoop 0.11 release and trunk both\nwhen you rerun the same job. I have observed this inconsistency of the map\noutput in different jobs. A simple test to double check is to use hadoop\n0.11 with nutch trunk.\n\nfrom Albert Chern:\n\nI am having the same problem with my own map reduce jobs.  I have a job\nwhich requires two pieces of data per key, and just as a sanity check I make\nsure that it gets both in the reducer, but sometimes it doesn't.  What's\neven stranger is, the same tasks that complain about missing key/value pairs\nwill maybe fail two or three times, but then succeed on a subsequent try,\nwhich leads me to believe that the bug has to do with randomization (I'm not\nsure, but I think the map outputs are shuffled?).\n\nAll of my code works perfectly with 0.9, so I went back and just compared\nthe sizes of the outputs.  For some jobs, the outputs from 0.11 were\nconsistently 4 bytes larger, probably due to changes in SequenceFile.  But\nfor others, the output sizes were all over the place.  Some partitions were\nempty, some were correct, and some were missing data.  There seems to be\nsomething seriously wrong with 0.11, so I suggest you use 0.9.  I've been\ntrying to pinpoint the bug but its random nature is really annoying.\n",
