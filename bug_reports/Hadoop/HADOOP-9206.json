        "description": "Hi, in contrast to the easy-to-follow 1.0.4 instructions (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.0.4/single_node_setup.html) the 0.23.5 and 2.0.2-alpha instructions (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.0.2-alpha/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/SingleCluster.html) need more clarification -- it seems to be written for people who already know and understand hadoop.  In particular, these points need clarification:\n\n1.) Text: \"You should be able to obtain the MapReduce tarball from the release.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the MapReduce tarball?  What is its name?  I don't see such an object within the hadoop-0.23.5.tar.gz download.\n\n2.) Quote: \"NOTE: You will need protoc installed of version 2.4.1 or greater.\"\n\nProtoc doesn't have a website you can link to (it's just mentioned offhand when you Google it) -- is it really the case today that Hadoop has a dependency on such a minor project?  At any rate, if you can have a link of where one goes to get/install Protoc that would be good.\n\n3.) Quote: \"Assuming you have installed hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs and exported $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/$HADOOP_HDFS_HOME, untar hadoop mapreduce tarball and set environment variable $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME to the untarred directory.\"\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by the forward slashes: hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs and $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/$HADOOP_HDFS_HOME -- do you mean & (install both) or *or* just install one of the two?  This needs clarification--please remove the forward slash and replace it with what you're trying to say.  The audience here is complete newbie and they've been brought to this page from here: http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r0.23.5/ (same with r2.0.2-alpha/) (quote: \"Getting Started - The Hadoop documentation includes the information you need to get started using Hadoop. Begin with the Single Node Setup which shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation.\"), they've downloaded hadoop-0.23.5.tar.gz and want to know what to do next.  Why are there potentially two applications -- hadoop-common and hadoop-hdfs and not just one?  (The download doesn't appear to have two separate apps) -- if there is indeed just one app can we remove the other from the above text to avoid confusion?\n\nAgain, I just downloaded hadoop-0.23.5.tar.gz -- do I need to download more?  If so, let us know in the docs here.\n\nAlso, the fragment: \"Assuming you have installed hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs...\"  No, I haven't, that's what *this* page is supposed to explain to me how to do -- how do I install these two (or just one of these two)?\n\nAlso, what do I set $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME and/or $HADOOP_HDFS_HOME to?\n\n4.) Quote: \"NOTE: The following instructions assume you have hdfs running.\"  No, I don't--how do I do this?  Again, this page is supposed to teach me that.\n\n5.) Quote: \"To start the ResourceManager and NodeManager, you will have to update the configs. Assuming your $HADOOP_CONF_DIR is the configuration directory...\"\n\nCould you clarify here what the \"configuration directory\" is, it doesn't exist in the 0.23.5 download.  I just see bin,etc,include,lib,libexec,sbin,share folders but no \"conf\" one.)\n\n6.) Quote: \"Assuming that the environment variables $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME, $HADOOP_HDFS_HOME, $HADOO_MAPRED_HOME, $YARN_HOME, $JAVA_HOME and $HADOOP_CONF_DIR have been set appropriately.\"\n\nWe'll need to know what to set YARN_HOME to here.\n\nThanks!\nGlen",
