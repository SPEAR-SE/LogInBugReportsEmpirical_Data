        "description": "This appears to have been introduced in the 1.0.0 release. The issues does not seem to affect 0.10.2.\n\nWhen a topology is killed and workers receive the notification to shutdown, they do not shutdown cleanly, so worker hooks never get invoked.\n\nWhen a worker shuts down cleanly, the worker logs should contain entries such as the following:\n\n{code}\n2016-10-28 18:52:06.273 b.s.d.worker [INFO] Shut down transfer thread\n2016-10-28 18:52:06.279 b.s.d.worker [INFO] Shutting down default resources\n2016-10-28 18:52:06.287 b.s.d.worker [INFO] Shut down default resources\n2016-10-28 18:52:06.351 b.s.d.worker [INFO] Disconnecting from storm cluster state context\n2016-10-28 18:52:06.359 b.s.d.worker [INFO] Shut down worker exclaim-1-1477680593 61bddd66-0fda-4556-b742-4b63f0df6fc1 6700\n{code}\n\nIn the 1.0.x line of releases (and presumably 1.x, though I haven't checked) this does not happen -- the worker shutdown process appears to get stuck shutting down executors (https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.2/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/worker.clj#L666), no further log messages are seen in the worker log, and worker hooks do not run.\n\nThere are two properties that affect how workers exit. The first is the configuration property {{supervisor.worker.shutdown.sleep.secs}}, which defaults to 1 second. This corresponds to how long the supervisor will wait for a worker to exit gracefully before forcibly killing it with {{kill -9}}. When this happens the supervisor will log that the worker terminated with exit code 137 (128 + 9).\n\nThe second property is a hard-coded 1 second delay (https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.2/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/util.clj#L463) added as a shutdown hook that will call {{Runtime.halt()}} if the delay is exceeded. When this happens, the supervisor will log that the worker terminated with exit code 20 (hard-coded).\n\nSide Note: The hardcoded halt delay in worker.clj and the default value for {{supervisor.worker.shutdown.sleep.secs}} both being 1 second should probably be changed since it creates a race to see whether the supervisor delay or the worker delay wins.\n\n\nTo test this, I set {{supervisor.worker.shutdown.sleep.secs}} to 15 to allow plenty of time for the worker to exit gracefully, and deployed and killed a topology. In this case the supervisor consistently reported exit code 20 for the worker, indicating the hard-coded shutdown hook caused the worker to exit.\n\nI thought the hard-coded 1 second shutdown hook delay might not be long enough for the worker to shutdown cleanly. To test that hypothesis, I changed the hard-code delay to 10 seconds, leaving {{supervisor.worker.shutdown.sleep.secs}} at 15 seconds. Again supervisor reported an exit code of 20 for the worker, and there were no log messages indicating the worker had exited cleanly and that the worker hook had run.\n",
