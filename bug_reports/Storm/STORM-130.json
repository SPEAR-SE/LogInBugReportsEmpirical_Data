I may be that new-assignment is got from zk after storm-code-map. So we changed the storm-code-map after all-assignment and the problem disapeared.\n\n(defn mk-synchronize-supervisor [supervisor sync-processes event-manager processes-event-manager]\n  (fn this []\n(let [conf (:conf supervisor)\n      storm-cluster-state (:storm-cluster-state supervisor)\n      ^ISupervisor isupervisor (:isupervisor supervisor)\n      ^LocalState local-state (:local-state supervisor)\n      sync-callback (fn [& ignored] (.add event-manager this))\n      storm-code-map (read-storm-code-locations storm-cluster-state sync-callback)\n      downloaded-storm-ids (set (read-downloaded-storm-ids conf))\n      all-assignment (read-assignments\n                       storm-cluster-state\n                       (:supervisor-id supervisor)\n                       sync-callback)\n      new-assignment (->> all-assignment\n                          (filter-key #(.confirmAssigned isupervisor %)))\n      assigned-storm-ids (assigned-storm-ids-from-port-assignments new-assignment)\n      existing-assignment (.get local-state LS-LOCAL-ASSIGNMENTS)]\n  (log-debug \"Synchronizing supervisor\")\n  (log-debug \"Storm code map: \" storm-code-map)\n  (log-debug \"Downloaded storm ids: \" downloaded-storm-ids)\n  (log-debug \"All assignment: \" all-assignment)\n  (log-debug \"New assignment: \" new-assignment)\n\n----------\nNJtwentyone: I ran into having a similar problem once. Haven't had it lately. I was going to investigate more and before I created a posted but... There are two schedule-recurring functions of intertest in the function (mk-supervisor).\n\n(schedule-recurring (:timer supervisor) 0 10 (fn ))\n(schedule-recurring (:timer supervisor)\n0\n(conf SUPERVISOR-MONITOR-FREQUENCY-SECS)\n(fn )))\n\nSo function-1 (synchronize-supervisor) will eventually remove that dir [../stormconf.ser]\nAnd function-2 (sync-processes) will eventually hang wanting to create workers saying repeatedly\n2013-01-13 22:13:13 b.s.d.supervisor [INFO] 6f73facd-8722-4b83-959c-a7b396c61224 still hasn't started\n\nI'm using the distributed setup of (Storm 0.8.2/zookeeper-3.4.5) on my mac and a hp using storm.starter.WordCountTopology\n\n----------\nmiggi: Well this problem was resolved only after reinstalling new instance of ZK (3.3.6), we had other issues with deploy topology on 0.8.1 version, so it was decided use new instance ZK. \nBtw: removing storm data folders didn't help\n\n----------\nnathanmarz: For those of you hitting the problem, it would be really useful if you could turn on DEBUG logging on the supervisor and show those logs when the problem is hit.\n\n----------\nmiggi: After few months stable work - we ran into the same issue again.\n\nLogs (\"topology.debug: true\") \nSupervisor logs: http://cl.ly/0p2W3N0A2V3S\nWorker logs: http://cl.ly/2w1j1r0a3X46\n\nCleaning/restarting ZK/Nimbus/Worker components didn't help. \nNow we down: haven't tried solution proposed by xiaokang but probably it would be our next steps.\n\nAny fresh ideas ?\n\n----------\ndevoncrouse: +1 - ran into this twice now. We've \"reset\" things by clearing out Storm stuff in Zk, wiping out Storm data directory, and restarting the topology, but it happens again in time.\n\nStorm 0.9.0-wip16\nZk 3.3.6\n\n----------\nd2r: +1 seen this happen many times. same work-around\nMost recently Storm 0.8.2-wip22\n\nI'll try to collect a look and debug logs from the supervisor and have a look.\n\n----------\nmiggi: Hey guys, \ntry restart your cluster and ensure that all previous workers (java processes) was killed after this operation. \nAlso we've updated cluster to storm 0.8.3-wip1 with possible fix.\n\nHope it helps \n----\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nOleg M.\n\n----------\ndevoncrouse: Simple restart doesn't cut it; have to totally clear out all Storm state in Zk and data directory (cluster otherwise quickly becomes unbalanced with same errors in the logs) - and again, we're on 0.9.0-wip16.\n\n----------\nxiaokang: We encountered the same problem in production cluster. The log showed that a worker died and supervisor and nimbus found that at the same time. Than nimbus assign the worker to other host and the supervisor's sync-supervisor delete topo's code while sync-process try to restart the died timeouted worker.\n\nOur solution is change supervisor's woker timeout from 30 to 5 seconds and nimbus remain 30. It works.\n\n----------\nd2r: We have tried the same work-around from @xiaokang, but we still see the issue.\n\n----------\nnathanmarz: @d2r This is fixed in the 0.8.3 wip, please try that out and let me know if it fixes the issue for you.\n\n----------\nd2r: @nathanmarz Yes, pulling in the fix to supervisor.clj from 0.8.3 did resolve the issue for us. Thanks!\n\n----------\ndevoncrouse: Is this fix going to be applied to the newer builds (e.g. 0.9.0) as well?\n\nd5207b5\n\n---------\nviceyang: We encountered the same problem, our version is 0.8.3, i read supervisor code, it seems not a bug, the key reason is \"synchronize-supervisor\" which responsible for download file and remove file thread and \"sync-processes\" which responsible for start worker process thread is Asynchronous. \nsee this case: in synchronize-supervisor read assigment information from zk, supervisor download necessary file from nimbus and write local state . in aother thread sync-processes funciton read local state to launch workor process, when the worker process has not start ,synchronize-supervisor function is called again topology's assignment information has changed (cased by rebalance,or worker time out etc.) worker assignment to this supervisor has move to another supervisor, synchronize-supervisor remove the unnecessary file (jar file and ser file etc.) , after this, worker launched by \" sync-processes\" ,ser file was not exsit , this issue occur. \nThough in this issue exception occured but logic sees right. this excetion can't compelety Eliminate unless change thread Asynchronous feather. \nthere is some way reduction the exception occur, @xiaokang metioned \"change supervisor's woker timeout from 30 to 5 seconds and nimbus remain 30\" this method redeuce nimbus reassign topology. another way change \"synchronize-supervisor\" thread loop time to a longger than 10(default time) sec, such as 30 sec。",
