        "description": "*UPDATE*\r\n\r\nTurns out that this is much better solved by leveraging {{log4j2}}'s {{isThreadContextMapInheritable}} property, which hands child threads a point-in-time copy of the parent's {{MDC}} contents, which completely solves the issue this sought to address.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*ORIGINAL*\r\n\r\ntl;dr: {{ShellLogHandler}} is handed context in one thread, before being used exclusively from another, this obstructs sane usage of {{slf4j}}'s {{MDC}} feature which is thread local.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n{{ShellBolt}} instantiates the {{ShellLogHandler}} and calls its {{setUpContext}} as part of {{prepare}}, immediately before it spawns its {{BoltReaderRunnable}} and {{BoltWriterRunnable}} threads which are responsible for communication with the {{ShellProcess}} that's already been spawned.\r\n\r\nThe {{ShellLogHandler}} is used exclusively from {{BoltReaderRunnable}}. The upshot of this is that {{setUpContext}} is executed in the task thread (i.e. {{Thread-21-joiner-executor[2 2]}}) while the {{log}} method is executed in the anonymous thread (i.e. {{Thread-30}}) running the {{BoltReaderRunnable}}.\r\n\r\nThis creates a problem when trying to leverage {{slf4j}}'s {{MDC}} (or {{NDC}}) which are used for augmenting log messages with additional information which is localised and persisted at the thread level.\r\n\r\nThe current work around for this is to store all relevant context on the {{ShellLogHandler}} during {{setUpContext}}, and then write it into the {{MDC}} during the {{log}} call, and taking precautions around that state being thread safe. The thread safety requirement is the first drawback, the second is that each {{log}} call has the additional overhead of either unconditionally writing to the {{MDC}} or checking that the {{MDC}} is already populated. Neither is very appealing.\r\n\r\nThe suggested solution is to pass {{stormConf}}, {{_process}}, and {{_context}} into the constructor of {{BoltReaderRunnable}} (and perhaps also {{BoltWriterRunnable}}) and instantiate {{ShellLogHandler}} and call its {{setUpContext}} from that thread.\r\n",
