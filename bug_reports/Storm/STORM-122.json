        "description": "https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/issues/745\n\nApologies if this ticket is off-base, I'm not an expert in this area. We've been testing an existing topology we ran on Storm 0.8.1 on a deployment of Storm 0.9.0-rc2. The only roadblock we've encountered so far is the presence of the log4j-over-slf4j jar in the newer version. It turns out that log4j-over-slf4j is incompatible with slf4j-log4j12.\n\nBasically our topology uses slf4j as the the logging facade and log4j as the backend, which I've heard is a common pattern. It seems that in order to migrate to the new Storm version we must either move our code off of log4j or delete the log4j-over-slf4j jar from the storm classpath.\n\nAre we doing something crazy here? I'm open to alternate solutions, but it seems like an issue to break legacy topologies over logging. My understanding based on #144 was that Storm was migrating completely to slf4j, is this no longer true? Any insight, advice, or fixes would be helpful.\n\n--------\njmlogan: You're going to have to exclude log4j and log4j-over-slf4j. Storm calls mostly seem to be slf4j, but it is not logger-agonistic. In 0.9.0, it will force logback onto your classpath at runtime, and will crash if it has multiple adapters.\n\nIf you see a job failing to launch, right after updating, it's probably this issue. We ended up just excluding log4j from the offending dependencies.\n\n\n---------\nbakks: Hey, thanks for your response. The issue is that log4j-over-slf4j is now a Storm dependency, so its loaded into the topology classpath by default. This wasn't true in earlier Storm versions, so perhaps this is intentional, but our topology which used to work now doesn't. It seems like there is now no way to use log4j as an slf4j backend. If that is the new state of the world, its fine, but it seems like an issue and I'm hoping for a workaround.",
