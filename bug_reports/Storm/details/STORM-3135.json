   \r\n    1.  We are doing something in the test that we are not doing anywhere in the real code.  If this is a bug in the test why are we not doing something similar in the real code that tries to shut down the queue, and if we want to do something similar everywhere, can we make some changes to `JCQueue` so the halt is guaranteed to happen.\r\n    \r\n    2.  The second one goes along with this.  Part of `haltWithInterrupt` is best effort (inserting the `INTERRUPT` message), but the rest of the method assumes it will be called once (closes down metrics etc.) . Not sure if these need to be moved to a different location when we know the close has happened, or if we want to protect them from being executed multiple times.  But all of this depends on how we address my first concern.\n","created":"2018-07-02T13:26:40.900+0000","updated":"2018-07-02T13:26:40.900+0000","started":"2018-07-02T13:26:40.899+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"118171","issueId":"13169250"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13169250/worklog/118271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user srdo commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2745\n  \n    @revans2 Good point. It probably doesn't hurt much in the real code, because the queue is only shut down when the worker or executor is shut down. It could be an issue for tests with LocalCluster though.\r\n    \r\n    Took a different approach. As far as I can tell, there isn't a great reason that we need to interrupt the async loops through the JCQueue. We can just interrupt the threads directly, which is already happening during worker/executor shutdown.\r\n    \r\n    I think the reason to interrupt via the queue is because the wait strategies now include use of LockSupport.parkNanos, so there's no guarantee that the executors will hit a Thread.sleep and throw an InterruptedException. We can fix this by checking manually for interrupts, either in the async loop, or in the wait strategies where we're calling parkNanos. \n","created":"2018-07-02T17:34:03.184+0000","updated":"2018-07-02T17:34:03.184+0000","started":"2018-07-02T17:34:03.183+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"118271","issueId":"13169250"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13169250/worklog/121569","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user revans2 commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2745\n  \n    Sorry I don't think I submitted my nit.
