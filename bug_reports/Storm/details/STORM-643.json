\n    Thank you for the good finding and patch.\n    \n    I have applied proposed patch on pure storm-0.9.3 branch, deployed and testet, and indeed it seems to fix the issue by skipping failed offsets. \n    But, in case there are lots of failed messages that have outdated offset -> the spout will slowly ask kafka for each of them and then discarding filed message one at a time.\n    \n    In logs this will look like following: (some log warnings records were added for debugging reasons).\n    Note, that \"new offset\" doesn't change.\n    \n    ```\n    2015-02-23T14:19:30.080+0100 s.k.KafkaUtils [WARN] Got fetch request with offset out of range: [58094410182]\n    2015-02-23T14:19:30.083+0100 s.k.PartitionManager [WARN] Using new offset: 58094849835\n

one step, see code snippet below:\n    \n    ```\n                //fix bug [STORM-643] : remove this offset from failed list when it is OutOfRange\n                if (had_failed) {\n                    // For the case of EarliestTime it would be better to discard\n                    // all the failed offsets, that are earlier than actual EarliestTime\n                    // offset, since they are anyway not there.\n                    // These calls to broker API will be then saved.\n    \n                    // In case of LatestTime - it is a question, if we still need to try out and\n                    // reach those that are failed (they still may be available).\n                    // But, by moving to LatestTime we are discarding messages in kafka queue.\n                    // Since it is configured so, assume that it is ok for user to loose information\n                    // and user cares about newest messages first.\n                    // It makes sense not to do exceptions for those that are failed and discard them as well.\n    \n                    SortedSet<Long> omitted = failed.headSet(_emittedToOffset);\n    \n                    // Use tail, since sortedSet maintains its elements in ascending order\n                    // Using tailSet will set a 'range' on original implementation\n                    // so we couldn't then add objects that are out of range.\n                    // For that reason we copy tail into new Set, where range is not set.\n                    failed = new TreeSet<Long>(failed.tailSet(_emittedToOffset));\n                    LOG.warn(\"Removing the failed offsets that are out of range: {}\", omitted);\n                }\n    ```\n    \n    So, then outdated offsets are skipped at once, and we save several (hundreds) calls to kafka API:\n    \n    ```\n    2015-02-23T15:07:21.913+0100 s.k.KafkaUtils [WARN] Got fetch request with offset out of range: [8786892024]\n    2015-02-23T15:07:21.915+0100

The code in partitionManager does not ack the offset in that case.  It should be made clear that a scheme should not return an empty list of lists, but null, if it deserializes no objects.  Or, this code in PartitionManager should be fixed to treat an empty list of lists in the same way it treats a null list.\n    \n    ```java\n                if (tups != null) {\n                    if(_spoutConfig.topicAsStreamId) {\n                        for (List<Object> tup : tups) {\n                            collector.emit(_spoutConfig.topic, tup, new KafkaMessageId(_partition, toEmit.offset));\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        for (List<Object> tup : tups) {\n                            collector.emit(tup, new KafkaMessageId(_partition, toEmit.offset));\n                        }\n                    }\n                    break;\n                } else {\n                    ack(toEmit.offset);\n                }\n    ```\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-09-17T16:31:20.540+0000","updated":"2015-09-17T16:31:20.540+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771585/comment/15030404","id":"15030404","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jia.fu","name":"jia.fu","key":"jia.fu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"jia.fu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Chongqing"},"body":"I'm using this ver  storm-kafka 0.95.and got a large number of logs like below .\nand set up \tspoutConf.forceFromStart = true;\nthe root cause is  this issue?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.843+0800 s.k.PartitionManager [WARN] Using new offset: 26147475\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.850+0800 s.k.KafkaUtils [WARN] Got fetch request with offset out of range: [9852196]; retrying with default start offset time from configuration. configured start offset time: [-2]\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.850+0800 s.k.PartitionManager [WARN] Using new offset: 26147475\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.851+0800 s.k.KafkaUtils [WARN] Got fetch request with offset out of range: [9852196]; retrying with default start offset time from configuration. configured start offset time: [-2]\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.852+0800 s.k.PartitionManager [WARN] Using new offset: 26147475\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.853+0800 s.k.KafkaUtils [WARN] Got fetch request with offset out of range: [9852196]; retrying with default start offset time from configuration. configured start offset time: [-2]\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.853+0800 s.k.PartitionManager [WARN] Using new offset: 26147475\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.855+0800 s.k.KafkaUtils [WARN] Got fetch request with offset out of range: [9852196]; retrying with default start offset time from configuration. configured start offset time: [-2]\n2015-11-28T12:39:28.855+0800 s.k.PartitionManager [WARN] Using new offset: 26147475","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jia.fu","name":"jia.fu","key":"jia.fu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"jia.fu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Chongqing"},"created":"2015-11-28T06:22:11.790+0000","updated":"2015-11-28T06:23:11.403+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771585/comment/15030422","id":"15030422","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vesense","name":"vesense","key":"vesense","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=vesense&avatarId=25513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=vesense&avatarId=25513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=vesense&avatarId=25513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=vesense&avatarId=25513"},"displayName":"Xin Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Yes.
