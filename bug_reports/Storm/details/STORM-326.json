Thank you for your advice @revans2 . I have added a new class named ExclamationTopologyWithMetrics to reproduce the error. The newly added class is based on the existed ExclamationTopology class. For testing, I set the parallelism of the bolt named \"exclaim1\" to 3, and its task number to 6, and the parallelism and task number of the second bolt named \"exclaim2\" to 2 and 6, respectively. After running the topology, I got the following results:\n    \n    ![results](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4179640/3022766/7a1a0e70-dfd2-11e3-8944-7e683c08a279.png)\n    \n    As shown in the Figure, the task \"4:exclaim1\" has repeated twice of the metric reporting, and the task \"11:exclaim2\" has repeated three times, as we expected.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-05-20T03:58:50.762+0000","updated":"2014-05-20T03:58:50.762+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715102/comment/14003236","id":"14003236","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/118#issuecomment-43626596\n  \n    I was thinking more along the lines of a unit test, but a manual test is OK too.
