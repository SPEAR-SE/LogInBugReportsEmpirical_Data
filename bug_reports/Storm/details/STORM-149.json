Are there any pre-requisites to run this on windows ? are the same zip files that we run on Linux machines could be used to run on Windows?\n\n----------\ndavidlao2k: Hi Chitturi\nYou can run storm on Windows. At the moment it requires merging pull request 722 into 0.9.0 to create usable jar. In addition to java and python, you will need the Windows version of zmq binaries as well as unzip.exe. Cygwin is not required. I'll be posting detailed build and setup instructions at https://github.com/davidlao2k/storm-windows in the next couple of days.\n\n----------\njmlogan: You could try switching to Netty to avoid the Windows-zmq dependency?\n\n----------\nChitturiPadma: Hi David,\n\nAny update on how the storm stuff works on Windows ? I have build 0mq, zmq dependencies on windows. Even the zookeeper is running on master node. My major concern is storm 0.8.2 version contains .sh files which actually work on linux environment. How to make these work on windows environment. What modifications are required?\n\nHi David,\nI downloaded the zip file (storm-windows-master.zip) from https://github.com/davidlao2k/storm-windows. how to proceed with running .cmd files in bin directory. I have modified the storm.yaml file il conf. Are any changes required for .cmd file to run on windows machine. When i execute storm.cmd and storm-config.cmd, its throwing error that STORM_HOME variable is not set to the absolute path of the directory that contains sand storm distribution. Can u please suggest me how to proceed on this.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"364154","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"\"storm jar\" doesn't work on Windows","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12684776/comment/13865779","id":"13865779","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ptgoetz","name":"ptgoetz","key":"ptgoetz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"P.
