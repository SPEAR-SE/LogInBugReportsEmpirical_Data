It does not apply to consumer rebalance. Quoting the [javadoc](https://goo.gl/PyR7Cm) of \"The offset used by the Kafka spout in the first poll to Kafka broker.\" Therefore, the `LATEST/EARLIEST` strategies only apply in the first poll, not on every consumer rebalance. Furthermore, if a consumer rebalance occurs, but the same partition is assigned to this spout, and some offsets have already been emitted and acked, we wan to keep those, and only process the ones that haven't yet been acked because they have have failed and waiting to be retried (according to exponential backoff) or may be on the \"wire\". \n    \n    What do you mean by -2 , -1?
