yes, copy/paste comes out exactly as you see it.  Even in the case of maps and lists with values in them there are new lines.  I like the JSON because you can copy and paste it on the command line with a -c command.  But the new lines make it a little difficult.  If you think this is a blocker please let me know and I'll look for a work around, like having a copy button that does not include any extra white space.
