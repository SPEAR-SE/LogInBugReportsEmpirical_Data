The code is really confusing and overly complicated.  I comes from when we were adding in security to storm.  It is a long story where we ran into several bugs/limitations in ZK itself that prevented us from doing what we initial wanted to do.  It also comes from the really confusing way that ZK handles authentication.\n    \n    ZK supports both SASL authentication which is per connection, and a special digest authentication with can be per command and can override the connection authentication if any.  (don't confuse this special built in ZK digest authentication with the SASL digest authentication which ZK also supports, as they are different) SASL authentication with ZK is handled through the jaas conf.  There is a \"Client\" section that says how you want to authenticate with the zookeeper servers.  Using kerberos for this is the recommended way to authenticate ZK as it very secure.  STORM_ZOOKEEPER_AUTH_SCHEME allows you to use the built in ZK digest auth scheme in the daemons.  This is really only there for testing purposes.  Although it could work in production if you wanted it to, it just will be no where near as secure as kerberos is.\n    \n    One of the issues we ran into with allowing the workers to communicate with ZK was that the workers needed some way to authenticate with ZK that didn't expire.  We could force everyone to send a TGT to the worker and then use that to authenticate with ZK, but TGTs expire and so users would have to push a new one periodically.  So we made the decision that we would use the built in ZK digest like a ticket.  We would randomly generate a 128 bit number as the secret, and then let nimbus setup the ACLs in ZK to only allow a user with that 128 bit secret to access the data.\n    \n    That is how it currently works.  We didn't really like that and wanted to leave open the possibility of using a different auth scheme with ZK in the future.  That is why we have the configs as a string and not a boolean.  If we want to update the documentation for the cofnigs we can.  But I would say for now just mark them as being internal configs relating to security that the end user should not actually set.\n","created":"2017-07-19T19:36:12.718+0000","updated":"2017-07-19T19:36:12.718+0000","started":"2017-07-19T19:36:12.717+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"48168","issueId":"13086840"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13086840/worklog/48169","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user revans2 commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2208#discussion_r128345781\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/Config.java ---\n    @@ -967,12 +967,6 @@\n         public static final String STORM_ZOOKEEPER_SUPERACL = \"storm.zookeeper.superACL\";\n     \n         /**\n    -     * The topology Zookeeper authentication scheme to use, e.g. \"digest\".
