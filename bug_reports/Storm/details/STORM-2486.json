And then the {{pwd}} command prints the same directory again.  So the behavior results in the {{STORM_BASE_DIR}} variable containing duplicate paths with a newline in between.  This results in a broken classpath in the Storm processes, which looks something like this:\n\n{code}\n...:/base/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/storm-rename-hack-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:/base/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT^J/base/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf:/base/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/storm-local/supervisor/stormdist/foo-1-1480491213/stormjar.jar\n{code}\n\nOr with the {{:}} chars replaced with newlines for ease of readability:\n{code}\n...\n/base/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/storm-rename-hack-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n/base/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT^J/base/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf\n/base/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/storm-local/supervisor/stormdist/foo-1-1480491213/stormjar.jar\n{code}\n\nNote that the classpath entry with {{/conf}} as a suffix is munged, with a {{^J}} character in between duplicate copies of the base path.\n\nThe solution is easy:  at the beginning of the {{bin/storm}} script we should {{unset CDPATH}}.\n\nFYI, this \"CDPATH + bash script\" problem is covered in this blog entry:\n*
