Windows.\n\n    See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2716.\n    \n    The tests run on Windows now at least. I haven't tested Logviewer beyond checking that I can search logs on my local machine from Storm UI, so there may still be some corners of Logviewer that doesn't work on Windows.\n    \n    I also removed some constants that were making accessing the file.separator property easy. I don't think we need them since File.separator exists.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/srdo/storm STORM-2716\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2360.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #2360\n    \n----\ncommit d8363813e9877b35bb6a8f9006540cf3d0be44e1\nAuthor: Stig Rohde Døssing <srdo@apache.org>\nDate:   2017-08-20T16:59:12Z\n\n    STORM-2716: Fix logviewer on Windows, and make storm-webapp tests pass on Windows.
