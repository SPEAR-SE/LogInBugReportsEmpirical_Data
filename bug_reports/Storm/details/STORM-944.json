Hive 1.2.1 depends on Calcite 1.2.0 and several tests fail if it's excluded.  I could get past these first problems by updating the calcite version in storm-hive/pom.xml to 1.2.0.  However, one test still fails (see below).  I have not had time to investigate these further, but it looks like some Hive behavior changes unrelated to the calcite dependency issue.\n    \n    A new JIRA for Hive 1.2.1 support seems appropriate for that issue.\n    \n    ```\n    Running org.apache.storm.hive.bolt.TestHiveBolt\n    Tests run: 9, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 15.488 sec <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.storm.hive.bolt.TestHiveBolt\n    testWithTimeformat(org.apache.storm.hive.bolt.TestHiveBolt)  Time elapsed: 0.692 sec  <<< FAILURE!\n    org.mockito.exceptions.verification.WantedButNotInvoked: \n    Wanted but not invoked:\n    collector.ack(\n        source: null:1, stream: , id: {}, [100, test-123, null, null]\n    );\n    -> at org.apache.storm.hive.bolt.TestHiveBolt.testWithTimeformat(TestHiveBolt.java:235)\n    \n    However, there were other interactions with this mock:\n    -> at backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.reportError(OutputCollector.java:223)\n    -> at backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.fail(OutputCollector.java:218)\n    -> at backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.reportError(OutputCollector.java:223)\n    -> at backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.fail(OutputCollector.java:218)\n    \n    \tat org.apache.storm.hive.bolt.TestHiveBolt.testWithTimeformat(TestHiveBolt.java:235)\n    \n    Running org.apache.storm.hive.common.TestHiveWriter\n    Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.387 sec - in org.apache.storm.hive.common.TestHiveWriter\n    \n    Results :\n    \n    Failed tests: \n      TestHiveBolt.testWithTimeformat:235 \n    Wanted but not invoked:\n    collector.ack(\n        source: null:1, stream: , id: {}, [100, test-123, null, null]\n    );\n    -> at org.apache.storm.hive.bolt.TestHiveBolt.testWithTimeformat(TestHiveBolt.java:235)\n    \n    However, there were other interactions with this mock:\n    -> at backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.reportError(OutputCollector.java:223)\n    -> at backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.fail(OutputCollector.java:218)\n    -> at backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.reportError(OutputCollector.java:223)\n    -> at backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.fail(OutputCollector.java:218)\n    \n    \n    Tests run: 12, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\n    ```\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-08-11T12:51:25.132+0000","updated":"2015-08-11T12:51:25.132+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845760/comment/14692342","id":"14692342","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/609#issuecomment-130092091\n  \n    For now, all Travis CI builds are failing due to SNAPSHOT issue on storm-hive.\n    It is already bothering us, so I think we should take this first, and discuss later improvements for this issue.\n    +1.\n    \n    @caofangkun \n    I'm sorry but removing calcite-core from dependency is minor at now.
