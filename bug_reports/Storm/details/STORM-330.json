It overcomes the following shortcomings in curator frameworks implementation of `BoundedExponentialBackOffRetry`:\n      - Limitation maxRetries to 29.\n      - `getSleepTimeMs` fails with IllegalArgumentException by passing -ve argument to random.nextInt if retryCount > 29.\n      - Also, exponential calculation in quickly catches up to `maxSleepTimeMs` - eventually adding more delay and increasing collision possibility.\n    This class calculates `threshold` for exponentially increasing `sleeptime` for retries. Beyond threshold, the sleep time increase is linear. \n    It adds jitter for exponential/linear retry.\n    It guarantees `currSleepTimeMs >= prevSleepTimeMs` and `baseSleepTimeMs <= currSleepTimeMs <= maxSleepTimeMs`\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/kishorvpatil/incubator-storm storm-backoff-retry-strategy\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/220.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #220\n    \n----\ncommit 7d21ffe9f9f61c9e3115add26a250b95084b131d\nAuthor: Kishor Patil <kpatil@yahoo-inc.com>\nDate:   2014-08-08T20:32:20Z\n\n    Implement storm exponential backoff stategy to use for netty client and curator.\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-08-08T20:45:04.846+0000","updated":"2014-08-08T20:45:04.846+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715742/comment/14092909","id":"14092909","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user ptgoetz commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/220#discussion_r16061121\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/messaging/netty/Client.java ---\n    @@ -137,8 +138,9 @@ private synchronized void connect() {\n                 if (channel != null && channel.isConnected()) {\n                     return;\n                 }\n    -            \n    +\n                 int tried = 0;\n    +            StormBoundedExponentialBackoffRetry retryPolicy = new StormBoundedExponentialBackoffRetry(base_sleep_ms, max_sleep_ms, max_retries);\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    Would it make sense to make `retryPolicy` an instance variable and instantiate it in the constructor rather than create a new one for every call to `connect()`?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-08-11T15:48:56.379+0000","updated":"2014-08-11T15:48:56.379+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715742/comment/14092933","id":"14092933","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user kishorvpatil commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/220#discussion_r16062415\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/messaging/netty/Client.java ---\n    @@ -137,8 +138,9 @@ private synchronized void connect() {\n                 if (channel != null && channel.isConnected()) {\n                     return;\n                 }\n    -            \n    +\n                 int tried = 0;\n    +            StormBoundedExponentialBackoffRetry retryPolicy = new StormBoundedExponentialBackoffRetry(base_sleep_ms, max_sleep_ms, max_retries);\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    @ptgoetz, good catch.

Since the `maxRetryInterval` is argument passed in constructor and need not again be retrieved for assertion against what was passed to the constructor. \n       - About failing tests, the constructor arguments needed to be corrected, since old class had different order of `maxRetries` and `maxSleepTimeMs` in `Utils.java`.\n       - About `divide by zero`, was scenarios I overlooked - when `maxRetries` is below `expRetriesThreshold`, making the RetryPolicy - exponential only. In that case, the calculation of `linearBaseSleepMs` failed. Now I am forcing it to `1` whenever user configures `maxRetries` below exponential retry threshold. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-08-28T05:45:52.452+0000","updated":"2014-08-28T05:45:52.452+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715742/comment/14113737","id":"14113737","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/220#issuecomment-53717790\n  \n    +1 all the tests pass and the code look fine.\n    \n    @ptgoetz not sure if you want to take another look or not.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-08-28T13:18:50.426+0000","updated":"2014-08-28T13:18:50.426+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715742/comment/14115738","id":"14115738","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/220\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-08-29T19:58:41.912+0000","updated":"2014-08-29T19:58:41.912+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715742/comment/14115740","id":"14115740","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ptgoetz","name":"ptgoetz","key":"ptgoetz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"P.
