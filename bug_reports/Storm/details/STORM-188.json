full configuration path when running storm command\n\n    We can use system config \"storm.conf.file\" to specify a custom config file.\n    \n    Before this patch, we will only try to lookup this file on jvm classpath.\n    \n    This patch will give us the ability to specify full/relative filesystem path as configuration file path, thus will give us more flexibility, while we still are able to look it up on jvm classpath.\n    \n    Now we are able to submit storm topology like this: \n    \n    ```bash\n    storm jar job.jar --config /tmp/dynamic-configuration-path.yaml\n    ```\n    \n    We don't need to add /tmp into our classpath(also inappropriate).\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/clockfly/incubator-storm
