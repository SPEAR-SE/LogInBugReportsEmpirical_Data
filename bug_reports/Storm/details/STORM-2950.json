Maybe worth to see how much the difference is? We should provide state resharding anyway to support the change of task parallelism. (though changing hash function requires all of end-users to run it once.)\n","created":"2018-02-14T22:26:34.661+0000","updated":"2018-02-14T22:26:34.661+0000","started":"2018-02-14T22:26:34.661+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"73640","issueId":"13138586"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13138586/worklog/73641","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2558#discussion_r168331437\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TupleUtils.java ---\n    @@ -41,7 +41,7 @@ public static boolean isTick(Tuple tuple) {\n         }\n     \n         public static <T> int chooseTaskIndex(List<T> keys, int numTasks) {\n    -        return Math.abs(listHashCode(keys)) % numTasks;\n    +        return Math.abs(listHashCode(keys) % numTasks);\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    Worth noting that `Math.abs(listHashCode(keys)) % numTasks` != `(mod listHashCode(keys) numTasks)` so we did it wrong, and fortunately found it.\n","created":"2018-02-14T22:31:10.300+0000","updated":"2018-02-14T22:31:10.300+0000","started":"2018-02-14T22:31:10.300+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"73641","issueId":"13138586"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13138586/worklog/73658","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user Ethanlm commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2558#discussion_r168339726\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TupleUtils.java ---\n    @@ -41,7 +41,7 @@ public static boolean isTick(Tuple tuple) {\n         }\n     \n         public static <T> int chooseTaskIndex(List<T> keys, int numTasks) {\n    -        return Math.abs(listHashCode(keys)) % numTasks;\n    +        return Math.abs(listHashCode(keys) % numTasks);\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    Thanks.
