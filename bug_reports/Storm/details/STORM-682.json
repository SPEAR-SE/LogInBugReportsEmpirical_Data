LocalState.put first creates a data file X and then marks a success by creating a file X.version.  During get it first checks for all *.version files , tries to find the largest value of X and then issues a read against X. See the below pseudo code\n\n{code:java}\nstart_supervisor() {\nworkerIds = `ls local-state/workers`\nfor each workerId in workerIds\n     versions =  `ls local-state/workers/workerId/heartbeats/*.version`\n     latest_version = max(versions)\n     read  local-state/workers/workerId/heartbeats/latest_version [Note there is no .version extension] \n}\n{code}\n\nDuring cleanup it first tries to delete file X and then X.version. If X gets deleted  but X.version fails to delete the supervisor fails to start with FileNotFoundException in the code above. \n\nWe propose to change the deletion order so the .version files get deleted before the data file and catch any IOException when reading worker heartbeats to avoid supervisor failure.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Supervisor
