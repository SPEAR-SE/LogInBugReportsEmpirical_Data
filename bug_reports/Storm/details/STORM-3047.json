The changed code used to request sorted partitions from the spout via getOrderedPartitions, do a round-robin partitioning, and assign partitions via refreshPartitions https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.4/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/spout/OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor.java#L100. The new code just passes the output of getOrderedPartitions into refreshPartitions https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.0/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/spout/OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor.java#L120. It looks to me like refreshPartitions is passed the list of all partitions assigned to any spout task, rather than just the partitions assigned to the current task.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix will use getOrderedPartitions to get the sorted partitions list, pass the list into getPartitionsForTask, and pass the resulting list of assigned partitions back into refreshPartitions.\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"remainingEstimate":"0h","timeSpent":"20m","remainingEstimateSeconds":0,"timeSpentSeconds":1200},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":0,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Ensure
