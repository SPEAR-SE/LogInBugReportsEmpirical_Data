the Trident interface correctly\n\n    This PR is based on https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2271, so please ignore the first commit. The broad thrust of this PR is to fix the storm-kafka-client Trident spout so it implements the Trident API as intended. The current implementation takes some shortcuts because it used to be necessary to support use of the KafkaConsumer.subscribe API, but it causes some issues listed below.\n    \n    * The changes in https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2009 released in 1.1.0 made some changes to the OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor that likely broke IOpaquePartitionedTridentSpout implementations other than storm-kafka-client. The changed code used to request sorted partitions from the spout via getOrderedPartitions, do a round-robin partitioning, and assign partitions via refreshPartitions https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.4/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/spout/OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor.java#L100. The new code just passes the output of getOrderedPartitions into refreshPartitions https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.0/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/spout/OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor.java#L120. It looks to me like refreshPartitions is passed the list of all partitions assigned to any spout task, rather than just the partitions assigned to the current task.\n    \n    The proposed fix will use getOrderedPartitions to get the sorted partitions list, pass the list into getPartitionsForTask, and pass the resulting list of assigned partitions back into refreshPartitions.\n    \n    * The current implementation of the Trident Kafka spout only has one consumer in the Emitter. The Coordinator needs to know which partitions are involved in a batch, and this information is shared via a static field the Emitter writes to. The Coordinator and Emitter are both running as regular bolts, so there's no guarantee that they're in the same JVM.\n    \n    The Subscription interface doesn't fit Trident very well. Trident assumes that there is a coordinator bolt that will determine which partitions should be involved in a batch, and the emitter bolts should partition the list emitted by the coordinator and each emit for only the partitions assigned to the relevant emitter. The Subscription interface only has a `subscribe()` method that does everything, which means we can't delegate parts of the subscription process to the coordinator. The current spout does a workaround that assumes that the coordinator bolt will be in the same worker as one or more emitters, and just makes the emitter handle everything while the coordinator reads partition information from a static field. This only works if the coordinator happens to be sharing a worker with the emitters, and causes issues where the coordinator emits a set of partitions, and the emitters happen to do a reassignment before the message arrives.\n    \n    The suggested fix is to split the subscription process into 4 steps that fit what Trident needs: Get all partitions for the spout tasks, sort the partitions, decide which partitions belong to this task and do the assignment. This allows us to get rid of the shared static field and split the subscription process across the coordinator and emitters. We'll lose a bit of flexibility in implementing Subscriptions, since we're now locking implementations to follow these steps, but I don't think it's a great loss.\n    \n    I don't think we can port this to 1.x without breaking the public API for the spout. I'd be okay with breaking the API in 1.2.0 unless anyone has an idea for a workaround.\n    \n    Other small changes:\n    * The Trident spout was previously checking that all output stream fields were identical. As far as I can tell * Trident only supports one output stream, so check for that instead.\n    * Removed an empty transactional spout implementation.\n    * Remove TopicPartition from KafkaTridentSpoutBatchMetadata. It is unnecessary, the OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor keeps track of which metadata belongs to which partition.\n    * Upgrade Mockito to latest 1.x version for Rule support.\n\nYou can merge
