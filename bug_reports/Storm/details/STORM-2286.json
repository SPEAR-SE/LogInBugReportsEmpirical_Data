Finally, it will get a new storm-id and totally new assignment on cluster.\n    \n    When supervisor feels this, it will kill all the old workers for the rebalanced topology, and launch new. In other words, the rebalanced topology and the old one are totally two different topologies to nimbus and cluster. Storm doesn't keep any state and just kill the old worker after the wait time we passed in [from rebalance command].\n    \n    So, the problem you suggest doesn't exist. The rebalance command is just like a composite of kill and submit command.\n    \n    Here is the code snippet:\n    \n    ```java\n    (defn do-rebalance [nimbus storm-id status storm-base]\n      (let [rebalance-options (:topology-action-options storm-base)]\n        (.update-storm! (:storm-cluster-state nimbus)\n          storm-id\n            (-> {:topology-action-options nil}\n              (assoc-non-nil :component->executors (:component->executors rebalance-options))\n              (assoc-non-nil :num-workers (:num-workers rebalance-options))))\n      (mk-assignments nimbus :scratch-topology-id storm-id))\n    \n    (defnk mk-assignments [nimbus :scratch-topology-id nil]\n      (if (is-leader nimbus :throw-exception false)\n        (let [conf (:conf nimbus)\n            storm-cluster-state (:storm-cluster-state nimbus)\n            ^INimbus inimbus (:inimbus nimbus)\n            ;; read all the topologies\n            topologies (locking (:submit-lock nimbus) (into {} (for [tid (.active-storms storm-cluster-state)]\n                                  {tid (read-topology-details nimbus tid)})))\n            topologies (Topologies. topologies)\n            ;; read all the assignments\n            assigned-topology-ids (.assignments storm-cluster-state nil)\n            existing-assignments (into {} (for [tid assigned-topology-ids]\n                                            ;; for the topology which wants rebalance (specified by the scratch-topology-id)\n                                            ;; we exclude its assignment, meaning that all the slots occupied by its assignment\n                                            ;; will be treated as free slot in the scheduler code.\n                                            (when (or (nil? scratch-topology-id) (not= tid scratch-topology-id))\n                                              {tid (.assignment-info storm-cluster-state tid nil)})))]`\n","created":"2017-01-17T09:48:34.639+0000","updated":"2017-01-17T09:48:34.639+0000","started":"2017-01-17T09:48:34.639+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"35705","issueId":"13034556"}]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i38ndr:"}}
