GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"GitHub user eshioji opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/568\n\n    [STORM-763] nimbus reassigned worker A to another machine, but other worker's netty client can't connect to the new worker A\n\n    (This PR builds on [STORM-839](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/566), so it includes its changes)\n    \n    While I'm not 100% certain if it's the same issue, I also saw these messages logged a lot (hundreds per second per machine).\n    \n    Upon investigation, I found that after firing a connection request, `Client.Connector` waits synchronously for the connection. Because there is only one scheduler thread per worker by default, this means only one connection request per worker process can be serviced at a time. This becomes a problem when connections are lost frequently for whatever reason, and is especially exacerbated when each connection attempt takes time.\n    \n    Commit `aa5c2d71` changes the code so that the `Connector` fires & forgets the connection request, and lets Netty's callback thread handle the rest. There is no blocking or expensive operation done here, so using Netty's thread should be fine.\n    \n    This change did decrease the amount of ERROR logs in my topology, but I still saw a fair amount. Upon investigation, I found that this is simply because each call to `send` produces an ERROR log. So `ad8112d10` changes the code so that a connection error is exactly logged twice; once when the connection error is detected, and the second time when the re-connection is concluded (either a successful re-connect, or permanent failure).\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/eshioji/storm STORM-763\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/568.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #568\n    \n----\ncommit ed8ab3ec194f19c75fc2f5c000609204f04b50e8\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-28T19:42:05Z\n\n    Simplified the flow and removed the lock that was causing the deadlock\n\ncommit 91b8eb3840432e47b79f40abebec8304627732a8\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-28T19:46:17Z\n\n    Bump version\n\ncommit b7d84bdc7fd3de34f45a94131cdbb6bfbd3763dc\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-28T21:27:31Z\n\n    Remove background flushing because it doesn't seem necessary. Netty's Channel queues up written data on an unbounded buffer. The background flushing seems to have been added to avoid this, but in practice it was probably doing it anyways because flushMessages(), which is called by send() doesn't check for isWritable. Moreover, queuing on an unbounded buffer seems fine because back pressure is provided by MAX_PENDING_TUPLE. If OOME occurs due to this buffer overflowing, it seems reasonable that one has to reduce MAX_PENDING_TUPLE, rather than Storm trying to cope with it by dropping messages.\n\ncommit 679e42bc1e38f51c2759667b03cb45322c6a793b\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-28T21:31:35Z\n\n    Change to a SNAPSHOT version for deployment purposes\n\ncommit 27a92e2aa3488c0203f500306e0583ff9e7e1e82\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-29T09:32:16Z\n\n    Remove (now) dead comment and code\n\ncommit 09bf6e1b5d9d351f2a60cd9a32e0239752cf437a\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-29T10:23:46Z\n\n    Merge branch '0.9.x-branch' into STORM-839\n    \n    Conflicts:\n    \texamples/storm-starter/pom.xml\n    \texternal/storm-hbase/pom.xml\n    \texternal/storm-hdfs/pom.xml\n    \texternal/storm-kafka/pom.xml\n    \tpom.xml\n    \tstorm-buildtools/maven-shade-clojure-transformer/pom.xml\n    \tstorm-core/pom.xml\n    \tstorm-dist/binary/pom.xml\n    \tstorm-dist/source/pom.xml\n\ncommit fdb394c158ccd87c0a06c060239766d666a8db5a\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-29T10:28:20Z\n\n    Accidentally committed generated file\n\ncommit 36eff0a409336d9247ce2e96b52fcf9630a446fb\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-29T10:30:38Z\n\n    Remove dead method\n\ncommit 884f496dcd06bc9413c04fdf730aca2cfb4239c6\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-29T10:32:39Z\n\n    Remove comment line I forgot to remove\n\ncommit aa5c2d719bb3913285d4274cfcf8364df958b1ff\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com>\nDate:   2015-05-29T13:40:47Z\n\n    Do not block in Connector.

With `v0.9.4` it would start to go haywire after several hours and start to consume lots of CPU and a lot of tuples start to fail. That symptom seems to have been alleviated with the patch. However, this topology feeds off a live data stream so admittedly it's not a strict comparison (because the volume of data is not completely the same from run to run). Is there a standard way you guys use to verify performance regression?\n    \n    \n      \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-06-01T15:21:56.771+0000","updated":"2015-06-01T15:21:56.771+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12819248/comment/14567653","id":"14567653","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/568#issuecomment-107654049\n  \n    @eshioji Sounds great.
