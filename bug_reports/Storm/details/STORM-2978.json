Sadly it turns out that this mechanism doesn't extend to external projects that depend on Storm components. While e.g. storm-kafka will use Zookeeper 3.4.6 when built as part of Storm, it will have a transitive dependency on Zookeeper 3.5.3-beta when an external project declares a dependency on storm-kafka.\r\n\r\nA quick google indicates that the \"proper\" way to export the transitive dependency versions to downstream projects would be with a BOM pom, i.e. we'd create a separate BOM project for Storm that exports our DependencyManagement, and users would then import the BOM. I'm not sure if we want to do that on master, but since it is a breaking change I don't think we should do this on 1.x.\r\n\r\nFor 1.x (and maybe master?), we'll have to make sure that Curator dependencies always exclude Zookeeper, and all projects depending on Curator will have to explicitly declare the right Zookeeper dependency version.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"remainingEstimate":"0h","timeSpent":"50m","remainingEstimateSeconds":0,"timeSpentSeconds":3000},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":0,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"The
