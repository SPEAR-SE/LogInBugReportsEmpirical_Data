Inside the map are clojure {persistent maps, symbols, lists, vectors, and sets}  There is also a LocalAssignment (which is a defrecord, that will have a different serialization id if ever modified).  I'm not sure if we want to convert all of this to thrift too?  or if we just want to move LocalAssignment over to be a map.  If we think clojure will not maintain serialized compatability, then we probably want to go to thrift.  If we think that they will maintain compatibility, then we could do something much more simply.\n\nIn our experience at least, when we moved from clojure 1.5 to 1.6 we saw the following errors during rolling upgrade testing (reading in local state).\n\n{code}\njava.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.InvalidClassException: clojure.lang.APersistentVector; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = -2689426146225009349, local class serialVersionUID = 4667575149454420891\n{code}\n\nTo me this means that clojure is not trying to maintain compatability for serialized objects, like vector.  So I personally would rather move to Thrift for the serialization of local state if possible.  I am going to file a new JIRA just for this work, as it is large enough I think it should be separated from this JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-04-08T19:44:09.660+0000","updated":"2015-04-08T19:44:09.660+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12819028/comment/14485883","id":"14485883","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I Filed STORM-765 for changing LocalState.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-04-08T19:47:11.652+0000","updated":"2015-04-08T19:47:11.652+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12819028/comment/14486044","id":"14486044","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=parth.brahmbhatt","name":"parth.brahmbhatt","key":"parth.brahmbhatt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Parth Brahmbhatt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"When I tested the rolling upgrade feature I did not upgrade clojure.
