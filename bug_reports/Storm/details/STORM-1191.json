The code is a bit complex.  When debugging these in the past the tests use simulated time, which is a great thing it lets us run tests that would take a long time very quickly, but to make it work properly there are some critical points where we wait for the simulated cluster to be idle.  Typically we see timeouts happen here, waiting for the entire cluster to stop.  But for some reason on really slow hardware, that I don't totally understand yet, this does not always happen. and increasing the timeout does not always induce it to be in that state.\n    \n    I am +1 on merging this in, but I am not totally sure that it will \"fix\" the problem.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-11-10T14:12:28.092+0000","updated":"2015-11-10T14:12:28.092+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12911578/comment/15000682","id":"15000682","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user knusbaum commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/869#issuecomment-155847070\n  \n    Most all of the spurious test failures I've seen have been *real* failures and not timeouts.\n    I'm okay with this going in, even though I don't like potentially making the build time longer and I'm not optimistic about this fixing any problems. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-11-11T17:02:06.114+0000","updated":"2015-11-11T17:02:06.114+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12911578/comment/15002442","id":"15002442","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/869\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-11-12T17:15:56.934+0000","updated":"2015-11-12T17:15:56.934+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12911578/comment/15002445","id":"15002445","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks [~ashnazg],\n\nI merged this into master.
