With logging enabled, it should be even higher.\n    \n    @arunmahadevan \n    The perf improvement i described here is observed when going from the default value nil to 0 for topology.eventlogger.executors \n    \n    **Topology detail:** 1 spout, 1 bolt, 1 acker. Spout generates random numbers. Bolt does this math on the tuple:  (value+1)*2.    In effect this is just a speed of light topology.\n    \n    The perf hit that i noted is actually due to those very same checking of flag.\n    This checking of flags in clojure turns into very expensive lookups in clojure internals. It internally invokes Java reflection!  If you are thinking 'what the hell'.. then yes that was my reaction too.   \n    \n    Specifically this is the problematic lookup for this code path :  'storm-component->debug-atom' \n    \n    I agree with @arunmahadevan 's  concern that this will confuse the users when they don't see logs after enabling it on the UI. \n    \n    The alternative fix for this is to change the manner in which this flag is made available to the code.

Quite the contrary, i feel, one should have to have a very good justification to leave this turned on.  \n    \n    It is not feasible to do a full fledged Yahoo style benchmark to identify and fix all such issues.

Then the numbers change, and it's not that big a hit.\n    \n    If we release with what we have now, I would leave things as is, and document that there's a performance benefit to turning it off.

After going through the spout it appears that with every emit a new Long is created. \n    `collector.emit(new Values(new Long(rand.nextInt(Integer.MAX_VALUE))), messageCount);`\n    \n    With the spout emitting 400+ Million tuples in 10 mins (the new Long alone eating up 3.2 GB memory), I thought the GC could have distorted the results. So I changed the spout to emit a fixed long value and measured the throughput and heres what I observed.\n    \n    [No

I played around a bit and found a way to show the tooltip on disabled button immediately using the same style as other tooltips. You need to wrap the input element in a span like below,\n    ```javascript\n    <span style=\"display:inline-block;\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" title=\"\" data-original-title=\"To debug set topology.eventlogger.executors to a value > 0 or nil\">\n      <input disabled=\"\" onclick=\"confirmAction('test-topology-1-1459402415', 'test-topology', 'debug/enable', true, 10, 'sampling percentage', 'debug')\" type=\"button\" value=\"Debug\" class=\"btn btn-default\">\n    </span>\n    ```\n    2 . The tooltip is shown even if the button is enabled. You could add the `<span> </span>` only when number of executors is 0, which would take care of this.\n    3 . The tooltip is also shown when the debug button gets disabled after the user clicks on it (when topology.eventlogger.executors > 0). Similar fix as above.\n    4 . The button should be disabled in the spout/bolt pages as well.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-31T07:16:36.893+0000","updated":"2016-03-31T07:16:36.893+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12950732/comment/15220573","id":"15220573","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user roshannaik commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1217#issuecomment-204101205\n  \n    1. I spent sometime trying to see if the tooltip can show up faster. But there is a catch-22 there. The Bootstrap based tooltip mechanism allows it, but the Bootstrap based tooltips wont show up if button is disabled. So had to settle for this mechanism... which has a downside that it doesnt allow customization of color and timing to the best i could check.  The solution you describe here is among one of the alternative I had already tried and it doesn't work.  The tooltip wont show up unless you hover the mouse over the boundary between the enclosing span element and the disabled button.\n    \n    2. & 3.  Although nice to not show tooltip when enabled, I thought its OK to show the tooltip in both enabled/disabled states of the button. Given the desire for quick turn around, i felt it was wise to not pursue implementing/testing this nice to have, but non-critical feature. \n    \n    4. Let me look into that.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-31T19:55:46.926+0000","updated":"2016-03-31T19:55:46.926+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12950732/comment/15220960","id":"15220960","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user roshannaik commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1217#issuecomment-204198533\n  \n    Update: Have  fixes for  pts 1 2,3 & 4 raised by Arun. \n    To support the changes in the component level page would have required a change the thrift spec to add the additional info in the response object.

I think we should remove `loggersTotal != null` so that \"debug\" is enabled if the value is set to `null` since one event logger task is created per worker if the value is set to null. This interpretation of \"null\" is not very intuitive, but its consistent with what \"null\" means with other variables like \"topology.acker.executors\".\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-04-05T17:14:21.868+0000","updated":"2016-04-05T17:14:21.868+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12950732/comment/15226981","id":"15226981","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user roshannaik commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1217#discussion_r58601713\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-core/src/ui/public/js/script.js ---\n    @@ -220,19 +220,21 @@ function topologyActionJson(id, encodedId, name, status, msgTimeout, debug, samp\n         jsonData[\"deactivateStatus\"] = (status === \"ACTIVE\") ? \"enabled\" : \"disabled\";\n         jsonData[\"rebalanceStatus\"] = (status === \"ACTIVE\" || status === \"INACTIVE\" ) ? \"enabled\" : \"disabled\";\n         jsonData[\"killStatus\"] = (status !== \"KILLED\") ? \"enabled\" : \"disabled\";\n    -    jsonData[\"startDebugStatus\"] = (status === \"ACTIVE\" && !debug) ? \"enabled\" : \"disabled\";\n    +    jsonData[\"startDebugStatus\"] = (status === \"ACTIVE\" && loggersTotal!=null && loggersTotal!=0 && !debug) ? \"enabled\" : \"disabled\";\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    Since the intent is to disable event logging by default, we should  disable logging if topology.eventlogger.executors is null   ...  otherwise its confusing.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-04-05T19:36:26.865+0000","updated":"2016-04-05T19:36:26.865+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12950732/comment/15227134","id":"15227134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user roshannaik commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1217#issuecomment-205985587\n  \n    On further thought... i feel it maybe ok to just remove the loggersTotal != null check here.
