To reproduce this bug you should do the following:\n1. Set supervisor.worker.timeout.secs property to e.g. 1;\n2. Create a shell spout (as a standalone application, not Java class) that hangs for more than 1 second and doesn't respond on heartbeat messages, e.g. Thread.Sleep(5000);\n3. After timeout Storm will try to kill the shell spout process with calling die function:\nhttps://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v0.10.0-beta/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/spout/ShellSpout.java#L237\n4. The \"die\" function will call heartBeatExecutorService.shutdownNow() function that raises InterruptedException, which is not caughted by the calling thread. In a result topology stops working properly, however you may see it in ./storm list.\n\nI'm not Java developer and thus I'm not sure whether code below is valid, however it seems to fix the problem:\n\n    private void die(Throwable exception) {\n        heartBeatExecutorService.shutdownNow();\n        try {\n            heartBeatExecutorService.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            LOG.error(\"await catch \", e);\n        }\n\n        _collector.reportError(exception);\n        _process.destroy();\n        System.exit(11);\n    }","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HeartbeatExecutorService issue in Shell Spout\\Bolt","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ohord","name":"ohord","key":"ohord","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Oleh Hordiichuk","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ohord","name":"ohord","key":"ohord","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Oleh Hordiichuk","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":"Alpine Linux 3.2, openjdk-7","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10431","value":"Important","id":"10431"}],"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-1021/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2jlbr:"}}
