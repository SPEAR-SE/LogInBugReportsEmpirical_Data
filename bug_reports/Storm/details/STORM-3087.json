FluxBuilder.canInvokeWithArgs check whether the actu…\n\n    …al argument type is assignable to Number before deciding that a method with a primitive parameter can be invoked\r\n    \r\n    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3087\r\n    \r\n    The added test checks whether Flux throws an IllegalArgumentException because it couldn't find the right method, or because it found the wrong method and tried to call it (in which case the IAE would have a null message).\r\n    \r\n    A more useful example would be trying to use code like this:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    public MyClass(String s){}\r\n    public MyClass(long l){}\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Using a topology definition that tries to invoke the String-typed constructor, Flux will sometimes erroneously pick the long-type constructor instead. The test is the way it is because trying to test an example like this will inherently be flaky, since the order Flux encounters methods in is random.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git
