I was off for the last few days and hence just getting back into this, although a bit too late because the patch just got merged before I got the chance to respond. \r\n    \r\n    @erikdw the fundamental reason behind squashing all the commits is sanity. The main challenge when the branches diverge is to track down what happened. The same happens when cherry-picking changes across branches. In Storm this is very hard because Storm's Git log does not have a well​ defined structure, does not have one commit per JIRA, and contributors don't always squash their commits. As an illustration I am adding a the output of \"git log\" for Storm, Kafka, Spark, Hbase, Flink, and Apex. The difference is notorious. Every other project has a clean, consistent, Git log, which makes it very easy to understand and track down what happened. Furthermore, it makes it also very easy to write git hooks to automate all sorts of tasks to merge and track down what happens cross branches, for example, helping users that have their own private distribution which gets synced with Apache from time to time (I face such tasks periodically and understand how much easier it would be if had a clean git log).\r\n    \r\n    One could argue one way or another. However, a fact is that all of the aforementioned mainstream Apache projects follow one commit per JIRA (with the exception of having perhaps a consistent token such as MINOR), and commits always squashed. In my opinion we should do so as well with absolutely no exceptions. The extra effort to do this is minimal, and the benefits are immense. I have proposed this a few times before, but for some reason it has never been agreed upon or even warranted a lengthy discussion (which honestly is hard for me to understand why).\r\n    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10284328/34959386-299e7800-f9eb-11e7-99a5-9b18022e6665.png)\r\n\n","created":"2018-01-15T20:07:44.531+0000","updated":"2018-01-15T20:07:44.531+0000","started":"2018-01-15T20:07:44.527+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"66225","issueId":"13129779"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13129779/worklog/66230","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user srdo commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2512\n  \n    @hmcl I'd raise the discussion on the mailing list, then see if there's at least a lazy consensus. It seems likely to me that a discussion about this will peter out quickly, since some people probably won't care too much, but I think you only need for no one to object to a squash-all policy.
