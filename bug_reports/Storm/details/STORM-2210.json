E.g. choices.get(size - 3). Shuffling the array first could cause this thread to get the post-shuffle value instead of the pre-shuffle value.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/kevpeek/storm STORM-2210\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1790.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #1790\n    \n----\ncommit 980af8083aaf185fad3db476dd765abe4ea9cda4\nAuthor: Kevin Peek <kpeek@salesforce.com>\nDate:   2016-11-21T18:53:33Z\n\n    remove array shuffle from ShuffleGrouping when counter resets to zero\n\n----\n","created":"2016-11-21T19:07:15.137+0000","updated":"2016-11-21T19:07:15.137+0000","started":"2016-11-21T19:07:15.136+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"32284","issueId":"13022254"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022254/worklog/32287","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user revans2 commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1790\n  \n    I keep beating my head against this to think if there are issues with this, but I honestly don't see any.  Long term I would like to see more of a combining of shuffle grouping and the shuffle or local grouping so that it favors local when possible, but when overloaded it starts to send tuples elsewhere.  But until then I think this is fine.  +1\n","created":"2016-11-21T19:58:14.774+0000","updated":"2016-11-21T19:58:14.774+0000","started":"2016-11-21T19:58:14.773+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"32287","issueId":"13022254"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022254/worklog/32288","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user revans2 commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1790#discussion_r88975651\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/grouping/ShuffleGrouping.java ---\n    @@ -17,17 +17,13 @@\n      */\n     package org.apache.storm.grouping;\n     \n    -import java.io.Serializable;\n    -import java.util.ArrayList;\n    -import java.util.Arrays;\n    -import java.util.Collections;\n    -import java.util.List;\n    -import java.util.Random;\n    -import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;\n    -\n     import org.apache.storm.generated.GlobalStreamId;\n     import org.apache.storm.task.WorkerTopologyContext;\n     \n    +import java.io.Serializable;\n    +import java.util.*;\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    nit: we usually discourage widcard imports.

They provide uniform distribution.\n    \n    Regarding stable version, personally I had been thinking v1.0.2 is fairly stable since we fixed numerous issues on v1.0.1 and v1.0.2, and after v1.0.2 there're no performance-affecting critical bugs reported before this one.\n    \n    Below links point the issues for next bugfix (v1.0.3) and next minor (v1.1.0):\n    * v1.0.3: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20%3D%201.0.3%20AND%20project%20%3D%20STORM%20order%20by%20priority\n    \n    * v1.1.0: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20%3D%201.1.0%20AND%20fixVersion%20not%20in%20(1.0.0%2C%201.0.1%2C%201.0.2)%20AND%20project%20%3D%20STORM%20order%20by%20priority\n    \n    There's no 'completely stable' in every projects since we're adding the code anyway and no one ensure there's no bug on that version.

Opinions are completely on my own.\n    \n    To be honest, I'm not a big fan of test coverage for such a complicated thing. What we call 'critical' is often from race condition, and I'm not sure these things can be covered from tests. I agree that testable things should have tests so always good to have tests, but there're still edge cases.\n    \n    We have Travis CI for checking the unit tests and some integration tests. We're manually testing the patch before checking in unless there's a small change so don't need to be tested. Basic manual tests are done while voting for release. Two things we don't have are automatic system tests and automatic performance tests, as it's very hard to get stable result automatically, and also we don't have INFRA to construct.\n    \n    Along with Apache Storm community, there're enterprise customers as well and I guess service vendors are fixing reported bugs fast and these are also contributed to Apache Storm as well. More eyes and more early adopters can greatly increase project's health.\n","created":"2016-11-23T00:29:03.489+0000","updated":"2016-11-23T00:29:03.489+0000","started":"2016-11-23T00:29:03.489+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"32342","issueId":"13022254"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022254/worklog/32343","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user Crim commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1790\n  \n    I feel you, tests can't cover everything.
