This is very similar to what we are doing with the batching code.  Each disruptor queue has a dedicated Timer thread that sleeps for 1ms and then tries to flush anything in the batch.  Each bolt/spout instance has 2 disruptor queues so having 100 bolt/spout instances on a single box will result in 50% of the CPU, in this case, going to sleeping.

We are using a single timer thread for all of the system metrics to be able to do something similar, but there is no possibility of them blocking.  It is all atomic memory operations when the timer goes off so having a single thread shared between them is not a big deal.\n    \n    With the disruptor queue if the queue is full the thread will block trying to flush the messages.  This could be a very long period of time.  This is why I went with the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.  The problem here is that it has no way to spin up new threads under load or tear them down when idle.  I could spend some time and build my own, but this seems to solve a lot, but not all of the load problem.\n    \n    I am going to try and spend some time to create something that can do all of that, but it is not something I can put together in a few hours and expect it to work.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-11-10T14:29:30.371+0000","updated":"2015-11-10T14:29:30.371+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12911409/comment/14998783","id":"14998783","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user danielschonfeld commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/870#issuecomment-155458973\n  \n    @revans2 can you explain the load problem to me again please? is the problem here the fact that we have so many threads in a sleeping state? meaning that cutting the amount of those will result in a total performance gain? or is there another problem at play here?\n    \n    Also if I wrote code, how can I test it?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-11-10T15:47:04.589+0000","updated":"2015-11-10T15:47:04.589+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12911409/comment/14998848","id":"14998848","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/870#issuecomment-155471398\n  \n    @danielschonfeld I don't know 100% what the cause of the issue is, but I suspect that it is having lots of threads trying to sleep very frequently.\n    \n    ```storm jar ./examples/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-0.11.0-SNAPSHOT.jar storm.starter.ThroughputVsLatency 100 1 5```\n    \n    is the test that I have been using.

Especially Daniel Schonfeld who proposed the final solution.  The new CPU utilization should be just slightly higher then it was without batching.\n\nOn a happy side note this reduced the CPU utilization everywhere with batching so now with all of the performance changes that have gone in I can run a 2 worker ThroughputVsLatency topology at 43,000 sentences per second on my MBP, with a max spout pending of 100 and Automatic Back Pressure off.  I don't have an apples to apples comparison with before this change.  Because it looks like ABP was limiting things to about 35,000 sentences per second.  Either way we are running a lot better then we were before where we would max out at about 6,500 sentences per second.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-11-13T16:26:35.600+0000","updated":"2015-11-13T16:26:35.600+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12911409/comment/15005628","id":"15005628","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=danielschonfeld","name":"danielschonfeld","key":"danielschonfeld","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel Schonfeld","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thank you [~revans2]!!
