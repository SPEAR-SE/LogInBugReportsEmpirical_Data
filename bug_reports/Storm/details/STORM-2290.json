There is an issue for it here:\n[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1576]\nThis issue has been resolved in the version 3.5.x branch of Zookeeper.  However, after 2.5 years and 3 releases the 3.5.x branch of Zookeeper is still in Alpha :-(.\n \nDespite the fact that it is in alpha, there is a branch of Curator (v.3.x.x) that uses it, but Storm uses Curator version 2.x.x – possibly because it doesn’t rely on alpha code.  So the bug is still unpatched in Storm.\n\nI realise that an upgrade to alpha code may be too much of a risk, but this problem is a serious issue for those running Storm on AWS (and presumably other cloud providers) - so perhaps it may be worth considering?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amilbourne","name":"amilbourne","key":"amilbourne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Anthony Milbourne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-02-23T16:59:28.365+0000","updated":"2017-02-23T16:59:28.365+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13034954/comment/15888906","id":"15888906","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kabhwan","name":"kabhwan","key":"kabhwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jungtaek Lim","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"body":"ZOOKEEPER-1576 fixed client side so worth to consider version bump, but ZOOKEEPER-1506 fixed server side so might not need to bump if ZK 3.4.9 server is compatible with ZK 3.4.6 client. \n\n[~sachingoyal]\nCould you only replace your ZK server to 3.4.9 and reproduce?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kabhwan","name":"kabhwan","key":"kabhwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jungtaek Lim","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"created":"2017-02-28T21:36:57.341+0000","updated":"2017-02-28T21:36:57.341+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13034954/comment/15889824","id":"15889824","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amilbourne","name":"amilbourne","key":"amilbourne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Anthony Milbourne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"We are currently using Zookeeper server 3.4.8, which includes the ZOOKEEPER-1506 fix.
