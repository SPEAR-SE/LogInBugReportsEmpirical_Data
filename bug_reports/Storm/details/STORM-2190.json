I fixed the race condition and I addressed the review comments, but I also put in some optimizations to storm submitter.  We were literally calling getClusterInfo 3+ times for each topology submission, and because the ultimate goal of STORM-2190 is to make it more scalable this helps a lot.  There is still some lock contention, but it is much better then it was before.\n    \n    If things look good here I will backport the changes to my other pull request.\n","created":"2016-12-02T21:34:41.626+0000","updated":"2016-12-02T21:34:41.626+0000","started":"2016-12-02T21:34:41.624+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"32830","issueId":"13019018"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13019018/worklog/32833","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user ptgoetz commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1764\n  \n    +1\n","created":"2016-12-02T22:31:21.492+0000","updated":"2016-12-02T22:31:21.492+0000","started":"2016-12-02T22:31:21.491+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"32833","issueId":"13019018"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13019018/worklog/32846","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1764\n  \n    +1.
