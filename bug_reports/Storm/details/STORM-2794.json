But we have some clusters that we need to migrate off of 0.10 so we are going to make this work, at least in the short term.  When we are done migrating we are happy to have a follow on JIRA to rip out the 0.10 support.\r\n    \r\n    Also I am not too concerned about missing things because we really only need configs that are topology configs that have class names in them that are read by either nimbus or the supervisor.  There are really almost no configs where we do this, because there are security concerns when we do this.  I could be wrong, but I think it is manageable.  If you still feel like it is too much of a burden, I don't have a problem with us just doing it internally.\n","created":"2017-11-06T18:58:16.816+0000","updated":"2017-11-06T18:58:16.816+0000","started":"2017-11-06T18:58:16.814+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"56375","issueId":"13113425"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13113425/worklog/56388","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2397\n  \n    @revans2 \r\n    My intention is forcing users to migrate their Storm version to at least 1.x when we release Storm 2.0.0.
