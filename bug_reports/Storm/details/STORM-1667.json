When any of those methods is changed to throw some other `Exception` then this code should also be changed to handle that, otherwise this code would throw that Exception and get into unexpected scenarios. That may be the reason why `Exception` is caught in earlier code.\n    \n     \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-31T15:49:29.376+0000","updated":"2016-03-31T15:49:29.376+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12954752/comment/15220099","id":"15220099","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user zhuoliu commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1280#discussion_r58081089\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj ---\n    @@ -296,11 +293,15 @@\n             (worker-launcher-and-wait conf user [\"signal\" pid \"9\"] :log-prefix (str \"kill -9 \" pid))\n             (force-kill-process pid))\n           (if as-user\n    -        (rmr-as-user conf id (worker-pid-path conf id pid))\n             (try\n    +          (rmr-as-user conf id (worker-pid-path conf id pid))\n               (rmpath (worker-pid-path conf id pid))\n               (rmpath (worker-tmp-root conf id pid))\n    -          (catch Exception e)))) ;; on windows, the supervisor may still holds the lock on the worker directory\n    +          (catch IOException e\n    +            (log-warn-error e \"Failed to cleanup pid dir: \" pid \" for worker \" id\".

It would be the responsibility of the one who added new code to catch other possible exception, or they may prefer to not catch and let it fail fast upon specific scenario. \n    But for now, since there is any non-deterministic exception might be thrown in Windows environment, we may still ignore all types of exception, which might also be why the previous code did this way (\"catch Exception\").\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF
