When the topology was redeployed with less workers, it did not cause nimbus to fail.\n\nProbably what's happening is nimbus is trying to create a zknode that is larger than 1MB which is the default max size for a zk node.\n\nOne solution is to increase this threshold in zookeeper to a larger value than 1MB.\n\n\n---------\nd2r: This is exactly what we had to do. We did it by setting jute.maxbuffer property to some higher power of 2.\n\nI think it happened to us because we launched > 12k workers and all of the assignments were serialized at once and written to a zk node at once, and this constantly exceeded the 1MB buffer. I think we ended up using jute.maxbuffer=4097150.\n\nEDIT: Should also note that workers/supervisor read this zk node after it is written, and the same buffer issue applies. So the childopts for supervisors and workers need to be set in the same manner in addition to nimbus.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"364094","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Deploying topology with 540 workers caused nimbus to crash.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-109/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1qpg7:"}}
