Run a topology with large num of executors.\n    2. When a small number of tuples, CPU usage becomes abnormally high.\n    \n    ### Reason\n    1. Most threads wait at\n    \n    \t```\n    com.lmax.disruptor.BlockingWaitStrategy.waitFor(long, com.lmax.disruptor.Sequence, com.lmax.disruptor.Sequence[], com.lmax.disruptor.SequenceBarrier, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)\n    ```\n    2. When there are few tuple transfered, most of executors block on DisruptorQueue.consumeBatchWhenAvailable method.\n    \n    \t```\n    final long availableSequence = _barrier.waitFor(nextSequence, 10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n    ```\n        When bolt num is large, since timeout is 10ms, there will be frequently switching thread context lead to abnormally high CPU utilization.\n    \t\t\n    ### Fix\n    1. Change the timeout value from 10ms to 1000ms.\n    \t\n    ### Test\n    1. ENV\n    \t+ Storm 0.9.3\n    \t+ CPU (E5620, 8 core, 2.40GHz)\n            + Centos 6.5, kernel 3.10.5-3.el6.x86_64\n    \t+ Word counter topology, change spout sleep time from 100ms to 10s and num of counter bolt from 12 to 500.\n    2. DisruptorQueue wait time 10ms\n    \t+ 28% CPU usage, %13 user, %15 sys \n     3. DisruptorQueue wait time 1000ms\n     \t+ 5% CPU usage, %3 user, %2 sys\n    4. Execution latency do not increase.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/errordaiwa/storm STORM-929\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/625.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #625\n    \n----\ncommit 5141440bbd267ca954b19b990b77781b7795bd7b\nAuthor: errordaiwa <xingyusu@outlook.com>\nDate:   2015-07-09T02:40:20Z\n\n    fix issue of high cpu usage when bolt idle\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-07-09T03:36:19.474+0000","updated":"2015-07-09T03:36:19.474+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12843548/comment/14619865","id":"14619865","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/625#issuecomment-119812763\n  \n    @errordaiwa \n    Could you change issue number to STORM-503 from PR? \n    I just closed STORM-929 as duplicated.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-07-09T04:24:56.351+0000","updated":"2015-07-09T04:24:56.351+0000"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-929/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2gzzj:"}}
