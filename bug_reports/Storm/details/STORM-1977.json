But the process BlobStore is behind is Nimbus, which is designed to fail-fast, which I think is just not same way.\n    \n    For example, suppose the scenario what I addressed from STORM-1977.\n    \n    Tested with the scenario I've described from STORM-1977\n    \n    1. comment cleanup-corrupt-topologies! from nimbus.clj (It's a quick workaround for resolving STORM-1976), and patch Storm cluster\n    2.

Launch Nimbus 2 from different node\n    \n    Without having condition for granting leadership, Nimbus 2 can grant leadership, and act as leader. This is not a blocker for BlobStore's view, since replication count for topology1 is 0 but it doesn't make them crashed, and reviving Nimbus 1 should eventually replicate topology 1 to Nimbus 2.\n    The thing is, leader nimbus should do the own work as Nimbus. In this case just requesting getClusterInfo can make Nimbus 2 crashed, and Nimbus 1 comes in later and gain leadership, but replication count for topology1 is still 1 until Nimbus 2 comes in.\n    \n    With having condition for granting leadership, Nimbus 2 gives up leadership, and continuously waits for new leader. (No leader at that time) And Nimbus 1 comes in, and topology1 is eventually replicated to Nimbus 2 to ensure replication count.\n    \n    Due to this behavior, the crash and recovery scenario heavily depends on sequence of launching Nimbuses.

I just don't think that this is the final solution for the local blobstore+nimbus, nor do I think that either is a blocker.   The reality is if I use HDFS as the backing for the blobstore and I only set it to have a single replica, then I lose a datanode, nimbus will still crash in almost exactly the same way.  Is this a bug in nimbus?  Is it a bug in the blobstore or HDFS? I would say no. It is user error because the user is trying to make something HA without configuring it properly. Then when an error happens we cannot recover.  So the question is, if it does happen is it better for nimbus to crash or is it better for nimbus to hang?  Because all this does is it switches from one to the other.  I can see advantages for hanging over crashing, so I am OK with this fix.\n    \n    Does the blobstore code have bugs in it and things that we can change to make it work better? I would expect it to, it is software after all.  I just want us to spend some time thinking about how we really want it to behave and fix it properly.  If that proper fix comes after making a few patches to improve things, that is fine.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-07-18T16:02:51.011+0000","updated":"2016-07-18T16:02:51.011+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12990169/comment/15383134","id":"15383134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user harshach commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1574\n  \n    +1.

But it doesn't help from machine failure, and moving Nimbus to other machine requires at least configuration change of whole cluster. (This assumes that Supervisor is also supervised by aux. process. If not starting Supervisor should be done manually.)\n    - Nimbus H/A came in. It was relatively easier than other process on other project since Nimbus is designed as stateless so no need to sync. Only thing Nimbuses should sync up is topology code, and Nimbus H/A tried to address this by full replications and restriction of becoming leader. It made some overhead trying to replicate topology codes to all of Nimbuses but it was a best try to achieve higher availability. When other nimbuses crashed but only one 'leader' nimbus was alive, that was completely OK for that moment. There was a chance for all alive nimbuses not having complete set of topology code thus no leader and hang, but it was relatively smaller than counting replication count since it was doing full replication at all.\n    - BlobStore came in. I don't know the details of BlobStore so hard to tell. I'd be happy if you fill out this : After BlobStore.\n    \n    One thing I'm concerning is, there's new requirement for Nimbus to not easily crashed since every Nimbuses are also replica of BlobStore like DataNode, but Nimbus itself has lots of works to do (sure for leader, and not sure for followers) and it is still based on fail-fast. Is it OK to play together?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-07-19T00:15:23.138+0000","updated":"2016-07-19T00:15:23.138+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12990169/comment/15383386","id":"15383386","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1574\n  \n    @revans2 \n    Let me back to code change.

It tries to replicate all of the blobs to all of the nimbus nodes as quickly as possible.  It stores the metadata for each blob in ZK, just like the original nimbus HA code.  The big difference is that it can store a general set of blobs and they are all versioned so you can upload a new one, and if you ask for a blob that is not currently local on that nimbus it will speed up they sync process and go grab it from another nimbus instance for you.\n    \n    There is still a race, like with nimbus HA where it may not have fully replicated, but if you set the replication count when the blob is uploaded it should be waiting for the replication to complete before declaring success.\n    \n    The one bug I saw while going through the code is that when we list keys, we are doing it only from the local storage, not form ZK.  If we were doing it from ZK then when someone asks for all of the keys they would be guaranteed to get all of the keys, but this patch would do no good. Simply because it would not have an API to know what is local and what is not local.  In the short term I think this is OK, but long term we need to discuss how we really want all of this to work in the different failure cases.\n    \n    When configured to use HDFS as the backing, all of the \"blobs\" are stored in HDFS.  We do a directory listing to get the key listing.  With that nimbus truly becomes stateless, and you can stand up a nimbus on a different node and not have to worry about it.  This code would simply do the directory listing and then become a noop.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-07-19T13:49:13.171+0000","updated":"2016-07-19T13:49:13.171+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12990169/comment/15384271","id":"15384271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1574\n  \n    @revans2 \n    I might be wrong with explaining my patch.

If we were doing it from ZK then when someone asks for all of the keys they would be guaranteed to get all of the keys, but this patch would do no good. Simply because it would not have an API to know what is local and what is not local. In the short term I think this is OK, but long term we need to discuss how we really want all of this to work in the different failure cases.\n    \n    I think the one bug you stated is about BlobStore, right? Because `code-ids` just uses exposed BlobStore API, so underlying mechanism shouldn't be affected to its behavior. And achieving abstraction for BlobStore, like we pull a file from HDFS and expect pull will be succeed if there's at least one replica serving that file, when we use local BlobStore and pull blob which is not available for this nimbus, it should pull from another nimbus automatically without waiting for nimbus to next sync up cycle.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-07-19T15:01:57.346+0000","updated":"2016-07-19T15:01:57.346+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12990169/comment/15384307","id":"15384307","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user revans2 commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1574\n  \n    @HeartSaVioR yes there is no bug with this code.

If we address only 1) it will break this patch and go back to now.\n    \n    Suppose both things are achieved, we would like to have nimbus giving up leadership rather than crash when we have zero replication count on one of topologies code in blobstore.
