In this jira my goal is to add a few topologies for perf testing... not to create a benchmarking tool/framework itself. In that sense its not conflicting with STORM-642. \n\n*side note:* If we are adding a benchmarking framework, it would be good if it can run standard Storm topologies directly and not require topologies to be written specifically for it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=roshan_naik","name":"roshan_naik","key":"roshan_naik","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Roshan Naik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-10T23:14:37.125+0000","updated":"2016-05-10T23:14:37.125+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12966402/comment/15280160","id":"15280160","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I would love to see more performance tests/topologies in storm.  I wrote one https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/ThroughputVsLatency.java but it is just a word count topology, and it requires acking to be enabled for it to work properly.  We also did a storm benchmark as part of https://github.com/yahoo/streaming-benchmarks.  And then there is the https://github.com/yahoo/storm-perf-test which is outdated, and too many people use it to test the general performance of storm instead of using it as stress test on the messaging layer, which is the only thing it is really good at.\n\nI think ThroughputVsLatency is the correct model that we want to follow for these types of tests.  Trying to capture the processing latency at a given throughput.  It can easily be adapted to other topologies, and with a small amount of work should be able to support an OK measure of latency without the need for acking, assuming that the clocks among the different nodes are close to being in sync with one another. The intel benchmarks are great in their diversity of workloads, but I would also like to see something that is more real world too.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-05-11T14:03:00.003+0000","updated":"2016-05-11T14:03:00.003+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12966402/comment/15288091","id":"15288091","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mauzhang","name":"mauzhang","key":"mauzhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Manu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Thanks, very good suggestions.

Also some of these have been used to publish these benchmarks : https://hortonworks.com/blog/microbenchmarking-storm-1-0-performance/ \n    \n    Some topos measure purely the internal functioning of Storm, while others measure I/O with external systems like Kafka and Hdfs. Topologies of the former type can be used for both:\n    \n     - Profiling speed within the IDE using profilers like JProfiler.\n     - Benchmarking on a cluster\n    \n    The topos which measure how fast you can do I/O with Kafka/Hdfs ... are intended for running on cluster and not designed for profiling within IDE.\n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/roshannaik/storm STORM-1772\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1960.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #1960\n    \n----\ncommit 809188b4be9dbb5a09c2c9dc2298f19bfe46e5a6\nAuthor: Roshan Naik <roshan@hw13642.hsd1.ca.comcast.net>\nDate:   2017-02-22T20:05:08Z\n\n    STORM-1772 Adding top level storm-perf module with perf topos\n\n----\n","created":"2017-02-22T20:21:04.344+0000","updated":"2017-02-22T20:21:04.344+0000","started":"2017-02-22T20:21:04.344+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"37521","issueId":"12966402"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12966402/worklog/37522","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user roshannaik commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1960\n  \n    Wanted to give credit the authors of Intel benchmark :\n    https://github.com/intel-hadoop/storm-benchmark  \n    from where I borrowed (with modification) the code to collect and compute metrics.\n","created":"2017-02-22T20:24:44.671+0000","updated":"2017-02-22T20:24:44.671+0000","started":"2017-02-22T20:24:44.670+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"37522","issueId":"12966402"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12966402/worklog/37763","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user harshach commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1960\n  \n    @roshannaik looks good to me.
