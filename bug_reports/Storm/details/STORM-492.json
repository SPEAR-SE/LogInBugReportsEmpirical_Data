\n    1. tracked-wait function's usage is equivalent to previous. It's just a bug fix.\n    2. We can just add an additional parameter 'timeout-ms' while calling Testing.trackedWait()\n    \n    Previous usage is below\n    ```\n    (tracked-wait tracked 1)\n    (Testing/trackedWait tracked (int 1))\n    ```\n    \n    We can just add a parameter (3rd parameter) to specify timeout-ms.\n    \n    Please let me know if you feel I misunderstood your question.

I've rethought about it and it could be good to expose TEST-TIMEOUT-MS because there're various development environments which may take more time to process.\n    In addition, developer can present 3rd parameter from tracked-wait to multiple of TEST-TIMEOUT-MS, which can be flexible than current.\n    I cannot think system env. before you mentioned.

Environment variable can not be set in code. But property can be set.\n    ```\n    System.setProperty(\"stormTestTimeoutMs\",\"5001\")\n    ```\n    It was not for customising  that value on console which is passing `-DstormTestTimeoutMs=5001` parameter.\n    \n    Are you sure, you tested it well.

Because it is in `testing.clj` and my project is probably using `testing4j.clj`. I looked to all code in `testing4j.clj` there is no access to `wait-until-cluster-waiting`. I think there is no need to access that function neihter. \n    \n    I invoke `complete-topology`. I see the function takes `timeout-ms` parameter. It can be given as parameter. But as I mentioned above, I am using testing4j.clj result and the `complete-topology` function in `testing4j.clj`, does not accept `timeout-ms` parameter. Please check it in `testing4j.clj`. \n    \n    So there is only way left I can see, `TEST_TIMEOUT_MS` variable should also be fed by system property. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-11-24T10:13:08.032+0000","updated":"2014-11-24T10:13:08.032+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12739991/comment/14222864","id":"14222864","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/316#issuecomment-64175854\n  \n    @javrasya I added trackedWait to have timeout-ms as parameter, but not completeTopology.\n    Then we should add a parameter to completeTopology & complete-topology to make it work.\n    In JVM we can pass a parameter.
