@abhishekagarwal87 \n    Vote for releasing 0.9.6 and 0.10.0 is in progress.\n    I heard from @ptgoetz that Storm 0.9.x line will be faded out, so I'm expecting non-critical bugs cannot trigger new release of 0.9.x line.\n    So if you're affecting STORM-1027 and willing to resolve it ASAP using official release, using 0.10.0 will be fastest way to do it.\n    I can merge it to 0.9.x line, but I can't say when to release, so I'm curious that this should be backported.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF
