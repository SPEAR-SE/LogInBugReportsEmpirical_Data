Taking Satish's approach is a little more work since we will have to change the bolts that actually process the tick tuples to separate out onProcess and onTickTuple logic. But i think its worth. @dossett I did not exactly get the problem with exceptions. Can't we have a catch all and rethrow as a RuntimeException?\n","created":"2017-02-28T19:10:49.392+0000","updated":"2017-02-28T19:10:49.392+0000","started":"2017-02-28T19:10:49.391+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"37948","issueId":"13046892"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13046892/worklog/37958","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1978#discussion_r103552195\n  \n    --- Diff: external/storm-druid/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/druid/bolt/DruidBeamBolt.java ---\n    @@ -76,30 +77,33 @@ public void prepare(Map stormConf, TopologyContext context, OutputCollector coll\n     \n         @Override\n         public void execute(final Tuple tuple) {\n    -      Future future = tranquilizer.send((druidEventMapper.getEvent(tuple)));\n    -        LOG.debug(\"Sent tuple : [{}]\" , tuple);\n    +        if (TupleUtils.isTick(tuple)) {\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    @satishd \n    Make sense.\n    About class name I don't see good name for that.
