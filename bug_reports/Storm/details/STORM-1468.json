this.  Not having 2 copies is good and a lot better then what we have now, but I really would prefer to see a hybrid approach.  Some documentation is really tied to a release.  The REST API for example, where as other documentation is not, the list of contributors and users for example.  I really would prefer to see what I see on other sites, which is some common things but they point into release specific sections that are generated from the release branch, and are obviously tied to a release.\n    \n    We could also use symlinks to denote stable releases vs releases that are no longer
