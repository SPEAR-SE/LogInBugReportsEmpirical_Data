If the timing is really bad, it might ignore all the partitions and never restart.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, Kafka doesn't update leader and brokerinfo atomically, so it's possible to get unlucky and hit the NoNodeException when a broker has just died.\n\nI have a few suggestions for dealing with this. \n\ngetBrokerInfo could simply retry the inner loop over partitions if it gets the NoNodeException (probably with a limit and a short sleep between attempts). If it fails repeatedly, the spout should be crashed.\n\nAlternatively the DynamicBrokersReader could instead lookup all brokers in Zookeeper, create a consumer and send a TopicMetadataRequest on it. The response contains the leader for each partition and host/port for the relevant brokers.\n\nEdit: I noticed that the spout periodically refreshes the brokers info, so the issue isn't as bad as I thought.

As a side effect, it may give more informative error logs when the metadata API returns errors, than being told that a node in Zookeeper is missing.\n    \n    Yes, the RuntimeExceptions will crash the worker. I put them in before realizing that refresh was called periodically. I could replace them with error logs?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-05-18T10:57:53.137+0000","updated":"2016-05-18T10:57:53.137+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12955821/comment/15569464","id":"15569464","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Srdo","name":"Srdo","key":"srdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stig Rohde Døssing","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Copenhagen"},"body":"We misidentified the cause of our topologies hanging as this issue when it was actually caused by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1750.
