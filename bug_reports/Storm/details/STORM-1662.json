@arunmahadevan \n    I've just done with performance test, and the result is a bit different what I expected.\n    \n    ![eventlogger-performance-test-storm-1662-graph](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1317309/14170745/35b77144-f76a-11e5-8fb7-22b959e7fcf0.png)\n    \n    This patch affects the performance even though event logger is set to 0 thought I can't understand the result.\n    This performance test is done with your topology + modification for logging performance.\n    (https://gist.github.com/HeartSaVioR/0e2555633a5f7d12cb68)\n    I restarted all Storm processes for every test.\n    \n    [eventlogger-performance-test-STORM-1662-excel.xlsx](https://github.com/apache/storm/files/197260/eventlogger-performance-test-STORM-1662-excel.xlsx)\n    \n    Since test is done with my dev. machine (MBP), I really would like to borrow a dedicated machine and try this performance test again.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF

result, sorry I changed my vote to +0 for now.\n    I think we should make the test result stable before taking any actions.\n    \n    - test several times and take average or mean\n    - test longer\n    - test with dedicated (idle, not dev., no GUI) machine\n    \n    If we can get the stable result before releasing 1.0.0 is in progress, we can include this as 1.0.0. But it shouldn't block releasing 1.0.0.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-31T09:21:45.177+0000","updated":"2016-03-31T09:21:45.177+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-1662/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2vbov:"}}
