shutting down the context we could be sure that all ongoing connections were also terminated as cleanly as possible.  After this change that is only true for the server side and not the client side.\r\n    \r\n    What are the ramifications of that?  I think it was just defensive programming so it is probably fine to make this change from that perspective, but I would to make sure that my understanding of the problem matches yours.\r\n    \r\n    From the comments in STORM-3055 the error appears to be triggered when a supervisor is shut down, wiped clean (so it gets a new supervisor id), and then brought back up.  At that point nimbus schedules the worker on the same node/slot as before, but with a new supervisor ID.  This confuses the connection caching because when updating the connections it gets a list of connections to shut down and a separate list of connections to create.  The new connections are created, but in this case a new one is not created because we already have it open.  Then the old unneeded connections are torn down, but in this case the connection is needed.\r\n    \r\n    Looking at the javadocs for IContext. It looks like the caching really does violate the spec, but it is a bit of a gray area.\r\n    \r\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/53f38bc31f2fd315a520ba6b86c0a60be08381cc/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/messaging/IContext.java#L48-L57\r\n    \r\n    I am fine with removing the caching like this JIRA does, but I do want to see the code cleaned up, because without the caching there is a lot of extra code that can be removed.\n","created":"2018-05-14T18:36:09.522+0000","updated":"2018-05-14T18:36:09.522+0000","started":"2018-05-14T18:36:09.521+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"101825","issueId":"13156499"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13156499/worklog/101827","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user revans2 commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2669#discussion_r188055495\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/messaging/netty/Client.java ---\n    @@ -451,7 +451,6 @@ public int getPort() {\n         public void close() {\n             if (!closing) {\n                 LOG.info(\"closing Netty Client {}\", dstAddressPrefixedName);\n    -            context.removeClient(dstHost, dstAddress.getPort());\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    This line is the only reason to pass context into the Client.
