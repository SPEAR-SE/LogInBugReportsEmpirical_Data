The spout is getting down randomly at sometime and not runs continuously for every 5 minutes.\n2. The bolts (Trident Function) that receives the data from the Spout goes down randomly and hence missing the continuity / data.\n\nFor example, when the spout picked up 5 events and goes to sleep, the VCMigrator in this example process 2 events and goes down, there are no traces in log. Sometimes none of the events are processed by the bolt and no traces are found in log. We could not see any log related to this bolt after it goes down. This happens for all the realtime topologies that we run and not only with one.\n\nThis runs perfect in the version 0.8.2 and is creating problem in 0.9.0.1 and 0.9.1.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"388535","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Realtime Topologies Time interval ","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mksasi","name":"mksasi","key":"mksasi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sasikumar","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mksasi","name":"mksasi","key":"mksasi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sasikumar","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":"CentOS, 1 Nimbus and 3 Supervisor","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-293/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1uvvr:"}}
