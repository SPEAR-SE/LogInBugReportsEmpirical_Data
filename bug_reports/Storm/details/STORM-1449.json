in to an issue where this fix does not work. Correct me if i am wrong. But a fat storm jar that is compiled with older version of storm-kafka will still use byte[] and the newer version of storm now uses ByteBuffer. Hence it throws an exception at runtime if storm is upgraded. I think upgrade of storm should still work with older topology jars. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-01-14T08:59:43.691+0000","updated":"2016-01-14T08:59:43.691+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12928283/comment/15107372","id":"15107372","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/994#issuecomment-172976476\n  \n    @priyank5485 you are correct.  I didn't look into this in great detail until now.  What is more if you submit using an old client you will get deserialization errors too, because the SerialId is not set.\n    \n    STORM-1220 seems to fundamentally not be able to maintain that backwards compatibility.  So now the question is are the benefits of STORM-1220 worth the incompatibility?
