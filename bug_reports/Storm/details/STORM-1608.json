Will the state be messed up?  will we process things incorrectly?  Why do we even care if someone is OK with dropping tuples?\n    \n    What exactly is the contract that we have made between the bolts and the state checkpoint system?  Because this changes that contract, but I don't see any corresponding documentation change.\n    \n    What about the use case where someone does not ack a tuple, because they didn't expect it to be tracked, especially because we auto-anchored it for them in a previous bolt?\n    \n    Auto-anchoring feels like as big of a mistake as auto-acking something, unless we have a very explicit contract with end users to explain what they are and are not allowed to do.\n    \n    It makes me very nervous when we try to \"fix\" someone's code automatically for them assuming that we know what they are doing.

For `IRichBolt` instances, anchoring and ack'ing is left to the implementation.\n    \n    I feel (and I think @revans2 is alluding to the same) that that contract must be maintained when adding stateful bolts to a topology. (I believe with this patch it is, please correct me if I'm wrong).\n    \n    The seconds question is what are `IStatefulBolt` implementations expected to do in terms of ack'ing/anchoring? Since the output collector handed to `IStatefulBolt` is an instance of `OutputCollector` (as opposed to `BasicOutputCollector`) one would assume that ack'ing/anchoring is the responsibility of the implementation (the `ack()` and `fail()` methods are visible in `OutputCollector` but not `BasicOutputCollector`).\n    \n    If that is not the case (i.e. if stateful bolts are not expected to handle ack'ing/anchoring) it would be best to give `IStatefulBolt`s an output collector implementation that does not expose the ack'ing/anchoring API, similar to the relationship of `IBasicBolt`/`BasicOutputCollector`.\n    \n    Does that make sense?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-08T19:32:43.018+0000","updated":"2016-03-08T19:32:43.018+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12947616/comment/15185652","id":"15185652","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1190#issuecomment-193941111\n  \n    @arunmahadevan I agree mostly with @ptgoetz I wanted to understand the contract (thanks for the link), and that the new contract is consistent with our current contract.  On the acking side it feels like it now is consistent, but not on the anchoring side.  AnchoringOutputCollector in CheckpointTupleForwarder will anchor non-anchored tuples to the last inputTuple.  I can see lots of situations where this is neither expected nor correct for an IRichBolt. A shell bolt for example would totally get this wrong because it does ansync processing.  If we really want to disallow tuples that are not tracked I would prefer to have an exception thrown rather than \"fix\" the issue on the fly and possibly get it wrong.\n    \n    Part of my confusion came from me assuming that we supported state checkpointing without requiring at least once processing.  It feels like we should be able to support that with some kind of a best effort state checkpointing, but now I understand the current limitations and that it would be a separate feature.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-08T19:53:30.809+0000","updated":"2016-03-08T19:53:30.809+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12947616/comment/15186999","id":"15186999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user arunmahadevan commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1190#issuecomment-194268412\n  \n    @revans2 @ptgoetz I have refactored the code and removed the auto anchoring/acking for both stateful and non-stateful bolts in a stateful topology.

I still have not had time to dig into this feature in as much detail as I would like, but from what I have seen so far the contract with users looks good, and it is an important feature to have.
