All are done in a generic way through framework classes except one particular case where the behavior actually differs based on operating system. I only modified tests, not any actual application code. I tested this change on Windows, OS X, and Linux: all pass. On Windows, I still have to run Maven as administrator as some of the tests write to temp folders in AppData.\r\n    \r\n    I'll follow up with a pull request for STORM-2797. There are still some Clojure tests failing but a lot of them are around the logviewer, which will be fixed by my next PR. \n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/lawrencecraft/storm WindowsTestFix-1.x\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2414.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #2414\n    \n----\ncommit c32af1f4386044312357fe39c0789a41539aab6a\nAuthor: Lawrence Craft <lawrence.craft@gmail.com>\nDate:   2017-11-11T16:21:14Z\n\n    Fixing Java unit tests in storm-core to run under Windows\n\n----\n","created":"2017-11-11T22:16:03.682+0000","updated":"2017-11-11T22:16:03.682+0000","started":"2017-11-11T22:16:03.681+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"57016","issueId":"13116093"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13116093/worklog/57087","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user lawrencecraft commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2414\n  \n    Thanks Stig, will do. \r\n    \r\n    I might submit a fix for STORM-2797 (the LogViewer issue) first, if that's alright, as I've got that almost ready to go.
