It is a dependency for an HttpServletFilter pulled over from Hadoop that can be added in after the fact.  When people try to look at storm dependencies they see that hadoop-auth is not used and they remove it.  Perhaps what we really need to do is to have a separate external package that pulls in the ui filter and all the dependencies it needs.  Then we can have simple instructions on how to configure the filter using either the {code}${storm.home}/extlib-daemon{code} directory or preferably the {code}STORM_EXT_CLASSPATH_DAEMON{code} environment variable and {code}storm_env.ini{code}.  This way it would not add an unnecessary dependency on the classpath for anyone, and it is properly packaged + documented as an official part of storm.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-11-03T15:48:12.352+0000","updated":"2015-11-03T15:48:12.352+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12910015/comment/14987563","id":"14987563","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sriharsha","name":"sriharsha","key":"sriharsha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sriharsha Chintalapani","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~revans2] I disagree on this. when we are saying we are shipping security and pretty much not allow user to login into ui in secure manner unless they drop a another jar int ext-lib.
