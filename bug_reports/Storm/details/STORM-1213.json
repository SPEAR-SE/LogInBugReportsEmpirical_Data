Since Apache releases are source-only, these binaries can't be included in a release.\n\nMy initial thought was just to exclude the binaries from the source distribution, but that would mean that distributions built from a source tarball would not match the convenience binaries from a release (the sigar native binaries would not be included.\n\nThe solution I came up with was to leverage the fact that pre-built native binaries are included in the sigar maven distribution ({{sigar-x.x.x-native.jar}}) and use the maven dependency plugin to unpack them into place during the build, rather than check them into git. One benefit is that it will ensure the versions of the sigar jar and the native binaries match. Another is that mavens checksum/signature checking mechanism will also be applied.\n\nThis isn't an ideal solution since the {{sigar-x.x.x-native.jar}} only includes binaries for linux, OSX, and solaris (notably missing windows DLLs), whereas the non-maven sigar download includes support for a wider range of OSes and architectures.\n\nI view this as an interim measure until we can find a better way to include the native binaries in the build process, rather than checking them into the source tree -- which would be a blocker for releasing.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Remove sigar binaries from source tree","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ptgoetz","name":"ptgoetz","key":"ptgoetz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"P.

I switched to using the maven antrun plugin to download and unpack the sigar native binaries. It downloads the archive to the local maven repository alongside the other sigar dependencies so it only needs to download it once.\n    \n    The good news is that allowed me to use the full binary archive, so it includes support for windows and other OSes/architectures. On the down side it's somewhat brittle compared to using \"pure\" maven, and IMO is kind of ugly. It's also hard-coded to use google code, which is supposedly going away at some point, but that's the only place I could find the archive with a published checksum.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-11-19T20:16:50.496+0000","updated":"2015-11-19T20:16:50.496+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12913720/comment/15014366","id":"15014366","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/887#issuecomment-158199509\n  \n    @ptgoetz \n    +1 the changes look good and my manual tests all pass.\n    \n    I Agree the it kind of ugly.
