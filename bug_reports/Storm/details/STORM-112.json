But at the same time sync-process may already be running with old state indicating that a worker timed out and needs to be relaunched. launch-worker then tries to read in the topology conf which was deleted and crashes.\n\nThe following is a sanitized version of the supervisor log that shows this happening.\nhttps://gist.github.com/revans2/6282830","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"364099","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Race condition between Topology Kill and Worker Timeout can crash supervisor","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12684721/comment/14250102","id":"14250102","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miguno","name":"miguno","key":"miguno","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959"},"displayName":"Michael Noll","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"body":"I think I can confirm this is still affecting Storm as of 0.9.2.\n\nIt may also be caused by killing a topology with a small kill wait time (say, 0-5 seconds), followed by resubmitting the same topology immediately or a few seconds after killing the previous running instance.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miguno","name":"miguno","key":"miguno","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959"},"displayName":"Michael Noll","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"created":"2014-12-17T16:48:10.706+0000","updated":"2014-12-17T16:48:10.706+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-112/votes","votes":2,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1qphb:"}}
