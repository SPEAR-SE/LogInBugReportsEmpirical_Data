Then just for {{TOPICS\\[2]}} they want it to be output as {{Fields(\"topic\", \"partition\", \"offset\")}} to {{STREAMS\\[2]}}.  (Don't know what happened to {{STREAMS\\[1]}})\n\nThere are two issues here.  First with how the TupleBuilder and the SpoutStreams are split up, but coupled {{STREAMS\\[2]}} is actually getting the full \"topic\" \"partition\" \"offset\" \"key\" \"value\", but this minor.  The real issue is that the code uses the same KafkaSpoutMessageId for all the tuples emitted to both {{STREAMS\\[1]}} and {{STREAMS\\[2]}}.\n\nhttps://git.corp.yahoo.com/storm/storm/blob/5bcbb8d6d700d0d238d23f8f6d3976667aaedab9/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpout.java#L284-L304\n\nThe code, however, is written to assume that it will only ever get one ack/fail for a given KafkaSpoutMessageId.  This means that if one of the emitted tuple trees succeed and then the other fails, the failure will not result in anything being replayed!  This violates how storm is intended to work.\n\nI discovered this as a part of STORM-2225, and I am fine with fixing it on STORM-2225 (I would just remove support for that functionality because there are other ways of doing this correctly).  But that would not maintain backwards compatibility and I am not sure it would be appropriate for 1.x releases.  I really would like to have feedback from others on this.\n\nI can put something into 1.x where it will throw an exception if acking is enabled and this situation is present, but I don't want to spend the time tying to do reference counting on the number of tuples actually emitted.  If someone else wants to do that I would be happy to turn this JIRA over to them.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"KafkaSpout does not replay properly when a topic maps to multiple streams","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13024535/comment/15712191","id":"15712191","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kishorvpatil","name":"kishorvpatil","key":"kishorvpatil","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kishor Patil","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"[~revans2],\nSince the current implementation violates intended storm usage and failures lost in race condition would never be replayed, I would think breaking backward compatibility would only help add warning to API users.
