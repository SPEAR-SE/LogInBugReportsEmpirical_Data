It ended up being a simple issue of not setting the message timeout value high enough (via setMessageTimeoutSecs), as the topology was taking over a minute to complete. But - frustratingly - there was no indication that this was the cause.\n\n(I've observed this behaviour on both 0.8.2 and 0.9.0-wip17)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"364011","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"LocalDRPC.execute never returns after timeout","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-74/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1qoxz:"}}
