The problem is that it would YARN require the proxy to parse HTML/CSS and rewrite the links.  I think this is possible but I am not an expert on HTML, so I should not have been the one to write the proxy anyways.  If anyone can fix it I would be forever grateful for them to clean up my mess. On that note I think the MR API has this same problem, it is just that it uses the same JS libraries that YARN does so it just happens to work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-02-26T16:21:25.393+0000","updated":"2014-02-26T16:21:25.393+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12697323/comment/13914001","id":"13914001","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clockfly","name":"clockfly","key":"clockfly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sean Zhong","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi Bobby,\n\nGreat to know you also face this problem! \n\nI'd like to share my work-around for this.
