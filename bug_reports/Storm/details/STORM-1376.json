But I could not observe zookeeper slowing down to a point it could not respond. I will launch more topologies to make sure it really slows down. I realized in this scenario that it is only performing reads and as per zookeeper implementation I presume connections are thread safe and hence one connection to read information would be sufficient I guess. An interesting point came up with synchronization here, I looked at the localizer code and I have seen downloads to the supervisor are performed by locking but updates are not therefore to support nimbus HA checkForUpdate and checkForDownload might have to be synchronized. Will make sure by running it with more topologies.
