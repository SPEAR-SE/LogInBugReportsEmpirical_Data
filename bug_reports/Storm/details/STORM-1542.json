Also we can build a command line tool over rest API, if needed.\n\n[~kishorvpatil] The disadvantage I see is that it is very important to clear an action in zookeeper so that it is not executed again. However such scenarios can be identified and fixed. My primary concern is the asynchronous nature of call and viewing the output through a file dump. If I submit a request such as jstack, jmap on UI, I as a user expect an immediate output on the web page itself. If logviewer consumes these requests, it can serve the request synchronously without storing in a file. Additionally there is no mechanism of cleaning up file dumps and for a user it is difficult to know which dump corresponds to his jstack request. By serving the output directly on page solves that problem.\n\nIf multiple users are submitting heap dump requests, we can chose to do that in different threads. \nOther concerns coming out in doing it synchronously through logviewer\n1. pid discovery - logviewer has access to same configuration as supervisor. Supervisor reads worker-artifcats directory to read the pid. Logviewer can do the same as long as it knows the worker-id\n2. profiler actions - It is inherently asynchronous in nature. We can move away from time-bound stop to manual stop. User can start the profiler and manually stop the profiler (similar to debug/stop-debug we have for topologies). \nWhat do you think?
