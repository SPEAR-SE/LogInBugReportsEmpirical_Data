One new thing I found is that it's not associated with a \"magic number\" of supervisor. I have it running at 3 but not at 4. I think it has to do with this specific error:\n\n2012-08-14 11:29:33 worker [WARN] Received invalid messages for unknown tasks. Dropping... \n2012-08-14 11:29:33 worker [WARN] Received invalid messages for unknown tasks. Dropping... \n2012-08-14 11:29:33 worker [WARN] Received invalid messages for unknown tasks. Dropping...\nSeems the fourth one gets messages for tasks it does not know about- possibly out of sync.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Bring one supervisor up 2 mvn -f m2-pom.xml compile exec:java -Dexec.classpathScope=compile -Dexec.mainClass=storm.starter.DRPCTestClient -Dexec.args=\"2000\"\n\nDRPRC CLIENT\nSIZE 2000\nResult = []\ndb time 3268 ms\n[INFO] ------------\n\n2. Repeat adding supervisor and rerun the client.\n\n#DRPRC CLIENT #\nSIZE 2000\n[WARNING] \njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\nat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n..\n\n\n----------\namuraru: @nathanmarz What kind of key is used to uniquely identify the supervisor in nimbus? I saw similar errors when running multiple supervisors on different machines but with the same hostname (e.g. localhost.localdomain) listed in storm ui. COuld be this an issue?\n\n----------\nnathanmarz: Supervisors generate a unique id for themselves and store it in their local dir. It's fine to run many supervisors on the same host as long as they don't share a local dir.\n\n----------\nwillfcareer: Hi, there can't be more supervisor in trident drpc ?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"364170","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Adding more supervisor causes topology (LinearDRPC) to fail","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-165/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1qpx3:"}}
