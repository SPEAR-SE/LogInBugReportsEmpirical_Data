Am I correct in interpreting that it means users on 1.1.x branches cannot use EARLIEST with Kafka?  If so then choosing to not backport this fix is effectively killing Storm 1.1.x for users of Kafka.\r\n# The difficulty of backporting a fix is certainly a factor that should be considered, but also the impact of the fixes.  Specifically, the change that introduced this problem *was* backported, so I'm not entirely sure why the fix for that change wouldn't be backported too.  i.e., the original change that introduced the problem which STORM-2844 is fixing (STORM-2666) seemed like a \"nice to have\" from the description (prevent some duplicates from flowing through the topology), whereas this seems like a \"must have\" (crashing the worker).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erikdw","name":"erikdw","key":"erikdw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=erikdw&avatarId=26098","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=erikdw&avatarId=26098","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=erikdw&avatarId=26098","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=erikdw&avatarId=26098"},"displayName":"Erik Weathers","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-12-27T22:02:58.653+0000","updated":"2017-12-27T22:05:24.783+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-2844/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":123,"worklogs":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13123018/worklog/61748","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"GitHub user hmcl opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2465\n\n    STORM-2844: KafkaSpout Throws IllegalStateException After Committing to Kafka When First Poll Strategy Set to EARLIEST\n\n    \r\n     -
