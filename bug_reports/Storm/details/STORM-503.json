I took the WordCountTopology from storm-starter and ran it in  an Ubuntu VM. I increased the sleep time in the RandomSentenceSpout that feeds the topology to 10 seconds so that there was effectively no work to do. I then modified the topology so that there were 30 threads for each bolt and only one instance of the spout. When I ran the topology I noticed that there was again 100% CPU usage when idle even on this very simple topology. After extensive experimentation (netty vs. zeromq, 0.9.3, 0.9.2, 0.9.1, multiple JVM versions) I used yourkit and found that the high utilization was coming from DisruptorQueue.consumeBatchWhenAvailable where there is this code:\n\nfinal long availableSequence = _barrier.waitFor(nextSequence, 10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n\nI increased to 100 ms and was able to reduce the CPU utilization when idle. I am new to storm, so I am not sure what affect modifying this number has. I Is this expected behavior from storm? I would like to propose modifying the code so that this wait is configurable if possible...\n\nThank
