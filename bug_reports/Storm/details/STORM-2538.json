I'm wondering if you'd be willing to try out a workaround for this issue? Since the issue is caused by Kafka rebalances, I think you can resolve this by switching to this Subscription implementation https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/ManualPartitionNamedSubscription.java. You can specify this class when creating your KafkaSpoutConfig builder (e.g. https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpoutConfig.java#L136).\n\nSwitching to the manual Subscription should prevent rebalances from occuring unless you change the number of partitions for the topic(s) you're consuming from.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Srdo","name":"Srdo","key":"srdo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stig Rohde Døssing","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Copenhagen"},"created":"2017-06-01T16:59:29.501+0000","updated":"2017-06-01T16:59:29.501+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13075875/comment/16090986","id":"16090986","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hmclouro","name":"hmclouro","key":"hmclouro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hugo Louro","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Marked as Won't Fix in favor of STORM-2542","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hmclouro","name":"hmclouro","key":"hmclouro","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hugo Louro","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-07-18T02:07:31.431+0000","updated":"2017-07-18T02:07:31.431+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-2538/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":29,"worklogs":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13075875/worklog/43649","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"GitHub user hmcl opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2147\n\n    STORM-2538: New kafka spout emits duplicate tuples\n\n      -

There are better approaches to do this, but this one fixes some immediate problems for some customers. \n    \n    The discussion of whether supporting dynamic partition assignment or only fixed partition should be done in the email list. I think that we should still support it, at least for 1.x-branch as there are customers using it already. I would conjecture that way more people are using dynamic vs fixed. For 2.0 is a matter of deciding what we want to do, and if we end up supporting both, we should really separate concerns handling fixed and dynamic partition assignment.\n","created":"2017-05-31T17:58:10.705+0000","updated":"2017-05-31T17:58:10.705+0000","started":"2017-05-31T17:58:10.705+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"43673","issueId":"13075875"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13075875/worklog/43674","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user hmcl commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2147#discussion_r119429199\n  \n    --- Diff: external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpout.java ---\n    @@ -252,14 +289,16 @@ private boolean commit() {\n         private boolean poll() {\n             final int maxUncommittedOffsets = kafkaSpoutConfig.getMaxUncommittedOffsets();\n             final int readyMessageCount = retryService.readyMessageCount();\n    -        final boolean poll = !waitingToEmit() &&\n    -            //Check that the number of uncommitted, nonretriable tuples is less than the maxUncommittedOffsets limit\n    -            //Accounting for retriable tuples this way still guarantees that the limit is followed on a per partition basis, and prevents locking up the spout when there are too many retriable tuples\n    -            (numUncommittedOffsets - readyMessageCount < maxUncommittedOffsets ||\n    -            consumerAutoCommitMode);\n    +        final boolean poll = !isWaitingToEmit() &&\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    I was avoiding refactoring internal logic in these changes, but I will look at it and do it either in this or in a follow up patch.
