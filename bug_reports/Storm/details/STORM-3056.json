reaction!\r\n    \r\n    Unfortunately the newly introduced test passes without #2643, so it does not test the original issue. Since  in this modification both the server and the client is closed gracefully the port won't stuck in TIME_WAIT state, no need to use SO_REUSEADDR to restart new instances. To test #2643 the server port should stuck in TIME_WAIT state and then a new server instance should be started successfully.\r\n    \r\n    I still think that it is out of scope to test an operating system level TCP setting in a Storm test.\r\n    \r\n    cc: @HeartSaVioR \n","created":"2018-05-04T08:59:52.962+0000","updated":"2018-05-04T08:59:52.962+0000","started":"2018-05-04T08:59:52.961+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"98163","issueId":"13156954"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13156954/worklog/98172","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2660\n  \n    @ghajos Thanks for the information.
