Yes one of them is to allow the cluster to be more utilized by having finer grained resource scheduling.\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\nWhen we added in RAS we did stop honoringÂ {{topology.workers}}.Â  There are only a handfull of places where it is used outside of the scheduler, so it didn't turn out to be that big of a deal.Â  The biggest issue we ran into was around the default number of ackers.Â  In really old versions of storm it was 1, but then was updated to be the number of workers.Â  We worked around this by having RAS \"guess\" an approximate number of workers as an alternative default.\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/402a371ccdb39ccd7146fe9743e91ca36fee6d15/storm-server/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/daemon/nimbus/Nimbus.java#L2911-L2924]\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\nFor me there are two different things that need to be addressed.\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\n1) we need to update the documentation for {{topology.workers}} to better reflect how it is actually used.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/storm/blob/402a371ccdb39ccd7146fe9743e91ca36fee6d15/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/Config.java#L194-L199\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\n2) We need to fix the current issue.Â \r\n\r\nWe can do that by either not relying on the config and instead looking to see if all of the executors for the topology are in the current worker, by turning it off like the current patch does, or by having RAS do a similar \"guess\" about the actual number of workers, but making sure that we always set it to at least 2, because we don't know how many there really will be.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2018-04-02T17:51:55.676+0000","updated":"2018-04-02T17:51:55.676+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13141544/comment/16423486","id":"16423486","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kabhwan","name":"kabhwan","key":"kabhwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jungtaek Lim","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"body":"If we really want to address this via not removing micro optimization but fixing it, it can be done in the right way.

That's why [~ethanli] would like to file new issues regarding them, and IMHO I think it may be better to initiate them in dev. mailing list so that we canÂ share the concerns and discuss them.\r\n\r\nAs you seem to think I'm missing, I may need toÂ explain my thought below:\r\n\r\n1. Even we want to retain the optimization, IÂ think I proposed \"the right way\" to do it in my comment. Checking topology worker count is \"simplest\" one for activating/deactivating transfer thread, but \"right one\" is checking whether outgoingÂ stream exists in that worker. Multiple workers can be run independently (not communicating with each other)Â depending on how scheduler plans. Isn't it? We never utilized topology worker count inÂ specific worker, and I thinkÂ workerÂ still has enough information to deal with such optimization without knowing topology worker count.\r\n\r\n2. Regarding modifying topology configuration, I think I already put my 2 cent on last comment. Whenever I need to check which value I set in configuration, I'm checking the value in UI. If the value is different than what user put before, we still need to explain why it is happening to avoid confusion. That's not ideal.Â I think the topology configuration should be immutable one, though we don't guarantee it from the code. Maybe weÂ would need to have context object like StormContext?\r\n\r\n3. We already have StormTopology as well asÂ TopologyContext which provide necessary information. Dynamic informations like assignmentÂ are handled by worker. The number of worker in topology is not exposed directly, butÂ can be calculated from Assignment. (Please referÂ [https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/daemon/worker/WorkerState.java#L357]Â andÂ [https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/generated/Assignment.java]) Based on 2, I would try to calculate it if it really needs.\r\n\r\n4. WeÂ construct the configuration from combination of command line, code, conf. file, etc. We assume they're not changing during runtime,Â which makes us safe toÂ read the configuration multiple times inÂ differentÂ places. There's a chance for the assumptionÂ to be broken if we modify the value in runtime.\r\n\r\n5. I admit that it is too ideal for the state of current Storm, but the count of worker in topology can be increased or decreased in runtime if we address elasticity. If we deal with this via relaunching all the workers then the value can be considered as static, but if not, the value will be dynamic which topology configuration is not doable to contain it.\r\n\r\nÂ ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kabhwan","name":"kabhwan","key":"kabhwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jungtaek Lim","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"created":"2018-04-04T00:49:51.299+0000","updated":"2018-04-04T00:50:14.691+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13141544/comment/16425223","id":"16425223","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=roshan_naik","name":"roshan_naik","key":"roshan_naik","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Roshan Naik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"MutabilityÂ of topology configuration is explicitly allowedÂ in the documentation (previously referenced).\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\nUsefulness of single worker use case should not be under-estimated.

Would they try to communicate to one another differently?Â  Would they send different types or sizes of messages?Â  I just don't see any use case where a bolt or spout would care, but if you have a use case we can totally provide it.\r\n\r\nÂ \r\n\r\nI agree that the single worker use case is critical for performance.Â  Hopefully in the future we can get the scheduler and the routers to be smart
