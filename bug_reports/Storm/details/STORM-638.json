There is other more damaging information exposed on the UI already.  Also what is having the pid of the process going to let me do as an attacher?  If I cannot log onto the box the pid is really rather useless.  If I can log onto the box I can already get the pid by running ```ps -aef | grep '<topology-id>-<port-number>'```.  Granted I am not a malicious individual so perhaps I am missing something or perhaps an attach will show up in the future that is somehow related to the pid.  It is totally possible, but I don't see it as being that likely.\n    \n    @caofangkun, The generated thrift code no longer compiles.  It looks like you regenerated with thrift7, and we have moved on to thrift 0.9.2.
