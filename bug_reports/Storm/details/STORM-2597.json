Please refer below:\n    \n    ```\n    >>> import os\n    >>> def get_wildcard_dir(path):\n    ...     if os.path.isdir(path):\n    ...         ret = [(os.path.join(path, \"*\"))]\n    ...     elif os.path.exists(path):\n    ...         ret = [path]\n    ...     return ret\n    ...\n    >>> get_wildcard_dir(\"~/WorkArea\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 6, in get_wildcard_dir\n    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'ret' referenced before assignment\n    >>> get_wildcard_dir(\"/Users/jlim/WorkArea\")\n    ['/Users/jlim/WorkArea/*']\n    >>> get_wildcard_dir(\"/Users/jlim/WorkArea/*\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 6, in get_wildcard_dir\n    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'ret' referenced before assignment\n    ```\n    \n    So `get_wildcard_dir()` just fails when a part of classpath contains not a dir nor a existing file. \n    IIRC we don't guide the format of `STORM_EXT_CLASSPATH` and `STORM_EXT_CLASSPATH_DAEMON` and then what I expect is the format of Java class path pattern.\n    \n    I'm +1 for the change. This is a bug hence actually need to port back to 1.x version line, but it might break backward compatibility so not having strong opinion about back port.\n    \n    Maybe need to fix `get_wildcard_dir()` as well. Which value we want to return when it's not a dir nor an existing file? Same return value as an existing file? `[]` to effectively get rid of input to the classpath?\n","created":"2017-06-29T04:14:24.365+0000","updated":"2017-06-29T04:14:24.365+0000","started":"2017-06-29T04:14:24.364+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"46548","issueId":"13082196"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13082196/worklog/46684","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user revans2 commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2173\n  \n    Sounds good.
