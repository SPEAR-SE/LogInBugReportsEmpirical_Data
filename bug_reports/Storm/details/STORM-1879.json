Maybe I didn't describe it very well, so let me try to summarize it differently:\n\nThe problem occurs if {{kill-existing-workers-with-change-in-components}} tries to kill a worker that has been started but has not yet written a single heartbeat, so {{read-allocated-workers}} returns a state of {{:not-started}} and also no information about the port this worker is assigned to. Therefore in this line https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L536 the second argument to {{shutdown-worker}} will be {{nil}}.\nThis leads to:\n# {{pids}} is empty (https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L277), therefore the worker is not killed\n# {{try-cleanup-worker}} is also called with an {{id}} of {{nil}} (https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L303)\n# which will delete the local state files for all workers, since {{org.apache.storm.config/worker-root conf nil}} returns for example '/var/lib/storm/workers/' and this path is deleted (https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L265)\n\nThe heartbeat files of the workers that are still running will eventually be recreated at the heartbeat, but the PID files are gone for good at that point, so even stopping the topology won't help. Only manually killing the worker processes will solve the problem.\n\n\nP.S: I also attached a workaround patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nico.meyer","name":"nico.meyer","key":"nico.meyer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nico Meyer","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-06-22T15:54:21.067+0000","updated":"2016-06-22T15:55:11.921+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12975130/comment/15354803","id":"15354803","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kabhwan","name":"kabhwan","key":"kabhwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jungtaek Lim","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"body":"Sorry for late participating.
