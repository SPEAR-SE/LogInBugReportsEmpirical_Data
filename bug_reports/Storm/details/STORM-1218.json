If there is support from the community, I will move on to other components, though any html will just pass through, so it shouldn't garble, and will likely improve any existing javadoc.\n    \n    The first commit adds the corresponding maven javadoc plugin to the default build. This means it will increase build time when you run `mvn install`, but it will also spit out warnings about javadoc problems and may encourage developers to fix or improve documentation problems.\n    \n    The second commit is a quick pass over `storm-core` to remove unnecessary HTML and some minor javadoc comment linting. Only javadoc comments were modified.\n    \n    The third commit adds the `highlight.js` license to both the source and binary LICENSE files, since the generated javadoc includes it. I'm not sure this is necessary, since the JavaDoc is generated, but I will find out if there's support for this patch.\n    \n    *Note:* The [pegdown-doclet licence](https://github.com/Abnaxos/pegdown-doclet/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) is GPL, but it's only used at build time, so that does not seem to present a licensing issue.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/ptgoetz/storm markdown-javadoc\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/891.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #891\n    \n----\ncommit e03b28ca6222f61471b4acb1a6086aab9b597b8a\nAuthor: P.
