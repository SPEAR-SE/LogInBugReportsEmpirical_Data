The private credentials set is actually backed by a linked list, so the order they are scanned is insertion order.  Because a TGT is going to be inserted before any service tickets in the common case all is fine, the issue only shows up when we insert in a new TGT after other still valid service tickets.\n\nThis also only shows up when you are talking to more then one service, like we do with hbase.  If it were talking to just one service then the java code would reuse the valid service ticket instead of trying to get a new service ticket.
