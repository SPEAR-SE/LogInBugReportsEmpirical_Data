We could reach out to the maven community and see if they would be interested in making the plugin official, but in the short term, we create a new version number for the plugin, that is not the same as storm's and publish the artifact to the maven repo on its own.  We may also need to separate out the build for the plugin from the rest of storm so it does not try to pull it in and get confused.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-17T15:27:28.377+0000","updated":"2015-02-17T15:27:28.377+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771358/comment/14328343","id":"14328343","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user Lewuathe commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/403#issuecomment-75163410\n  \n    I changed documentation.
