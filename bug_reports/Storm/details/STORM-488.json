How to reproduce\n\n{code}\n$STORM_HOME/bin/storm unsupportedCommand\n{code}\n\nh3. Actual result (incorrect)\n\nThe command above prints the usage help of the {{storm}} CLI tool, which is ok.  However, the exit code is 0, indicating success.\n\n{code}\n$ /opt/storm/bin/storm unsupportedCommand\nUnknown command: [storm unsupportedCommand]\nCommands:\n\tactivate\n\tclasspath\n\tdeactivate\n\tdev-zookeeper\n\tdrpc\n\thelp\n\tjar\n\tkill\n\tlist\n\tlocalconfvalue\n\tlogviewer\n\tnimbus\n\trebalance\n\tremoteconfvalue\n\trepl\n\tshell\n\tsupervisor\n\tui\n\tversion\n\nHelp:\n\thelp\n\thelp <command>\n\nDocumentation for the storm client can be found at http://storm.incubator.apache.org/documentation/Command-line-client.html\n\nConfigs can be overridden using one or more -c flags, e.g. \"storm list -c nimbus.host=nimbus.mycompany.com\"\n\n$ echo $?\n0    << zero exit code, should be non-zero\n{code}\n\nThe problem of the current behavior is that automated deployment tools such as Puppet or Ansible fail to work correctly because they assume a zero exit code indicates success.\n\nAs a concrete example, imagine you mistype the command to submit a topology jar file to a Storm cluster:\n\n{code}\n# Doh, forgot to put the \"jar\" command between `storm` and `mytopology.jar`!\n$ /opt/storm/bin/storm mytopology.jar my.Class\n\n# Correct would be:\n#    $ /opt/storm/bin/storm jar mytopology.jar my.Class\n{code}\n\nIn this example, even though the user mistyped the submit command in e.g. an Ansible script, the script would not be able to tell -- the storm CLI tool incorrectly reports that the (wrong) command completed successfully.\n\nh3. Expected result (correct)\n\nRunning the storm CLI tool with an unsupported command should return a non-zero exit code to clearly indicate an error condition.\n\n*The only remaining question would be:  What would be the actual, non-zero exit code?*\n\nFor example, running the storm CLI tool without any argument returns an exit code of 255:\n\n{code}\n$ /opt/storm/bin/storm\n...snip...\n$ echo $?\n255\n{code}\n\nUnfortunately, my understanding is that we haven't defined the semantics of non-zero exit codes.  Their values are IMHO not deliberately chosen.\n\nFor instance, if you run the \"storm jar\" command these are (some of) its possible exit codes:\n\n{code}\n0: success\n1:\n  - topology of same name already exists\n    `Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.RuntimeException: Topology with name `mytopology` already exists on cluster`\n  - class cannot be found (`storm jar storm-starter.jar storm.starter.IDoNotExistAtAll`)\n    `Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: storm/starter/IDoNotExistAtAll`  (<<< logged to STDERR)\n  - incorrect use of command line, e.g. wrong number of command line arguments\n{code}\n\nAs you can see, we return an exit code of 1 for a variety of error conditions.  On the positive side, at least it's clear that there was an error.  On the negative side, we cannot tell different error conditions apart because the same exit code is used.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"storm CLI tool reports zero exit code on error scenario","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miguno","name":"miguno","key":"miguno","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959"},"displayName":"Michael Noll","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miguno","name":"miguno","key":"miguno","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miguno&avatarId=26959"},"displayName":"Michael Noll","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12739444/comment/14156206","id":"14156206","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"GitHub user miguno opened a pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/278\n\n    STORM-488: Exit with 254 error code if storm CLI is run with unknown command\n\n    This change follows the existing semantics when the `storm` CLI tool is invoked without _any_ parameters.\n    \n    With this change, whenever the user tries to run `storm <cmd>` with an unknown command the `storm` script will print the usage help (existing behavior) AND then exit with a 254 error code.\n    \n    I decided not to re-use the 255 error code, which is returned by the `storm` CLI tool when being invoked without any parameters.
