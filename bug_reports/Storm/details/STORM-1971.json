I think overhead is very high in the current case. Writing a message of x size y times to a hdfs cluster vs write a single message of xy size to hdfs cluster.  HDFS is best at large streaming reads and writes  What are the advantages of current implementation(one message write) over the proposed one(batching writes)?

Readers can see the latest message writes only after sync. Hence, i feel that it is safe to write a batch and do a sync immediately during every tick.   As you said, this will work for text files and i need to investigate Avro and Sequence. I am ready to contribute and I will take this up very soon.
