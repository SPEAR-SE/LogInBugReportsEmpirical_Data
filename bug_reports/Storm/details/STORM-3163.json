The upshot of this is that {{setUpContext}} is executed in the task thread (i.e. {{Thread-21-joiner-executor[2 2]}}) while the {{log}} method is executed in the anonymous thread (i.e. {{Thread-30}}) running the {{BoltReaderRunnable}}.\r\n\r\nThis creates a problem when trying to leverage {{slf4j}}'s {{MDC}} (or {{NDC}}) which are used for augmenting log messages with additional information which is localised and persisted at the thread level.\r\n\r\nThe current work around for this is to store all relevant context on the {{ShellLogHandler}} during {{setUpContext}}, and then write it into the {{MDC}} during the {{log}} call, and taking precautions around that state being thread safe. The thread safety requirement is the first drawback, the second is that each {{log}} call has the additional overhead of either unconditionally writing to the {{MDC}} or checking that the {{MDC}} is already populated. Neither is very appealing.\r\n\r\nThe suggested solution is to pass {{stormConf}}, {{_process}}, and {{_context}} into the constructor of {{BoltReaderRunnable}} (and perhaps also
