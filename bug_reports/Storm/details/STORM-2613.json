opposite to STORM-2613, because both nil and 0 are logically false. So it doesn't include tuples which are not sampled, but it also doesn't include tuples which are done in 0 ms. Less harmful but still affects the overall latency.\n    \n    @vinodkc \n    I guess we need to file different issue for this, since the bug is affecting differently. Could you please follow up? Thanks in advance!\n","created":"2017-08-02T22:57:26.050+0000","updated":"2017-08-02T22:57:26.050+0000","started":"2017-08-02T22:57:26.019+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"49808","issueId":"13084246"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13084246/worklog/49833","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user vinodkc commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2251\n  \n    @HeartSaVioR \n    Sure, filed a new issue STORM-2677.\n    Can you please change the status of STORM-2613.\n","created":"2017-08-03T04:19:31.068+0000","updated":"2017-08-03T04:19:31.068+0000","started":"2017-08-03T04:19:31.067+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"49833","issueId":"13084246"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13084246/worklog/49835","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2251\n  \n    @vinodkc\n    OK.
