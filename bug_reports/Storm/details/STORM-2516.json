testPrepareLateTupleStreamWithoutB…\n\n    …uilder\n    \n    The test was sleeping a bit and hoping that WaterMarkEventGenerator.run() had been run by the executor in that class before the test woke up. Sometimes that wasn't happening. Instead we're calling the method manually now, like the rest of the tests involving that class.\n    \n    I also fixed the checkstyle violations in WaterMarkEventGenerator.\n    \n    As far as I can tell, the lastWatermarkTs variable in WaterMarkEventGenerator should be volatile or an AtomicLong, since it is being written to in run() with the expectation that it can be seen by the thread calling track().\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/srdo/storm STORM-2516\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2118.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #2118\n    \n----\ncommit 9a4d10efccb9b60746b80250f292a95c1f1f0f5a\nAuthor: Stig Rohde Døssing <stigdoessing@gmail.com>\nDate:   2017-05-16T19:27:41Z\n\n    STORM-2516: Fix timing issues with testPrepareLateTupleStreamWithoutBuilder\n\n----\n","created":"2017-05-16T19:40:57.029+0000","updated":"2017-05-16T19:40:57.029+0000","started":"2017-05-16T19:40:57.029+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"42955","issueId":"13072552"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13072552/worklog/43467","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user arunmahadevan commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2118#discussion_r118845392\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/windowing/WaterMarkEventGenerator.java ---\n    @@ -45,17 +46,25 @@\n         private final Map<GlobalStreamId, Long> streamToTs;\n         private final ScheduledExecutorService executorService;\n         private final int interval;\n    +    private final AtomicLong lastWaterMarkTs;\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    this could be a volatile instead of AtomicLong\n","created":"2017-05-28T17:15:17.473+0000","updated":"2017-05-28T17:15:17.473+0000","started":"2017-05-28T17:15:17.473+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"43467","issueId":"13072552"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13072552/worklog/43471","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user srdo commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2118#discussion_r118846076\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/windowing/WaterMarkEventGenerator.java ---\n    @@ -45,17 +46,25 @@\n         private final Map<GlobalStreamId, Long> streamToTs;\n         private final ScheduledExecutorService executorService;\n         private final int interval;\n    +    private final AtomicLong lastWaterMarkTs;\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    Yes.
