Now that we are making a string out of what is returned by .getResource, `uri` won't be `nil` when no resource is found—it will be a URI with an empty path.  And we do not want to try and do a dir copy from a File with an empty path, since it will likely bring down the supervisor with an exception.\n    \n    We really want something like:\n    ```Clojure\n    uri (if-let [url (.getResource classloader RESOURCES-DIR)]\n          (URI. (str url)))\n    ```\n    \n    This is slightly corrected from my earlier comment, and with this change:\n    \n      * If `.getResource` returns `nil`, then `uri` becomes `nil` (no else is needed within `if-let`), and the `cond` does not evaluate the `do` expression paired to `uri` with the `copyDirectory` below.\n    \n      * If `.getResource` returns a URL, then `uri` becomes a URI of the string of `url`, and `cond` evaluates the `do` expression with the `copyDirectory`.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-07-11T21:01:56.382+0000","updated":"2014-07-11T21:01:56.382+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12694365/comment/14059375","id":"14059375","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user apetresc commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/188#issuecomment-48784372\n  \n    @d2r, thanks for the detail, that makes a lot of sense :) Commit amended with all your comments.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-07-11T21:20:14.954+0000","updated":"2014-07-11T21:20:14.954+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12694365/comment/14072310","id":"14072310","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user ptgoetz commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/188#issuecomment-49932845\n  \n    This need an upmerge, but other than that I'm +1.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-07-23T20:47:21.648+0000","updated":"2014-07-23T20:47:21.648+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12694365/comment/14073632","id":"14073632","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user apetresc commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/188#issuecomment-50076920\n  \n    Upmerged.
