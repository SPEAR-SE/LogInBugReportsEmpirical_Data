applied without backporting to 0.10.x. STORM-1463 is just one of these.\n    \n    I'm wondering we would want to find whole of things and backport to 0.10.x. If we don't want, this PR is just good to go for 0.10.x, and I'll create pull request for 1.x and master.\n    \n    What do you think?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-04T08:03:16.876+0000","updated":"2016-03-04T08:03:16.876+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12946846/comment/15179553","id":"15179553","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user hustfxj commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1183#discussion_r55001806\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-core/test/clj/backtype/storm/supervisor_test.clj ---\n    @@ -261,8 +260,8 @@\n                                     (str \"-Dstorm.id=\" mock-storm-id)\n                                     (str \"-Dworker.id=\" mock-worker-id)\n                                     (str \"-Dworker.port=\" mock-port)\n    -                               \"-Dstorm.log.dir=/logs\"\n    -                               \"-Dlog4j.configurationFile=/log4j2/worker.xml\"\n    +                                (str \"-Dstorm.log.dir=\" file-path-separator \"logs\")\n    +                                (str \"-Dlog4j.configurationFile=\" file-path-separator \"log4j2\" file-path-separator \"worker.xml\")\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    @HeartSaVioR  sorry, I didn't see STORM-1463 before.

If it's a large diff, I don't think we want to do that. I would much prefer to pull individual patches in to ensure we're not adding features or creating regressions. \n    \n    This conversation probably belongs on the mailing list, though, so others can weigh in. For now, I think we can merge this and treat backporting fixes to 10.x as a separate issue.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-08T17:48:52.683+0000","updated":"2016-03-08T17:48:52.683+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12946846/comment/15186358","id":"15186358","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1183#issuecomment-194076581\n  \n    @knusbaum \n    Yes, I'll send the mail to dev mailing list.
