failures with 'BUILD FAILURE'\n\n    Slightly more complicated clojure.\n    The only thing really changing here is that it checks the values for the `:fail` and `:error` keys in the return value of `run-tests`\n    \n    In case of error, `System.exit(1)`. \n    In the python, propagate the exit code.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull
