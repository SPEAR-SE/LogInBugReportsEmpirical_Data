good fix.\r\n    \r\n    When I first wrote the code I would launch a topology which depended on several blobs, some that required a relaunch of the worker and others that didn't.  I then manually verified that the worker was relaunched when I changed the ones that required a relaunch and wasn't relaunched for ones that didn't need it.  It would be good to at least verify that it is still working after this change, and more importantly is this code needed at all if it was working before.\n","created":"2018-06-07T14:26:00.887+0000","updated":"2018-06-07T14:26:00.887+0000","started":"2018-06-07T14:26:00.887+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"109708","issueId":"13164696"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13164696/worklog/109836","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user zd-project commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2708\n  \n    I extended the test to cover the testing of filterChangingBlob now.\n","created":"2018-06-07T19:38:26.426+0000","updated":"2018-06-07T19:38:26.426+0000","started":"2018-06-07T19:38:26.425+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"109836","issueId":"13164696"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13164696/worklog/110121","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2708\n","created":"2018-06-08T14:02:43.487+0000","updated":"2018-06-08T14:02:43.487+0000","started":"2018-06-08T14:02:43.487+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"110121","issueId":"13164696"}]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3umdj:"}}
