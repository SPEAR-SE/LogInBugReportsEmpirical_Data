This fixes two unit test failures in external/kafka I saw when running tests repeatedly, especially on low resource VMs.\n    \n    There was a race in the Exponential Backoff Manager that was fixed by switching the test to use simulated time.\n    \n    The Kafka Utils Test was seeing failures on underpowered systems due to a timeout value that was too small. Added log4j2 properties xml to be able to change the log level printed in the output. Also changed metadata.fetch.timeout.ms to max.block.ms, as kafka 0.9 had deprecated the config. The test output had warnings like\n    \n    39890 [main] WARN o.a.k.c.p.KafkaProducer - metadata.fetch.timeout.ms config is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use max.block.ms\n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/ppoulosk/storm FixKafkaUnitTests\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1335.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #1335\n    \n----\ncommit 38cf3f3d2f594023260efd853a2255306a0e6190\nAuthor: Paul Poulosky <ppoulosk@thenperfect-lm.champ.corp.yahoo.com>\nDate:   2016-04-12T19:17:44Z\n\n    Fix tests\n\ncommit c54e6c5a7c76ee38fcf7620359c17a0dc3caa034\nAuthor: Paul Poulosky <ppoulosk@thenperfect-lm.champ.corp.yahoo.com>\nDate:   2016-04-29T14:22:41Z\n\n    Change other occurrances of the deprecated setting\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-04-29T19:53:18.513+0000","updated":"2016-04-29T19:53:18.513+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12952450/comment/15268420","id":"15268420","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1335#issuecomment-216477509\n  \n    `max.block.ms` is not available for 0.8.x so IMO it would be not good to change storm-kafka module to strictly support 0.9 or higher.
