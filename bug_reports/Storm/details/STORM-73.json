The the ack() and fail() methods expect that they receive exactly the number of ack or fail calls you would expect as emited for each sequence.\n\nBut watching the console, after around 13 sequences:\n\nAcking sequence: 0\nAcking sequence: 1\nAcking sequence: 2\nAcking sequence: 3\nAcking sequence: 4\nAcking sequence: 5\nAcking sequence: 6\nAcking sequence: 7\nAcking sequence: 8\nAcking sequence: 9\nAcking sequence: 10\nAcking sequence: 11\nAcking sequence: 12\nAcking sequence: 13\nFailing sequence: 15\nSome sequence didn't fail completly!! {14=396}\nFailing sequence: 16\nSome sequence didn't fail completly!! {14=396}\nFailing sequence: 17\n\netc... etc.. Keeps failing from now on\n\n-----------\nbarrywhart: This sounds very similar to a problem we were having last week on 0.8.0 on a conventional topology (non-Trident) written in Python. The spout would hang forever after about 100 messages.\n\nIn our case we were able to downgrade to 0.7.4, and it has been working fine since.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"364010","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"TridentTopology with a RichSpout and tuples that fail","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xumingming","name":"xumingming","key":"xumingming","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xumingming&avatarId=18354"},"displayName":"James Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-73/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1qoxr:"}}
