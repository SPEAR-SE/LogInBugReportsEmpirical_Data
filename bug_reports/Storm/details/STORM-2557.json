query arrival rates. We found a bug in `DisruptorQueue `that leads to severe underestimation to the queue arrival rates. After further investigation, we finally found that in the current implementation of `DisruptorQueue`, the arrival rates are actually measured as the number of batches of tuples rather than the actual number of tuples, resulting in significant underestimation of the arrival rates.\n    \n    To be more specific, in` DisruptorQueue.publishDirectSingle()` and `DisruptorQueue.publishDirect()` functions, objects containing tuples are published to the buffer and the metrics are notified by calling `_metric.notifyArrivals(1)`. This works fine when the object is simply a wrapper of a single tuple. However, the object could also be an instance of `ArrayList<AddressedTuple>` or `HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<TaskMessage>>`. In such case, we should get the actual number of tuples in the object and notify the `_metrics `with the right value.\n    \n    I added some code that determine the type of object to fix this issue at `DisruptorQueue.publishDirectSingle ()` and `DisruptorQueue.publishDirectSingle ()` functions.\n    \n    Any comment or suggestion regarding to this pull request is welcomed.\n    \n    Thanks.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/wendyshusband/storm master\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2164.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #2164\n    \n----\ncommit 70d45b29c5fd7d67e4d841a2cb2c8504fb999e2c\nAuthor: wendyshusband <tkl449@126.com>\nDate:   2017-06-17T05:40:17Z\n\n    STORM-2557: A bug in DisruptorQueue causing severe underestimation of queue arrival rates\n\n----\n","created":"2017-06-17T05:53:56.875+0000","updated":"2017-06-17T05:53:56.875+0000","started":"2017-06-17T05:53:56.873+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"45289","issueId":"13080561"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13080561/worklog/45292","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2164#discussion_r122565494\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/DisruptorQueue.java ---\n    @@ -502,15 +502,26 @@ private static Long getId() {\n     \n         private void publishDirectSingle(Object obj, boolean block) throws InsufficientCapacityException {\n             long at;\n    +        long numberOfTuples;\n             if (block) {\n                 at = _buffer.next();\n             } else {\n                 at = _buffer.tryNext();\n             }\n             AtomicReference<Object> m = _buffer.get(at);\n             m.set(obj);\n    +        if (obj instanceof ArrayList) {\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    Seems like the logic for counting number of tuples is duplicated so better to extract method.\n","created":"2017-06-17T09:57:07.845+0000","updated":"2017-06-17T09:57:07.845+0000","started":"2017-06-17T09:57:07.843+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"45292","issueId":"13080561"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13080561/worklog/45293","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2164\n  \n    @wendyshusband \n    Thanks for the contribution.
