So to combat that I made as many of the test run in parallel.  Some of the tests didn't work well in this mode, so I disabled the parallelism for storm-hive, storm-kafka-client, and integration-test.  Storm-hdfs and storm-hive have some issues with where data is stored, and we could probably make it work with the right settings.  storm-kafka-client mostly works, but occasionally I would see a test hang and I didn't have time to debug it.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/revans2/incubator-storm STORM-2876\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2500.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #2500\n    \n----\ncommit 19878bdb05e5eca4bf47012039243bbf9d14ec81\nAuthor: Robert (Bobby) Evans <evans@...>\nDate:   2018-01-03T20:35:04Z\n\n    STORM-2876: Work around memory leak, and try to speed up tests\n\n----\n","created":"2018-01-03T22:21:03.811+0000","updated":"2018-01-03T22:21:03.811+0000","started":"2018-01-03T22:21:03.811+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"64584","issueId":"13128036"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13128036/worklog/64732","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user srdo commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2500\n  \n    +1\r\n    \r\n    For storm-kafka-client I think the hangs are likely in the tests that run a local Kafka instance.

It is a problem with using the mini-dfs cluster, and we use it for tests in 1.x too.  The patch applies mostly cleanly to 1.x too.  The only difference is that `<trimStackTrace>false</trimStackTrace>` is not in pom.xml so git didn't know if it should include it or not.  If you are fine with me making that change manually as I merge it in I will not bother with a 1.x pull request.\n","created":"2018-01-05T15:14:52.191+0000","updated":"2018-01-05T15:14:52.191+0000","started":"2018-01-05T15:14:52.189+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"64950","issueId":"13128036"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13128036/worklog/64951","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2500\n  \n    @revans2 Sure.
