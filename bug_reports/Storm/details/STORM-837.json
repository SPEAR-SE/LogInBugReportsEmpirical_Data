It is just a State, there are no get operations supported on it, it is a sink that writes all input to HDFS.  The issue is with others reading the data.  The readers in this case are likely to be a batch job using a Hadoop input format to read the data.  For regular storm it provides at most once or at least once semantics, and the HdfsBolt, which is also a sink, provides the exact same semantics, so if there is duplicate data or lost data it could be for more reasons then just the Bolt not syncing things correctly.  In that case however, I would like to see the spout not ack a tuple until it has been synced to disk, that way we truly can be sure no data is lost, but that is another issue.\n\nfor trident we expect exactly once semantics, especially form something that comes as an official part of storm.  The File formats that the data is written out in are just a log with no ability to overwrite out of data data like a MapState can.  They also have no knowledge of zookeeper and the batch ids that have been or not been fully committed.  And even if they did have that knowledge the entries have to commit ID in them to let the reader know which ones it should ignore while reading.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-05-28T13:40:10.340+0000","updated":"2015-05-28T13:40:10.340+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12832758/comment/14628608","id":"14628608","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arunmahadevan","name":"arunmahadevan","key":"arunmahadevan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Mahadevan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"[~revans2] Can we add an option to log the txid as the first field separated by the field separator along with each tuple.

We have to store the batch ID somewhere to make this work, but we need a way to dedupe the data, either on the read side or as part of the commit  If we store the batch ID with each tuple and do nothing on the commit side the consumer of the data has to dedup duplicate batches.  We can do that on the read side but we essentially have to dedupe everything in the data set, even previously processed data, and hope that the storm code produced the exact same result each time or else we could end up with a problem.  Because of the complexity of doign this right, and the fact that we would put this burden on the end user I personally would rather see two files employed and we dedupe on the commit side.  One file is for writing out data, and the second file is batch ID index into the first file.\n\nIn the simplest case the second file is just an edit log and can be thrown away when the commit is complete.\n\nbeginCommit would write out to the edit log that batch X is starting at file Y offset Z and flush to be sure it is on disk.\nupdate would write out the data similar to what it does now.\ncommit would at least flush the data file and possibly close and rotate it to the final location, and would write out to the edit log that batch X is finished at file Y offset whatever.\n\nThe interesting code would all be in the error handling.\n\nIf the state comes up and it sees existing files that have not been rotated it needs to recover any batches that were committed but not rotated to the final location.\nIf beginCommit is called without the previous batch ID being committed {\n    if the commit ID is the same as the current batch ID, we need to recover the batches that succeeded but have not been rotated, then continue on as normal\n    else if the commit ID is not the same as the current batch ID we disable writing any data out until the current batch ID fully commits. \n}\nif beginCommit is called for a batchID that we already completed we disable output until we move on to the next batch ID.\n\nThere may be other cases that we need to think about too, I just threw this out as a starting point.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-07-15T21:03:54.013+0000","updated":"2015-07-15T21:03:54.013+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12832758/comment/14629736","id":"14629736","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arunmahadevan","name":"arunmahadevan","key":"arunmahadevan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Mahadevan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Agree with the approach of keeping data and txd id index in separate files. \n\nBased on my understanding of transactional and opaque transactional spouts, \n\n1.

To keep it simple, automatically turn off exactly once semantics if TimedRotation policy is in use.\n    \n    Have tested with the normal flow and simulating the recovery scenario, with both regular Hdfs file and sequence files. Appears to work fine.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/arunmahadevan/storm master\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply

That file is initially read in the `prepare()` method call, and is initialized if it does not already exist. The POJO representing that file is stored in a `lastTxn` instance variable, which represents that last committed transaction.\n    \n    In the `beginCommit()` method, it checks the transaction ID against the one stored in `lastTxn`. If it is <= (indicating a replay of a batch), it triggers recovery (more on that later), otherwise it continues normally (writing data in the `execute()` method).\n    \n    In the `commit()` method, it essentially re-writes the transaction file with the new transaction ID and the current file offset after the latest batch data was written. This offset serves as the starting point for recovery.\n    \n    **Recovery**\n    When recovery is triggered, it is assumed that there was a failure during the `execute()` method, and the data file now contains data from tuples that will be replayed. If it were to simply append to that file, there would be duplicate records. So it effectively truncates the data file by creating new file, and copying everything from the old data file *up to the last successfully committed offset,* and discarding the remaining data.\n    \n    I think this is an interesting approach and is certainly more resilient than what we currently have, but I think there's a scaling problem with the recovery functionality. Recovery works by essentially copying the old/orphaned data file into a new file and skipping any extra, uncommitted data it contains. This is fine for small files, but what about the case where the data file is really big and the recovery time would take longer than `topology.message.timeout.secs`?\n    \n    Another problem I see is the lack of support for time-based file rotation. I understand why it's not supported by this patch, but as I mentioned earlier, that's one of the most common use cases.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-07-24T18:31:43.510+0000","updated":"2015-07-24T18:31:43.510+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12832758/comment/14640938","id":"14640938","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user arunmahadevan commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/644#issuecomment-124635613\n  \n    @ptgoetz to address the concern of recovery times for large files, can we recommend (or auto enforce) the max size in \"size based rotation\" to a reasonable threshold (say 1GB).

pass through the code and it looks OK, but I have not looked at it in great detail.  I am not very happy with the limitations on which rotation policy you can use, nor on the size limit.  I would rather be correct but slow by default in all cases, even if they set bad configs (> 1GB), and give them the power to make it fast but wrong if they know the risks and can deal with it.  Also a hard coded 1GB limit seems a little strange.  What if we have a 10GigE connection or even infiniband for HDFS and all of the data happens to be in memory.  We could in theory have processed the 1GB in less then a second, still painful but not the end of the world.\n    \n    Why don't we want to support a time based rotation, that rotates at the end of a batch after the time has passed instead of in the middle of the batch?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-08-05T20:35:37.197+0000","updated":"2015-08-05T20:35:37.197+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12832758/comment/14659568","id":"14659568","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user arunmahadevan commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/644#issuecomment-128266209\n  \n    I was trying to put a safety net  so that the recovery would always work.

Although the rest of storm seems a bit unstable with tests.\n    \n    I think the changes look fine +1 for merging this in.\n    \n    I don't think we have any split brain problems because of how we route messages, so the begin command and commit messages should prevent this.\n    \n    There are some things that I think we can do better, but are not wrong. \n    1) I am scared that the transaction file is going to put more of a load on the Name Node than I like.  I am mostly concerned that if we have thousands of instances of hdfs state creating/deleting transaction files multiple times a second the load is going to noticeable on a large cluster.  But this is a premature optimization so I would say we don't address it unless we see it as an actual problem.\n    2) The RotationActions don't have a recovery interface, and things like the MoveFile action could potentially fail after successfully rotating the file which might leave the file in the wrong directory.\n    3) I don't really like the special case for the TimedRotationAction.start.  I would rather see start a part of the RotationAction interface, that can be ignored by those that don't want/need it.\n    \n    The last two could perhaps be a follow on JIRA.  I am fine with the code as is, but I would like another pair of eyes looking at this too before merging it in.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-08-12T14:03:56.164+0000","updated":"2015-08-12T14:03:56.164+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12832758/comment/14695643","id":"14695643","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user knusbaum commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/644#issuecomment-130776850\n  \n    +1 \n    I looked through it and didn't see any obvious flaws.
