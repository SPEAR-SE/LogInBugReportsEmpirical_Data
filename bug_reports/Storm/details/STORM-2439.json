The default timeout value produces `java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Long at org.apache.storm.command.HealthCheck.processScript(HealthCheck.java:79)` because the value, 5000,Â is automatically deserialized by Jackson as an Integer, but we attempt to cast it to a long. (I successfully worked around this by setting a timeout greater than the maximum int.)\n\n2. The documentation says that a script should print \"ERROR\" if the node is unhealthy, but in fact the script must *also* exit with a non-zero exit code. This appears to be the opposite of what is intended, given a comment that says \"We treat non-zero exit codes as indicators that the scripts failed to execute properly, not that the system is unhealthy\". I believe the test in this line is inverted: https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/70102643e74d577728adf5f8719920d1bf60e98a/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/command/HealthCheck.java#L97\n\n3. Even with workarounds for the above two bugs, a failing health check does not cause workers to shut down in my testing with Storm 1.0.3. I have not determined the cause, but because the previous two issues suggest to me that this code is rarely if ever tested, I do not plan to investigate further at the moment.\n\nIf this feature is, as it appears, untested and non-functional, I would suggest that it be removed from the code and documentation.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HealthCheck feature does not work","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djudd1905","name":"djudd1905","key":"djudd1905","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Judd","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djudd1905","name":"djudd1905","key":"djudd1905","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Judd","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/STORM-2439/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3cyxb:"}}
