there appears to be no `SubSystem` class in this branch, so the addition of a `hashCode` method to it is not ported here\n    - `SchedulerAssignmentImpl` does not have an `equals` method in this branch, so the addition of a `hashCode` method is not ported here\n    - the `DefaultResourceAwareStrategy::sortNeighbors` comparator logic that was incorrectly changed in #2100 and restored in #2143 is not altered here\n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/adityasharad/storm fix/1.x/lgtm-alerts\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2149.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #2149\n    \n----\ncommit 7d7dfbb3262c34a9fd1384c7d11128aa3501142d\nAuthor: Aditya Sharad <aditya@semmle.com>\nDate:   2017-06-05T02:33:16Z\n\n    STORM-2503: Fix lgtm.com alerts on equality and comparison operations.\n    \n    Fixes several alerts involving comparison operations\n    found at https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/storm/alerts.\n\ncommit 433c95b80bc92ae111ae91bbea4da9ffd393937e\nAuthor: Robert (Bobby) Evans <evans@yahoo-inc.com>\nDate:   2017-05-15T20:55:49Z\n\n    Fixed test failure\n\n----\n","created":"2017-06-05T02:41:27.400+0000","updated":"2017-06-05T02:41:27.400+0000","started":"2017-06-05T02:41:27.397+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"43973","issueId":"13069257"}]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3eibr:"}}
