A fix was put in for this to simulate time advancement in the background while the cluster was shut down, but the code did not wait for background process to finish.  This resulted in simulated time being advanced in the background for other tests.  It is a simple fix, just wait for the background process to stop before returning.\n\nI'll put up a pull request shortly\n\n```\ndiff --git a/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/testing.clj
