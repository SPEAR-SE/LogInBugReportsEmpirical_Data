\n    Looking at the code prior to https://github.com/apache/storm/commit/861a92eab8740cfc0f83ac4d7ade9a2ab04a8b9b null routing was silently ignored.  I'm not sure that was on purpose though.  I am OK merging this in, but I really would like to understand why the destination task is showing up as null occasionally, but I see that you addressed that in the comments here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-770?focusedCommentId=14499225&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14499225\n    \n    So I am +1 for the change.
