The code in question is the task receiver, which processes tuples sent to a bolt.  It expects to see a list of tuples in a batch, not individual tuples. If an individual tuple showed up it would cause an exception like this.  There are a few places in the code where tuples are injected directly into a receiver queue, the tick tuple, and the metrics tick are the ones that come to mind, but all of them explicitly insert a list for the single tuple they put in.  There is also the possibility that something in the batching code is not handling one use case properly and not putting in a list, but without a reproducible use case it is really hard to tell.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-11-03T14:35:16.673+0000","updated":"2015-11-03T14:35:16.673+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12832411/comment/15105429","id":"15105429","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=longtimer","name":"longtimer","key":"longtimer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Kania","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Toronto"},"body":"I continue to get this happening after running for a while, but am at a loss as to the cause.
