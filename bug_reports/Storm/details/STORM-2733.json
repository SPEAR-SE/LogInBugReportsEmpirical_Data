Which made it almost impossible to recover.\n\nThe second issue was that the serialization of the tuples took a lot longer than the processing, which resulted in the send queue filling up much more quickly than the receive queue.\n\nTo help fix this issue I plan to address this in 2 ways.  First we need a better algorithm that can actually shut off the flow entirely to a very slow bolt and second we need to take the send queue into account when shuffling.\n\nThis is not a full set of changes needed by STORM-2686 but it is a step in that direction.

implementation\n\n    I have run several tests that show this works much better at big imbalances in processing latency than did the previous shuffle implementations.\n    \n    I ran some simple performance tests and because `chooseTasks` didn't change the performance was more or less identical to what was here before.\n    \n    The plan on how this would work with STORM-2686 (adding distance to shuffle) is that we would have 4 different weights (worker local, node local, rack local, and everywhere).  Each time we update the load we update all of the weights, for the min load currently in the locality group.  This is because executors may move from one group to another as things are rescheduled, so we need a way to keep it consistent.  \n    \n    We can then test a few different ways of selecting the group we want to target.  Currently we are thinking we will select the most local group that has a maximum load < .5 falling back to everything if we cannot find one.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/revans2/incubator-storm STORM-2733\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2321.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #2321\n    \n----\ncommit ba758c2507842f3c8ae94da40f21ca58adb4c3bc\nAuthor: Robert (Bobby) Evans <evans@yahoo-inc.com>\nDate:   2017-08-24T16:13:08Z\n\n    STORM-2733: Better load aware shuffle implementation\n\n----\n","created":"2017-09-11T20:22:22.458+0000","updated":"2017-09-11T20:22:22.458+0000","started":"2017-09-11T20:22:22.457+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"52119","issueId":"13100857"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13100857/worklog/52589","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2321\n","created":"2017-09-14T15:33:01.864+0000","updated":"2017-09-14T15:33:01.864+0000","started":"2017-09-14T15:33:01.862+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"52589","issueId":"13100857"}]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3jtx3:"}}
