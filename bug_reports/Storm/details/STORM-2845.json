I know a case, but the source codes on standalone mode code are migrated to the project (and modified to conform to the project) and the project no longer depends on Storm SQL.\r\n\r\nIf we all don't have any other case, how about dropping it and only concentrate to trident mode?\r\n(Btw, I'm trying to replace the backend on Storm SQL from Trident to Streams API, which may make the mode name obsolete, but after dropping standalone mode we don't even need the name for mode since there will be only one mode.)\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nDiscussion
