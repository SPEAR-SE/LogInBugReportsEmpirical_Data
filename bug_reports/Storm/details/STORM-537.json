The bug is that a worker reconnects to another dead worker infinitely when it tries to send a batch of messages. Each message in a batch causes a new reconnect. More details are in the jira issue.\n    \n    Pull request contains a simple fix and tests. Actually there is \"test-reconnect-to-permanently-failed-server\" which is exactly for this bug. There is also \"test-reconnect-to-temporarily-failed-server\" which was written just-for-fun, because this functionality is not covered by other tests.\n    \n    Note, that storm with applied fix works well and fixed the issue on our staging environment.\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/Sergeant007/storm

the review, @clockfly \n    \n    I have added necessary comment and removed the tests. Sorry, I wasn't able to simplify them - if they were in simple synchronous mode, the tests would hang infinitely if smth. is wrong instead of failures. So I've implemented them in quite complicated (since I'm new in Clojure), but robust way. Another issue was in complexity of reproducing of the bug: 1. you should be already connected and 2. it is reproduced only if you send several messages at once. Anyway, I have removed the tests as you asked me.
