They're supposed to be internal to Trident.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-10T21:50:00.679+0000","updated":"2016-03-10T21:50:00.679+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12948570/comment/15190014","id":"15190014","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user knusbaum commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1199#discussion_r55755714\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/TridentTopology.java ---\n    @@ -409,16 +427,26 @@ public StormTopology build() {\n                         throw new RuntimeException(\"Regular rich spouts not supported yet... try wrapping in a RichSpoutBatchExecutor\");\n                         // TODO: handle regular rich spout without batches (need lots of updates to support this throughout)\n                     }\n    -                builder.setSpout(spoutIds.get(sn), sn.streamId, sn.txId, s, parallelism, batchGroupMap.get(sn));\n    +                builder.setSpout(spoutIds.get(sn), sn.streamId, sn.txId, s, parallelism, batchGroupMap.get(sn))\n    +                    .setMemoryLoad(onHeap, offHeap)\n    +                    .setCPULoad(cpuLoad);\n                 }\n             }\n    -        \n    +\n             for(Group g: mergedGroups) {\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    I would be very happy to change this terrible name if it were in new code, but I don't want to start refactoring unrelated things in this PR.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-10T21:51:43.156+0000","updated":"2016-03-10T21:51:43.156+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12948570/comment/15190017","id":"15190017","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user knusbaum commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1199#discussion_r55755996\n  \n    --- Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/topology/ResourceDeclarer.java ---\n    @@ -0,0 +1,24 @@\n    +/**\n    + * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n    + * or more contributor license agreements.

First off, your example won't compile. `persistentAggregate` returns a `TridentState`, which doesn't have a `name` method. Okay, well we can move the name call up to just below the groupBy. It's a little confusing being right in the middle, but groupBy returns a `GroupedStream`, which has a name method. Unfortunately, you end up with all your bolts being named \"b-*-aggregate\" because 'GroupedStream' just renames the stream before it. In fact, except for differentiating between the spout and body, I don't see any existing way to give different sections different names, and doing so is not a simple change, and not one that is going to be backwards-compatible.\n    \n    I agree with your point in principle, but how much do we want to change the existing API to accommodate it?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-14T22:30:58.706+0000","updated":"2016-03-14T22:30:58.706+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12948570/comment/15194462","id":"15194462","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user ptgoetz commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1199#issuecomment-196585455\n  \n    I lean toward making this part of the Stream API, just like parallelismHint().

I've been a little unclear on what should go in and what shouldn't.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-17T20:18:17.933+0000","updated":"2016-03-17T20:18:17.933+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12948570/comment/15200310","id":"15200310","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user ptgoetz commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1199#issuecomment-198068879\n  \n    @knusbaum Yeah, you're right. :) I always try to wait based on last patch. We should think about changing that.\n    \n    As far as pulling it into 1.x, I am +1 for it. Although it is a new feature, it builds on top of the core storm RAS feature and I feel it would round out the release. I'd rather 1.x have RAS support for both APIs than just core storm.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-17T20:29:32.049+0000","updated":"2016-03-17T20:29:32.049+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12948570/comment/15200314","id":"15200314","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user knusbaum commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1199#issuecomment-198069480\n  \n    @ptgoetz Makes sense to me.
