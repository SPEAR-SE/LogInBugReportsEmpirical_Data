On the most recent occasion it had a max spout pending of 4 and there were 4 transactions in zookeeper. We are using transactional topologies and the final bolt in the topology is a global grouping with only one task. We have verified that the first transaction finished successfully right up to the last line of the finish batch, but the tx is still in zookeeper and all of the other transactions are waiting on it. I know transactional topologies have been deprecated, but regardless this shouldn't happen unless the acks are being dropped. We have had a bunch of similar issues since moving to the netty based versions and I think there is a serious reliability issue with them. Sorry I can't provide code to replicate the issue because the problem is intermittent.
