When the user kills  we don't erase /transactional data upon killing of a topology. After user re-deploys the topology even if its the same user the auth digest will change and which will cause it thrown an ACL exception when trying to access previous transactional data.\n\n1) add topology_name under /transactional . currenlty it uses /transacational/spou1 . \n2) delete /transactional/topology_name data if user kills a topology.\n\ndeleting the /transactional nodes probably not a good option .

In the ideal world nimbus would recognize the two trident topologies were related and could then update the ACLs accordingly, if they were owned by an appropriate user.  The issue is that nimbus is not actually aware of the transactional state in any way.  Trident is really a library sitting on top of core storm, and the transactional state could even be updated to point to a different ZK instance that nimbus is not aware of.  These are the reasons why we went with the quick and dirty solution.\n\nI thought I had updated the documentation to include this, but looking at it now I see I didn't.
