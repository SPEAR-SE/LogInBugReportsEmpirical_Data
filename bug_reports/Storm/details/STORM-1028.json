To set up the right context for re-processing the stream in a deterministic way, they need to sync their view with the incoming old data. To be able to do this, they need knowledge of the event sequenceNumber and partition.\n\nFor example, if you have a bolt that calculates total_order_amount for a stream of orders, and emits order tuples with the total_order_amount calculated for all previous orders, replaying an order event should not change total_order_amount. I.e. orders with a higher sequenceNumber than the order being processed should not be included in total_order_amount.\n\nThis synchronisation can be achieved if the bolt has access to the parition and sequenceNumber from eventHub.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Eventhub

doesn't work for people who implement their own IEventDataScheme class.
