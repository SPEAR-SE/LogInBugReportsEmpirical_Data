This requires implementing all kinds of queries supported by cql just to map column names which is kind of unnecessary. Cassandra connector API should be agnostic about the cql by simply using datastax driver. This avoids implementing any new features being added in cql by cassandra connector APIs. We should support only simple/prepared/batched statement builder by giving respective API to map columns with tuples.\nhttps://github.com/apache/storm/pull/827#issuecomment-158807186\n\n\n@satishd, @harshach ok perfect.
