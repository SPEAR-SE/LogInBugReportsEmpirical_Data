I did some debugging on Travis on my fork and found 2 issues\n    \n    - The behavior of binding to _localhost_ seems somewhat inconsistent for Zookeeper and Kafka.  I noticed a bunch of ZK connection issues trying to connect to the hostname of the travis machine that wouldn't resolve.  Using _127.0.0.1_ fixes this\n    - More importantly, there were timing issues related to creating the topic and the partition leaders being assigned.  `DynamicBrokersReader#getNumPartitions` will fail if the topic doesn't yet have leaders assigned to its partitions and this was the root of the NPE.  \n    \n    I fixed the second issue by waiting until the topic is fully ready in kafka (exists in zookeeper and all partitions have leaders) before attempting to use it.  I also adjusted the logic around emitting messages from the partition manager to allow for timing delays on the broker end as this was another cause of spurious failures.\n    \n    I've also adjusted the _integration-test_ parent pom version to match the current one in the branch.  It looks like this was missed when the version was bumped to _1.2.0-SNAPSHOT_\n","created":"2017-07-08T22:51:53.675+0000","updated":"2017-07-08T22:51:53.675+0000","started":"2017-07-08T22:51:53.672+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"47292","issueId":"13083590"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13083590/worklog/47295","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2182\n  \n    @kevinconaway \n    Great.
