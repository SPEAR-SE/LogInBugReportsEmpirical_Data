not showing correct values for component CPU, Memory and Executors\n\n    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3023\r\n    \r\n    (1) The component page of the UI is showing a blank for requested resources (CPU and Memory).\r\n    (2) for the topology page what is being showed for them is the total for the entire topology, not individual components.\r\n    \r\n    It's because the storm rest api code is using wrong keys. The component `requestedMemOnHeap` is null and then the `Mustache` in ui code uses `requestedMemOnHeap` from the parent (which is the total sum)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    (3) And the executors of components in topology page shows wrong numbers. \r\n    This is a bug introduced when porting clojure to java https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1147\r\n    The number of executors of components gets accumulated incorrectly \n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/Ethanlm/storm STORM-3023\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2629.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #2629\n    \n----\ncommit a50c2b145e6403447aa6d7e4b74b80e80171b5d9\nAuthor: Ethan Li <ethanopensource@...>\nDate:   2018-04-09T23:16:41Z\n\n    [STORM-3023] fix the issue that Storm UI not showing correct values for component CPU, Memory and Executors\n\n----\n","created":"2018-04-10T19:50:20.652+0000","updated":"2018-04-10T19:50:20.652+0000","started":"2018-04-10T19:50:20.652+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"89580","issueId":"13151379"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13151379/worklog/89581","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user Ethanlm commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2629\n  \n    Tested manually.\r\n    \r\n    Topology page:\r\n    \r\n    ![screen shot 2018-04-10 at 2 36 44 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14900612/38580043-881b328a-3cce-11e8-9dfd-b41c77820748.png)\r\n    \r\n    Component page:\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-04-10 at 2 51 07 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14900612/38580071-9e33280c-3cce-11e8-82ca-a488e58cb00a.png)\r\n\n","created":"2018-04-10T19:51:27.008+0000","updated":"2018-04-10T19:51:27.008+0000","started":"2018-04-10T19:51:27.008+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"89581","issueId":"13151379"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13151379/worklog/90905","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2629\n","created":"2018-04-13T17:32:22.018+0000","updated":"2018-04-13T17:32:22.018+0000","started":"2018-04-13T17:32:22.017+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"90905","issueId":"13151379"}]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3sdcf:"}}
