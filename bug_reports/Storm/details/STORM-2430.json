And program it to fail on some random tuples. For eg: say tuple number 10 fails. Also assume  there is only 1 Kafka partition the spout reads from.\n\nSpout on first execution of nextTuple() gets 110 records and emits them. At this point number of uncommitted message would be 110.\nFirst 9 tuples are acked by the bolt. 10th tuple is failed by the bolt. KafkaSpout puts it on retry queue.\nTuple number 11 to 110 are acked by bolt . But spout only commits till offset 9.[link | https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/1.0.x-branch/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpout.java#L510]\n\nNow, the number of uncommitted  messages = 110 - 9 = 101 > 100 (max allowed uncommitted messages)\nNo new records are polled from kafka.[link | https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/1.0.x-branch/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpout.java#L239].
