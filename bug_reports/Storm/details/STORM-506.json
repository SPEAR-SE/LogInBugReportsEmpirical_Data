So this PR is to revert the functionality back to what it was before\n    the client-side rendering feature in the UI.\n    \n    \n    \n    > If I don't enable acking it doesn't show me any stats.\n    \n    Yeah, the spouts need to give an ID when they emit, or else they will not\n    expect any ack when that ID completes processing.  This ID sticks with all\n    downstream tuples thoughout the tuple \"tree.\"\n    \n    If you take storm.starter.clj.word_count, for example, unmodified, you will see\n    exactly what you are describing, because the code has two spouts and neither of\n    them give an ID when they emit a tuple.  Individual bolts can still ack, but\n    you will not see them turn up in the spout stats.\n    \n    Adding the `:id` keyword parameter fixes this.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-10-03T15:25:56.213+0000","updated":"2014-10-03T15:25:56.213+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12743709/comment/14158267","id":"14158267","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user harshach commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/267#issuecomment-57832285\n  \n    @d2r thanks for the details .
