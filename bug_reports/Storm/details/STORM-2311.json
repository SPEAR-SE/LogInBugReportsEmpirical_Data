the cluster cant's access storâ€¦\n\n    JIRA Issue: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2311](url)\n    \n    when storm cluster is in a security mode such as kerberos,We can not use a browser which is outside the cluster to access storm ui,even if we remove the configuration item which named ui.filter.There is a mistake like \"server 500\",because those methods to get cluster's info for ui can't access the cluster which is in a security mode.\n    It's not necessary to limit users to get the general information when storm cluster is in a security mode,so it's not necessary to limit a Get-Request.What should we do is to limit the Post-Request,preventing the external users to kill the topology,deactivate the topology and so on... We only should ensure users can't operator the cluster with the RestApi.\n    \n    \n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/liu-zhaokun/storm-1 master\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1890.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #1890\n    \n----\ncommit 927a05eacf1d0b11e50e8def6dc4f7e67c1497cd\nAuthor: liuzhaokun <liu.zhaokun@zte.com.cn>\nDate:   2017-01-20T06:29:54Z\n\n    [STORM-2311]A browser which is outside the cluster cant's access storm ui when storm cluster in a security mode\n\n----\n","created":"2017-01-20T06:51:02.783+0000","updated":"2017-01-20T06:51:02.783+0000","started":"2017-01-20T06:51:02.783+0000","timeSpent":"10m","timeSpentSeconds":600,"id":"36040","issueId":"13036395"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13036395/worklog/36539","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"comment":"Github user harshach commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1890\n  \n    @liu-zhaokun we shouldn't be removing authorize methods.
