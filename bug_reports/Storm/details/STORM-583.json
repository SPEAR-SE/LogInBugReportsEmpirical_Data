The code itself looks OK, but I am not comfortable voting on it either way with my current knowledge.  \n    \n    I am a bit nervous about pulling this in as we don't have a very good way to test it beyond the unit tests. EventHubs is a Microsoft Azure specific system.  I cannot spin up my own instance of it to validate that the code is doing what I expect prior to a release.  Although it may be a bit painful, I can do that for Kafka, Redis, HDFS, and HBase integration that we have accepted in so far.  That doesn't mean we cannot/should not pull it in.  To me it mostly means that we need more assurances and support prior to doing so. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-01-23T16:05:37.425+0000","updated":"2015-01-23T16:05:37.425+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12759305/comment/14290432","id":"14290432","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user sasincj commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/336#issuecomment-71300125\n  \n    @revans2 Without storm-eventhubs, Developers who are using storm with eventhub has to write their own Spout to receive the events.
