If the worker gets re-spawned on the same slot (port), the topology stops processing. But if the worker re-spawns on a different port, topology processing continues normally.\n\nThe Storm cluster configuration is pretty standard, there are two Supervisor nodes, one node has also Nimbus, UI and DRPC running on it. I have four slots per Supervisor, and run my test topology with setNumWorkers set to 8 so that it occupies all eight slots across the cluster. Killing a worker in this configuration will always re-spawn the worker on the same node and slot (port), thus causing the topology to stop processing. This is 100% reproducible on a few Storm clusters of mine, across multiple Storm versions (0.9.0.1, 0.9.1, 0.9.2).\n\nI have reproduced this with multiple Trident topologies, the simplest of which is the TridentWordCount topology from storm-starter. I've just modified it a little to add an additional Trident filter to log the tuple throughput: https://github.com/dschiavu/storm-trident-stuck-topology\n\nNon-transactional Trident topologies just silently stop processing, while transactional topologies continuously retry the batches and are re-emitted by the spout, however they never get processed by the next bolts in the chain so they time out.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"406045","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Trident topologies getting stuck when using Netty transport (reproducible)","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dschiavu","name":"dschiavu","key":"dschiavu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Danijel Schiavuzzi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dschiavu","name":"dschiavu","key":"dschiavu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Danijel Schiavuzzi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":"Linux, OpenJDK 7","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12727920/comment/14073515","id":"14073515","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ppoulosk","name":"ppoulosk","key":"ppoulosk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Poulosky","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"We were able to reproduce this outside of Trident, using a modified Exclamation topology that has two workers and parallelism of 1 on the spouts and bolts.\n\n    Word-Spout (worker1)\n              |\n              V\n      Exclaim 1 (worker1)\n              | \n              V\n      Exclaim 2 (worker2)\n\nIf the worker2 containing the downstream bolt is killed and relaunched, the upstream worker does not recognize that the connection went down, and makes no attempt to reconnect.\n\nWe are working on a fix and will submit a patch soon.
