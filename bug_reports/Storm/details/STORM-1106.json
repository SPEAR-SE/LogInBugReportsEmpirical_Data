But initial startup ( requires supervisor to read assignments/download code/launch workers.) which could mean much more than that. \n    \n    The `StormBoundedExponentialBackoffRetry` lets you go beyond max attempts to give you 1sec sleep until you succeed. So, the workerA should keep trying unless nimbus informs workerA that workerB ( is no longer working on that port.)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF
