[It is not a bug but limitation of current LocalCluster.

Flux uses LocalCluster(String zkHost, Long zkPort) when "local" and "zookeeper" are configured.

{code}
options.addOption(option(1, "z", OPTION_ZOOKEEPER, "host:port", "When running in local mode, use the ZooKeeper at the specified <host>:<port> instead of the in-process ZooKeeper. (requires Storm 0.9.3 or later)"));
{code}

I'm wondering that we may want to support multiple zk servers with local cluster.
If we're fine to leave as is, this issue can be resolved as "Not A Problem"., Thanks. I will close this issue as "Not A Problem".]
