[[~revans2] : seems this issue is fixed with the LogWriter that was introduced in storm-0.10.0.  I cannot find a ticket for that feature to link this against though., If you know the file that was changed, or some code that was changed as a part of it, both blame and history can be big helps in getting the traceability.  We don't squash commits though so it can sometimes not give you what you want.  But in this case it works out OK, but you may need to expand the commit comment to find the JIRA number

https://github.com/apache/storm/commits/0.10.x-branch/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/LogWriter.java

STORM-833

and the pull request for it shows LogWriter being added.
