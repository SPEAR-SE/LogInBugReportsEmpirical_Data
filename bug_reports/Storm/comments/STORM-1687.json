, [~zhuoliu] You added this issue to the epic. Does it mean that you're going to vote -1 on RC2 and add this before shipping?, Just found that rc2 is already out, do we think we should add this bug fix to the 1.0.0 list and call an rc3 vote? [~kabhwan] [~ptgoetz]
This issue happened to our production, though not causing anything to crash., It depends on the priority of the issue.
If priority of the issue is critical or blocker, we just vote -1 with issue description on release vote thread.
IMO, if it doesn't crash anything (thus marked as non-critical or blocker), we could remove this issue from epic and add this as 1.0.1., Github user unsleepy22 commented on the pull request:
