    If we want to remove warning message because this is not a part of design, how about modifying this comment as well?
    Maybe like this : `This should be the metrics, and it always picks the last one when more than one metrics messages are available.`

    nit: Can we have a debug statement saying more than one task message received instead of the removed warning message?

    +1, would like minor nit to be addressed.

    I'm also OK for this approach. If we pick this, comment doesn't need to be modified.

, Thanks [~dagit], I merged into master, 1.x, 1.0.x branches., Hi,[~dagit],there are some WARN like this in my cluster with storm 1.0.2,do you mean it doesn't matter? Can it indicate that my network latency is high?Look forwards to your reply,thx , {quote}do you mean it doesn't matter?
{quote}
Correct. You may safely ignore the message. It was added originally to indicate a failure mode, but it turned out that receiving multiple of these metric messages can happen also when things are OK.

I would not worry about it.]
