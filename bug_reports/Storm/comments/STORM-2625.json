[STORM-2625: reduce uncommitted count when kafka consumer group re-assign partitions, Thanks for reporting the JIRA [~GuangDu].  This looks to be side affect of using auto subscription ( kafka consumer balancing the partition subscription). This shouldn't be an issue if you use manual subscription, more details are here https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/docs/storm-kafka-client.md#manual-partition-control-advanced . Can you give it a try with manual subscription and report your findings. , Thank you [~sriharsha] for pointing out another direction.
We had some discussion in the pull request above, Stig DÃ¸ssing implemented another version of tracking auto re-balanced partitions per partition in Storm Kafka Client module, so to fix the side effect of auto subscription. Personally I think it looks promising.
I'll look into the manual subscription in detail to see what I could do. Thank you again for the info., [~GuangDu] please note that manual subscription doesn't work until version 1.2.0 (1.x-branch). If you use the spout from that branch it will use manual subscription by default., I think STORM-2549 addressed this issue. Closing. Thanks for reporting!]
