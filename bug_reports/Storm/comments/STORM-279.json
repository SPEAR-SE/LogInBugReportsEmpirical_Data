[also storm.py doesn't contain any code for looking STORM_LOG_DIR like its in storm.cmd, Please take a look at the patch. It contains the changes to cluster.xml and storm.py.
Thanks,
Harsha, The changes that are being made for STORM_LOG_DIR will only impact nimbus, supervisor, ui, and logviewer.  They are not being set when the worker is launched so the worker logs will probably end up trying to be written to "/worker-...log" which I don't think is what we want., [~revans2] Thanks for comments. Attached patch contains changes to supervisor.clj which takes storm.log.dir and passes it to worker., I did some manual tests and the code works as designed.  I would prefer to have this be a storm config instead of an environment variable, but I am OK with it the way it is.  +1, GitHub user harshach opened a pull request:

    STORM-279. cluster.xml doesn't take in STORM_LOG_DIR values

    instead of using env var changed it to read from config
    if user defines storm.log.dir log files goto that particular dir otherwise it will be under storm.home/logs

    changed from using env var to read from conf file
    user can add storm.log.dir to storm.yaml to specify a different location to storm logs
    default it uses storm.dir/logs

    This needs an up-merge, and it would be good if we could remove the differences that are white-space only.
