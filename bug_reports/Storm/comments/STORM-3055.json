[thr problem is caused by context's connection cache.
for example supervisor with id 'a' restart with local version store corrupt , then it will generate an other id 'b' (as an example).
when 'b' is up, then nimbus will assign some task on 'b', if old assignment is [a:6700, c:6700],  the new assignment is [b:6700, c:6700]
 then task c:6700 will first connect [b:6700] then close and remove connection [a:6700],  
since a, b is the same ip so b:6700 will share connection a:6700. but the same connection will close by remove , this problem can be reproduced by:
first set up 2 two supervisor (name a, b), each with one slot, and submit a topology with network traffic between two works.
then the kill one supervisor (name a), remove the local state with the supervisor.  and kill work supervisored by a. then restart supervisor a
by follow this you can see worker on b print error log.
(remove the local state is to simulate localState corruption, which happens on our production environment), Thanks for the hard work. It looks like this will fix STORM-1560 STORM-2108 STORM-2596, Thanks I merged this into master, 1.x and 1.1.x.  It didn't apply cleanly to 1.0.x but I don't think that line is supported any more.]
