[Hi.

Please use English when raising issues.

Here's a quick Google translate:

{quote}
Spout in the nextTuple may pull more than one kafka message, will remain in the _waitingToEmit, and then launch one by one, even if the TOPOLOGY_MAX_SPOUT_PENDING set to 1, when the first tuple is defeated, the bolt will still receive follow-up Message until _waitingToEmit is completely transmitted.

This and I think TOPOLOGY_MAX_SPOUT_PENDING is not the same meaning, I hope that the message can be strictly processed one by one, my topology worker number, spout and bolt parallelism are set to 1
{quote}

TOPOLOGY_MAX_SPOUT_PENDING is only supposed to control how many tuples are being processed in the topology at one time. The spout is free to fetch a number of messages, as long as it doesn't emit more than one at a time.

It sounds like you're looking for a way to prevent the spout from fetching more than one record at a time. I'm not sure you can do this with the storm-kafka spout, but if you upgrade to storm-kafka-client, you can set the max.poll.records property to 1, which will prevent the consumer from fetching more than one record at a time., ThanksÂ [~Srdo].

Your answer is very helpful to me., [~wu.yong@neusoft.com] Happy to help. Going to close this issue, since it sounds like your question was answered. Please feel free to reopen if you think there's still something we should change or talk about here.]
