    Please change the catch block to explicitly return nil. Don't depend on log-warn to do that for you.

    We may want to consider applying this to the 0.9.x branch as well.

    @ptgoetz I will create new jira for 0.9.x branch and apply the fix.
    @nathanmarz given this is blocking the release and you have a -1 vote I would really appreciate if you could take some time to review this again.
