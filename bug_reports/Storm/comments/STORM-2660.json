Are you seeing it only in Windows, or other OS like Linux or MacOS as well?, [~kabhwan] It's also an issue on Linux. 
{code}
srdo@srdo-VirtualBox:~$ ./apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/storm nimbus
{code}
produces a storm-local directory at ~/storm-local instead of ~/apache-storm-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/storm-local as expected. Doing the same thing with "storm supervisor" puts the storm-local directory in the right place.

I don't have a Mac to test, but I'd be surprised if this wasn't an issue there too., [~Srdo] 
Thanks for clarifying. I guess we have related issue before as well (though the summary is less descriptive) so would like to see two's relevance.
