    STORM-1655 Flux doesn't set return code to non-zero when there's any exception while deploying topology to remote cluster

    * Modify Flux.runCli() to not catching exceptions so that exception can be propagated to main()
    
    JVM sets exit code to 1 when exception is propagated to main() and even main() doesn't catch it.
    
    ```
