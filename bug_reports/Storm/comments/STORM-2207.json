[I believe this is a race condition between acking a message as soon as the topology comes online versus initialization of the kafka spout to insert the topic partitions in the ack topic map., I also experienced the same error! And my topology in production failed to start because of many errors like this.
So I tested using small sets such as 2 worker or 5 spout, and it failed as well.
(FYI - The topic has almost hundred parittions), strom1.0.2 ,"enable.auto.commit" default is false,you can change it .then retry., Fixed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2104, This is still a problem in 1.0.3 release (try to migrate from 0.9.6).
This problem occurs when Kafka Coordinator decides to rebalance for some reason. Then KafkaSpout throw NPE because does not know what to do in acked Map for the incoming acked tuple.
STORM-2104 seems to handle that problem, but it is only available for 2.x and 1.1.x branches., This is still a problem in 0.10 release , This appears to be a duplicate of STORM-2104 as [~f1sherox] mentioned. The bug should be fixed in the fix versions listed there. Please let us know if the bug is still present in those versions or later.

[~wangliang938] mentioned a temporary workaround. It is a fine fix in some cases, but please note that this workaround can lead to message loss, so you should prefer upgrading to a Storm version where this is fixed.]
