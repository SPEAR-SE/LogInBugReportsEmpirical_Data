[I think this might the same thing I saw with building the master branch on JDK 1.7 on OSX.

On OS X its manifests as a sementation fault (jvm crash). But it doesn't happen with 1.8.

Can you try with 1.8?, This test is now running fine for me on master (1059735f78bb5e7a15831e1d225ca9f97df06f8d), still with JDK7, so some recent change has solved it.]
