[[~gkhare] Can you please update jira with java ,maven versions., [~sriharsha] Updated the environment info., [~gkhare] 
I tried on OS X 10.9.2 with maven-3.2.1 with java 1.7.0_55 and 1.6.0_65 
on Windows 7 with maven-3.2.1 and java 1.7.0_55 my build went through fine for the 
latest from git.
I would try deleting ~/.m2 dir and run mvn clean package.
, Is this still an issue?  If it is you can try compiling with clojure version 0.6.0-alpha2 it has a fix in it that allows the error to be output.  If not please close this., Closing this ticket because no response on it, in a long time.  If it is still an issue, reopen.]
