Whoops, the issue is that we didn't expect Storm to ask the spout for metrics while the spout is deactivated. We close the consumer when the spout is deactivated. When Storm then asks for metrics, the spout tries to use the consumer to get e.g. how far behind the latest offset the consumer is, which throws this exception. 

I'll take a look at fixing this, unless you want to?, [~Srdo]

Please go ahead for fixing the issue, I may take time to find and come up with a patch

There are two scenarios of issues:
 # Deactivate storm topology and after some time produce some data into Kafka, we'll get the above mentioned exception. If we don't produce any data there won't be any issues.
 # Kill Kafka broker then we'll get the exception in checking offset lag (which you have mentioned)

Â , [~Ajeesh] I've fixed the metrics issue. Could you try it out and see if it resolves the problems you're having? The code is available at https://github.com/srdo/storm/tree/STORM-3013-1.x., Just to clarify, the only changes are in storm-kafka-client, so you only need to build that part of Storm., [~Ajeesh] Kindly reminder, did the fix resolve your problem?, [~Srdo] Sorry, I was not in a situation to test the fix. If someone else could test the fix it'll be helpful. If possible I'll test this fix in this week., Thanks [~Srdo], I merged into master.

The patch wasn't applied to 1.x-branch cleanly. Could you please raise a PR for 1.x-branch as well? Thanks in advance!, Also merged into 1.x-branch.]
