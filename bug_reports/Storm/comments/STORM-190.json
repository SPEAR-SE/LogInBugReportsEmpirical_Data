[who can explain this phenomenon to me? And in different storm release, I got different results., We need more information to make sense of this:

How many supervisors in your cluster?

How many ports per supervisor?

Do you have both topologies deployed at the same time?

Screenshot of Storm UI would probably suffice., ok, I will give it.

How many supervisors in your cluster?
3 supervisors.

How many ports per supervisor?
15 slots(ports) per supervisor. And supervisor's config as follows:
 supervisor.slots.ports:
    - 6700
    - 6701
    - 6702
    - 6703
    - 6704
    - 6705
    - 6706
    - 6707
    - 6708
    - 6709
    - 6710
    - 6711
    - 6712
    - 6713
    - 6714
 supervisor.childopts: "-Xmx1024m "

Do you have both topologies deployed at the same time?
I have run 3 WordCountTopology named "wc-test", "wc-test2", "wc-test3", which have been shown already.

Screenshot of Storm UI would probably suffice.
please see the attach file. this is a new screenshot, do not have duplicated WordCountTopology., The numbers are correct. The difference is that in 0.9.0 Storm defaults the number of ackers to be equal to the number of workers (each acker uses an executor).

So for your word count topology, adding up the parallelism you get:

5 + 8 + 12 = 25

Then add 3 for the number of workers/ackers:

25 + 3 = 28

So the numbers are correct., edited last comment (my math isn't _that_ bad), thanks, got it. by the way, is there some place to describe this difference?, Not A Problem]
