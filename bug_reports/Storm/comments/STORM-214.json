    STORM-214. Windows: storm.cmd does not properly handle multiple -c arguments

    :combine-fn merge doesn't have any affect on multiple args. New version of cli provides a  :assoc-fn capability which can be used  to merge multiple params for same arg. 
    Tested on linux and windows.

    I got confused by my own mistake (typo in the original JIRA). The "-c" in the title should be a "-e".
