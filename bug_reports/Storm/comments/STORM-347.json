    Could you add @Override annotations, and unless the javadocs are different from the interface they override are really not needed here.

    This is likely to be called very frequently and fork/exec are not fast.  We should implement some of the caching the Interface suggests should be going on.

    For the most part the code looks really good.  I am concerned about not having any caching in the groups implementation, even if it expires after just a couple of seconds.  I also don't think we need to expose the caching APIs explicitly.  They can probably just be an implementation detail.  If you want to put in the caching in a follow on JIRA that is fine too.  Getting the API in place is probably the most critical.
    
    I am fine with you borrowing some code from Hadoop to make this simpler.  No need to reinvent the wheel.  But there are already some Shell utilities in storm that do similar things.
    
    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/utils/ShellProcess.java
    
    It would be good to file a follow on JIRA to look at how we can combine the two together so we don't have two classes that do almost the same thing.

    @revans2 Thanks for the feedback. Regarding caching methods in  the interface these are provided for potential plugins which might be fetching group info from ldap or active directory and can add caching to those calls.
    Regarding ShellProcess I will work in integrating that into ShellUtils.

    This plugin will be called Authorizer.permit method which is only get checked if there is any operation being performed on the cluster or topology. I don't think it will be that frequent that it requires caching. If you think otherwise let me know I'll add the caching.

    Right now you are probably correct, but I was thinking about DRPC.  I would like to add this to the DRPC authorization, and that would require caching.  So lets leave it for now, and I'll file a JIRA for adding groups support to DRPC, and include some caching in there too.

    OK I am fine with leaving the APIs there, if you have plans to use them in the near future, especially with Active directory for windows support.

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/166#issuecomment-49674242
  
    @revans2 I added caching to ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping class using TimeCacheMap with a config option. I removed caching related apis from the interface as you suggested didn't feel they are useful while implementing the above caching. 
    Is it ok if I do the merge for ShellProcess and ShellUtils in another JIRA. 
, Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/166#issuecomment-50172155
  
    Yes, feel free to do the merge on another JIRA.  The code looks good.  There are a lot of white space changes to Config.java, but I don't think that is too critical.
    
    I would like to see ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping drop the Unix in it's name.  Looks like it will work with Windows too.  Also it would be good to have some tests for this code.  I am fine with some simple unit tests that look at the groups code in isolation.  I realize it may be hard to do this cleanly for Windows/Unix etc, especially when you don't know what user is running the tests.  But perhaps just a sanity test that you can get something back without it blowing up.

    Thanks @revans2 . I added a simple unit test and dropped the "unix" from the file name. Please check.

    The change looks good to me.  Let me run through the tests and if it all checks out I am +1.
