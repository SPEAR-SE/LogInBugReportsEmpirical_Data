[HBaseSecurityUtil uses legacyprovider.login(), which finally ends up in UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromKeytab() which modifies the static loginUser (currently logged in user) and this is causing issues if two tasks in the same jvm login with different credentials. 

The entire login method should rather be re-written to not affect the current user during login.]
