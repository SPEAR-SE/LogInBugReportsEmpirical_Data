[I think if you hav AutoHDFS configured you do not need to specify keytabs because of this condition https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/hdfs/common/security/HdfsSecurityUtil.java#L44

I never had a chance to test AutoTGT but if we can confirm it works as expected this jira is still valid., Sorry I cherry-picked some code and missed the change that added in AutoHDFS support.  Still needs AutoTGT support though., GitHub user revans2 opened a pull request:

    +1. I do not have a secure hdfs setup right now so if you can confirm that you were able to test this with AutoTGT that would be great.

    @Parth-Brahmbhatt I did run with this on one of our secure clusters.  It was not exactly the same code, as our version is older and does not have the AutoHDFS in it.  Which is why I originally filed the JIRA incorrectly and said it should support that too.
