[I mentioned it in the PR but adding it here in case it was missed: 

I had a parallel effort which arrived at most of the same conclusions before discovering this JIRA.

There is a bug with activate/deactivate where the spout continues to call nextTuple() but never emits new messages. I'm not sure if it is scoped to the manual partition work or is a general bug. Would you consider a fix here for that or a new JIRA?

Since posting that, I have a fix for nulling out the currentAssignment and it enables the ability to deactivate and activate, however, I'm seeing duplicates during reactivate.  I'm also seeing duplicates if you kill the topology and start it back up at 'uncommitted_earliest' , [~kristopherkane] thanks for your comments. Have you tested this patch as is and noticed the duplicates you mention? I would suggest that if there is a bug here, that we fix it on top of this change., How would you like to work together on this PR?  PRs to your fork or patches here? 
Your patch works well.  The duplicates and the activate/deactivate problems are not related to your patch as they are problems in KafkaSpout and the original Manual* subscription capabilities.  It looks like during KafkaSpout.shutdown() only the ack'd tuples are then committed back to Kafka but I believe that isn't accounting for other tuples in flight.  That fact might be by design for 'at least once' but I wonder if there is a way to wait for n seconds (based on topology kill time) to see if the remaining inflight tuples.  I don't recall the same duplicate behavior for in flight tuples when using storm-kafka but never looked for it specifically.  , [~hmclouro] Is this issue still valid, or can we close it?]
