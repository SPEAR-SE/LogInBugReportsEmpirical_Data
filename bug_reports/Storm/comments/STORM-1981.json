[The code indicates that your command is looking to pull in {{org.apache.ranger.authorization.storm.authorizer.RangerStormAuthorizer}} but could not find it.  This is not a part of storm, it appears to be a part of ranger, so my guess would be that you need to include ranger, or part of it on your classpath.  You could do this by putting it in the lib directory under the storm.home directory. You might also want to try asking on the ranger or storm user mailing lists, because honestly I don't use ranger.  At this point it does not look like a bug in storm, it looks like user error or an issue with your configuration, so I am going to close this JIRA.  If you disagree that it is actually a bug in storm feel free to reopen this., [~revans2] When I run a storm command I expect it to complete in a reasonable time. In this case I expect that it will complete saying - client code did not finish in say 30 sec and hence was forcibly killed., OK Makes since thanks for clarifying [~raghavgautam]]
