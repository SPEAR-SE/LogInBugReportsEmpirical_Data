    How can we get this patch. 
    We have storm 1.0.1 release deployed in current production environment, and has the same issue.
    Can you please provide the link for the patch, or steps to generate the patch.

    @abhishej This will be part of the next release i.e. 1.0.2. If you want it now, you could clone the 1.0.x branch (or the 1.0.1 tag and cherry-pick the commit). You can build the distribution by following the steps - https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#packaging
