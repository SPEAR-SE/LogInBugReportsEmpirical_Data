[I'm planning on fixing this by wrapping the few places the path separator is used as a regex in a function that'll sanitize it first. I'll submit a PR for this tomorrow.

I had a look at the Java version in master and it doesn't seem to be affected, but I haven't had a chance to test it yet. , [~lawrence.craft] The master branch was fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2716. You might be able to backport that fix to resolve this issue., Thanks, I'll take a look at that. I don't think it'll be fully portable as the LogViewer has been moved from clojure->java in Master, but most of it should be applicable.

Is the appropriate branch for the PR the 1.x-branch?, Yes.]
