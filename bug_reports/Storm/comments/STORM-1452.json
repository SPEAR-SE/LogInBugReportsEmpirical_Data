    Not really specific to this pull request, but I missed it before when the profiling functionality was originally added.
    
    If profiling is enabled, we turn on the "Commercial Features" of the JVM:
    
    `worker.profiler.childopts: "-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+FlightRecorder`
    
    The current Oracle Java license [1] states:
    
    >Some of the packages described in the Installation of Oracle Java SE Product Editions section above install Commercial Features that are restricted to Oracle Java SE Advanced, Oracle Java SE Advanced Desktop and/or Oracle Java SE Suite. **This means that even if you download an Oracle Java SE package for free under the Java BCLA, you must separately license from Oracle (and pay the appropriate license fee) the right to use any Commercial Features, described in Table 1-1 below, included in these packages.**
    
    If my interpretation of the license is correct, that means users must have purchased a license from Orace for each node that has profiling enabled. (Read the license [1] for more information and examples.)
    
    I think that's probably okay, but we may want to document that somewhere (`defaults.yaml` maybe?), so users don't accidentally run afoul of Oracle's licensing terms.

    Can we file a follow on JIRA to make this a bit cleaner?  Perhaps a script for different environments that we can check at run time if the script is there?

    It looks like this needs to be upmerged, because the docs are no longer on master, so the REST API docs needs a separate pull request :(

    Sure.  We are using this var in several places, and I did not want to change all of them to fix this.
