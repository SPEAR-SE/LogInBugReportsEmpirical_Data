    STORM-1729 Get rid of reflections while recording stats

    * define MultiCount/LatencyStatAndMetric in let statement and set type hint to there
    
    Before applying I got around 860,000 emitted/sec from BasicTopology, and after applying I got around 940,000~960,000 emitted/sec.
    
    And it removes reflection warnings from lines which record stats.
    
    Btw, though after applying this, `invokeMatchingMethod` is still on top 10. I'll track where it occurs.

    BTW. can we have more performance tests in more cases so that we can see the overall performance change?

    @unsleepy22 
    Yeah, I really want to, but in order to do that we need a stable machines and benchmark tests.
    We can give it a try with https://github.com/yahoo/streaming-benchmarks first.

    And also ThroughputVsLatency topology in storm-starter.

    @unsleepy22 Let's move to #1362. I'll address the performance tests there.

    Please refer #816. I'm confused completely why this happens cause those lines are introduced at 16c33efac39edea7e2d77df319d0ee3fd407383a which fixes the reflection issue. Why it is broken again?
