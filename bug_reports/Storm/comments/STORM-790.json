    @HeartSaVioR 
    Looking at the code prior to https://github.com/apache/storm/commit/861a92eab8740cfc0f83ac4d7ade9a2ab04a8b9b null routing was silently ignored.  I'm not sure that was on purpose though.  I am OK merging this in, but I really would like to understand why the destination task is showing up as null occasionally, but I see that you addressed that in the comments here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-770?focusedCommentId=14499225&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14499225
    
    So I am +1 for the change.  At least now we explicitly handle the situation.

    @revans2 Yes, actually it's not easily reproductive, so I'd like to gather error log representing tuple information, encourage Stas Levin to apply it and report logs if found any.
    Without applying this patch (or adding hook) we can't get informations about tuple making crash.

    Michael Pershyn applied current PR by hand and met that situation again, 6 machines, last 3 hours, 2 messages left.
    Without patch it should be crashed.
    
    Btw, we're succeed to gather information, see information

    @revans2 I've updated PR to leave tuple type which can give us detailed evidence.

    @HeartSaVioR great I am still +1 on the pull request.

    I have tested these changes on pure 0.9.3. 
    With them [STORM-770](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-770) doesn't break the affected bolts, rather prints warning messages:
    
    ```
    2015-04-27T16:39:02.503+0200 b.s.d.worker [WARN] Can't transfer tuple - task value is nil. tuple type: nil and information: nil
    ```
    
    I have also [commented](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-770?focusedCommentId=14517213&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14517213) STORM-770

    @ptgoetz I'd like to add this patch to 0.9.x since it verifies that it prevents strange worker crash cause of null task id. Please have a look.

    +1
    
    @HeartSaVioR I'll ad this to the list of patches for 0.9.5

    +1 for merging this in.  It does not apply to 0.9.x-branch though.  If you want me to merge this to 0.10.x-branch and master I am happy to.

    It seems to be merged to master well. Thanks for reviewing and merging!
    
    Btw, it is an active bug, so IMO it should be applied to 0.9.5 and 0.10.0, too.
    Did you intend to leave works for cherry-picking and releasing JIRA issue?

    @HeartSaVioR This patch has been applied to 0.9.x and 0.10.x.
