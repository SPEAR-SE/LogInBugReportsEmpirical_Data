    I prefer using UnsupportedOperationException in this case but since  it's just a test code I'm OK.

    +1 Thanks that's what I forgot to address. I saw relevant JIRA issue for this but can't find.

    I fixed a few other things that are also breaking the build on master.  If you want me the break them apart I can.

    This time the failures really are unrelated :).
    
    ```

    I am seeing a lot of timeouts to repository.apache.org and that cause the build failures.

    @revans2 I do not think you need to break them into different PRs  as these are small set of changes. I can see build failures in travis with jdk 7 but they seem to be unrelated. 
    +1 again.

    +1. I don't see a need to break them out.

    STORM-2021 is also related to 1.x-branch, so I've also downmerged.
