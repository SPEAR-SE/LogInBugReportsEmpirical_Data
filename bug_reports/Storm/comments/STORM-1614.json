    I tested submiting topologies and killing them and did not see issues do to this added line, but to those with more knowledge of backpressure logic please let me know if you can think of issues.

    The name - "backpressure-topologies" is a little confusing (people may think "backpressure" as verb) since it just returns the current topologies' zk nodes (ids) under backpressure root. We might rename it as something like "get-backpressure-topologies-ids".

    May rename this to be less general, e.g., "force-delete-topo-dist-dir"

    I agree. I think, however, it is *somewhat* consistent with the interface (e.g. heartbeat-storms, error-topologies don't say get-X-topologies-id). Additionally, I think we should call them one thing throughout (is it storms? is it topologies? is it keys?) Happy to make that change, but I think it's bigger than this PR. Thoughts?
