    @hmcl and @vesense these changes are not necessary.  I pointed out here https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/977#issuecomment-169101930 that the commit API should probably be changed, because if we force a commit, things can get off from each other.  Somehow that turned into this.  I am -1 on this unless we also get changes to the Committer API too.
