    STORM-1995: close input stream and other tweaks to downloadChunk

    When the input stream is being removed from its parent collection (after reading fully) in downloadChunk it isn't being closed, causing a leak.

    Is there a reason to change type hint class name?

    BufferFileInputStream is not a "is-a" BufferInputStream, and it also has close() method itself.

    @HeartSaVioR, in beginFileDownload (just above the impl for downloadChunk) the type used for the input stream and put into :downloaders is a BufferInputStream, hence the change in downloadChunk.

    @abellina OK I didn't know about the context. Great change.

, Thanks [~abellina], I merged into master, 1.x, 1.0.x branches.

NOTE: There're merge conflicts which is hard to continue. So I apply changes on 1.x and 1.0.x manually.]
