[Storm removed CSRF-token from REST API, so you don't need to call '/api/v1/token' before calling uploadTopology API.
Please test it once more, and close issue when it works smoothly. Thanks!, [~kabhwan] Thanks for responding. However, issuing the command below suggested in STORM-UI-REST-API.md still got failed due to the same reason.

curl -i -b ~/cookiejar.txt -c ~/cookiejar.txt -X POST -F topologyConfig='{"topologyMainClass": "storm.starter.WordCountTopology", "topologyMainClassArgs": ["wordcount1"]}' -F topologyJar=@/opt/huxihx/storm/apache-storm-0.10.0-beta/examples/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-0.10.0-beta.jar http://localhost:8080/api/v1/uploadTopology

Here is the response:

If you install Storm-0.10.0-beta, UI's Jetty version should be 7.6.13.v20130916, but your UI's Jetty version is 6.1.26, which seems that you launched UI via old release of Storm.
Please check that your UI is launched to 0.10.0-beta.

ps aux | grep "backtype.storm.ui.core" | grep "storm-core-0.10.0-beta" should print your UI process.

When you think the issue is invalid, please close issue. :), yes, I messed up the version stuff. Finally it got working. Thanks for the advice!]
