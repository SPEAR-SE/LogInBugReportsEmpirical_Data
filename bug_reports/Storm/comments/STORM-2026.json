    STORM-2026 Inconsistency between (SpoutExecutor, BoltExecutor) and (spout-transfer-fn, bolt-transfer-fn)

    * fix Executor, SpoutExecutor, BoltExecutor to not calling init() while creating Executor itself
    * call init() for the first time in async loop

    @HeartSaVioR It is better to pass  `idToTask` object as part of constructor instead of setting here. idToTask can be created before calling constructor.

    The assumption here is that this method is invoked only once. Do no we want to handle for multiple invocations?

    I just follow previous executor implementation, and invoking init() to multiple times is not intended not only for while statement, but also rest of statements.

    @satishd 
    Constructor of Task needs executor so Executor should be created prior to construct idToTask.

    @HeartSaVioR Sorry, missed that. This code looks convoluted because it is ported from clojure. I am fine with that for now as these PRs are more about poring from clojure to Java. We can address these later.

    Yes, actually the code style is more likely to clojure itself indeed. It's needed for ease of port work, and we can address later.
