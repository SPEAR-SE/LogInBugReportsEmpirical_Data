    (Not a project maintainer, just someone who ran into the same problem)
    I support the idea and encountered the same need myself, but I think they way it's implemented in this pull request isn't correct since it doesn't work for people who implement their own IEventDataScheme class. The way I did it was to change the signature of deserialize() in that interface to add a MessageId parameter, that way implementors of that class can choose to add the partition ID (and sequence number) properly if they wish. Would that work?

    Mooso is right, and his suggestion is a cleaner implementation. I suggest we use his implementation of IEventDataScheme and EventDataScheme. 
    Mooso can you make a PR for your copy of these?
