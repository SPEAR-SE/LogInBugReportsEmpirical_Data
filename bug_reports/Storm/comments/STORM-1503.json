    [STORM-1503] Worker should not crash on failure to send heartbeats to Pacemaker/ZK

    - Worker should catch and log Exception related to sending worker heartbeats to ZK/pacemaker.
    - `PacemakerClient` should not leave open previous channels.. If successfully reconnected - made new `Channel`. This avoids worker having unused Channel open to Pacemaker around.

    Worker should retry later instead of dying on failure to send heartbeats to ZK/Pacemaker
