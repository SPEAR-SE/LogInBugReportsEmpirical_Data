[Thanks [~erikdw], merged to master, 1.x, 1.1.x and 1.0.x. 1.1.x and 1.0.x didn't merge cleanly due to the file having moved, so I redid the fix on those branches. Hope that's okay., [~Srdo]: sorry, missed this comment to the ticket.  I'm fine with whatever you had to do for merging it back, thanks!]
