[I think this is harder to fix with IgnoreZkoffsets. Instead we should remove this option and document if users wants to ignore the zookeeper stored offsets they can use a new zk node in SpoutConfig or delete the corresponding zknode where previous offsets are stored. 
cc [~ptgoetz] [~parth.brahmbhatt] [~revans2] . Let me know if you see any better option., I am fine with removing the config as long as we document what users will have to do manually when they want zookeeper offsets to be ignored i.e. what paths from zookeeper needs to be deleted. 

We need to restart the discussion on STORM-650. My personal stand is to forget about backward compatibility and just re-write kafka spout from scratch. That code has reached a pretty unmaintainable state IMO and we are adding more and more features on top of it. , Is there any way to reset zkOffsets when user call submitTopology?, [~RenkaiGe] we don't want to introduce spout/bolt level code into core api. , [~sriharsha]Could you tell me how to manually remove zknode based on current version of storm-kafka?, [~RenkaiGe] KafkaSpout uses the following config to store offsets SpoutConfig(BrokerHosts hosts, String topic, String zkRoot, String id);
zkRoot/id will be the node on zookeeper. You can use zkCli.sh to login into the zookeeper you are using for this spout and do rmr zkRoot/id make sure this is the same one you give in Spoutconfig., https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/754/files, Github user harshach commented on the pull request:

    +1. @priyank5485 it will be great if you can add a integration test we can do this in another jira.
