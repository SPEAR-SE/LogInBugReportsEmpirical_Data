[You can reproduce this by setting fetchSizeBytes to reasonably small number, I think the default behavior should be modified to get at least one message from kafka, is it doable?, [~sweetest_sj] this is not a issue with kafka spout . Its how the kafka api is your fetch.max.message.bytes should always be higher than the max message size . 
you can check broker's server.properties message.max.bytes and make sure you set fetch.max.message.bytes to equal or higher.]
