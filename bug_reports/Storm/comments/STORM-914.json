    STORM-914: AutoHDFS should also update hdfs.config into Configuration

    PR for [STORM-914](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-914)
    
    When storm user a specify hdfs cluster, he will put some config such as namenode.host into hdfs.config when submit storm topology, and when HdfsBolt create HdfsConfiguration, it will use hdfs.config update HDFSConfiguration, then HDFSBolt will visit the right hdfs cluster. But in AutoHDFS's renew and getHadoopCredentials, Configuration not for the HDFS that storm user specify, we should update all the Configuration with hdfs.config.

    @tedxia 
    if you change ```hdfs.config``` to ```topology.hdfs.config``` 
    should the following several files  change too ?
    [HdfsFileTopology.java](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-hdfs/src/test/java/org/apache/storm/hdfs/bolt/HdfsFileTopology.java#L82)
    [simple_hdfs.yaml](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/flux/flux-examples/src/main/resources/simple_hdfs.yaml#L74)
    [hdfs_test.yaml](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/flux/flux-core/src/test/resources/configs/hdfs_test.yaml#L82)

    yesï¼ŒI think we should change to hdfs.config for this reason, I will add a patch later.
