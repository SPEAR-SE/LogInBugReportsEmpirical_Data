[Attached proposed fix. I've clicked around a bunch on the Jekyll local server, and haven't noticed anything break. I'm not too familiar with Ruby and Google wasn't helpful, so I've just added an explicit redcarpet dependeny to the gemfile. If there's a better way to refer to https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/c7d98cae2652b2df7ebd3c60b4f8c87950760e47/Gemfile#L82 I'd like to change it., GitHub user srdo opened a pull request:

    Which pair(s) of OS and Ruby version are you trying out?
    I'm trying out the change but I'm experiencing crash on redcarpet. (redcarpet.rb has `require 'redcarpet.so'` but there's no file) macOS Sierra (10.12.6) and Ruby 2.4.1. Odd thing is that standalone command 'redcarpet' works.

    @HeartSaVioR I've tried it out on Windows 10 and ruby 2.3.4p301. I just went and tested it on a fresh install of Ubuntu 17.04 and ruby 2.4.1p111.
    
    Did you run `bundler install` after switching to this branch?
    
    I'm wondering if the README is a little misleading, it's my understanding that people should use Bundler to update dependencies and run Jekyll, but the README doesn't mention it. 
    
    Here's the commands I ran to start the local server:
    `bundler install`
    `bundler exec jekyll serve -w`

    @HeartSaVioR Sorry to bother you with this, but I think this PR fell through the cracks. If you get a chance sometime could you try to build the site with the commands I mentioned in the previous comment?
