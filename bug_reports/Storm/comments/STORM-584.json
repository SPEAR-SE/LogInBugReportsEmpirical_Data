    +1 this change itself looks good, but there are a number of issues with the metrics.log file.  I filed STORM-584 to address them.
, Thinking about it now this is probably marked too high in severity.  The current state is two wrongs making it not that bad.  The logging metrics consumer just puts its logs in with the worker logs.  This works just fine, so long as you don't mind filtering them out. Perhaps we should just remove the section for metircs.log altogether and call it good., GitHub user jnioche opened a pull request:

    Fix logging for LoggingMetricsConsumer STORM-584

    Currently the metrics.log file is always empty and it declared in the cluster.xml file whereas it should be in the worker one. The metrics end up in the log file which is not a huge issue but it would be cleaner to have them in a separate file, as originally intended. 
    
    This patch addresses this and makes so that there is one metrics file per worker, as per the other log files, which should address the issues mentioned in [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-584].
