[More details on description below:
(This was copied from dev@ mailing list what I've posted)

1. There were three Nimbuses N1, N2, N3 and N1 was the leader.
2. We submitted topology T1.
3. After submission we restarted N1 and N2 got leadership.
4. We killed T1. 
5. While N1 is initializing and syncing up its topology blobs, N2 concurrently removes the ZK path and also max sequence number path for topology blob in progress of killing topology. 

This race condition is only occurring on Local BlobStore since removing ZK path is done only if Nimbus is using Local BlobStore.

https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/1.x-branch/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/blobstore/KeySequenceNumber.java#L138-L149

checkExists (L138) succeeds but getChildren (L149) throws NoNodeException, in result sequenceNumbers.last() throws NoSuchElementException., Lowering priority since this is occurred only for Nimbus H/A and race condition during failover. I don't think it should block further releases., I'm asking questions to the dev@ mailing list to make my suspects clear.

, [~kabhwan] Does this only affect the 1.0.x line, or is 1.x affected as well?, [~ptgoetz]
I guess this affects starting from 1.0.0 to master. Might be better to also add 1.1.0 and 2.0.0 to affects versions., Merged into master and 1.x branch via [~sriharsha].
I'll handle porting back to 1.0.x after 1.0.3 RC1 vote.]
