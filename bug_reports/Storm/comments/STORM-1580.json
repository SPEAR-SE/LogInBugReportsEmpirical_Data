http://blog.csdn.net/wulantian/article/details/42173095, [~ght]  fyi.. I am beginning to take a look at this., Sorry for the delayed update... kept getting pulled into other urgent things and took sometime to setup a kerberized cluster.

*Update:*  I modified  HdfsSpoutTopology.java  (from examples/storm-starter )  for  kerberos and tried it on a secure cluster. It worked fine.

I am attaching the modified java file.

Your error might indicate some issue likely on the kerberos setup side. 
try these:
- kinit with the same keytab and principal on that host and verify its ok by running some hadoop fs -ls  commands 
- Ensure hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml from the kerberized cluster are packaged as resources in your topology. A quick way to do this is to copy them into storm/lib and restart supervisor.
