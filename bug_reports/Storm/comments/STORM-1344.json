[I have been running into this error on multple platforms (RHEL, Mac os) when running unit tests against master branch today.  I worked around it by having the sql only create a table if it does not exist., Do you have a patch for that?  I can see it being at least a step in the right direction on fixing this., Thanks [~ppoulosk], I merged into master, 1.x, 1.0.x branches.]
