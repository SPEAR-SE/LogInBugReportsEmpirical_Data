[I've added what I think would be a potential fix
I've tested this locally and it fixes the bug
note The deleteRecursiveIfExists function (that tests for symlinks and doesn't recurse through them) may have an equivalent in some other library..., I think we are seeing this issue as well, also running on Windows, storm 1.0.1.

We can reproduce this issue by "rebalancing" the topology, subsequent to this, some of our multilang resource files are missing., [~hairywelly] Please open a PR at https://github.com/apache/storm. There's much better chance of someone reviewing your fix there, and it'll also get run through our CI setup. Thanks :), We introduced Supervisor V2 in 1.0.3 which completely renew the code on Supervisor. We don't track old supervisor issue.]
