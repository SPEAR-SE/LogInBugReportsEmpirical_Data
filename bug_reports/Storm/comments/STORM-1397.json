    STORM-1397: Merge conflict from Pacemaker merge

    When Pacemaker was merged, some calls got missed in nimbus.clj, supervisor.clj, worker.clj and executor.clj.
    
    This merge error prevents nimbus from spawning separate read/write zookeeper clients since the ClusterState ends up with daemonType == DaemonType.UNKNOWN.
