    [STORM-2037] debug operation should be whitelisted in SimpleAclAuthorizer

    While enabling/disabling topology event logging, theres a call to assert-authorized-user with "debug" as the operation in ui/core.clj.
    This needs to be whitelisted in SimpleAclAuthorizer to get it working in secure mode.

    +1. We should be introducing a Enum class to capture these ACLs in one place and let the pluggable authorizers use that class instead of free-form strings.
