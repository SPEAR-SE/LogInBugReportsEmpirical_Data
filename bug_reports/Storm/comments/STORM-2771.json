[The issue only appears to show up when no profiles are set.  -Pall-tests and -Pintegration-tests-only appear to work as expected.

It looks like failsafe is running all of the tests, including integration tests, after surefire finishes running just the non-integration tests. , I merged this into all of the 1.x lines and to master.  It is a minor change and there were no merge conflicts.]
