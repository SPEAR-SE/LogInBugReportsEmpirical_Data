[Clarification, this is on amazon EC2 instances, and it seems to be host the hostname is resolved when using the public DNS alias.  EC2 instances have two IPs, an external and an internal one.  I'd like to know how the IP address is resolved in the code.

I've seen a handful of posts reporting this same problem with Storm on AWS, but no resolution.]
