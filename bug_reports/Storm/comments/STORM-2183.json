[Storm topology is in the shape of a directed a cyclic graph(DAG), so I think your description will not happen., This is 100% reproducible.  If there is a loop in the graph (e.g. C subscribes to a steam from D above) then the stateful bolt wrapper queues tuples until it receives a state command message on the checkpoint stream.   Because C will not forward tuples until it receives one on each channel, D never receives the tuple to forward back to C.  It is clear from your comment you did not test this, as it is trivial to reproduce.]
