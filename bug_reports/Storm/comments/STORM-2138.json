[I can confirm this on 1.0.2 but instead of worker failure, I see the Supervisor shut down after a time.  Inspecting the supervisor after it is noticed as down, I see that the stormconf.ser file is present, with the correct ownership, in the reported missing file location. , Same issue with 1.0.3, sometime supervisors shutdown onÂ java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: File '/space/StormData/storm-data/supervisor/stormdist/MyTopo/stormconf.ser' does not exist)]
