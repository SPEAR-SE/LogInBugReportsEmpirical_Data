[This issue is interesting to me. ^-^ 
Is there anyone else now working on it?, Can we have more description of "messages not exists in kafka"?
Do such messages refer to the ones that are outdated and deleted by kafka?
In which case will such messages still reside in the PartitionManager's _waitingToEmit queue?
, Sorry I took so long to respond. You can visit STORM-643(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-643) for more information about this issue.]
