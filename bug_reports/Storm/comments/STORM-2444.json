[Below patch might help, so need to try reproducing this after the patch is merged.

https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2305, This is still happening after STORM-2533., [~kabhwan]  I am interested in looking into this issue. Could you please let me how to reproduce this? I launched a non-secure cluster and submitted a wordcount topology. I didn't see the errors you described above, [~kabhwan]  Any updates on how to reproduce this?, That was intermittent. Let's reopen if we see it again.]
