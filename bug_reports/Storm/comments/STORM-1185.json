    since for Storm HA there can be multiple nimbus hosts, shouldn't we provide an example like with storm.zookeeper.servers that includes multiple hosts? Like 
    
    nimbus.seeds: ["host1", "host2", "host3"]

    Can you instead use values that will be valid in a single node setup? With current values anyone running storm locally will be forced to update this value.
    
    nimbus.seeds:["localhost","127.0.0.1"]
