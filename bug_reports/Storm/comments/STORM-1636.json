    [STORM-1636] - Supervisor shutdown with worker id pass in being nil

    In function kill-existing-workers-with-change-in-components in supervisor.clj:
    The function tries to detect whether there is a change in assignment. The bug in this function is that the ordering of the assignment matters but it shouldn't. For example, if a worker assignment is [[1 1] [2 2]] and it changed to [[2 2] [1 1]] it will cause the supervisor to restart the worker
