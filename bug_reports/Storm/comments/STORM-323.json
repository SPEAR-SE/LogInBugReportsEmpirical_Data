The spout would only unblock itself upon some activity that was rarely occurring. Once this was corrected, the issue has not been seen again. Heap dumps do not show any signs of these tuples getting accumulated.

On a side note, the following would have helped in troubleshooting:
1. Looking into the dumps, it wasn't possible to trace the spout/bolt whose RingBuffers held these unacked tuples. 
2. Some documentation on the internals like async_loop, RingBuffer, etc just for the sake of those who are not familiar with clojure, Marking this as invalid since this was due to spout blocking on a queue and not releasing storm's executor thread.
The javadoc for nextTuple clearly mentions that it should be non-blocking.]
