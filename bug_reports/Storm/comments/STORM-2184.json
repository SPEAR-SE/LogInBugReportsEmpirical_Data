[hi, Stig Rohde
I think the KafkaConsumer wakeup and close should be done when commit offsets success, and the commit offset is sync, and commitSync can have a callback, the KafkaConsumer wakeup and close can handed in callback. , Hi [~rawind]
I think I misunderstood the issue. As far as I know Storm doesn't call multiple methods on a spout at the same time, so the call to KafkaConsumer.wakeup shouldn't be there at all., Thanks [~Srdo], I merged into master, 1.x, 1.0.x branches.]
