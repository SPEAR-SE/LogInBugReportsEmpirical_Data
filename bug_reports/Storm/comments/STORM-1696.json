    I can either put the refactoring part as a separate pull request or within this.

    @zhuoliu 
    +1 Nice finding. 
    Could you address this to master branch, too?

    [STORM-1696] status not sync if zk fails in backpressure #1320 

    This is a fix for master branch.
    
    When there is a zk exception happens during worker-backpressure!,
     there is a bad state which can block the topology from running normally any more.
    
    The root cause: in worker/mk-backpressure-handler
     if the worker-backpressure! fails once due to zk connection exception,
     next time when this method gets called by WordBackpressureThread, because (when (not= prev-backpressure-flag curr-backpressure-flag) will never be true, the remote zk node can not be synced with local state.
     This problem can cause a topology to be blocked!
    
    This also explains why we will not see any problem when testing in a stable (zk never fail) environment.
    
    Solution is quite straightforward: first change the zk status, if succeeds, change local status.

, Thanks [~zhuoliu].
I merged into master and 1.x-branch, but version 1.0.1 is not available for fix versions so I'll keep this issue open and close when it's available.]
