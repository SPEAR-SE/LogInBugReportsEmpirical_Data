, When my PR has approved, I wish to have bugfix release on it.
Storm UI is very informal in production environment, and new feature (topology graph) is also not seen because of this issue., Github user d2r commented on the pull request:

    Version of jquery.tablesorter.min.js matches what is tagged as v2.17.3 in Mottie/tablesorter.
    
    Ran a few word_count topologies and tested sorting on time columns and numerical columns.  Looks good.
    
    I am +1 on this change, but I am not sure how we document our choice of the MIT license.
    
    @ptgoetz, can you comment?

    @dashengju I'm happy to help!
    @d2r Please see https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/LICENSE.
    257 Line from current master, TableSorted is already documented but outdated for this PR.
    I think we could be safe with only replacing version because Mottie/tablesorter uses same license.
    https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter#licensing
    If you think I am on the right track, please give me your feedback. Then I'll update LICENSE file. :)

    I can update the LICENSE file when merging. It's just a matter of explicitly stating which license we are selecting.
