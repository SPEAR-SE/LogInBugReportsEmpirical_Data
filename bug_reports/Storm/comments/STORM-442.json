    [STORM-442] multilang ShellBolt/ShellSpout die() can be hang when Exception happened

    In ShellBolt, the _readerThread read command from python/shell process, and handle like this:
     try
     { 
        ShellMsg shellMsg = _process.readShellMsg(); 
        ... 
     } catch (InterruptedException e) {
     } catch (Throwable t) { 
        die(t); 
     }
    
    And in the die function, getProcessTerminationInfoString will read getErrorsString() from processErrorStream.
    
    private void die(Throwable exception) { 
         String processInfo = _process.getProcessInfoString() + _process.getProcessTerminationInfoString(); 
         _exception = new RuntimeException(processInfo, exception); 
    }
    
    so when ShellBolt got exception(for example, readShellMsg() throw NPE ) , but it is not an error from sub process, then getProcessTerminationInfoString will be hang because processErrorStream have no data to read.
    
    On the other hand, as Kang Xiao says ShellBolt should fail fast on exception ( https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/46 ) , I think it is not a good idea to read error info from stream.
    
    Because Kang Xiao 's PR is based old version, so I will move his code to this PR, and modify the same place in ShellSpout.

    @dashengju  Can you clarify "getProcessTerminationInfoString will be hang because processErrorStream have no data to read". Which case it might hang , looking at the code https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/utils/ShellProcess.java#L135 If there is no data in processErrorStream it returns empty string.
    If possible can you add a unit test. Thanks.

    Is there a relation between parent process's exception and subprocess's stderr?
    If it's not, and we should capture it from parent, I think spout may have stderr reader with new thread.
    Because it may not be right way to capture it when only parent process raises exception.

    @HeartSaVioR , 
    parent process's exception contains two types: 1) net io error caused; for example, subprocess report an error to stderr and exit; 2) parent process's handle logic exception.
    as 1), we want to read from stderr to get more information; 
    as 2), as you say, it may not be right way to capture it when only parent process raises exception.
    
    @d2r 's suggestion, we should change ShellProcess#getErrorsStream so that it checks that there is actually something to read.

    In ShellBolt, the _readerThread read command from python/shell process, and handle like this:
    try
    { 
    ShellMsg shellMsg = _process.readShellMsg(); 
    ... 
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    } catch (Throwable t) { 
    die(t); 
    }
    
    And in the die function, getProcessTerminationInfoString will read getErrorsString() from processErrorStream.
    
    private void die(Throwable exception) { 
    String processInfo = _process.getProcessInfoString() + _process.getProcessTerminationInfoString(); 
    _exception = new RuntimeException(processInfo, exception); 
    }
    
    so when ShellBolt got exception(for example, readShellMsg() throw NPE ) , but it is not an error from sub process, then getProcessTerminationInfoString will be hang because processErrorStream have no data to read.

    If we're narrowing issue to just handle parent process's Exception hang, looks good to me.
    (We can make it better with extracting logic that reads from stderr to method, since it's duplicated from logErrorStream() and getErrorsString(). )
    
    This could be off-topic, but is there no chance to occur that subprocess writes stderr for some reason but parent process runs well without Exception? If it can possible, is parent process responsible to read stderr and do something (like logging, raise Exception, etc.)?

    @HeartSaVioR 
    
    yes, there is a chance to occur that subprocess writes stderr for some reason but parent process runs well without Exception.  When this happens, parent process will check, and log then to log system.
    
    Below is the ShellBolt and PythonBolt communication flow. As you can see, when the ShellBolt send a tuple to Python, it will read from stderr(call logErrorStream()) to see anything to log, and log info them.

    @dashengju 
    Yes, ShellSpout/Bolt read stderr from subprocess after sending tuple immediately.
    
    I'm afraid that this may cannot cover all cases, and ShellBolt could read stderr message after sending "next" tuple if PythonBolt doesn't write stderr immediately.
    Please remember ShellBolt has no "sync". It just send a message and forget, and doesn't wait for 
    PythonBolt if it has any stderr message regarding that tuple.
    
    Btw, it's not related to current PR. It's just my 2 cents, so take your time.

    @dashengju 
    
    When parent fails while child shell process is running correctly, should we call cleanup() to kill the suprocess first?
    
    This has two benefits:
    1. avoid zoombie sub process to exist
    2. Avoid blocking at sub process errorstream reading.
, Github user itaifrenkel commented on the pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/305#issuecomment-61631559
  
    @clockfly - Please clarify. When you say "the parent process fails" do you mean that the worker process is no longer running? If this is the case that process cannot call cleanup() since it is not running. We are using os specific hooks in the child process to receive signal when parent process dies. Another cross platform alternative is using file lock checks. Either way, are you sure this is related to this pull request ?

    @itaifrenkel,
    
    ```
     When you say "the parent process fails" do you mean that the worker process is no longer running?
    ```
    No, it means the case described by dashengju, that an exception is thrown in the java space(not originated from sub process)
, Github user clockfly commented on the pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/305#issuecomment-61632248
  
    dashengju is describling a use scenario that parent process blocks while trying to read error stream data from sub-process (parent java space throw an exception, which trigger the error handling).
    
    Becasue sub-process is still running, there is no EOF of errorStream, so errorStream.read() will blocks.
    
    If in this scenario, we can make sure the child process is dead by called child.destroy(), then there will be an EOF signalled to its error Stream, and parent process will not block.

    I'm curious to. Is it not safe because of chance of blocking, or available() can always return 0 with some InputStream subclasses so we cannot read any messages from subprocess?

    @clockfly  
    I think it is not a good idea to kill sub process. Because when we catch a exception, we do not know whether sub process is still running. "kill pid" may cause other error.
    
    By the way, when parent process is exist, the sub process will exit when read from stdin encounter a EOF, so sub process  will not zoombie.

    I see this has not had that much traffic in quite a while.  The code to me looks acceptable.  I am not really happy with calling .available() twice, but I can live with it.  There is the possibility of a race if two different threads call getErrorsString or logErrorStream at the same time, but as the way the code is currently used that should not be a problem.  I am +1 on checking this in, but would like to know if others have any option.
