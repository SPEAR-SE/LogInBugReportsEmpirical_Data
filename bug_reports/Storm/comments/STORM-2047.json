[Thanks [~sriharsha] for helping with debugging. The issue is that browser needs to be able to talk to supervisor machines. In safari this works cleanly. In firefox, you have to change settings to allow supervisors., Setting {{network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris}} to something like {{.apache.org}} works for firefox., [~raghavgautam] The storm security doc https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/docs/SECURITY.md already explains whitelisting the UI servers in the browser. Maybe we can add a note to explicitly mention that the hosts where the log viewer runs needs to be whitelisted as well., Thanks [~arunmahadevan], I merged the change to master, 1.x, 1.0.x branches. 
I didn't applied to website yet, so I'll take care and close this issue., Published. Marking as fixed.]
