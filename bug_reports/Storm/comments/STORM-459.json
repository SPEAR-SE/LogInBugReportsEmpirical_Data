[Not totally sure what is happening here.  If your PHP is stuck writing to stdout then like you said the spout is probably not reading that in.  

https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/spout/ShellSpout.java?source=c

has the shell spout code.  It will read from the stdout of the php process when nextTuple, ack, or fail is called, and then it will drain the queue until a sync command is returned.  Do you have a stack trace of the java process when this happens so you know what it is doing at this time? ]
