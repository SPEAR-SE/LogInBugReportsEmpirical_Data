[Just curious: Is this based on theory or are you experienced deadlock? If you experienced the thing and have stack dump it would be better to attach it. And are you planning to fix it for yourself?, We actually saw this during some testing, but it has been a while, and it was only the once, so I don't have the stack trace right now., Spoke to [~revans2]. 

 
 * Will be removing redundant ZK state updates when using LocalFsBlobStore
 * Will not connect to self when the only nimbus that has the replica is self, Thanks [~govindmenon],

 

I merged this into master.]
