    I can see "nexus.codehaus.org" is unreachable. I merged your PR to my forked repo and started Travis CI build.

    There're some issues regarding using SNAPSHOT version of dependencies.
    
    - Tez: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8845
    - Calcite: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8873
    
    Since it is fixed at 1.0.0, we'd be better to upgrade Hive version, not excluding artifacts.
    I didn't have time to use Hive, but normally 1.x.y feels more stable compared to 0.x.y. ;)

    Could you verify storm-hive can work with recent version of Apache Hive, 1.2.1? Thanks!

    I'm sorry, but it would be better to discuss it from #609 since this PR is duplicated and it contains same patch.
    
    @caofangkun 
    Could you close this PR and relevant issue as duplicated? Thanks!
