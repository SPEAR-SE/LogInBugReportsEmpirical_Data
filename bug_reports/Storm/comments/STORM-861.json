[It may be that there are not enough tasks defined in the topology, and so increasing the parallelism may have no effect.  (There are not any more tasks to execute in the new threads that would be launched.), Yeah, you're right. I couldn't think about testing it to decrease parallelism.
Below operation changes components' parallelism successfully. (decrease parallelism by 1)

Sorry for not testing well. Not an issue.]
