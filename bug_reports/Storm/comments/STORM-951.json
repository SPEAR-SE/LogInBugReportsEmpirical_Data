    If ```rollToNext == false``` should we ``` writer.close()``` ? 
    Like:
    ```
     writer.flush(rollToNext);
     if (!rollToNext) {
        writer.close();
     }
    ```

    @caofangkun closing Writer handled in different method you can flushAllAndCloseWriters().

, Marking issue as resolved since it is merged to master.

Btw, IMO it should be backported to 0.10.0 since it's a bug and high priority.]
