[[~sj] thanks for the catch, I believe it has been fixed at 1.1.x-branch, please have a look at:

[https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/1.1.x-branch/external/storm-kafka/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/kafka/ZkCoordinator.java#L93]

Also, storm-kafka has been deprecated and will be removed in a future storm release after 1.x version. Please upgrade to storm-kafka-client.

FYI, [https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/external/storm-kafka-client]
