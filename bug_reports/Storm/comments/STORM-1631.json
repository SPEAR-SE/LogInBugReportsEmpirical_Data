    is any one using cgroup to limit the cpu usage? these days i found the system will be halt when the pressure is growing up, and i found that much of the cpu was wasted by the system, above 25%
    CentOS 6.5 
    64 bit 
    128 G 
    32 core
    31 workers

    @caishize too many threads will cause high sys cpu usage. much worse situation, the node will be halt.
     I see there are 31 workers in your machine, what's the total thread number? reducing the number of threads should bring a improvement.

    i want to know if there is a rule about workers num and threads num. In production, i always set the thread num is 10 times than worker num.  oh, i use storm 0.9.5.

    @yegortokmakov in general, for one topology: 
    i:woker number
     worker number < cluster node number
     worker/per node
    ii:thread number
     this depends on your logic. for example, the parallelism of KafkaSpout should be equal to the number of partitions, in order to get a good performance.
    
    btw, I really recommend you to upgrade your storm to 1.0.1.

    At yahoo, cgroups are used to limit both memory and cpu of every worker so
    that topologies can have more resource isolation

    I’ve found that the system will be halt when there are some workers are reboot frequently, this may be a bug of the OS，and i found this https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=7538 may be the reason, i hadn’t  confirm this yet..
