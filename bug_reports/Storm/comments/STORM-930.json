Do you set parallelism-hint of your topology component ? , We have similar issue, but the problem is that Nimbus is not able to start at all:
{code}
o.a.s.c.f.s.ConnectionStateManager [INFO] State change: CONNECTED
b.s.cluster [WARN] Received event ::none: with disconnected Zookeeper.
b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Starting Nimbus server...

{code}

We have there one topology that may not have setted parallelism-hint, but the problem is that without Nimbus running we are not able to remove it. Any suggestions? , Not enough information. Please re-open and add additional information to reproduce the issue if you are still having a problem.]
