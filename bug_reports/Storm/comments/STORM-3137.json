[The exception in the description is misleading, and happens on every test run. It's not the cause of the failure.

The failure is because the test asserts that when Nimbus tries to clean up "topo2" and "topo3", it calls first IStormClusterState.teardownHeartbeats("topo2"), then IStormClusterState.teardownHeartbeats("topo3"). Nimbus iterates over a Set of topo ids, so the order is nondeterministic. We should just replace the mocking/verification with Mockito, so we can assert that the calls happen without asserting the order they happen in.]
