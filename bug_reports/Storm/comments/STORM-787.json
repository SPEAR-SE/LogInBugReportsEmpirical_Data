    [STORM-787]: test-ns should announce test failures with 'BUILD FAILURE'

    Slightly more complicated clojure.
    The only thing really changing here is that it checks the values for the `:fail` and `:error` keys in the return value of `run-tests`
    
    In case of error, `System.exit(1)`. 
    In the python, propagate the exit code.
