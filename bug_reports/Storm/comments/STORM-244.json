    Why 2 instead of 1? Also could we stub TIMEOUT-CHECK-SECS to something smaller like 1 so that the test can run faster?

    Just one small comment, to speed up the test,  The code itself looks great.

    Thanks.
    I've fixed the timeouts you've mentioned, but have a look. That was the best way I could think to muck with TIMEOUT-CHECK-SECS.

    So with this new code if someone somehow sets a config that has a key of 5 it will essentially adjust the TIMEOUT-CHECK-SECS value?  That seems ugly to me.  I was thinking of using conjure but because TIMEOUT-CHECK-SECS is not a function I see that we cannot stub it.  Perhaps we should just make a true key for it in Config.

    Could we create a function that returns the TIMEOUT-CHECK-SECS value to ease testing, and then stub the new function?

    Mocked.

    +1 Looks fine to me.
    @revans2 are you OK with having the new function instead?

    +1 looks good.
