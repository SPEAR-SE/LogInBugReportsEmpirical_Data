[Thanks [~satish.duggana], I merged into master and 1.x branches., I believe this needs to land on 1.0.x-branch too. Can someone please cherry pick it there?, Let's not reopen the issue because of backport. It can just be done with backporting and updating Fix version/s.

And release vote for 1.1.0 is going to be passing, so not sure whether we would want to keep 1.0.x branch or use 1.1.x branch for the new bugfix version line after releasing Storm 1.1.0., Sorry - I was not aware that there will be no further 1.0 release.]
