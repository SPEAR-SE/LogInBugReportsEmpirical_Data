[We may try to check whether the port is used by other processes on the node, e.g., "lsof -i :6703"., i checked it and got 
COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
java    5124 user   71u  IPv4  37584      0t0  TCP *:6703 (LISTEN), Can we further run a "ps aux |grep 5124" to check what this process is doing?, i got this

, Can we do this: 
a. Shutdown storm, check the port's usage again to make sure the port is not being used by other processes; 
b. may also try profiling this with storm-0.9.5; 
c. for storm-0.9.5, paste the stacktrace/error message from supervisor.log and/or worker log for the exception if available.
Thanks!, thanks , i did number a and got nothing 
for b how can i delete current version of storm ? 
Thanks for your time 
last point 
i'm using ubuntu 14.04 and when i installed it i didn't made anything with network configuration just i put wire net 
is there any configuration i should do it ? 

and do you mind to get this project just to run it in your machine to ensure that the problem with me ? i'll appreciate that 
i need to finish this project as soon as possible , this problem made me confusing , this my storm.yaml 
storm.zookeeper.servers:
     - "127.0.0.1"
nimbus.host: "127.0.0.1"
storm.local.dir: /home/user/storms/storm
supervisor.childopts: "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
nimbus.childopts: "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
worker.childopts: "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
supervisor.slots.ports:
    - 6700
    - 6701
    - 6702
    - 6703
is there anything wrong here ? , I do not find anything wrong with your configuration.
For a clean delete, you can "killall -9 java; rm -rf  /home/user/storms/storm;", and removing zookeeper data dir would be a plus.
I would suggest downloading the storm-0.9.5 release or 0.10 release, you can try extract and start storm with pure default
configuration (not editing conf/storm.yaml will still work as long as your zookeeper server is launched locally at port 2181).
I tried both releases on my machine with default setting, it works fine., thanks but i tried before something and got strange problem 

i installed storm-0.8.2 then deleted storm-0.8.2 folder to uninstall it and knew after that , it's wrong way 
then install storm-0.9.5 and every time i run storm -0.9.5 . storm-0.8.2 folder recreated itself with empty !!

NOW 
i reinstalled ubuntu again from scratch and installed storm-0.8.2 to run the project that coder used this version i think it should work fine with me but didn't !! 

I need to know how can i uninstall storm-0.8.2 to install new version ?? 
and project i have , has storm-0.8.2 in m2/repository should i delete it or what ? , You can try deleting your whole m2 directory. From what I can see, if you download a binary version, you can install storm by simply extracting the zip file [storm-0.10.0 | http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/storm/apache-storm-0.10.0/apache-storm-0.10.0.zip]., Thanks but I think you didn't got what I mean . I'm asking for delete
current version if storm to become ready for installing new version


, Gotcha. Are you using apt-get to install storm? Then you may need to run apt-get remove to uninstall rather than removing the directory. Also make sure /etc/storm/conf/storm.yaml is deleted.]
