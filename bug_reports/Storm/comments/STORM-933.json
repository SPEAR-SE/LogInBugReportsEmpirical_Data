    We can add null check from KafkaSpout.commit() to save tiny memory (by lazy allocation), but it is really tiny so I think current approach is acceptable.
    +1.
, Thanks [~caofangkun],
I merged this into master, 0.10.x-branch, 0.9.x-branch respectively.

Seems like Github mirror has issue again. When it becomes stable, your PR could be automatically marked as merged., Github user HeartSaVioR commented on the pull request:
