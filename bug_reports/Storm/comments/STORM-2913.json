[Came up with what I think is a better option: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2914. Once that is resolved, we should be able to fix this by updating the at-most-once commitSync call., [~Srdo] I am currently with limited Internet access. I will get my input on this by tomorrow. Thanks., Thanks [~Srdo], merged into master.

Since there's some diverge between master and 1.x-branch for storm-kafka-client, I'd like to wait for [~Srdo] to submit pull request against 1.x branch. We can merge it afterwards.]
