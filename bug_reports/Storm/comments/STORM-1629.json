    STORM-1629 Files/move doesn't work properly with non-empty directory in Windows

    Please refer https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1629 to see why Files/move with non-empty directory fails on Windows.
    
    * Use FileUtils/moveDirectory on Windows
      * It copies whole contents inside directory, and delete directory
    * Keep using Files/move on non-Windows
      * it's still better option since doesn't require copying contents inside directory
    
    Since `on-windows?` is ported to Java, I'll create separate pull request for 1.x-branch.
