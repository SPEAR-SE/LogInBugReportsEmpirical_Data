    STORM-596: remove config topology.receiver.buffer.size

    topology.receiver.buffer.size has no effect and not necessary for now.
    Should we just remove it ?

    @caofangkun I think correct behaviour is restricting the max size of `batched` ArrayList within given `max-buffer-size` . But if you mean this parameter is not necessary anyway, removing at all is a option.
, [~caofangkun] I'm so sorry. I missed this [post](http://qnalist.com/questions/5094095/topology-receiver-buffer-size-no-longer-honored)
As you modified, I agree with you that these codes are no longer needed. , Github user caofangkun commented on the pull request:

    This is technically a non-backwards compatible change, but I think it is OK.  I am +1.

    No one else has decided to review this, and it still compiles and I am still +1 so I will merge it in.
