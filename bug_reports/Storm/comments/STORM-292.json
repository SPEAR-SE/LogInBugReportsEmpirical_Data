[Since SplitAndJoinTopology is cyclic. I was looking at  Nathan's previous commits to "fix deadlock bug due to variant of dining philosophers problem" using overflow-buffer for spouts.

I think storm should extend the use of overflow-buffer to bolts as well to avoid deadlock on bolt while publishing to queue with no free slots. Any thoughts?
, That sounds good to me.  I would rather have a topology use more memory then dead/live lock., It is already fixed by STORM-216.
Please refer https://github.com/apache/storm/commit/fe5f41aa8332700d3f98422cb7d986fc47289bcd, Only using overflow-buffer for spouts is not enough to solve the  "dining philosophers problem"? why do we need overflow-buffer in bolts?, [~ujfjhz],

You are right overflow has been on for all spouts and bolts for quite a while.  Since security went in as a part of 0.10.  If you are running into it please upgrade to at least 0.10 and preferable 1.0. ]
