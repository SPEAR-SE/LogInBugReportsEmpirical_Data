    STORM-1455: Do not reset the emittedOffset for offsetOutOfRangeExceptions

    There are two changes in this PR 
    
    - If there is a TopicOffsetOutOfRangeException, it can be due to an old failed tuple. We should not reset the state back to the beginning. 
    - Apart from the last completed offset, also emit the last emitted offset in the metric. latestEmittedOffset now points to the last emitted offset.

    Thanks @revans2 . Fixed the compilation error. I had missed some changes. To put these changes in 1.0 release, do I need to open another pull request?

    Typically you don't need a separate pull request.  Just ask for it and we will cherry-pick it.  If there are merge conflicts we may come back and ask for a separate pull request.
