    STORM-286: Use URLEncoder#encode with the encoding specified.

    We should set the name of character encoding to UTF-8 explicitly
    because URLEncoder#encode without the encoding parameter is deprecated
    and the W3C states that UTF-8 should be used according to Java API docs.

    $ git pull https://github.com/mnogu/incubator-storm avoid-deprecated-encode
