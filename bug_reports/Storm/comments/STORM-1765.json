[[~hmclouro] ,[~sriharsha]: I have a quick question around Storm-kafka bolt, I thought it might be related to this Jira so decided to ask here. Is it possible to use KafkaBolt of pervious version to write messages to Kafka (0.9) enabled with SSL + ACL? or should STORM-1765 should address it?, [~supermonk] You can use use existing storm-kafka KafkaBolt which uses new producer API . You should configure SSL and pass the right configs to enable SSL in kafka producer Follow the doc here http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#security_ssl . , [~sriharsha] : Thanks I was able to get it working, the problem was I was using storm 0.10 (Storm-kafka ) which was having old Producer, I used Storm 1.0 and it is working fine., [~hmclouro],

Is this something you still intend to do?, [~revans2] Yes. I planned on doing this when I refactored the examples code, but it got postponed a bit. I will do this asap., [~revans2] does this JIRA still make sense in face of your recent PR https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1808, Sorry I didn't respond sooner.  Things have been a bit crazy for the last few weeks.

https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1808 includes this.  We can move it, but because they are compiled against different versions of kafka things get a bit harry.  I thought it would be best to copy it and deprecate the original., [~revans2] OK. Since the JIRA is now assigned to yourself, I will defer. Please let me know if I can be of any help.]
