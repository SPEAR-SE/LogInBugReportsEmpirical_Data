    STORM-1078: Updated RateTracker to be thread safe

    , more accurate, and very fast. Removed sub-sampling of rate calculation in disruptor, because sub-sampling was more expensive than just doing the calculation.

    It would be better to comment that it is continuous test after previous loop, so for each loop earliest bucket (which stores 10) is eclipsed and replaced to 20.
    I was misunderstood L43-51 to a new test, so I spent some times to find out why it is not 20.0.

    It's easier to understand. Great work.
