    [STORM-357] Cleans workers-users file only when rmr is successful

    We do not check the exit code of the "worker launcher" script, but even if we did, it returns 255 indiscriminately preventing us from distinguishing failure modes.
    
    This change adds a specialized function for calling "rmr" that throws an exception if we find in fact that the worker root dir was not removed after the script returns.
