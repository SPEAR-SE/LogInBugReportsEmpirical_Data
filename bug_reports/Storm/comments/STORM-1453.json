    Test failures are the same, and they look unrelated.  We may want a new Jira created under [STORM-915](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-915).

    @revans2 looks like this was originally #996, which had the requisite +1s, but needed an upmerge. I think @caofangkun just opened a new pull request and closed #996.
