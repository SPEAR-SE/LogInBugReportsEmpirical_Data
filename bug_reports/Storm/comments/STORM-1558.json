    Upmerged, please help review again. The CI failure seems unrelated to this PR.

    I find that `event-log-link` breaks component page due to the same reason.
    
    https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/ui/core.clj#L148
    
    So we can fix it in this PR too.

    All tests pass on my Mac, the CI failure should be unrelated.
