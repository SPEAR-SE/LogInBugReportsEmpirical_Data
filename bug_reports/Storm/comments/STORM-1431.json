To answer your question the supervisor does not know why it has not started.  You need to look at the worker logs for the process to see if it has printed anything out.  In reality this is not always a problem these messages often happen because it takes a while to bring up a worker.  They is why they are INFO logs and not WARN or ERROR.]
