[Example of {{JAVA_HOME}} set to "c:\Program Files\..."

{code}
C:\Users\derekd\Desktop\storm-inst\apache-storm-0.9.2-incubating-SNAPSHOT>bin\st
orm nimbus
The system cannot find the path specified.
Error: JAVA_HOME is incorrectly set.
\QuickTime\QTSystem\QTJava.zip was unexpected at this time.
C:\Users\derekd\Desktop\storm-inst\apache-storm-0.9.2-incubating-SNAPSHOT>echo %
JAVA_HOME%
c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_55
{code}, Replacing %JAVA_HOME% with "%JAVA_HOME" doesn't resolve the issue ?, Yeah, that sounds like it would work.  I very briefly tried double-quoting instances where the variable was used, but it still resulted in a similar error at a different part of the script.  I have not taken time to look at it further., I fixed this issue with STORM-487.
My JAVA_HOME contains C:₩Program Files, but it works well with patched bin₩storm script.
Please take a look at https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/280, Tested on a windows box with https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/373 
Should be ok :-)
, Seems the fix was recently merged to master, so Resolving this Jira.

Thank you Frantz!]
