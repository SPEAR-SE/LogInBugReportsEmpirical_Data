[Attaching before/after  screenshots of profiler screenshots, The attached profiler info related to the amount of time taken by ~45k invocations each of  Spout.nextTuple() and  Bolt.execute()  suggests a perf boost of:

*Spout.nextTuple() :*   6953ms -> 5396ms  =  *~30%* improvement
*Bolt.execute() :*         5313ms -> 3687ms =   *~ 44%* improvement, GitHub user roshannaik opened a pull request:

    Nice, +1
    According to https://gist.github.com/tolitius/1721519, maybe we can try recursive approach to improve performance if we want to stick in clojure. But now we don't need to, and this PR is clearer.

    I was able to run the unit tests successfully for this.. but wanted to ensure a committer is able to review the Java ACKing logic implementation and confirm it looks good.

    I haven't looked at the conflicts yet, But we may need separate pull requests for the mast and 1.x branches. But that should be trivial.
    
    Can you add this to STORM-1491?
