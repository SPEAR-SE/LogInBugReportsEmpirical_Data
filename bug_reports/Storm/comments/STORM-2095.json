[When nimbus dies while a blob is being created, the temp file is left in the directory. When Nimbus starts up and tries to delete the blob, it's looking for a file named after the blob name. That file doesn't exist, and when the delete of the blob folder is attempted, it fails.

To fix this, when deleting the folder for the blob, this will also delete any partially uploaded temp files.

I created a pull request for this: https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1848, Thanks [~mwissman], I merged into master, 1.x, 1.0.x branches.]
