[Tested on 1.x and it works fine. 

The way how it writes ResourceUtils/getBoltsResources is able to avoid NPE issue.  But that's not the case in 2.x. Technically it's the same bug in 1.x source code. 

But we don't need to change 1.x because in 1.x, we don't care about resources for system bolts. They will be just default values., Thanks [~ethanli],
