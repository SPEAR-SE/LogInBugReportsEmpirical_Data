    @abhishekagarwal87 Great. Could you apply it to bolt, too?
, I assume that you are referring to STORM-292. I will raise a separate PR for that one. Have assigned that issue to myself. , No, Bolt also has overflow buffer. We just need to apply same thing to Bolt., Github user abhishekagarwal87 commented on the pull request:

    Applied the same to bolt as well.

    Backporting STORM-1027

    This PR is to backport STORM-1027 into 0.9.x branch. @HeartSaVioR can you merge this?

    @abhishekagarwal87 
    Vote for releasing 0.9.6 and 0.10.0 is in progress.
    I heard from @ptgoetz that Storm 0.9.x line will be faded out, so I'm expecting non-critical bugs cannot trigger new release of 0.9.x line.
    So if you're affecting STORM-1027 and willing to resolve it ASAP using official release, using 0.10.0 will be fastest way to do it.
    I can merge it to 0.9.x line, but I can't say when to release, so I'm curious that this should be backported.

    can this not be released as part of 0.9.6? We see this deadlock regularly in our kafka spout based topologies.

    @abhishekagarwal87 @HeartSaVioR 
    
    I'm okay with canceling the current 0.9.6 release vote and cutting a new release candidate if there is enough community support. I'll raise the question on the 0.9.6 release thread.

    @ptgoetz @abhishekagarwal87 
    If we can cancel current release vote, and decide to cancel, I'll do backport this to 0.9.6. Decision should be made.

    For long running topologies using kafka spout, we have always ran into this deadlock. It completely blocks the topology. Internally, we are already running the storm with this patch.
