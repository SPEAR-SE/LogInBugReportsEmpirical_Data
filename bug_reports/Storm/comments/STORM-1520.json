    STORM-1520 [for master branch] Nimbus Clojure/Zookeeper issue ("stateChanged" method not found)

    Please take a look at the mapping between Curator ConnectionState and Storm ConnectionState.
    
    When pull request is merged, I'll craft the pull request which can be applied to 1.x-branch.
    (It would be nearly same to this pull request but I've seen small conflict since we ported ZK to Java.)

    STORM-1520 Nimbus Clojure/Zookeeper issue ("stateChanged" method not found)
    
    * fix a bug which passes wrong type of parameter to ClusterStateListener.stateChanged()
      * we passed ConnectionState from Curator which method needs storm's ConnectionState

----
, Since this bug also affects master branch (2.x), I submitted a pull request for master.
Crafting pull request for 1.x-branch would be easy, so I'd like to let PR for master branch in reviewing first., Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:

    In this line, listener is ClusterStateListener which was introduced to unify interfaces between Zookeeper and Pacemaker.
    
    Method signature of ClusterStateLister.stateChanged() is 
    `void stateChanged(org.apache.storm.cluster.ConnectionState newState)`,
     while ConnectionStateListener.stateChanged() is 
    `void stateChanged(org.apache.curator.framework.CuratorFramework client, org.apache.curator.framework.state.ConnectionState newState)`
    
    So it should remove client from parameter, and convert ConnectionState from Curator to ConnectionState from Storm.

    Seems like I didn't explain why this occurs and how to fix. Explained inline.

    Nice explanation!  Helps a lot to have such "whys" explained out, thanks!

    Thanks for kind words. :) I hope that Storm will get rid of many kinds of type / signature / typo problems when ported to Java, static typed language.

    It doesn't make any conflicts with 1.x-branch, so I merged to 1.x-branch without new pull request.
    Thanks all for the review!
