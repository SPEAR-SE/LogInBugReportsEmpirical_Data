[Having multiple supervisors share the same storm-local is bad and can result in a lot of other errors beyond this.

If you want to run multiple supervisors on the same node please set {code}storm.local.dir{code} differently for each of them.  I am not totally sure how you are launching your supervisors through mesos, but you can set configs on the command line using -c when launching the supervisor just like you can when launching a topology.

You are also going to have to set the {code}supervisor.slots.ports{code} to be different for each supervisor or the workers will collide with each other when trying to run.  There are likely to be other issues too.  This is not officially supported., We are using this project to integrate Storm and Mesos: https://github.com/mesos/storm and it actually launches several supervisors on the same storm local dir.
It seems it's more to do with that project, therefore i submitted this issue on their GitHub page.

Thanks., The link to submitted issue: https://github.com/mesos/storm/issues/60, As I replied in the issue that [~ernisv] raised (https://github.com/mesos/storm/issues/60), the solution is to leverage mesos's ability to put framework's data into separate sandboxes.  Just *don't* set {{storm.local.dir}} and the cwd of the Mesos Executor will be used for the Supervisor, which will be in the supervisor-specific sandbox.

FYI [~revans2], the ports are taken care of automatically by Mesos's scheduler/offer system, as they are considered part of the resources that each topology is claiming on the Mesos worker nodes ("mesos-slave" has now been renamedÂ as "mesos-agent").]
