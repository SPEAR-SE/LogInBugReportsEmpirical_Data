[I believe this is fixed as of 1.2.0. From 1.2.0 on we will use the KafkaConsumer constructor that doesn't take key/value deserializer parameters, so configure will be called. Compare https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/e296d65fdd17c8f8b1fde966e2d54fdad259a7bc/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/internal/KafkaConsumerFactoryDefault.java#L25 and the 1.1.1 version https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/internal/KafkaConsumerFactoryDefault.java#L25.

We shouldn't need to make KafkaConsumerFactory public., This approach is also effective.Thank you for your reply.]
