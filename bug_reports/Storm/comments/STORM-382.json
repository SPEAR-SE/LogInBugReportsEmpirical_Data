    @Gvain Can you change the PR title to be STORM-382. UI index/topology summary page display disorder info. It will tag it in the JIRA.

    Is this a duplicate of STORM-369?
    
    Were there other issues that STORM-369 did not fix?
    
    It seems STORM-369 changed the order of the values, while this patch changes the order of the headings.

, I am resolving this as a dupe of STORM-369, if someone disagrees feel free to reopen this issue, I think the problem is still there, take a look at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-542.

Am I missing something?]
