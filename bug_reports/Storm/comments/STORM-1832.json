[Lately, my topologies have gotten stuck on backpressure mode, even when all components' capacity goes to (and stays at) 0... I'm wondering if this is what's happening. How can I can test/verify that our metricsconsumer is the issue?, [~BaconSeason]
Sorry for the delay. I just saw this comment now.
You can see the capacity of metric consumer bolt and determine that is root of the issue or not.
When we address queue metrics on UI you can easily see that symptom., Relevant issue was marked as 'Fixed']
