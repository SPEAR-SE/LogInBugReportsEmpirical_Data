    STORM-1161: Add License headers and add rat checks to builds

    This moves Apache Rat out of the release profile and into the standard build process.  It will add a slight amount of time to builds for the benefit of more frequent and thorough license audits.
    
    I also updated 16 files with the appropriate license header.

    Travis says that storm-hive failed the rat check.  Can someone show me the contents of "/home/travis/build/apache/storm/external/storm-hive/target/rat.txt" ?

    @dossett none of us have permission for those files, in fact they are probably gone by now.  Travis only saves what was output to the log.  You could put in something in the ./dev-tools/travis that will spit out the contents of rat.txt files if the build fails because of rat.

    I found the storm-hive issue.  The remaining java7 failure appears unrelated to these changes and java8 build was successful.

    @revans2 @ptgoetz @redsanket Are you still +1 on this change?  I added the small travis step of printing file names with failed licenses since your vote.

    I just tried to build with this and we need to upmerge because filght.bash has been added in recently.

Can you please take a look., [~sriharsha],

I have seen this too, but it tends to show up when I have a large patch sitting around.  For some reason rat scans all of the files in the project space and it takes a crazy long time for large patch files, I don't know why.  It might be worth making rat run by default as a part of CI, but not always as a part of the normal build., We could also try adding *.patch to the rat ignore configuration.

, [~revans2] [~dossett] I am running this against master branch and there are no new files but its taking forever to complete. Also this will break our packaging process as we checkout the git repo everytime for our nightly builds.  Agree on making this as part of CI not for normal build.]
