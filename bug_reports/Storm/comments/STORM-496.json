[[~revans2] This should be fixed when we do merge. I am assigning it to you. Thanks., This was pulled in with security, [~revans2] Any reason to remove the logging. If its for security the problem I see with having these is if users have access to supervisor nodes they can see what is going on other topologies . They won't be able to access it via storm logviewer as there will be access control., I am talking about the missing log-message from here https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/ab5e5096a1acb7f2df46acfcec32caa4fa3e9af2/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/task.clj#L134, Sorry I misread the JIRA when I closed it.  I thought that they were added back in as part of security, not that they were removed as part of the security change., GitHub user harshach opened a pull request:
