[https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/17, 
This isn't just an inconvenient limitation.  This is also potentially a rather serious security bug in that lack of escaping implies that it is likely that it is possible to inject arbitrary commands using things like back ticks.

, In this case we are going to the os without using a shell.  The program to be run is hard-coded to 'java' (both before and after the patch).  An attack using backticks as part of the topology name would result in the backticks being passed literally as part of the argument to java.

It would be possible to use the topology name to pass additional options to java.  We already facilitate this through topology.worker.childopts.

Non-options would be treated as arguments, and additional arguments would cause the worker to exit immediately (wrong number of arguments)., New pull request https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/18 (supersedes 17), Github user d2r commented on the pull request:

    OK, fixed escaping in the string that is logged.  Also up-merged.
