[I have no idea to modify source.xml to make it work. 
Easier workaround is renaming ".log" files to ".log.test" and modify logviewer-test to refer renamed files if it works.
I don't like this kind of workaround, so if someone can resolve this with former way, I'm happy to lend a hand., GitHub user HeartSaVioR opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1300

    STORM-1677 Test resource files are excluded from source distribution, which makes logviewer-test failing

    * rename '.log' files to '.log.test' which can avoid exclusion when building source distribution
    
    I can create pull request for 1.x-branch too, but just cherry-picking `d5e1112` would be easier if we cancel voting 1.0.0 RC1 and revert some commits.

    @HeartSaVioR I'm not sure whether it is caused by `*.log` rule in gitignore.
    If *true*, we can apply your patch(`d5e1112 `), or create another patch just change the rule from `*.log` to `derby.log`, or revert the `e58c67a` commit(btw, although I don't recommend using the last way).

    @vesense 
    I explained why this happens from JIRA issue, please refer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1677. 
    'log' files are already stored to git repo but not included to source distribution.
