[patch supplied, On same subject, we should also add "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu" directory into library path.

Reasoning :
/usr/lib64 is standard for Red Hat world whereas /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu is used in Debian multi-arch distribution (see [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec] and [https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch])
, Thanks, Hugo Picado.

I merged the pull request into master.]
