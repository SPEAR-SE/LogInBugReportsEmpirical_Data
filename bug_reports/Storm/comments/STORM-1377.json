    [STORM-1377] Adds lock when launching a test cluster

    There seems to be a race that results in certain tests accessing the wrong test nimbus server, and that is causing failures.  This gates attempts of any of the tests to talk to a nimbus cluster.

    I am not sure this will solve the problemâ€”the jdk8 build failed even on this branch. I have reproduced this on a local, single-core cluster.  Closing until I can find a more reliable work-around.
    
    I am suspecting an unexpected exception is being thrown here, and it is not actually a locking issue.
    
    Closing until I can figure this out.

    > Are we going from 30 seconds to 3000 miliseconds here? Shouldn't it be 30000?
    
    30 seconds is an extremely long timeout for a thrift response.  Most of the time, 30ms is enough.  If the thrift server does not reply within 3 full seconds, I am done waiting for it.
    
    
    > How about adding a comment describing why the choice of 3000 in this particular test?
    
    Yes, I can add a shorter comment.

    Sure, I will do that.

    Hi @d2r , could you change 3 secs a little longer? We've met the case in production that for a large topology(say, 800+ workers, 4000+ tasks), this may timeout.

    @unsleepy22, these are timeouts for simple tests.  Normally much, much shorter timeouts work.  It's just that on single-core environments, like that of our travis-ci, some of the clients cannot quite reply in 30 milliseconds.  This should not affect any deployment in production; it is merely for running tests.

    It's an unlikely scenario and I might be paranoid, but what if the tests were running on a cluster under heavy traffic? For instance, what if the tests were to be run on OpenStack, and the test just happened to run when there is unrelated heavy traffic (say, Hadoop shuffle) pressuring the switches?

    This should be using the loopback device.  I think the main problem here is the CPU was too busy to have the thrift server reply within 30ms.  If traffic were the issue, we would see many more of our tests fail similarly.
