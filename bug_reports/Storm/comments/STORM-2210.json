[When running the multi threaded version of the test above, I consistently get distributions similar to the ones below. This shows how many times the grouping returned each taskId.

ShuffleGrouping - with Collections.shuffle():
[50, 155, 10775, 284226, 665, 4129]

ShuffleGrouping - without Collections.shuffle():
[50000, 50000, 50000, 50000, 50000, 50000], My 2 cents...I like this implementation better because it doesn't rely on a "oops we hit a race condition, better loop thru again until its cleared up"

I merged this into master, 1.x-branch and 1.0.x-branch.  Keep up the good work.]
