    unfortunately this change breaks some tests on linux
    ```
    3446 [main] INFO  kafka.log.LogManager - Log directory '/tmpkafka_tmp_logs' not found, creating it.
    3453 [main] ERROR kafka.server.KafkaServerStartable - Fatal error during KafkaServerStable startup. Prepare to shutdown
    kafka.common.KafkaException: Failed to create data directory /tmpkafka_tmp_logs
    ...
    ```
    (see https://github.com/wurstmeister/storm-kafka-0.8-plus/issues/44)
    
    Unfortunately I did not have a chance to send a PR yet, will send one shortly
