[The problem is in the following in util.clj:
{code}
(defn zip-contains-dir? [zipfile target]
  (let [entries (->> zipfile (ZipFile.) .entries enumeration-seq (map (memfn getName)))]
    (some? #(.startsWith % (str target file-path-separator)) entries)
    ))
{code}

In the jar file, the file-path-separator is trying to find target + file-path-separator. In this case, file-path-separator on windows is "\" and hence it is searching for "resource\". However jar file always uses "/" as separator. Hence it cannot find "resources/" and instead it should actually be looking for "resources/"
