[It appears that the "-Dstorm.log.dir" arg is not passed to the LogWriter which is causing this. Will raise a PR for the same., GitHub user arunmahadevan opened a pull request:

    [STORM-1024] Pass -Dstorm.log.dir arg to LogWriter

    The log4j variable `${sys:storm.log.dir}` is used in `worker.xml` to set the fileName however the system property was not being set while launching worker (via LogWriter) causing a directory by the name ${sys:storm.log.dir} to be created under `STORM_HOME` dir.
    
    This fix is to pass the system property while launching LogWriter

    While merging to master, I found it breaks some tests of supervisor_test.clj. 
    Since it's minor, I fixed things before merging.
, Thanks [~arunmahadevan],
I merged into master and 0.10.x-branch.]
