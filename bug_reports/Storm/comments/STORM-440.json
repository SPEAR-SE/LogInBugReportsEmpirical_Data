[I'll see if I can put together a pull request but my clojure is pretty bad so it might take a bit for me to figure out how to write a test., Actually, could we just add a reasonable default to defaults.yaml?, Its actually already provided in defaults.yaml[1] but we are creating our own NimbusClient and supplying it our own config Map. Is there an easy way to read these defaults?

[1] - https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/conf/defaults.yaml#L37, Utils.readStormConfig is the best way to get the config.  It reads in default, and lays the command line options on top of them., Ok looks like that works using just storm-core as well. I think we can close this then. It would be nice to have a config POJO that loaded in the defaults for me instead of having to use a map and know to do this but thats a bigger change than this issue., I think we still need to fix this in some way.  The issue is a usability one.  Trying to create a NimbusClient or a DRPCClient requires a full cluster config.  If that is true, then we need to provide better APIs to let users do that in a simple way.  Perhaps we can add in a few new Constructors or make the config to getConfiguredClient optional and smarter.  And do the same for DRPC too.

{code}
public static NimbusClient getConfiguredClient() {
  return getConfgiuredClient(null);
}
public static NimbusClient getConfiguredClient(Map conf) {
  try {
    Map fullConf = Utils.readStormConfig();
    if (conf != null) {
        fullConf.putAll(conf);
    } 
    String nimbusHost = (String) fullConf.get(Config.NIMBUS_HOST);
    int nimbusPort = Utils.getInt(fullConf.get(Config.NIMBUS_THRIFT_PORT));
    return new NimbusClient(fullConf, nimbusHost, nimbusPort);
  } catch (TTransportException ex) {
    throw new RuntimeException(ex);
  }
}

    shoud be ```return new DRPCClient(fullConf, host, port).getClient();```
