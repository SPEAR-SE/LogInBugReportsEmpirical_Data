[Thanks [~revans2], I merged into master.

I'm following your comment on PR and just only merged into master, but we can port back this anytime., [~kabhwan],

The only real thing to be careful with pulling it into another branch is making sure to set the serialVersionUID correctly.  I tested it for 2.x and I know that it works.  I think that 1.x will have the same ID as 2.x, but because we were not specifying it before I really would want to check before back-porting.]
