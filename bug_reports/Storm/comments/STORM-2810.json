Thanks, I merged the patch into master. 
I noticed the failure of storm-hdfs in Travis CI with OpenJDK7 looks like consistent, and you also put 1.1.2 to affects version/s as well. Could you raise a PR against 1.x branch as well? Cause it doesn't look like clean cherry picking. Please let me know if you don't have time to do so, I'll try to craft it., [~kabhwan] Thanks for reviewing. You're welcome to take a look at backporting it. As you noted it doesn't cherry-pick cleanly, it looks like storm-hdfs on 1.x is missing some of the changes from 2.0.0 (e.g. https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2315, seemingly also some of https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1773). I'm not familiar enough with storm-hdfs to tell whether the difference to 2.0.0 is on purpose or by accident, so I don't feel comfortable resolving the conflicts., [~kabhwan] Nevermind, once I disabled whitespace diffing in my mergetool it got a lot easier to backport. I'll get a PR up sometime soon.]
