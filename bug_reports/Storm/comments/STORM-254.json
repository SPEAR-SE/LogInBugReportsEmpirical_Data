    [STORM-254] one Spout/Bolt can register metric twice with same name in different timeBucket

    In a Bolt's prepare method, we can register metrics twice with the same name, using different timeBucketSizeInSecs parameter, like this:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    public void prepare(Map stormConf, TopologyContext context)
    { 
        mapper = new ObjectMapper(); 
        CountMetric cMetric = new CountMetric(); 
        context.registerMetric("JavaBoltCount", cMetric, 120); 
        CountMetric ccMetric = new CountMetric(); 
        context.registerMetric("JavaBoltCount", ccMetric, 60); 
    }
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is caused by TopologyContext's registerMetric. 
    In TopologyContext, all registered metrics holds in a map defined below:
    private Map<Integer,Map<Integer, Map<String, IMetric>>> _registeredMetrics;
    timeBucketSizeInSecs ----> __taskId ----> metricName ----> metirc
    But the same name check just at the innermost layer.

    I am sorry it has taken me so long to look at this.  The code change looks good.  It would be nice to have a unit test for this, but I don't think it is that critical.  I am +1 for this.
