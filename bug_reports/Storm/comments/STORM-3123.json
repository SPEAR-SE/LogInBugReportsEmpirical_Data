[I guess https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3068 will resolve this, [~Rajkumar Singh] Thanks for commenting. This is not the issue of JVM args being ignored. Actually the Storm Kafka Monitor is not initializing KafkaConsumer with these SSL properties. I'm working on a patch, will update here soon.]
