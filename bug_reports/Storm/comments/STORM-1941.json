    STORM-1941 Nimbus discovery can fail when zookeeper reconnect happens. (1.x)

    * delete ephemeral node first when reconnected handler is called
    
    This also deletes node if session is alive but reconnected.
    If we really need to avoid deleting node, we could check ephemeral owner before deleting. Zookeeper reconnect is not happening so often, so I guess it's fine to not applying. If you think we should, please let me know.
    
    Btw, blobstore also uses ephemeral nodes so I'm curious they should be recreated too.

    Aren't we using ephemeral node for this? If not I think we should do that no? Instead of manually deleting the node.

    @harshach 
    This is for edge case for ephemeral node not deleted while session is closed.
    Please refer http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1941.
    
    I know it's odd but it is happening, and other article states this behavior.
