[[~RAbreu] This is expected behavior and shouldn't affect processing. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2542 (I know the fix version lists only 2.0.0/1.2.0, but we backported to 1.1.2 as well in https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2549). 

Basically we are letting the spout manage which processes consume which partitions, rather than letting Kafka control it, and that's why you're seeing a different output. When it's referring to "active members" it means KafkaConsumers that are currently letting Kafka control their subscriptions. Since the spout controls the subscription manually, its consumer isn't considered an active member., Thank you for the clarification [~Srdo]. It makes sense.
 This can lead to some confusion if one only relies on Apache Kafka tools to inquiries about the consumers' health.
 What is the recommend way , other than check the lag that can even be increasing due to a slower Spout, to know if a Spout controlled subscription is active for a particular partition?, I would just use the logs https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.java#L1062. If you want to know whether the topology is healthy, you can look at Storm UI.

Additionally, you can still use kafka-consumer-groups if you like. Note that it's printing the current committed offset for the consumer group, so you should be able to tell whether the topology is making progress., Thank you for you time [~Srdo]]. I'll close this ticket since it's a non-issue/expected behaviour.
