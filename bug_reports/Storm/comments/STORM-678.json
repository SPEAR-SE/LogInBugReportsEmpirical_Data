[[~manishknema] what you mean by "Now kinit with another user 'test2' refresh the UI. It still says the 'test' user ." . Do you still see the storm UI logged in as test user? although you kinited as test2 user? . Also can you please send an email on users@storm.apache.org . we can check with devs and users before opening a JIRA. Thanks., [~manishknema] Storm UI kerberos delegation works as expected. The issue here is we are using Hadoop Authentication filter for SPNEGO. This filter has a default value 10hours for the cookie which sets the "token.validity" .So if a user authenticated and grabbed the ticket its valid for 10hrs. Changing kinit from command line doesn't affect this. 
You can add "token.validity" : "4"  this sets token validity to 4 seconds and you can see the change in the UI as switch between users as you change login with kinit. In general this is not a regular practice as users log in with one single principal. 

Here is the example config
ui.filter.params:
   "type": "kerberos"
   "kerberos.principal": "HTTP/nimbus.witzend.com@WITZEND.COM"
   "kerberos.keytab": "/vagrant/keytabs/http.keytab"
   "kerberos.name.rules": "RULE:[2:$1@$0]([jt]t@.*EXAMPLE.COM)s/.*/$MAPRED_USER/ RULE:[2:$1@$0]([nd]n@.*EXAMPLE.COM)s/.*/$HDFS_USER/DEFAULT"
   "token.validity": "4"
, [~harsha_ch] Thanks, this seems to be working as expected, 

This might be required as one can dedicate few nodes as edge/gateway node where users can login and submit/view their job in secured cluster.
