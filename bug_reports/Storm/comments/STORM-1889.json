[I think we already have this ability.

By setting storm.local.hostname on each of the supervisors it should fix your issue, because that is what will be reported to nimbus, and is what will be used when building the URL for the logviewer., Sorry I think I put this in the wrong JIRA., is there any update on the issue? I can not find any other references except this ticket so hope the issue I am experiencing has some work around.

From what I see, the REST API is not in sync with the UI. The index-page-template.html is expecting schedulerInfo which is not in response.

I also encountered another issue where deactivate does not work. It generates rest POST /api/v1/topology/:id/deactivate/0/ instead of /api/v1/topology/:id/deactivate. Any thoughts?, No longer an issue for me. This happened after upgrading existing cluster from 0.10.0 to 1.0.1. Once I cleared browser's cache, the issue was gone. I had to do it for everyone on my team., The caching issue is being addressed in a PR I put up: https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1536

It adds cache busting such that with a new deployment of Storm, the UI will know to re-fetch resources like the script.js, and others.
, Yep,

I saw your JIRA and cleared caches manually.
