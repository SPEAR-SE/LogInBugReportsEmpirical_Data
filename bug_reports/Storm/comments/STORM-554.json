[(defn- get-task-object [^TopologyContext topology component-id] ... ... )

i think the type of param topology is StormTopology not TopologyContext, Update "get-task-object" function, change the type of first param "topology" from ^TopologyContext to ^StormTopology

    @harshach I have filed a JIRA, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-554. 
, [~zhangjinlong] lets resolve the JIRA once the code merged in. Thanks., the "get-task-object" is called by "mk-task-data" function in task.clj, "mk-task-data" is defined as following:

(defn mk-task-data [executor-data task-id]
  (recursive-map
    :executor-data executor-data
    :task-id task-id
    :system-context (system-topology-context (:worker executor-data) executor-data task-id)
    :user-context (user-topology-context (:worker executor-data) executor-data task-id)
    :builtin-metrics (builtin-metrics/make-data (:type executor-data))
    :tasks-fn (mk-tasks-fn <>)
    :object (get-task-object (.getRawTopology ^TopologyContext (:system-context <>)) (:component-id executor-data))))

(:system-context <>) return TopologyContext instance, TopologyContext extends GeneralTopologyContext, the TopologyContext instance has StormTopology _topology. “getRawTopology” method of TopologyContext must return StormTopology _topology. (.getRawTopology ^TopologyContext (:system-context <>) return StormTopology instance not TopologyContext instance. so the type of param topology is StormTopology not TopologyContext.

at the same time, "get-task-object" call "get_spouts" and "get_bolts" of the param topology. you can find the "get_spouts" and "get_bolts" function are only defined in StormTopology, and StormTopology is not a subclass of TopologyContext. so i think the type of param topology is StormTopology not TopologyContext., the type of real argument is "StormTopology", however the "get-task-object" function use a error type declaration "TopologyContext", clojure REPL will not raise error. 

you can see this example:

; SLIME 20100404
user> (defn get_date_time [^String date] (.getTime date))
#'user/get_date_time
user> (def today (java.util.Date.))
#'user/today
user> (get_date_time today)
1416187016658
user> (def ss (String. "today"))
#'user/ss
user> (get_date_time ss)
No matching field found: getTime for class java.lang.String
  [Thrown class java.lang.IllegalArgumentException]

the "get_date_time" function use a error type declaration "String" to param date, however, there is no “getTime” method in class “String”. in fact, the "getTime" method is defined by "java.util.Date". (get_date_time today), clojure REPL will not raise error; but (get_date_time ss), clojure REPL must raise error "No matching field found: getTime for class java.lang.String". the question of "get-task-object" function is same as "get_date_time".

because the type of real argument is "StormTopology", "get-task-object" calls "get_spouts" and "get_bolts" not raise error, but, if the type of real argument is "TopologyContext", "get-task-object" calls "get_spouts" and "get_bolts" must raise error. class TopologyContext do not have "get_spouts" and "get_bolts" method.

in such a situation, clojure REPL type check will not raise error., Github user BuDongDong commented on the pull request:

    @BuDongDong, OK, got a compile error because STORM-441 went in since you made your change.  So we need to up-merge this branch and add an import for StormTopology, since it is no longer pulled in via bootstrap.
    
    ```Diff
    -  (:import [backtype.storm.generated SpoutSpec Bolt StateSpoutSpec])
    +  (:import [backtype.storm.generated SpoutSpec Bolt StateSpoutSpec
    +                                     StormTopology])
    ```
    
    Git will merge the file successfully despite this conflict, so if you could make this change to tasks.clj and push to your branch, hopefully it will work.

    @d2r I haved imported backtype.storm.generated.StormTopology in task.clj.

    OK, thanks.  I will take care of the merge conflict.  I want to run the tests once.
