[We use this api integration tests as well which has stopped working., [~raghavgautam] 
Great finding. Could you submit pull requests for master and 1.x, and even 1.0.x? Seems like 1.0.x and 1.x branch has same issue.
Normally users don't encounter the issue since we disable event logger by default., [~kabhwan] Will do that., Thanks [~raghavgautam], I merged into master, 1.x, 1.0.x branches., As I left comment from the PR, my bad. 1.x and 1.0.x branches were doing correctly.
I'll revert this from 1.x and 1.0.x, and the issue on master should be handled via STORM-2305., Just revert them.]
