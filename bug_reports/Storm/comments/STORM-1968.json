    [STORM-1968] Storm logviewer does not work for nimbus.log in secure cluster

    logviewer invokes "get-log-user-group-whitelist" which tries to get the worker metadata file by invoking "get-log-metadata-file". In the case of nimbus.log clojure-from-yaml-file  returns nil and the authorization fails.
    
    Modify clojure-from-yaml-file to return an empty map in case of failures so that the authorization can continue.
