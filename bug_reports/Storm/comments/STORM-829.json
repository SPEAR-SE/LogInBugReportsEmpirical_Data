    Just a couple comments:
     - Would you please include the summary of the Jira in the title of the pull request
     - There are a bunch of commits here. Would you squash them?
     - I think the jira calls for the removal of `hadoop-auth` from storm-core's pom. Have you found a reason for keeping it?

    Thanks for your review, @knusbaum !
    
    I've followed your suggestions (title, rebase, remove hadoop-auth in storm-core/pom.xml).
