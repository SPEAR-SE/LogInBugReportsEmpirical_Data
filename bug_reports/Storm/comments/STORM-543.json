[Attached two files for the acker good case and acker bad case. Thes are the acker logs (obtained using topology.debug : true) taken post worker restarts.

acker good case --> When the supervisor starts worker on a different supervisor slot then it was previously running.

acker bad case --> When the supervisor starts worker on the same supervisor slot it was previously running on.
, This has been resolved in 0.9.3 hence closing the issue.

Thank you.]
