    STORM-490: fix build under Windows

    This fixes several issues that caused the build to fail in Windows environments.
    
    In order to work around the fact that Windows doesn't have symlinks, I had to replace the symlinks for `storm.py` and `storm.rb` with copies. Not ideal, but I couldn't find a non-trivial alternative.

    I got a kind of odd error trying to merge this in.
    
    ```
    error: unable to create symlink storm-core/src/dev/resources/storm.py (File name too long)
    error: unable to create symlink storm-core/src/dev/resources/storm.rb (File name too long)
    ```
    when I copied the original files over the top of it, everything worked afterwards. I am +1 for merging this in, but I don't have a windows box, so I will leave it up to you to merge it in and be sure that it still works on windows.
    
    You probably also want to take a look at #265 as it is trying to add in another symlink for storm.js similar to what you are undoing for storm.rb and storm.py.
