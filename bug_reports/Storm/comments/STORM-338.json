    @xpe I totally agree that upmerging is a pain, so I think we can probably get this in soon.  Then the pain is mine to upmerge all of my outstanding patches :).
    
    I would like to see a section added to DEVELOPER.md describing the coding style, pointing to the other web pages you listed, and also the suggestions for IDEs that can help with the formatting.
    
    I would also like to see the title of this pull request edited to have STORM-338 in it.  The project has some tools that tie the two together using the title.

    Thanks @xpe,  If you can update DEVELOPER.md and then upmerge, there appear to be a few minor conflicts, that would be great.

    @xpe Thanks, I am now +1 on this change, it would be great to get another commiter to also give a +1 so that we can get this merged in and stop with the upmerging.

    We have documentation in Config.java.  Do we want to duplicate it here?

    Hmmm, this looks like a change from the upmerge.  Disregard.

    I havent' had the time to walk through the code, but the least I can do is to confirm that all tests pass on my machine when running a top-level `mvn clean install`.
    
    As shown in the pull request there are 4 conflicting files if you try to merge @xpe's changes into `master`;  I told git to overwrite those 4 files with their the remote versions (i.e. @xpe's changes).

    Having code style standards is a good idea, and I'm for it.
    
    * No objection to the style chosen.
    
    * With this change, there is a git-blame "barrier."  Say I am searching for the revision a particular change was made: It seems to me I will hit this commit for a large amount of the lines in the clojure source instead of locating the commit where the last non-formatting change was made.  Anyone know a way around this or a better way of locating a commit for a particular line of code?
    
    * To practically help with compliance to this standard, is there an automated tool we could use to validate changes or is it up to the reviewers to manually do this?
    
    * One tiny spelling comment

    There are two +1's but @d2r had the one spelling fix that needed to go in.  I think the question of tools is something that will be ongoing.  If there are no objections in the next few hours I will try to merge this in, and fix the spelling myself.

    +1 go for it.
, I just pulled this into master, but I am going to hold off on resolving this until 0.9.3 is added to the versions list.  Unless you can make me a JIRA administrator for STORM Taylor, then I'll just do it myself., Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:

    Glad to see that we could get this in.  Hopefully it will not cause too many headaches for others up-merging.  I think I am the one that will have the biggest headache with the security branch :).
, [~revans2] I added you as an admin, and also added the 0.9.3-incubating version to JIRA. I'm canceling the 0.9.2 release vote, so this fix will actually land in 0.9.2., Github user xpe commented on the pull request:

    Thank you all very much; sorry I didn't get the last parts dialed in.
