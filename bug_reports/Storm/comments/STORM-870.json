[In brief, it is intentional.

STORM-329 changes reconnection strategy, which is dropping messages while connection is unavailable.
[Guaranteeing message processing|https://storm.apache.org/documentation/Guaranteeing-message-processing.html] will replay tuple tree, so it has to be calculated whole tuple tree again, but it still guarantee at-least-once message processing.

Btw, Spout has its pending messages waiting for ack / fail / timeout to "memory", so sending ack to "new Spout" has no effect.
It means that Storm already relied on "at-least-once replay" at this situation before STORM-329.

Here's javadoc for Client.handleMessagesWhenConnectionIsUnavailable().

We will drop pending messages and let at-least-once message replay kick in.
Another option would be to buffer the messages in memory.  But this option has the risk of causing OOM errors, especially for topologies that disable message acking because we don't know whether the connection recovery will succeed  or not, and how long the recovery will take.

Hope this helps.
Since it is not a bug, I'll close this issue.]
