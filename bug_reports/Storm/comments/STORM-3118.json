[Just curious: does STORM-2693 give enough impact to replace Pacemaker? Ideally we should let Pacemaker fading out since it was just born to resolve specific limitation, and I believe Oath has most biggest Storm cluster(s)., I have not done any scale tests, but if we want to mark pacemaker as deprecated I would be +1.  And we can remove it in 3.x.  But for us to be able to do a rolling upgrade we still need to support pacemaker in 2.x, [~revans2]

I just thought out loud: it was based on ideal thought and I think we can't deprecate pacemaker without proper scale tests., Thanks [~agresch],

 

I merged this into master.]
