[The upgrade to 0.10.x is not a rolling upgrade.  The format of the state in zookeeper and elsewhere was changed to be thrift serialized.  You need to wipe out the state on nimbus and each of the workers as part of the install/upgrade process.  This is to allow us to make almost all upgrades in the future rolling upgrades.

If you are still having issues after clearing out the contents of storm-local please feel free to ask on the users or dev mailing lists.  If you feel it is a bug in storm feel free to reopen this JIRA]
