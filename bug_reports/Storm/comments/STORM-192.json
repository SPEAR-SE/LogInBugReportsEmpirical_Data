[The problem was related to IPV6, in the storm.yaml i now use the the name of the machine and not the ip address it have fix some error in the log.

The other problem in the storm.yaml I declare the DRCP server but in the java code I was adding it as well but with less server so the yaml was overwrited when deploy the topology. ]
