    STORM-1670 version store should consider only active/finished version files and avoid throwing FNF Exception 

    LocalState#get(String) can throw FileNotFoundException which may result in supervisr.clj#sync-processes which stop assigning new workers/assignments etc.

    @satishd For some reason this is causing the storm-core clojure tests to fail consistently. Could you take a look?

    @ptgoetz Tests in `org.apache.storm.versioned-store-test` does not really create a file with the created version but invoked `succeedVersion` which internally creates a `<version-path>.VERSION`. Those tests should have created a file with whatever data that wants to be saved.
