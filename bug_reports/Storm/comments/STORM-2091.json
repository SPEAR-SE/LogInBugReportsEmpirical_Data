[I've built version 1.1.0 which works fine with kafka 0.10.0.1, closed this issue., [~stannie42]
If you can still reproduce this with Storm 1.0.2, let's reopen this and set Affects Version/s to 1.0.2 so that fix could be available to 1.0.3., storm-kafka-client 1.0.x only works for 0.9.x and I was using the version 0.10.0.1 of kafka which only works with the version 1.1.0 of storm-kafka-client. So no need to re-open this ticket.

This could be clarified by updating the documentation at this page :
http://storm.apache.org/releases/1.0.2/storm-kafka.html
and to provide a matrix of compatibility storm-kafka-client vs kafka versions.

If you need any help, let me know,

Thanks,
Pierre., Yes I missed it. Thanks. READMEs are clearly stating this.

https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/1.0.x-branch/external/storm-kafka-client

Btw, we need to expose README of storm-kafka-client as website as well. Only old storm-kafka is on website.]
