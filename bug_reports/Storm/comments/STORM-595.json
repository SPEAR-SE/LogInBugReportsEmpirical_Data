    Added support for serialization to SequenceFileBolt
    
    Added support for org.apache.hadoop.io.serializer.Serialization to the

    I changed my original commit to reflect feedback that I was given. This is a simpler version that does not introduce a new interface or do type checking on the format object, but does have the effect of breaking the current API.
