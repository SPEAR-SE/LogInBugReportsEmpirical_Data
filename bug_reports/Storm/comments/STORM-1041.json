[Can you take the stack trace after the topology is stuck? Attach the stack trace here afterwards.  , I had encounter similar issue. I build a trident topology with 4 workers. At the beginning, the topology is running well. But after a while, the  performance slow down quickly.  so I put some track information to the topology, and found something:
    Sometimes, the time between two continuous batch is 10 minutes(always 10 min, it is weird). so, can any one tell me, what did the storm do in the 10min? was it stuck?

Could any one offer some help?
