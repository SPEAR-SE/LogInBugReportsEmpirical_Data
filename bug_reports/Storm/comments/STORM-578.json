    Thanks, @revans2
    I've corrected the other calls.
    This did lead to test failures in my test runs, though the place you mentioned didn't seem to cause any issue (I suspect executor-id->tasks isn't call in that particular test).

, [~mansheng] Thanks again for the fix I merged this into master.]
