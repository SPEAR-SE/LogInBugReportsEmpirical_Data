[Actually this issue happens only when the trident tuples has to be transferred over the network (and has to be serialized). 

To reproduce, I set numWorkers to '4' in TridentWordCount, topology.eventlogger.executors: 1 in storm.yaml, ran the topology and then turn on debug/sampling from UI., GitHub user arunmahadevan opened a pull request:

    [STORM-1540] Fix Debug/Sampling for Trident

    When ConsList emitted by a trident spout has to be transferred over
    the network, it fails during Serialization. The proposed fix is to make ConsList
    kyro serializable.

    Could we look at turning on "topology.testing.always.try.serialize" for the thrift unit tests?  This config should have caught it without the need for multiple real workers.

    +0 at this time just because I'd like to do some additional testing and verification.
