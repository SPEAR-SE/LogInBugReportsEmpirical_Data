[Could you add 'storm.local.hostname: <hostname or ip>' to storm.yaml for each node and see it helps?, It works. Thanks!, Actually it's only necessary to add this into the nimbus and supervisor configuration., [~kabhwan] It turned out that it only works when I use `docker-machine` and specify docker host's ip as `storm.local.hostname`. It doesn't work when docker is running locally and `storm.local.hostname` is localhost. Moreover, not only log search doesn't work in that case but also UI can't connect to the Nimbus as well as topology submission doesn't work.]
