    [ConfigUtils](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/ConfigUtils.java#L407) appears to take care of the relative path, so this check could be removed.

    Can you update the PR title ?
    
    Theres a PR https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1109 for the same issue but it does not make use of the ConfigUtils since it had to be merged to 1.x as well. Since this PR is a better fix for 2.0, I will close https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1109 and raise that against 1.x-branch.
    
    +1 to merge against master (not 1.x-branch) once review comment is addressed.

    I removed relative path handling and updated the title - hope this is what you meant?

    When the unit tests are run it creates log files under /logs. It should ideally be under system tmp directory. 
    
    Maybe unrelated, but when an example topology is submitted worker crashes with the below error,

    @mproch 
    Thanks for the work! I merged this into master.
    
    I'd like to also set assignee from JIRA issue to you but I couldn't find your name in Apache JIRA.
    If you have your account in JIRA, please do the followings,
    
    - set assignee to yourself at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1545 
    - resolve issue as 'resolved'
    - set fix version/s to 2.0.0
    
    Please let me know if you're not interested to do the things. I'll just assign assignee as reporter and resolve issue.
