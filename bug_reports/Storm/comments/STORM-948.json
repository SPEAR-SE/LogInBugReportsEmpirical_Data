[Hi, Eugene, I tried the latest storm version. And I am able to see the "topology.max.spout.pending" value in the Nimbus Configuration on the UI page. Could we have more details about how to repeat this problem? Thanks.
 , Hi Zhuo, I'm using FsStorm (https://github.com/et1975/FsStorm) to compose and submit a topology for execution over multilang. It uses thrift API directly (w/o any java client libs) to submit the topology, if you have a test in mind that does something like that I could try and reproduce it., Hi Eugene, do you mind using FsStorm to generate a topology's thrift with conf, and print (or attach) the deserialized key info on this JIRA? That would help us a lot to find the reason. Thanks!, thrift-serialized ReliableSpout definition (from FstGuaranteed sample) with the config key set.
It looks like this in the file:
{ "topology.max.spout.pending" : 123 }, Yeah, thanks for the info. In your screenshot, is "123" the value you expected or submitted for topology.max.spout.pending? , To clarify: the attachment is the thrift-serialized (bin) representation of the spout definition, not a screenshot. You should be able to deserialize it in any language that has the thrift lib support. 

The 123 value is the submitted config value (from the spout definition). 

Hope it helps., The value not reported anywhere, but it it has the desired effect. Resolving.]
