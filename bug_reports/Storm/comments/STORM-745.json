Hello.
I'd like to ask some question to get into it.

1. Did you download Storm from http://storm.apache.org/downloads.html ? What does "pre-built for windows" mean?
2. What file did you use for run? Is it storm.py or storm.cmd?, Hi junqtaek,
Yes I downloaded storm from http://storm.apache.org/downloads.html the exact link would be http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/storm/apache-storm-0.9.4/apache-storm-0.9.4.zip .

I used \bin storm.cmd to run in windows and bin\storm to run in Linux.

Thanks for the mail Junqtaek.

Regards
Jishnu Prathap

, I modified storm.cmd for debug this behavior.

{code}
  if %storm-command% == jar (
    set STORM_OPTS=%STORM_CLIENT_OPTS% %STORM_OPTS% -Dstorm.jar=%2
    set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%2
    set CLASS=%3
    set args=%4
    echo "-> %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9"
    shift
    echo "-> %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9"
    :start
    if [%4] == [] goto done
    set args=%args% %4
    shift
    echo "--> %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9"
    goto start

    :done
    echo %args%
    set storm-command-arguments=%args%
  )
  echo "-->> %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9"
{code}

When I execute "storm jar StormZeroMQ.jar com.wipro.bdas.zeromq.ZMQTopology value1 value2 value3 value4 value5", it prints below.

"-> jar StormZeroMQ.jar com.wipro.bdas.zeromq.ZMQTopology value1 value2 value3 v
alue4 value5 "
"-> jar StormZeroMQ.jar com.wipro.bdas.zeromq.ZMQTopology value1 value2 value3 v
alue4 value5 "
"--> jar StormZeroMQ.jar com.wipro.bdas.zeromq.ZMQTopology value1 value2 value3
value4 value5 "
"--> value1 value2 value3 value4 value5    "
"--> value2 value3 value4 value5     "
"--> value3 value4 value5      "
 value1 value3 value4 value5
"-->> value3 value4 value5      "

As you see, shift doesn't evaluated before calling goto.

I found the hint from http://ss64.com/nt/shift.html.

The SHIFT command will not work within parenthesis/brackets, so place all your command line arguments in variables before running any FOR commands or other bracketed expressions. Or use the CALL syntax as explained in this forum thread.

I'll post a pull request which fixes this behavior., GitHub user HeartSaVioR opened a pull request:

    Please refer https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-745 to see more details.
    
    The problem is, shift doesn't evaluated before calling goto.

    Just calling goto first resolves it.

    Maybe storm.cmd would be something hard to maintain. Executing storm.py within storm.cmd would be better.

    This is a regression that affects 0.9.4, and I've confirmed this patch fixes it.
    
    I'm +1 for merging as well as applying it to the 0.9.x branch and releasing 0.9.5.
    
    @HeartSaVioR, thanks for the fix.
