    I would suspect the validity of this change since "fail" is a substring of "failure", the script should not miss "failure"s by searching "fail".

    @unsleepy22  the  api "find(match)" of Python ElementTree finds the first sub element matching match. So the match is sub element, but not sub string

    +1 good catch.  I was wondering why it seemed to work on the clojure code but not on junit.  Thanks for doing this.
