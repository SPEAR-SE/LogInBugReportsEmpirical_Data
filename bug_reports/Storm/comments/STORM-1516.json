[org.apache.storm.starter.SlidingWindowTopology can be used to reproduce this issue., Whenever a topology is submitted, it creates respective workers on supervisor/s. These worker pids are stored as files in ${storm-localdir}/workers/{worker-id}/pids/ on supervisor. But there is an issue in storing worker pids. So, supervisor could not find respective worker pids when a topology is killed. Subsequent topology deployment workers are failed because of earlier workers are still alive and bound to the respective ports. This issue occurs only on 2.0 branch. 

The issue here is that worker.clj # mk-server has below bug.
(ConfigUtils/clusterMode conf) returns a string but it is compared with keyword which returns false, because of which pids are not stored. 

  (when (= :distributed (ConfigUtils/clusterMode conf)) 
    (let [pid (process-pid)]
      (touch (ConfigUtils/workerPidPath conf worker-id pid))
      (spit (ConfigUtils/workerArtifactsPidPath conf storm-id port) pid)))

    STORM-1516 Fixed issue in writing pids with distributed cluster mode.

    Whenever a topology is submitted, it creates respective workers on supervisor/s. These worker pids are stored as files in ${storm-localdir}/workers/{worker-id}/pids/ on supervisor. But there is an issue in storing worker pids. So, supervisor could not find respective worker pids when a topology is killed. Subsequent topology deployment workers are failed because of earlier workers are still alive and bound to the respective ports. 
    
    Fixed worker.clj to have right checks while writing pids to respective locations.

    how is this different from checking state == "distributed"

    Satish already explains why it occurs via JIRA comment.

    Easy explanation: 
    ```
    => (= :dist "dist")
    false
    ```

    @satishd Is it happening with all topologies ?

    Thanks @HeartSaVioR . Got it now.

    @arunmahadevan Right, this issue happens with all topologies. There is nothing specific about the mentioned topology in JIRA.

    The code looks fine to me, but for some reason nimbus-test is failing fairly consistently.  Also storm-hdfs is very unstable right now.

    I just did some poking around and it looks like these failures are likely unrelated.

    @satishd can you upmerge this and also open another PR for 1.x-branch if we want this there as well. Thanks.
