    The new ')' is in the wrong place.  It should be up on line 1255 instead.

    Also I tried to reproduce the issue on master and I am seeing the second topology come up on the ui without any issues.  Could you try to reproduce the error on master and let me know if it is still an issue?

    The code compiles now, but I still have not been able to reproduce the original cause of this problem. am I doing something wrong?
    ```
    ./bin/storm dev-zookeeper &
    ./bin/storm nimbus &
    ./bin/storm supervisor &
    ./bin/storm ui &
    ./bin/storm logviewer &
    ```
    wait for the UI to come up
    ```
    ./bin/storm jar ./examples/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-0.10.0-SNAPSHOT.jar storm.starter.WordCountTopology wc -c topology.workers=4
    ./bin/storm jar ./examples/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-0.10.0-SNAPSHOT.jar storm.starter.WordCountTopology wc-2 -c topology.workers=4
    ```
    
    Both show up in the TopologySummary section of the index.html page.

    @revans2 
    I have tried on master.  The UI indeed display correctly.  This should be no longer a issue. 
    Thanks for your attention and patience.
    I will close this issue.
