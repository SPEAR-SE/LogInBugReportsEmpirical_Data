[There seems to be race condition between BoltReaderRunnable.run() and ShellBolt.cleanup().

ShellBolt.cleanup() interrupts ReaderThread but actually few of methods inside BoltReaderRunnable.run() throws InterruptedException. (Accessing _pendingWrites throws InterruptedException, but I cannot find any others.)
So we assume that interrupting ReaderThread doesn't stop its flow at that time before encountering _pendingWrite.

1. ReaderThread.run() passes "while(_running)" check and dive into loop.
2. ShellBolt.cleanup() interrupts ReaderThread. It has marked as 'interrupted'.
3. ShellBolt.cleanup() clears _inputs
4. ReaderThread.run() reads shell message, and it is emit, so it calls handleEmit().
5. ShellBolt.handleEmit() checks _inputs but nothing found. So it throws RuntimeException., Seems like we have some options to solve.

1. Don't clear _inputs while cleanup() and let GC take care of all things.
2. Synchronize ShellBolt.cleanup() and ReaderThread.run() loop using lock.
3. What else?

I'd like to hear your opinion. Thanks in advance!, Additional Information: charlie quillard didn't treat heartbeat well, so ShellBolt tries to suicide, and issue occurs.]
