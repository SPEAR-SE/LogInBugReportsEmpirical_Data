    STORM-1945 Fix NPE bugs on topology spout lag for storm-kafka-monitor

    * Fix several spots which are throwing NPE on TopologySpoutLag
      * Use a trick to get classname of Spout without requiring storm-kafka and storm-kafka-client
    * Move storm-kafka-monitor jar to toollib directory
      * since jars in extlib are added to worker classpath which we don't want for this jar
    
    @priyank5485 @harshach Please take a look and comment. Thanks!

    The problem starts here. For many situation we can't deserialize Spout object since UI doesn't have dependency for that Spout, for example, storm-kafka or storm-kafka-client.

    @HeartSaVioR how do we deserialize for supervisors or others they don't have any dependency on  spouts or any other component.

    @HeartSaVioR while we are here can we fix the JSON response as well.
    currently what we have is this
    [{"spoutLagResult":"[{\"topic\":\"topic\",\"partition\":0,\"consumerCommittedOffset\":1175610,\"logHeadOffset\":5634192,\"lag\":4458582},{\"topic\":\"topic\",\"partition\":1,\"consumerCommittedOffset\":1251325,\"logHeadOffset\":5634192,\"lag\":4382867}]","spoutId":"spout","spoutType":"KAFKA"}]
    
    we should be returning an array instead lets have something like this
    
    { "spoutId" : "spout"
      "spoutType" :  "KAFKA"
      "spoutLagResult" : [
          "topic": // key is topic name
                ["partition0": {\"consumerCommittedOffset\":1175610,\"logHeadOffset\":5634192,\"lag\":4458582},
                 "partition2: {\"consumerCommittedOffset\":1175610,\"logHeadOffset\":5634192,\"lag\":4458582},
                ],
          "topic2" : 
                     ["partition0": {\"consumerCommittedOffset\":1175610,\"logHeadOffset\":5634192,\"lag\":4458582},

    @harshach Only task calls this method, no need to deserialize spout / bolt objects on daemons. Now UI is an exception case.

    I see. Since storm-kafka-monitor was being copied always, this section was not needed anymore. Thanks for clarifying.

    I agree this is better for removing duplicated thing and also easy to find by path. I'll update it.

    It would be better for changing JSON response to file a new issue and make it out of scope for this PR, since [STORM-1945](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1945) is a bugfix which is marked as critical.
