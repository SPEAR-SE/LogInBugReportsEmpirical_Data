[What's your storm version?
Could you provide more log messages?, sorry for late reply , i updated the problem with more details, can you help ? , Neither of those messages indicate that an error has occurred.  They are warnings but are perfectly normal in some situations.  Please ask these types of questions on the mailing list user@storm.apache.org, not in JIRA.  Also 0.8.2 is a really old version of storm and eats any error messages that are written to stdout/stderr by the worker process.  If you can upgrade to something like 0.9.6 it should help with your debugging a lot.]
