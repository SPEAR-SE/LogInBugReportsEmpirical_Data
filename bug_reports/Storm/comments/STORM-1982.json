[Is there a way to reproduce this issue? , Easy.

{code}
cd <STORM_HOME>/examples/storm-starter
../../bin/storm jar storm-starter-topologies-1.0.2.jar org.apache.storm.starter.RollingTopWords
{code}

Process will not be terminated. Same thing applied to example topologies with local mode., Seems like STORM-1730 addressed this issue, but it wasn't ported back to 1.0.x branch. Closing as 'Duplicate'.]
