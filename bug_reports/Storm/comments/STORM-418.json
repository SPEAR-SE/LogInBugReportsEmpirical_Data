[Just wondering - did you increase the parallelism of the spout along with the increasing the number of kafka topic partitions? This was not clear in your description., Hi Varun,

yes, we increased spout parallelism along with kafka topic partition increase. The message size we are using for this testing was 80-85 bytes.

Let me know if you need any more details.

Thanks
