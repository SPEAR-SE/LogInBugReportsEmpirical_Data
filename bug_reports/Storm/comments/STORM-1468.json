    I am +1 on this.  Not having 2 copies is good and a lot better then what we have now, but I really would prefer to see a hybrid approach.  Some documentation is really tied to a release.  The REST API for example, where as other documentation is not, the list of contributors and users for example.  I really would prefer to see what I see on other sites, which is some common things but they point into release specific sections that are generated from the release branch, and are obviously tied to a release.
    
    We could also use symlinks to denote stable releases vs releases that are no longer supported.

Is it intentional to apply this to only 2.x?
Diverge between 1.x (1.x-branch) and 2.x (master) comes from this issue, and we may have hard time backporting if pull request needs to fix some docs (for example, STORM-1452)., It is addressed to 1.x-branch via 93e0d028a588a1c45f8966f7e2fde82f207616eb., [~kabhwan], the removal of the {docs} directory has been applied to master and 1.x-branch. The content that was there has been migrated to asf-site, where the website content is maintained. This was intentional to avoid maintaining docs in two separate places.

We would like to figure out a way to version documentation so we can publish docs for different releases, but there haven't been any proposals for an approach.]
