    Oops. Didn't see this before I opened #812 
    I can close or you can close. Either way.

    It is a tiny patch and I don't mind closing this.
    But if you also don't mind, let's resolve it with normal way in open source world, 
    "If diff is same, first input wins, later input will be marked as duplicate." :)

    @HeartSaVioR Sounds good to me. I wasn't aware of that bit of etiquette. #812 is closed.
