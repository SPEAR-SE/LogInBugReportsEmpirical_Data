[AFAIK, It is intended behavior since nextTuple() in Spout shouldn't be blocked.
You can refer http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Concepts.html - Spouts section.

JStorm provides multi-thread mode of Spout, and it could be applied to Storm when merging Storm and JStorm.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1358, That's a fair point, however it's somewhat confusing then that the KafkaConfig allows you to set fetchMaxWait, which defaults to 10s., Not sure how far out the JStorm port is, but in the interim, maybe it would be sufficient to make the Kafka fetch asynchronous.  That way we can allow long-polling without blocking the spout.  ]
