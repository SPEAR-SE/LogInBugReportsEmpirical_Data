[Did you run the integration test? 
`mvn clean install` on current master doesn't reproduce this behavior. 
Could you pull the latest and try again?, I was running mvn clean package and it's the latest code from master. I've never met such exceptions before pulling the latest code today.
By running mvn clean install I get the same exceptions, note that the exceptions don't affect final test results, it's just unexpected exceptions., Sorry, it was NoSuchFileException, updated title., [~Cody]
I also can see the issue you stated from test-report.

Maybe the change comes from this commit, https://github.com/apache/storm/commit/0fc58437badb0f6b464141889d532dea87ff4457

Related configuration are here.

- storm.log.dir
- storm.home
- storm.workers.artifacts.dir

You can refer ConfigUtils.workerArtifactsRoot() to track down why your test tried to write "events.log" file to "/logs/workers-artifacts/<topology id>/<port>/events.log". 

Unfortunately if we doesn't set any of these root dir of worker artifacts is set to /logs/workers-artifacts.
The user account we normally use doesn't have permission to create /logs, so mkdirs() fails "quitely" and we see NoSuchFileException when creating or append actual file.
, Running {code}sudo mvn install{code} resolves this issue, but we need to make it clear that it's OK to set log dir to /logs when three params are default., Yes this will resolve the issue, but not natural, I've changed and opened a PR https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1161, would you please help review?, Thanks [~Cody],

I merged this into master.]
