    [STORM-1517] add peek api in trident stream

    Similar to the Java 8 peek, the peek api can be used to examine trident tuples at
    some point in the stream pipeline or execute some custom actions.

    [STORM-1505] Add map and flatMap functions in trident stream
    
    map and flatmap are common stream operations. Right now in trident this has to be
    implemented via each() which also sends the input field values
    in addition to the mapped field values, so the map and flatmap should make things slightly
    more efficient and easy.

    Addressed review comments
    
    Changed input to the map and flatMap functions from Values to TridentTuple to
    make it more easy to use.

    Added filter api
    
    filter is a wrapper over each to easily filter out tuples flowing through the pipeline.
