[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43086693/custom-log4j2-appender-not-working-with-storm, There is only one spout in topology for now and configured with 2 executors.
  	 	
Also default logger if we don't use custom logger is able to log every log line to file as usual. 
, [~nis3000] Are you still having an issue? If so, could you please post the logged line? 

I'm not too familiar with custom log4j2 appenders, but have you checked that the appender works from a toy project, e.g. a small console application that logs some lines from a few threads? It would help to isolate the potential error if we know that it works in an environment with less moving parts., The version is not we're tracking now. Closing.]
