    LGTM, I've confirmed with print COMMAND and ARGS.
    
    Before applying
    ```
    $ ./storm list "a b" c d
    list
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    ```
    
    After applying
    ```
    $ ./storm list "a b" c d
    list
    ['a b', 'c', 'd']
    ```

    @liaokevin previously bin/storm was a python script but recently it changed to a shell script that wraps the original python script.  The shell script did not quote arguments passed to the python script correctly so if I ran.
    
    ```./storm list "a b" c d```
    it would not honor the quotes around "a b" and treat them as separate arguments.  This is a problem if we include space in the name of a topology, or if we try to add a config to the command line with a space in it.

    @ptgoetz I am merging this into 0.10.x-branch as well, because it was introduced there.  If you disagree please let me know and I will revert it.

    @ptgoetz never mind, JIRA is off STORM-675 said it went into 0.10.0, but it did not.  I will just merge this to trunk.
