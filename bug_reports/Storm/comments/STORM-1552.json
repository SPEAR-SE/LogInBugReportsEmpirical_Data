    [STORM-1552] Fix topology event sampling log dir

    Currently the events are logged under "storm-local/workers-artifacts/{storm-id}/{port}/events.log".
    and the "events" link in UI does not display the log file.
    
    The events.log should be kept under "logs/workers-artifacts/{storm-id}/{port}/events.log"
    so that its viewable via logviewer.

    ConfigUtils.java is not available in 1.x-branch. I wanted the fix to be applied to both 1.x and master so took 1.x as the base and submitted the PR. Someone can let me know in such cases one need to raise two separate PRs with different code to fix the same issue.

    @ptgoetz can you take a look at this?. Figured out that the event log link is broken while testing STORM-1540. This also needs to go into 1.x branch.

    [Storm-1579] Fix NoSuchFileException when running tests in storm-core

    The old code takes "storm.local.dir" property as logDir while changes in STORM-1552 used `ConfigUtils.getLogDir`, which doesn't take this property, causing the ultimate event log directory to be "/logs/xxxx" and resulting in NoSuchFileException.
    
    Note that the only effective change is in `getLogDir` method, I just formatted the whole class.

    The old code takes "storm.local.dir" property as logDir while changes in STORM-1552 used ConfigUtils.getLogDir, which doesn't take this property, causing the ultimate event log directory to be "/logs/xxxx" and resulting in NoSuchFileException because permission is denied to create /logs directory.

    I suspected that the logs directory is being created inside the project itself and failing rat check. I pulled in your changes to check the same. 
    ```find storm-core/storm-local/logs -type f | wc -l
    26
    ``` 
    This directory is not excluded from the RAT check and thus build is failing. can you try excluding this directory from RAT check and run the build on your local end (mvn clean install) to see if the build succeeds?
    Sorry to tell this late but I see a problem with these changes I didn't think of before. Earlier the default log location was under logs directory. With these changes, logs will start going in storm-local directory which is meant for internal use. logs directory becomes redundant since storm.loca.dir always has a default value. In fact this PR will break STORM-1552 which @arunmahadevan should confirm.
    
    The exceptions in test classes may be fixed without changing the getLogDir implementation (by passing the `storm.local.dir/logs` as storm.log.dir property value instead of hardcoded logs directory)
