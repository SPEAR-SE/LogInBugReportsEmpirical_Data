    Sorry I really don't follow all the JIRa updates as closely as I should.  @HeartSaVioR thanks for kicking me :) I'll merge it in.

, Thanks [~dkatten],

I merged this into master, and re numbered the version to be 0.11.0, as there is already a 0.10.x branch.  If you want this to go into 0.10.0 please let me know and I will cherry-pick it in.]
