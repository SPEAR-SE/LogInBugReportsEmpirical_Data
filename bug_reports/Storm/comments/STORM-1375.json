    [STORM-1375] Blobstore broke Pacemaker

    When using the new Pacemaker (which, you kind of have to, cos the alternative of not using it is abusing ZK to the point of deadlocking it...), you cannot submit topologies because submitTopology is calling ClusterState's delete_node_blobstore which never got implemented in pacemaker_state_factory.clj.
    
    This PR introduces a noop implementation of default-node-blobstore for pacemaker.

    move delete-node-blobstore lower so its not implied it passes through to
    zk-state

    @iostat Could you rebase? 3 commits changes only 1 line.

    ugh, seems like github wants to hold on to the previous 3 commits, so now I have 5 commits :(. Worth just reopening this PR, or do any of you know a trick for this?

    @iostat You can rebase your commits into one (squash), and push your working branch to your fork with force option (maybe --force). It will change your PR to one commit.

    I suppose you could just reset the branch to master, copy/paste the change, and force push to this branch
