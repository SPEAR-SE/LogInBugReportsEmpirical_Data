    STORM-269: prevent logviewer from serving files outside the log directory

    This is a quick fix to prevent the log viewer from serving files outside of the log directory. It simply checks that the requested file has the root log directory as a parent. If this is not the case, it will not serve the file.

You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:

    $ git pull https://github.com/ptgoetz/incubator-storm STORM-269

    The string check will not prevent log-dir/../../../../etc/passwd I don't think.
    
    Can we try something like this?
    ```
    (let [file (.getCanonicalFile (File. LOG-DIR fname))
          path (.getCanonicalPath file)]
        (if (= (File. LOG-DIR) (.getParentFile file))
    ```
    
    Indentation looks a little weird too, after the if was added.  Not sure if that's a tabs vs. spaces issue.

    The path to the requested file (String) comes from `File.getCanonicalPath()` further down in the code. so all the relative portions of the path will have been resolved.
    
    I'll check the indentation. I'm open to either approach.

    Yeah, you're rightit is resolved. But then I also noticed `root-dir` is given by the request.
    
    Would a request like this also succeed?

    Yeah, good catch. This thing is an open http server for the entire file system. Thankfully it doesn't support POST or PUT. 
    
    There's no reason we should allow the root-dir to be specified as a request parameter. That's insane. I pity the fool running this as root.
    
    Whatever the fix, I think it needs to be a high priority. I would also consider back porting the fix to earlier releases.

    Root or not, any file readable by storm is accessible, including configuration files which means this has the potential for exposing credentials.

    @lucky Agreed. Until this is fixed, I think we need to recommend that the logviewer daemon not be run unless appropriate safeguards are in place.

    I don't think log-root can be sent as http param its being read from storm config .
    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/logviewer.clj#L108
    with @ptgoetz fix logviewer not able to read any other files apart from the ones in storm.log.dir and log-root is not accepted via http param. I tested the fix in centos 6.3 and windows 7, os x it works in plugging the security hole.

    @d2r I think we're okay with this patch. I tried a couple of things and it looks like you can't override `root-dir` in the request since the `conf-middleware` function associates it with the request, so it is ignored if supplied as a request parameter.
    
    I tried the following url:
    
    ```
    http://supervisor:8000/log?file=hosts&log-root=/etc/
    ```
    
    And nothing was returned. I got the following in `logviewer.log`:
    ```
    2014-04-27 14:07:23 o.m.log [WARN] /log?file=hosts&log-root=/etc/
    java.io.FileNotFoundException: /var/log/storm/hosts (No such file or directory)
    ```
    (Note that in this installation, storm is configured to log to `/var/log/storm/`)

    I updated the patch to fix the formatting. I also added an extra conversion of the `log-root` to a canonical path to ensure we are comparing full paths.

    @harshach, @ptgoetz OK, good to know it is not as open as I feared.
    
    With the String compare instead of File compare, do we know whether this will give a string with a trailing slash?
    ```
    (.getCanonicalPath (File. root-dir))
    ```
    If it does, we should be OK.  If not, then a user could get to certain sibling directories. (e.g., if `root-dir` was a directory named "foo", then a user could read from a sibling directory "foobar").

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/91#issuecomment-41588979
  
    @d2r You're right. I switched over to using `File` to do the comparison. This will also prevent users from accessing files in subdirectories log directory.

    Should this be `(.getCanonicalFile (File. root-dir))`?
    I am not sure whether FileAppender#getFile will give the canonical path.  If it does not, and if the Appender's path has a symlink, then the new condition could fail even for legitimate requests.

    Tiny thing: looks like `(with-open` and following two lines need indentation too.

    * Tested with ../ -> File not found
    * Tested with /etc/passwd -> File not found
    * Tested above with logback pointing to a file with symlink in the path -> File not found
    * Tested with file under sibling directory (logsfoo/foobar) -> File not found
    * Tested normal case (logviewer.log) -> OK
    
    Looks good.

    If you want to change log dir, add line to storm.yaml this line.
    > storm.log.dir=/some/real/dir/path
