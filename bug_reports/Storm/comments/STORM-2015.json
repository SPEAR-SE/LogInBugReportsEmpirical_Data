[Hi All,
             I would like to work on this bug., Actually this is a security issue.  We only allow downloading of files that are under a specific known log directory.  Otherwise a worker could link to a file that it cannot actually read, but the logviewer can.

I think the fix would be to make the a configurable whitelist of allowed subdirectories.]
