[The issue is https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.2.2/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpout.java#L507. If the processing guarantee is not AT_LEAST_ONCE, the offset managers map is empty., Thanks [~Srdo], I merged into master, 1.x, 1.1.x, 1.0.x branches.

This assumes we will cancel the ongoing votes (1.2.2 RC2, 1.1.3 RC1). If we just decide to pass the votes, I'll modify the fix versions accordingly.]
