[[~revans2] I am working on this JIRA. To clarify we need a UI filter class that can authenticate users against to kerberos and let them login and show only the topologies that users are authorized for. Please let me know if there are any other requirements that I need to consider. Thanks., GitHub user harshach opened a pull request:

    STORM-349. (Security) ui actions should have nimbus like authroization.

    Upgraded ring to 1.3.0.  Added IAuthorizer instance to UI daemon. Added
    hadoop-auth as a dependency which allow users to configure
    AuthenticationFilter.

    I'm not sure we want to pull this in directly to storm itself.  Storm already has a lot of dependencies and adding more seems to me like it could pollute the user classpath.  Looking at https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-auth/pom.xml it looks like this is going to add in javax.servlet:servlet-api, commons-codec:commons-codec, org.apache.directory.server:apacheds-kerberos-codec and org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-annotations to the classpath.  Possibly along with some oddness with two versions of Jetty.  org.mortbay.jetty:jetty and the org.eclipse.jetty:jetty that you added in above too. I am OK with adding in new dependencies, but I would like to understand better what really needs to be here and what does not.
    
    Ideally it would also be nice to separate out dependencies that are needed for worker processes from everything else.  But that is probably a separate JIRA.

    So can I assume then, that this also switched the version of jetty that we are using to 7.X from the 6.x line?

    We should remove Config.UI_ACTIONS_ENABLED, or at least deprecate it.

    Overall it looks good.  I think in the future we probably want to explore allowing the UI to pretend to be a different user to nimbus.  This would make the code a lot simpler, and would open up a number of other possibilities in the future.
    
    We could try to do this by modifying the SASL negotiation that happens when authenticating the connection, but I think it would be simpler to update the different Thrift operations to optionally include a doAs argument.  Then Nimbus would validate that the real user is authorized to perform operations on behalf of other users and update things accordingly.  Perhaps you could file a JIRA for this.

    @revans2 I understand having that as dependency is going to be issue. But wanted to have kerberos based filter to be shipped with storm it will give users an easy access instead of putting hadoop-auth in the classpath to enable the filter. What you think about copying required code from hadoop-auth into storm. Mostly duplicating as there wasn't anything to chnage apart from probably cookie name.

    @revans2 Thanks for the feedback. I'll file a jira for doAs.

    Like I said I am OK with adding in new dependencies, I would just like to better understand in full detail exactly what is being pulled in, and if we can leave any of it out through exclusions.  STORM-129 tracks isolating user and system dependencies which is where an ultimate solution really needs to come from.  For the time being I just want to keep unnecessary changes to a minimum.

    @revans2 I pulled out of all the dependencies from hadoop-auth as most of them are already in storm-core/pom.xml or not needed. I noticed a bug when user doesn't have UI-Filter configured it will throw an exception as servlet-request doesn't contain any user related info which causes authorizer to fail. I'll update the PR. Thanks.

    @revans2  I excluded almost all of the dependencies from hadoop-auth and  removed Config.UI_ACTIONS_ENABLED. Please check and let me know if it looks good. Thanks

    Just to add more info what we are using from hadoop-auth is AuthenticationFilter and KerberosAuthenticationHandler. Apart from these excluded all the dependencies from hadoop-auth package.

    Looks good.  I did a diff of the dependencies with what is currently on master and I saw both Jetty and ring change and hadoop-auth added in.
    
    I saw java.classpath-0.2.2.jar and tools.namespace-0.2.4.jar come in too, they seem to be coming with the ring update, so I think it is OK.  I am +1.
, Thanks Harsha,
