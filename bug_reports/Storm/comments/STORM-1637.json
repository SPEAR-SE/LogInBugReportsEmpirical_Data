    This build error is definitely unrelated (intermittent failure in storm-kafka)

    +1. @abhishekagarwal87 Thanks for the patch. For small fixes like this lets not file a jira

    Actually @revans2 had already created a JIRA for this. @HeartSaVioR has a PR open for the same bug I think. So this JIRA can be resolved as duplicate.

    Not wanted to take another action, but just leaving a note: according to BYLAWS, change of pom.xml belongs source code change, so we should wait 1 day for initial patch. That's why I didn't merge #1228 after receiving +1 from dossett.
    If we want to make exception cases like hotfix (this seems to go to hotfix), I'd love to discuss and reflect to BYLAWS.

    BTW, I think @revans2 's main concern is **why JDK7 builds pass while JDK8 builds fail with** in JIRA [STORM-1637](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1637).

    Yes. It is weird. I am taking a look at it.

    It can't find the metadata from repository.apache.org so go on finding alternative repositories.
    And stuck on nexus.codehaus.org, because all codehaus services have now been terminated and maven too.
    Please refer https://www.codehaus.org/
    I don't have an idea why it searches nexus.codehaus.org, but anyway that's the point why build failed.
