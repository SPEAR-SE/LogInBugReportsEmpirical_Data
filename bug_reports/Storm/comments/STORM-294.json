    Do we need to worry about two or more commas `,,`?

    Good point.  The python code in the storm script appears to keep the command line arguments separate, and does not split on space any more.  So the "%%%%" escaping of spaces is probably not needed any more.  Or I could just rearrange the order of the escaping.

    I changed the encoding all together to be URL encoding so that it is more standards based, and already handles corner cases.

    This may cause issues if a pre/post-fix versions of storm are used with nimbus/CLI, but it is a good practice anyway to keep storm versions the same when deploying.
