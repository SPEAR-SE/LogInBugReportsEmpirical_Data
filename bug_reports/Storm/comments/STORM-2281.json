[Trident implementation of storm-kafka-client is only applied to 1.x and master branch, and none of version line is released yet.

Did you build your own Storm with 1.x or master branch? If then please change Affects Version/s accordingly.

And could you reproduce this with Storm 1.0.2 or Storm 1.x branch? I'm not sure storm-kafka-client works with Storm 0.x version line., [~kabhwan] : Yes, We build our own branch. 

I have updated the ticket with the error on storm 1.0 and latest storm-kaka-client.  The error still appears. It has more to do with Kafka Consumer Subscription, [~supermonk] which version of kafka-clients are you using., [~sriharsha] : We are using 0.10.0.0

<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
			<artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId>
			<version>0.10.0.0</version>
		</dependency>, Quick update: I was able to reproduce this on my local machine., Thanks [~hmclouro], I merged into master and 1.x branch.]
