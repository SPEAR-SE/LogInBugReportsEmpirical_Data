[Actually STORM-1378 shouldn't be closed.
In STORM-1378, [~ashnazg] said he only address file path delimeter and can't handle other error messages.
And I can see that error messages again.

[~redsanket] Could we fix this before releasing Storm 1.0.0, or we need to discuss about dropping support for Windows starting at 1.0.0?, +1 for fixing this for 1.0. I don't think we should drop support for Windows., I guess we should modify localizer tests to not check supporting symbolic link in compressed files.
It simply fails on Windows, and I guess there's no workaround to make it work. I already tried testing with elevated command prompt., I found other reason which makes BlobStore UTs failing, delete existing file can be failed on Windows for various reason. 
Main reason is a locked file, various processes try to open the file (Anti-virus and Windows search, too) and it can't be deleted unless closed.
(*Nix just allows to delete that file but actually keep that file unless no process open that file. So *Nix doesn't fail to delete file for the same reason.)

So we should consider how to handle when deletion of file / directory fails., That was the case... 
While deleting file, it throws Exception, and stack trace shows another process holds that file so process can't access file.
But I can delete that file from finder after test process is terminated. It's within the test phase., GitHub user HeartSaVioR opened a pull request:

    STORM-1602 Blobstore UTs are failed on Windows

    * ensures objects of InputStream / OutputStream are closed after used
      * clojure: with-open
      * java: try-with-resource
    * skip checking symbolic link in LocalizerTest when on Windows
      * Windows seems not handle symbolic link in compressed file properly
    
    Some integration tests are still failing on Windows, but it should be handled with another issues.
    
    I'll also address this based on master immediately.
    
    Please have a look. Thanks!

    I assume they all pass on windows so +1
    
    The test failure looks like it is a bug with the mongodb pom.xml that JDK8 does not like but JDK7 seems OK with.  Very odd.  Filed a JIRA for it though.

    @revans2 Very odd indeed... It should give us error because of storm-mongo module.
