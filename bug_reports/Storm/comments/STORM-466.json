[ [~revans2] [~dagit]  [~xiaokang] This issue is caused by non-zero exit in ShellBolt.die
https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/task/ShellBolt.java#L302
easiest fix is to make System.exit(0) although it indicates the process exited without any error.

    @harshach I just merged in #223.  I think we can close this pull and resolve STORM-466 as a dupe of STORM-449.  Please let me know if you don't have permissions in JIRA for that and I will grant them to you.
