[Screenshot attached., Mark it as invalid, may be we should do the fix in yarn instead of storm., I would love it if we could fix this on the YARN side.  The problem is that it would YARN require the proxy to parse HTML/CSS and rewrite the links.  I think this is possible but I am not an expert on HTML, so I should not have been the one to write the proxy anyways.  If anyone can fix it I would be forever grateful for them to clean up my mess. On that note I think the MR API has this same problem, it is just that it uses the same JS libraries that YARN does so it just happens to work., Hi Bobby,

Great to know you also face this problem! 

I'd like to share my work-around for this. I did a small hack in core.clj, add a loader page which use javascript to redirect to the right URL:
(GET "/loader" request (str "<script>window.location.href='http://" (:server-name request) ":" (:server-port request) "'; </script>"))
And then fill the loader page as TrackingURL, so, if the storm ui IP:port can be accessed from your client machine, then it should work.]
