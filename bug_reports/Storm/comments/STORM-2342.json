STORM_HOME/bin/storm version
{code}

, Any update on this. Having similar issue. if I kill the topology and start it again, the same messages are being reprocessed. Don't see offset updated in Kafka/Zookeeper?

storm core version - 1.1.0, its working ok now after updating storm to a newer version, I am using KafkaTridentSpoutOpaque and using latest storm? I don't see Kafka consumer offset topic updated with Consumer Group Id (assigned to Spout). Did you have the similar issue? Also, can someone point me to the code where we are updating the offset in kafka or zookeeper after processing the batch?, Closing as reporter commented that upgrading Storm version resolved the issue., Hello Felipe Cavalcanti, which version did you upgrade to?, Hello Felipe, which version did you upgrade to?, [~felipejfc] please can you tell us what version of storm you upgraded to?  A few of us are experiencing the the same issue.

Do you think the upgrade resolved the problem, or is it possible something else that may have happened during the upgrade might have solved the problem?  For instance is it possible offsets in znode got reset, or data deleted?]
