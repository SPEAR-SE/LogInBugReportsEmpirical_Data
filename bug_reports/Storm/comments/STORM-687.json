    Why are we turning off caching on the client side, instead of having proper cache headers on the server response?  The code looks fine to me, just a bit confused if this is IE specific and it is ignoring the caching headers, or if we just are not including the proper ones.

    @revans2 I tried with setting Cache-Control to no-cache but didnt' see any affect IE but adding no-cache, no-store works with all the browsers. Removed client side settings from JS.
