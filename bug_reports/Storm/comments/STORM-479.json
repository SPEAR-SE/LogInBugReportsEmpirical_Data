    [STORM-479] (security) Multi-tenant scheduler handles already used slot not reported by supervisor

    When there is mismatch between supervisor heartbeats reported number for slots and actual slots used by the worker on the node, this change in multi-tenant scheduler assumes that slot (exists /must have existed on the supervisor before) and accommodates this discrepancy in the state (reported by supervisor vs worker heartbeats).
