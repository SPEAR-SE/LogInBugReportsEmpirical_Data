[Just to +1 this: I just ran into \(1) as well. I'm investigating Storm for a project I'm working on, and the second place I looked was the tutorial. It gave me a 404, which didn't give me a very good feeling about the project. Then I noticed that if I uppercased "tutorial.html" all was well., GitHub user vesense opened a pull request:

, Thanks [~vesense],

I merged this into 0.9.x-branch and pushed the changed .md and generated .html changes to subversion so they should show up for the 0.9.6 release docs., [~revans2] 
There're other pull requests against 0.10.x, 1.x, master. Do you intend to not address them or you just missed them?, [~kabhwan],
