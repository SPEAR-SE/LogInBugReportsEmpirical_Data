    Hi vesense,
    thanks for the PR, but it seems there're 3 files affected by this link:
    Serialization.md
    Structure-of-the-Codebase.md
    backtype.storm.Config L1102.
    
    currently only 1 file is changed. Could you change the other 2 files too?

    Done.Since files are not in the same branch, I have created a new PR (https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/909) for backtype.storm.Config.

    The updated links look good, but I don't understand why this can't be part of #908?
