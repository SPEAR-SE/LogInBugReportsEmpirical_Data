Actually, the server starts working fine. After few seconds, I get this exception. Could be this related to the fact that supervisors restart periodically? I use apache-storm 0.9.6.

, It is hard to tell. 

Please ensure that:
 * supervisord is running on that node. ({{ps aux | grep supervisor}})
 * check that slot (port 6700) is defined in your storm.yaml on all nodes
 * there is no firewall in place on nimbus / supervisor which could block port 6700

Also, a snippet from your supervisord.log would help investigate this issue further., Hi,

Thank you,
