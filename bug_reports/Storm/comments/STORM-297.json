    In general this looks good to me, but it needs to be reviewed by additional committers familiar with the netty transport. Unit tests pass as did a basic smoke test on a 3-node cluster.
    
    As I mentioned in an earlier comment, the additional config parameters need to be added to the `defaults.yaml` file, preferably with some comments/documentation regarding usage and ramifications of certain settings (e.g. sync vs. async). That way users won't have to dig around in source code to determine the default values.
    
    I also noticed that some of the changes you mentioned in the pdf doc don't appear in this pull request (e.g. serialization.reserve.tuple.createTime)? I'm just curious as to why you left some things out.
    
    Thanks for the contribution!

    Hi Taylor,
    
    Yes, you are right. it is used to avoid the worker to hang due to stdout full. The original demo patch is very big, so I have to break it down to several patches. The code which use  this function will appear in followup pull request.

    Can you describe how the worker receive thread has been changed in the pull request? In particular, do we still have the guarantee that messages sent from task A to task B are received in the same order they are sent (or not received at all)? For example, if task A sends messages 1, 2, 3, 4, and task B receives 1, 4, 3 that would violate this guarantee.

    I don't like the idea of having connect block until the connection is established.  Any thread that tries to send data to a connection that is still being established will block until the connection is established. I think it is more robust to buffer the messages in a data structure and try to handle them later when the connection is finished.

    Can we have a max number of iterations on this? I just feel it is more defensive to try for a while, and then if it does not work out log the message and go on.  After all the worst thing that happens with leaving early is that some messages may not have been acked, which we more or less ignore anyways.

    Why?  If I type in 3.5 for an integer config and I get a 3 out of it, is it a problem?  If so then we need to change Config.java to not just expect a Number for these things, but instead have a proper checker that knows this should be an Integer, and checks ranges etc.

    I did a quick pass through the code.  I have some concerns about the blocking nature of a number of the calls, especially connect.  This just feels like it is going to make the worker block until all other workers are up and the connections have been established.

    We are consistent with old behavior.
    If a config expect a integer, then short, int, long are valid; double, float are invalid.

    Hi Bobby,
    
    Thank you for your comments. I addressed most of the issues, except these three:
    
    **issue1:**
    > 
    ```
    +    private synchronized void connect() {
    ```
    > I don't like the idea of having connect block until the connection is established. Any thread that tries to send data to a connection that is still being established will block until the connection is established. I think it is more robust to buffer the messages in a data structure and try to handle them later when the connection is finished.
    
    **reply:** I think it is better to have connection estabilish before we allow message sender to send message. Here is the my obervations when allowing message sender to send message without a established connection:
    
    1. Excessive memory usage
    If  message senders are allow to send message without the connetion being established, the senders are encourged to send as fast as they can. In some profiling, I observed there was sharp increase of heap memory in the beginning, as we will buffer all those message in a unlimited queue in netty client. If the user are using unacked topology or set the topology.max.spout.pending to be a bigger enough value, it will possibly cause the JVM OOM.
    
    2. Longer latency
    The Netty Client queue can turns out to be very long, longer queue means longer latency. For example, suppose Netty Client can at max transfer 10 tuples/second, the Netty Client queue increased to size of 10000 because of this buffering, the spout generates 10 tuple/second, then in this case the queue size will stablize at 10000, the throughput will be 10 tuples/second. The throughput will be the same no matter the queue size is 100, or 1000, or 10000, the latency will be much bigger for queue size 10000. So it is very important to make sure the queue will not increase to too big from the begining.
    
    3. Reduced throughput.
    When the latency is longer, it will reduce the message generation speed of spout, as spout  will wait message to be acked(unacked size controled by topology.max.spout.pending). The longer the initial latency is, the longer it takes for the spout to converge to the balanced speed of tuple generation.  
      
    In the code, we will setup the connection in Client constructor asyncly before the send(message) is called to reduce the time that need to be waited by the message sender.
    ```
            Thread flushChecker = new Thread(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    //make sure we have a connection
                    connect();  //<-----------------here!
    ```

    Just a hint:
    What if we use MORE workers per node than just only ONE worker per node without changing the total number of executors ? By doing so, we will have MORE received threads, transfer threads and netty i/o threads for the total 144 executors. Should this increase total CPU usage and network bandwidth usage?

    >What if we use MORE workers per node than just only ONE worker per node without changing the total number of executors ? By doing so, we will have MORE received threads, transfer threads and netty i/o threads for the total 144 executors. Should this increase total CPU usage and network bandwidth usage?
    
    We tried this approach before, but it won't give us the performance data we want. There were inherit bottleneck there. Besides, receiver.count is not the biggest bottleneck here, netty performance matter more.
    
    The logic behind make "receiver.count" configurable is that, since we allow user to configure spout/bolt executor count per worker, we should also allow user to configure the receiver thread count to make it consistent with the parallism settings.
    
    Besides, increasing worker count will, 
    1. add more cross process or cross machine communication. For tasks inside same worker process,  the message will be **local** dispatched to target task if possible.
    2. More Netty context switch and contention. Check http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/64758709722/making-storm-fly-with-netty
    3. More outbound acker message count. Usually we will allocate one acker to one worker.
    
    So in common practice, each worker will have a moderate size of executors, neither too small, nor too big.

    @clockfly,
    
    Your logic makes since to me on why these calls are blocking.  My biggest concern around the blocking is in the case of a worker crashing.  If a single worker crashes this can block the entire topology from executing until that worker comes back up.  In some cases I can see that being something that you would want.  In other cases I can see speed being the primary concern and some users would like to get partial data fast, rather then accurate data later.
    
    Could we make it configurable on a follow up JIRA where we can have a max limit to the buffering that is allowed, before we block, or throw data away (which is what zeromq does)?

    "So in common practice, each worker will have a moderate size of executors, neither too small, nor too big."
    I agree on this. But what size is considered to be too big or too small. Should 36 be too big? Only a few executors failed to heartbeat to nimbus, the whole worker will reload.
    
    Besides, By using a SHARED threadpool(its default size is 1) among all netty client within a worker, the netty threads number do not increase as total worker numbers increase. Check [jira][storm-12]. So, increasing worker count may not cause netty context switching problem.
    
    "3. More outbound acker message count. Usually we will allocate one acker to one worker."
    But you allocate 48 ackers to only 4 workers.

    Context switch here means netty threads from different worker processes of same machine will compete with each other. 
    
    > "3. More outbound acker message count. Usually we will allocate one acker to one worker."
    But you allocate 48 ackers to only 4 workers.
    
    Usually one acker one worker will suffice. But for the perfomance benchmarking case, acker becomes a bottleneck, because the message count is huge.

    clockfly,
    
    Thanks for your patience. 
    Do you mean that allocating one worker per node is better than several workers per node as the netty threads from different worker process will compete with each other ?
    In production practice, it is properly to allocate only one worker per node ? I don't think so
    
    And i think using several netty threads working in sync and non-batch mode may have some what the same effect with using only one netty threads working in async and batch mode. Maybe i should test this out.  By the way, what storm version do you use in the test ?

    > Do you mean that allocating one worker per node is better than several workers per node as the netty threads from different worker process will compete with each other ?
    
    It depends. Executor is the basic unit of parallism, suppose executor number is the same, adding a worker will add more traffic, but if it is co-located with other worker, it may also increase the bandwith of intra-worker communication(as we do intra-process communication instead of intra-machine).
    
    For example, 1, 1, 1 (means 3 machine, one worker on each) may be faster than co-located 4, 4, 4
    But co-located 3, 0, 0 may be faster than distributed 1, 1, 1. This requires experiment to verify it is better or worse.
    
    >And i think using several netty threads working in sync and non-batch mode may have some what the same effect with using only one netty threads working in async and batch mode. Maybe i should test this out. By the way, what storm version do you use in the test ?
    
    Yes, sync-async can only give us pointers about what could be the possible bottleneck, these need continous profile-tune experiments to prove our guess. By the way, I use storm-0.9 release version.

    Yes getting the best performance of a topology really depends on the resources that your topology is using.  If your topology is CPU bound then you want to spread it out so that you have enough cores to handle the parallelism, but if your topology is I/O bound you want to collocate them as much as possible.  The best performance optimization is simply to stop doing something.  So if you can cut out the serialization/deserialization and sending tuples to another process, even over the loopback device, then that potentially becomes a big win.
    
    The really difficult part is that parts of your topology may be CPU bound, other parts may be I/O bound, and other parts may be constrained by memory (which has it's own limitations).  Also you may have a different definition of "best".  Some users may require a very low latency, and are willing to let most of the cluster sit idle so that they know when something happens they can process it very quickly.  Other times you are willing to sacrifice latency to be sure that everything you want to run fits on a smaller set of hardware.

    I would like to see a test added that tests that messages are received between tasks in the same order they are sent. The test is likely to be probabilistic, in that if the code is wrong it won't always fail, but that's ok. This is a really important property to maintain that this patch, or future modifications on this code, could affect. So it needs better testing. The test should have many workers with many send/receive threads.

    @clockfly 
    
    I used latest storm to reproduce some of your test. I found that adding a few more workers will increase throughput, as well as CPU usage. I also get a max doubled throughput.
    
    Im my test, i used 4 nodes(24 cores each, not power enough than yours), 48 spouts, 48 bolts, 48 ackers, and 4 to 64 workers, SOL benchmark, message size is 100 Bytes. Here is the results:
    
    workers |     Throughput |     CPU usage |     NET usage (only IN Bytes)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     4          |     320,000 tps |    56%             |    14MB/s
     8          |     656,000 tps |    89%             |    28MB/s
     16        |     560,000 tps |    92%             |    26MB/s
     32        |     353,000 tps |    90%             |    20MB/s
     64        |     208,000 tps |    90%             |    16MB/s
    
    Using 8 workers, the throughput doubled. 
    
    As we already discussed:
    (a) Increasing worker count, not too much,  may not cause netty context switching problem. As using a SHARED threadpool(its default size is 1) among all netty client within a worker, the netty threads number do not increase as total worker numbers increase. Check https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/57
    
    (b) Increasing worker count will increase netty threads. Using more netty threads working in sync and non-batch mode may have some what the same effect with using less netty threads working in async and batch mode which is your way.
    
    From the test result, it seems like the above point of view (b)  is true. 
    So, maybe, what we need to to is just pulling the https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/57 and adding a few workers.
    
    But i am still curious about if i adding more nodes, should this still work ?

    @clockfly , @revans2 
    
    I added more nodes, from 4 nodes to 15 nodes, as well as spouts, bolts, ackers and workers, and keep their parallelism count in the same ratio, eg, for every other 4 nodes, add 48 spouts, 48 bolts, 48 ackers and 8 workers. Here is the test result:
    
    nodes | workers | Throughput | CPU usage | NET usage (only IN Bytes)
    4   | 8   | 656,000 tps    | 89% | 28MB/s
    8   | 16 | 1,004,000 tps | 82% | 28MB/s
    12 | 24 | 1,133,000 tps | 72% | 25MB/s
    15 | 30 | 1,235,000 tps | 69% | 24MB/s
    
    for last two rows, the CPU usage decreased, and the throughput increasing speed slows down. I added a few more worker to re-run the test, the result is:
    
    nodes | workers | Throughput | CPU usage | NET usage (only IN Bytes)
    12 | 48 | 1,444,000 tps | 88% | 30MB/s
    15 | 30 | 1,735,000 tps | 88% | 30MB/s
    
    From the result, We can see adding some more workers DO help to scale up performance as adding more CPUs. 
    
    Finally, maybe we should re-considerate the root cause of this issue "STORM-297 Storm Performance cannot be scaled up by adding more CPU cores"

    Hi Gvain,
    
    Firstly I apologize for the late reply, I was stuck by a 2-day training.
    
    Thank you for sharing your data! It is really awesome that we are using the data to present our points!
    
    Before jumping to conclusions, let's make sure we understand the data in the same way and the test can be reproduced, I have some questions about your data.
    
    1. what tps here is consist of? Is it solely consist of spout message? or also including acker message? and other message?
    2. What is the message latency in each test?
    3. I noticed your network usage is pretty small, is it overall cluster network usage? or is it only single machine network usage? Are you using 1Gb network?
    4. What is your max spout pending setting?

    Hi, clockfly
    
    1) tps here only consists of spout emitted messages, NOT including acker messages or any other messages.
    3) the network usage is only SINGLE machine network usage, and only the IN direction bytes counts. And I am using two bonded 1Gb network card.
    4) max.spout.pending is 1000.
    
    As for 2), i didn't really stats message latency. All i did is compared the emitted count by spouts and the received count by bolts, they are quite catch up with each other

    I run with your approach, the result verified your saying, the throughput does increase as worker number increase.

    We can find out both throughput and CPU usage increase when worker number increase.
    
    Analysis
    -------------------
    The facts revealed by this test strengthened my conviction that it is even better to apply this patch for higher performance:
    
    1. **Higher performance with this patch.**
    
      | | Worker# |cluster network IN(MB/s)|spout through put(msg/s)|
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|-----:|
    | no storm-297 | 24 |	130 | 622938 |
    | with storm 297 | 4 |	140 |	752479 |
    
      **4 worker** with storm-297 can process **20% more** message than **24 workers** without this patch, with **less** CPU consumption.
    
    2. **Storm cannot scale well by changing task parallism solely**
    
      As the data in your test showed, for 4 worker, we can only reach 56% CPU. with the facts that there are 36 task parallism for each worker, much lagger than CPU core# 24.
    
      **The worker has inherit bottlenecks, ths issues are there. Work-arounds won't fix those issues.**
    
    3. **CPU System time increase when worker number increase**
    
      | Worker# |user cpu|system cpu|
    | ------------- | -----:|-----:|
    | 4 | 36% | 6%| 
    | 8 | 35%	| 7%	|
    | 12 |	40% | 11% |
    | 16 | 46% | 13% |  
    | 24 |	55% | **22%** |
    | 4(with storm-297) | 67.80% | 5.20% |
    
      Unnormal high system CPU is not good.
    
    4. **JVM allocation cost is high.**
      In the test, there are 16+ threads running for each JVM allocation. The supporting data can be found at  
    
    5. **Worker allocation is not cost free**
    
     Besides the JVM allocation cost, there are zookeeper related threads(4), hearbeat threads(5), system bolt(2), netty boss and worker threads(6, 2 boss, 2 worker, and 2 timer). Plus with JVM threads, each worker will add at least 33 threads. 
    
      More threads will add more pressure to central service like nimbus, and zookeeper.
    
      More threads means more context switch, it will hurt the performance of all applications running on these server. 
    
      | Worker# |cluster total threads#|
    | ------------- |:-------------:|
    | 4 | 422 |
    | 8 | 554 | 
    | 12 | 686 |
    | 16 | 818 |  
    | 24 | **1082** | 
    | 4(with storm-297) | 434 |
    (We will only count 1 gc thread 1 jit thread for each JVM) 
    
      For 24 workers case, the overall thread number is 1082+, with **each machine having more than 270 threads!**
    
    
    6. **Serialization and Deserialization Cost**
    
      When the message is delivered from the task in the same process, the tuple won't be serialized. 
    
      When there are 4 worker(suppose shuffle grouping and task is even distributed), there are 1/4 message that don't need serialization, but for 24 workers, the ratio is 1/24, which means we are now need to serialize 28% more messages.

    Great work @clockfly. The only additional change I'd like to see is renaming "worker.receiver.thread.count" to "topology.worker.receiver.thread.count". The "topology" prefix is how we indicate confs can be set on a topology-specific level. After that I'm +1.

    @clockfly 
    
    Thanks for your detailed test. But notice that there is a big difference between our test results. 
    In my test, only using 8 workers, i get the throughput peak which is 656K tps, and adding more workers the throughput drops down. 
    In your test, adding more worker helps increasing throughput, and the throughput peak reached 622K tps when using 24 workers. The worker number is greatly increased and thus the total threads number.
    
    I am wondering why this difference exists.

    @clockfly Beyond the specific work on this item (STORM-297) what would be your lessons learned after having investigated Storm's performance and scalability so closely, i.e. with regards to potential bottlenecks (= things that are broken and that need fixing) or areas where we still have untapped potential (= where we could optimize further, maybe simply because we haven't focused on a particular piece of the architecture/code/... yet)?
    
    For instance, would you say that there are some general design-related decisions that could put an upper bound on Storm's scalability (in theory and/or in practice)?  Or would you say it is, at least at this point in time, more the current implementation of the design?  Just thinking aloud.
    
    I'd appreciate any comments -- positive or negative -- you might have in this context.

    @Gvain,
    
    There are two parts in your question,
    
    1. In your test, why throughput drops when worker number increase after reaching a value(8 in your test case)? 
      
       For this one, it is because your CPU reach limit for worker# = 8 (CPU usage: 89%), In this case, adding more workers will just adding more threads and context switch, hurting performance. While for my case, I have more powerful CPU, and allow more parallel workers.
    
    2. why there are performance difference when scaling worker# from 4 to 8, in two different  environment?
    
      I don't know the answer. But I guess it may be caused by the difference in hardware. You env is  "bonded 1Gb network card"(2Gb)  bandwith is twice mine, and CPU is 24 core, half of mine. 
    
      Suppose we can model the message transfering pipeline as three layers:
    
      netty layer(throughput somewhat impacted by NIC bandwidth) -> intermediate layer( worker intermediate receiving pipes: netty server handler -> decoding-> receiver thread ) -> task processing (througput impact by CPU).
    
      For your env, CPU is relative at shortage, effective network bandwidth is rich(effective bandwith is measured by theory_bandwidth * network_efficiency_factor), the performance is throttled by the last layer. While for my environment, CPU is rich, effective network bandwidth is not enough(due to theory_bandwidth is only half), the performance is throttled by the first two layers. 
    
      The patch mainly solved the first two layers.
    
      1. Change netty Api from async -> sync and messaging API change will improve the network_efficiency_factor, thus increasing the effective network bandwidth.
    
      2. Adding more receiver thread and optimization in netty server handler will improve the second layer throughput.

    @clockfly 
    
    Thanks for your explanation. The explanation for part 2 seems not so convincing as the CPU and network are not saturated at both env when scaling worker# from 4 to 8. Oops, I don't wanna go any further on this. 
    
    Anyway, your work is really great.
    
    Another thing. Since you use netty to send message in a async way, how can you ensure that  all messages emitted from a fast component are received by a slow component without any loss especially under heavy throughput without any ackers enabled ? To my knowledge, the netty channel may not be writable, and pendings count will increase.

    @miguno, there are several more observations I have
    
    1.	Network still not efficient enough
    
      We can see from the test report, after this fix, the throughput is still bottlenecked by network(CPU: 72%, network: 45%), because there are still margins in the CPU(28%). That’s weird because only 45% of theory network bandwidth is used.
    
    2.	Uneven machine message receive latency
    
      In the experiment, I noticed that there are always some machine whose message receive latency is much higher than the others. For example, tuples generated from machine A, are sent to tasks on machine B, C, D, in one run, tasks on B take more time to receive messages, in another run, D may be the slowest.
    
      My guess is that some machine has a longer netty receiver queue than the other machines, and the queue length on all machines becomes stable but not equal after some time(new input = new output) . The latency is different because queue length is different. Changing max.spout.pending won’t improve this, because it only control overall message sent from A, it doesn’t treat B, C, D differently.
    
    3. better max.spout.pending?
    I observed, after we tune max.spout.pending to a big enough value, increasing max.spout.pending will only add to latency but not throughput. When spout.pending doubles, the latency doubles.
    
      Can we do flow control adaptively so that we stops when there is no further benefit to continue increasing max.spout.pending?
    
    4.	Potential deadlock when all intermediate buffer is full
    
      Consider two worker, task1(workerA) deliver message to task3(workerB), task3 deliver to task2(workerA). There is a loop! It is possible that all worker sender/receiver buffer will be full and block. 
    
      ![vvvv](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2595532/3188775/ba645bdc-ecbd-11e3-959b-dfb8208d4d1b.png)
    
      The current work-around in storm is tricky, it use a unbounded receiver buffer(LinkedBlockingQueue) for each worker to break the loop. But this is not good, because the receiver buffer can potentially be very long, and latency be very high.
    
    5.	Is it necessary for each task to have a dedicated send queue thread?
      Currently, each task has a dedicated send queue thread to push data to worker transfer queue. During the profiling, the task send queue thread is usually at wait state. Maybe it is a good idea to use a shared thread pool replace dedicated thread?
    
    6.	Acker workload very high.
      In the test, I spotted that the acker task is very busy. As each message size is small(100 byte), there are hugh amout of tuples need to be acked. 
    
      Can this acker cost be reduced? 
    
      For example, we can group the tuple at spout to time slice, and each time slice will share a same root tuple Id. For example, the time slice can be 100ms, and there are 10, 000 message in this slice, all share same root id, before sending to acker task, we can first XOR all acker message of same root Id locally on each worker. In that case, we may can reduce the acking network and task cost. The drawback is that when a message is lost, we need to reply all message in this slice.
    
    7.	Worker receive thread blocked by task receiver queue
    
      In worker receiver thread, it will try to publish the messages to the receive queue of each task sequentially in a blocking way. If one task receiver queue is full, the thread will block and wait.

    @Gvain,
    
    For an unacked topology, we can either block, drop, or store. before this patch, storm will always store, so there are potential OOM like you described. this patch steps a bit forward, if the downstream machine is down, it will block the upstream from sending thus avoiding OOM. 
    
    But for the case you mentioned, the downsteam is slow, but not down, it is possible that there will be more message pending at the netty client side or server side. If the network is OK, then it will pend on the server side, if the network is overwhelmed, then the message will be pending at the netty client side. 
    
    An example is that the spout crazyly generate really big message, but the bandwidth is not enough, it will lead to OOM on the spout worker JVM, and nothing can stop that.
    
    Bobby's comment mentioned a similar situation https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/103#issuecomment-43632986, 
    
    We should allow user to config to drop message in this case, thus avoiding OOM,  this bug is filed at followup jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-329 after discussion with Bobby.

    Thanks for your remind. 
    For an unacked topology. Before your patch, the OOM problem do exists, and I filed it at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-339
    
    After your patch, this OOM problem seems still exists just as what you said and filed up at jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-329. Now, we are stuck on this as we are using unacked topology under heavy throughput, so shall we make this issue's priority higher and fix it in time ?

    @Gvain,
    
    Unacked topology with no flow control is dangerous! 
    
    There are two concepts, flow control and error control. You don't want acker for its performance penalty, that is no error control. But you do need flow control.
    
    But the fact is that current storm flow control method "max.spout.pending" depends on error control channel "acker", that is the dilemma. Maybe we should seperate "max.spout.pending" from error control channel "acker" and only serves for flow control.
    
    One work-around is that when you emit a message with SpoutOutputCollector, you emit a id with a sampling rate, for example 1%.
    
    collector.emit(tuple, messageId), 
    
    only 1% tuple has messageId, while 99% don't have.
    
    In this case, you only have 1% acker traffic, reducing the performance penalty of acker, while still have some basic flow control.
    
    Hope this helps!

    Shall we just use a limited size of message queue in netty-client, if the queue is full, we can block or drop until channel has flushed away some pending messages. The strategy can be configurable just as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-329 described.

    Yes, that is what storm-329 want to do. But it may require more thoughts, because introducing another blocking buffer have performance penalty, and may cause deadlock. 
    
    I think for your unacked topology, the more reasonable method is to introduce a flow control mechanism. Let's have more disucssion in the thread of STORM-329.

    @clockfly and everyone else I love the discussion that is happening here.  I think the code is now at a point where we can merge it in (2 binding +1s), and continue the discussion and development on separate JIRAs.   I tried to go through all of the comments and most of what is left is around possible improvements that are still remaining, but nothing blocking.  If anyone disagrees or has issues they have seen, but not expressed yet please speak up.  Otherwise I plan to merge this in later today.

    fixed.
    
    The failed case is under namespace: backtype.storm.messaging-test
    
    root cause:
    The test failure is caused by the bug of local topology simulation. funtion complete-topology will asume topology is finished after all spout return, but it is not always true, the downstream bolts may be still working.
    
    direct cause:
    complete-topology->all spout finish -> shutdown the topology->shutdown worker->shutdown netty client -> bolt still not finished -> bolt try to send mesage to netty client -> client already shutdown -> throw runtime exception.
    
    the fix is to add a config to allow this topology to wait a longer time to be killed.

    -1 Tests should never, ever rely on timing in order to pass. This is the whole reason for doing time simulation in the first place, so that when functionality depends on time it can be properly tested without having to worry about random delays messing up the tests. 
    
    complete-topology is inherently reliant on detecting topology completion based on the spout saying all its tuples are "complete". If you're testing topologies that don't do full tuple acking, then you should be testing using the "tracked topologies" utilities in backtype.storm.testing.clj
    
    For example, here is how the acking system is tested using tracked topologies: https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/master/storm-core/test/clj/backtype/storm/integration_test.clj#L213
    
    The "tracked-wait" function is the key which will only return when both that many tuples have been emitted by the spouts AND the topology is idle (no tuples have been emitted nor will be emitted without further input) You shouldn't use tracked-topologies for topologies that have tick tuples, but that shouldn't be a problem in this case.

    Additionally, besides having the potential to fail randomly inserting sleeps into test code also slows down the tests.

    +1 for me too. The tests passed 3 times in a row, and the changes look good. I'll merge this into trunk now.
