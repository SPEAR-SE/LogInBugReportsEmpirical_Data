[I merged this into 1.x-branch first.

Assuming we may not resolve this for master branch soon for better fix, it might be better to clone the issue for master branch and mark this as resolved. Because when we're releasing Storm 1.2.0 having opened issue for 1.2.0 will not make sense. WDYT?, [~kabhwan], clone for 2.0 - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2884 so that we can resolve this bug.]
