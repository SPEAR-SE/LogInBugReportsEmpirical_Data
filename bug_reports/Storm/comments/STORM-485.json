    @d2r I think following need to be added to storm-dist/binary/src/main/assembly/binary.xml
    <file>
                <source>${project.basedir}/../../logback/worker.xml</source>
                <outputDirectory>/logback</outputDirectory>
            </file>

    @harshach Good catch.  I did a grep looking for cluster.xml to see if there was anywhere else I might need to call out the new file.  I did not find any additional matches.
