    STORM-493: Workers inherit storm.conf.file/storm.options properties of their supervisor

    Without this fix, if we override some configuration parameters on the command line (using storm -c "param=value") when we launch the supervisor, workers don't inherit them.
    There is a similar problem with configuration file name. If we specify it on the command line, workers don't inherit it and search the default "storm.yaml" file in the classpath.

    Can you modify/add a test to validate this?

    I have some difficulties to have a working environment to execute unit tests of Storm: there are some timeout during tests (even before my fix) and I don't know what is bad with ma machine.
    
    I fixed unit tests related to my change.  I tried to add some tests but I am not comfortable with clojure...

    The test issues we have seen with timeouts seem to show up a lot with VMs, or slow servers.  I don't really know for sure what is happening there.  The code looks like it should work I am +1 for merging this in.
    
    @Parth-Brahmbhatt writing a test for this really does sound difficult because you would have to spawn a separate process and validate that the config is passed to the new process. If you still do want a test I'll relent, but otherwise I would like to check this in.

    @revans2 You are right, its hard to add a test. The existing tests were failing for me before but they are passing now. I am ok with checking this in.
