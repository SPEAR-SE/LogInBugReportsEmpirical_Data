[There is some related discussion to this on STORM-946, This may be fixed by STORM-1609, I believe this is also the same problem as STORM-1560, And yes, it probably was fixed in STORM-1609. But I would have prefered to register a handler for the closeFuture od the newly created channel since it elimininates the dead time until the next check, which can be up to 30 seconds.
