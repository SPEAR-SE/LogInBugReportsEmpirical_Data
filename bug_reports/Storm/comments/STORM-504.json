    Change clojure class called by `storm repl`

    Currently using `storm repl` there's a message saying that the `clojure.lang.Repl` class is deprecated.
    
    ```
    WARNING: clojure.lang.Repl is deprecated.
    Instead, use clojure.main like this:
    java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main -i init.clj -r args...
    Clojure 1.5.1
    ```
    
    This change merely take the suggestion of the output, and updates the class to `clojure.main`.
