[Is this issue not resolved by https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/400 ?, [~sweetest_sj] This is fixed in the trunk https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L585
[~ptgoetz] If its not already included we should add this to 0.9.5 and 0.10., [~harsha_ch] The link you mentioned is a commit for STORM-130, which went out with 0.9.4.

This looks like a different issue. The stack trace posted by [~sweetest_sj] points to the following line:

https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v0.9.4/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L489, [~harsha_ch] [~ptgoetz]

There was an accident about two PRs, changeset of https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/401 and https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/418 is not same.
So it's merged to master well, but not properly merged with 0.9.x branch., [~kabhwan] I was able to get the missing piece applied to 0.9.x-branch, but had to do so manually. See the following commit:

https://github.com/apache/storm/commit/46b118a8d4f404d18babf706ec428131b558bd54, I can see that this commit adds missing part to 0.9.x-branch and 0.10.x-branch doesn't have missing part. Great!, [~sweetest_sj] Can you try reproducing this with 0.10-beta release . Thanks.]
