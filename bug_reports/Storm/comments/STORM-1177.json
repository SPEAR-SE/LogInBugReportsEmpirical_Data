    @schonfeld it looks like this was already done on a different pull request.

    If it looks OK to you could you close this pull request? 
    
    @harshach did you do this work as part of a JIRA?  If so could you duple STORM-1177 to that JIRA?

    @revans2 checked into master without a jira since it was a small fix.
