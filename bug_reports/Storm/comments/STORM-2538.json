[[~pshah] Hi Priyank. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to try out a workaround for this issue? Since the issue is caused by Kafka rebalances, I think you can resolve this by switching to this Subscription implementation https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/ManualPartitionNamedSubscription.java. You can specify this class when creating your KafkaSpoutConfig builder (e.g. https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpoutConfig.java#L136).

Switching to the manual Subscription should prevent rebalances from occuring unless you change the number of partitions for the topic(s) you're consuming from., Marked as Won't Fix in favor of STORM-2542]
