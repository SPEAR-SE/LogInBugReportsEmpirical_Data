, [~jerrypeng] Just a gentle reminder that pull requests should remain open for review for at least 24 hrs. after the last code change to allow others to review. Not a big deal for this one since it was somewhat minor and had a lot of committer support.

Also please try to remember to resolve the JIRA and set the fix version., Merged to master.]
