I guess this fix addresses only ported file. 
Do you think we need to apply this to also 1.x-branch? If it's not please edit affects version/s to 2.0.0, and remove epic.

Thanks in advance!, [~kabhwan] You are right. I have removed the epic links and updated the versions accordingly. , Github user unsleepy22 commented on the pull request:
