[Confirm the same issue and workaround on Storm 0.9.4. Our containers are deployed via ansible onto multiple hosts. Using the "hostname" ansible setting and not setting "storm.local.hostname" at all allowed storm to function correctly.

The observed behaviour from my perspective was:

1. Topologies with a single worker would deploy and run fine
2. Topologies with multiple workers would hang trying to establish Netty connections.]
