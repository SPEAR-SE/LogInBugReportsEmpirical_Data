  java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "kill" (in directory "."): error=2, No such file or directory
{code}

looks like  unable to find "kill" command .

Clould you find "kill"  in your docker instance? 
Like:
{code}
  [root@3c46f330f114 /usr/share]# which kill
  /usr/bin/kill
{code}, Hello,
Yes I finally found the problem.
kill was the built-in inside bash. After installing procps package it works like a charm!

Sorry for the noise. You can close the ticket or check in the pre-require that kill exists ;-)
