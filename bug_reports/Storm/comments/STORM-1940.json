[Removing EPIC since issue seems not clearly stated.
When it's clearly stated and easy to fix I'll re-include this as EPIC., [~happylu]
Could you share other worker logs as well if you don't mind? TransactionalState.setData() already check node existence before creating node, so I suspect there's race condition on it.

I have attached the whole log, thanks!, [~happylu] 
Sorry I mean logs for two workers. Your attached file seems to have only one worker log. 
Please also attach daemon logs (nimbus and supervisors) if you really don't mind. Thanks!, [~kabhwan]
Done! And please notice this storm has 8 Topo., [~happylu] 
Thanks for providing your logs! Unfortunately we don't log attempt to write tx meta, so I couldn't see race condition from the logs.
Btw, I'm trying to come up the valid scenarios for this behavior. I'll update once I found one., [~kabhwan]
I debug the code and find "if(_curator.checkExists().forPath(path)!=null) {" is only checking "/meta" exist or not, but not check if "path+ser". So it brings this exception., [~happylu]
Sorry but I don't understand it since ser is not part of the path. 
Is it always reproducible? If then, could you provide the instruction to reproduce?, Not very easy, we can only see it each a month, usually follow with ZK reconnect. I think you can reproduce it by hunge the code after ser node created, then disconnect the network to make ZK timeout. Or can we directly add the check of the "path+ser" before create it?]
