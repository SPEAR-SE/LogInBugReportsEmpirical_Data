[Same applies to rebalancing., GitHub user HeartSaVioR opened a pull request:

    STORM-860 disable "Activate" button when topology status is not "inactivate"

    When we activate topology while it is rebalancing or killed from UI, UI shows that "Error while communicating to nimbus".
    Based on these, "Activate" only makes sense while inactivated.
