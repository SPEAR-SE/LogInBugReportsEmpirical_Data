    STORM-399 update KafkaConfig.maxOffsetBehind default to be Long.MAX_VALUE

    
    I've recently upgraded to storm and storm-kafka `0.9.2-incubating`, replacing the https://github.com/wurstmeister/storm-kafka-0.8-plus spout I was using previously.
      
    I have a large kafka log that I needed processed. I started my topology with 
    ```
    storm.kafka.SpoutConfig spoutConfig = new SpoutConfig....
    spoutConfig.forceFromStart = true;
    ```
    I then needed to make some tweaks in my application code and restarted the topology with spoutConfig.forceFromStart = false. Expecting to pick up where I left off in my kafka log. Instead the kafka spout started from the latest offset. Upon investigation I found this log message in my storm worker logs
    ```
    2014-07-09 18:02:15 s.k.PartitionManager [INFO] Read last commit offset from zookeeper: 15266940; old topology_id: ef3f1f89-f64c-4947-b6eb-0c7fb9adb9ea - new topology_id: 5747dba6-c947-4c4f-af4a-4f50a84817bf

    2014-07-09 18:02:15 s.k.PartitionManager [INFO] Commit offset 22092614 is more than 100000 behind, resetting to startOffsetTime=-2
    2014-07-09 18:02:15 s.k.PartitionManager [INFO] Starting Kafka prd-use1c-pr-08-kafka-kamq-0004:4 from offset 22092614
    ```
    
    Digging in the storm-kafka spout I found this line
     https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/blob/v0.9.2-incubating/external/storm-kafka/src/jvm/storm/kafka/PartitionManager.java#L95
    
    To fix this problem I ended up setting my spout config like so
    ```
    spoutConf.maxOffsetBehind = Long.MAX_VALUE; 
    ```
    Now finally to my question.
    
    Why would the kafka spout skip to the latest offset if the current offset is more then 100000 behind by default?
    
    This seems like a bad default value, the spout literally skipped over months of data without any warning.   
    
    This pull request sets the default value to `Long.MAX_VALUE`

    @d-t-w That seems perfectly reasonable.  Do you want to file a JIRA to implement different configurable strategies?
