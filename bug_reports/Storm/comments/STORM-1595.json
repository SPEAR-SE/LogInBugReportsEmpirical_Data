[can you tell us the following configurations in your topology
 - topology.message.timeout.secs
- topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs
- async flag and batch size for kafka bolt

My hunch is that with kafka bolt fails a tuple in a callback which takes some time. In this time, init entry is timed out from acker bolt. when fail entry comes to the acker bolt, it will also get timed out eventually. Tuple will be marked failed after `topology.message.timeout.secs` even though the bolt fails it earlier. Though this hypothesis may be invalid if you are not overriding the topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs., Hi [~knusbaum]  can you add the topology configuration here?, [~knusbaum] is this still valid? Do you have a way to reliably reproduce this?, [~ptgoetz] I'm not able to reproduce this anymore. Going to close it.
