    STORM-786: KafkaBolt should ack tick tuples

    [STORM-512](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-512) (KafkaBolt doesn't handle ticks properly) adds special-casing of tick tuples. What is missing in the patch is that the input tuple, when it is a tick tuple, should be properly acked like normal tuples.
