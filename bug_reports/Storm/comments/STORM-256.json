[I believe you that there is a bug in rebalance on large topologies, it is just that storm does not currently do a rebalance the way you have described it, and I honestly don't know if it ever did.  Could you please include the exact version of storm you are using when you saw this issue?

When a topology is rebalanced nimbus keeps the existing assignments the same but marks the topology as needing to be rebalanced.  Those assignments are then filtered out of the data structures that are passed to the scheduler so it looks like none of the tasks for the rebalanced topology are currently running.  The scheduler then decides where to place the tasks for the topology without taking into account where the tasks were running previously.

The supervisor for its part is constantly downloading all existing assignments from zookeeper and then takes the current assignments that it knows about and does a diff of the two.  If they differ then it will shoot processes that are no longer scheduled for it to run, and launches new tasks that it is not currently running.]
