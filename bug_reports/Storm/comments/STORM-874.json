    [STORM-874] Add UncaughtExceptionHandler for netty threads

    The netty threads need to handle uncaught exceptions. This would help ensure that JVM exits if netty threads hit OOM Error  while allocating new buffer.

    @kishorvpatil would it makes sense to log the exception as well? , allows users to know the cause of jvm exit.

    @kishorvpatil 
    Utils.handleUncaughtException() only takes care of Error, and any kinds of Exception will be silently ignored without leaving any logs. 
    Is it intentional? Or do we need to take care?

    If the thread is used in `ThreadPoolExecutor` (like the boss & worker thread pool currently used), `UncaughtExceptionHandler` are not invoked because `ThreadPoolExecutor` suppress uncaught exceptions coming from tasks (see e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1838923/why-is-uncaughtexceptionhandler-not-called-by-executorservice). There are workarounds but they are quite hacky.
    
    Maybe it makes more sense to consider the service unhealthy if messages are unable to be dispatched, rather than based on whether an uncaught exception was encountered?

    @eshioji We are catching `Error` not `RunTimeException` which shows more of a JVM  resource issue - hence we do exit from the JVM - its more serious than just considering some service being down.

    @HeartSaVioR  We consider the Netty message handlers should take care of all those exceptions. We leave JVM level Error to be handled at executorservice handler level.

    @harshach Sorry for so long in responding to it. The `Utils.handleUncaughtException` writes ot STDOUT to avoid further major exception by attempting to log exceptions. But otherwise we log them.

    I agree with @HeartSaVioR , we should at least log any (unchecked) Exception instead of swallow it.

    Also, the name Utils/handleUncaughtException here implies we are handling exceptions that could not be otherwise be dealt with, and so this is the end of the road.  It does not seem that we should return from this handler expecting some other code to deal with the situation, but we should bring down the JVM or throw.  If the code is not intended to be used this way, then we should rename and/or document what is expected of the caller to do with `t` after we return.
