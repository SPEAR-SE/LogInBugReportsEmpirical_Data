[Can you try to re-word this (or someone else)? I don't quite understand what you're trying to say.

Without looking at the code though, I have not seen this behavior, nor heard of anyone having issues with this., I create a trident topology. After hundreds of millions of DRPC invoking I got OOM. I inspected the momory dump and found most momory are used by Long values.

You just missed one line "_msgIdToBatchId.put(r, batchIdVal);" emitting tuple in storm.trident.spout.RichSpoutBatchTriggerer.(added at line 161 for 0.9.1-incubating)

Look at the code. It's easy to found the bug. After adding the missing line and re-compiling, my trident topology works well. , Makes since to me.  [~davidlgr] it sounds like you already have a patch for this.  Is it something that you can throw up in a small pull request on github?  That would make it a lot simpler to review and test., OK. I've create a pull request on github., https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/82

This appears to be the pull request., Github user d2r commented on the pull request:
