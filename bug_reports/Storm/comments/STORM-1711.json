    [STORM-1711] Kerberos principals gets mixed up while using storm-hive

    Storm-hive uses UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromKeytab which updates the static variable that stores current UGI. Modified HiveUtils.authenticate to use UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromKeytabAndReturnUGI() which returns the new UGI instead of modifying the current UGI.
