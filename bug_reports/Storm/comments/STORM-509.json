[[~revans2] "We really should have a separate set of configs for the explicit groups that we want to grant permissions to" so should w e drive this by config. If two users belong configured set of groups than grant permissions otherwise don't.  Either we should use config which feels restrictive in terms of granting permissions to others on a running topology not sure how often this would be the case or provide a way for the user who is owner of the topology to add group permissions which will be written into topology config., I was thinking it would be like how we deal with the users.  When launching the topology the topology would set topology.groups to the list of groups that would have access to the topology.  If it is not set only the users in topology.users would be allowed, if it is set then anyone who is a part of any of those groups would be allowed or anyone who is in the topology.users groups., Sorry this took so long, I pulled this into the security branch.]
