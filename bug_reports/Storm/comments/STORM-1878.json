    STORM-1878: Flux can now handle IStatefulBolts

    @sakanaou Thanks for the patch. 
    
    Can you also add an example flux topology with an IStatefulBolt similar to to existing ones under https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/external/flux/flux-examples ?

    @arunmahadevan I have added an example as requested. It is basically an extension of the word count example with state support.
