[Harsha pointed out I'm calling Nimbus thrift API inside of Nimbus. 
I guess common logic can be extracted as function and both of reified INimbus and send_cluster_metrics_to_executors can call that., GitHub user HeartSaVioR opened a pull request:

    STORM-1925 Remove Nimbus thrift call from Nimbus itself

    * Nimbus fails to start in secure mode since authrization is not passed
    
    Extract the logic of getClusterInfo to new function 'get-cluster-info' and let both of callers call this function instead.
