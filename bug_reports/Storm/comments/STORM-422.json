    -0 I would rather delete this script in favor of maintaining one python launcher script. [STORM-487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-487)

    I tested on windows box and it worked just fine. I would prefer if we could deprecate this in favor of STORM-487 however I have heard python script does not always work in all Windows environment. Until STORM-487 is finished I think this is still a good change +1.

    Thanks @Parth-Brahmbhatt, you beat me to it.
    
    I'll comment on [STORM-487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-487) separately, but in my experience, it is non-trivial to port the current python script to windows, even with cygwin.
    
    For now I'm +1 for the patch.
