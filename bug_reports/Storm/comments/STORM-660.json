[I'm not sure I would call this a bug. Synchronizing access to non-threadsafe objects is standard practice in multithreaded code., The question is should we make the OutputCollector thread safe?  Is the overhead of grabbing a lock with no contention enough of a hit that we don't want to do it in the common case, instead rely on on end users to continually make this mistake and fix it themselves.  I personally think the overhead is so small it should not be that big of a problem.]
