    STORM-811: remove old metastor_db before running tests again.

, Really strange, I can't reproduce issue, too. I'm on OSX 10.10.3 and JDK is Oracle 1.7.0_55., Ahhh, and now today it is not happening at all.  I have no idea what happened.  Someone is playing a joke on me or something.  I want to leave the pull request up though just in case it comes back., Github user harshach commented on the pull request:
