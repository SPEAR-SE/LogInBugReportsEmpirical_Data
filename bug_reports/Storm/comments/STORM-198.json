[are you sure you did an install on the root level package, not storm-core? I had no problems checking out a fresh copy and building everything yesterday., I built from the root level. I just tried a new copy, but got the same compilation error. I observed following things:

  - There are no classes in libthrift7-0.9.1-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar which can be found in storm-deps/libthrift/target.
  - libthrift7-0.9.1-incubating-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar contains classes with packages renamed.
  
Then I tried modifying lib thrift pom to change 

<shadedArtifactAttached>true</shadedArtifactAttached>

to 

<shadedArtifactAttached>false</shadedArtifactAttached>

Then build works without tests.

, There are some issues with the way we handle the repackaging of the thrift dependency.

I have fix and will be submitting a patch shortly.

In the meantime running {{mvn install}} from the top level directory should work., This has been fixed in the master branch., Wondering if there's a typo in storm-core pom?  org.apache.storm instead of
                    <artifactSet>
                        <includes>
                            <include>org.apache.thrift:*</include>
                            <include>odg.apache.storm:*</include>
                        </includes>
                    </artifactSet>
