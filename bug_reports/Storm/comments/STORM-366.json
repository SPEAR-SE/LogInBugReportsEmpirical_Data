    The changes look fine to me.  I would like to see the new restful API docs updated to reflect the additional data, but other then that I am a +1.

    @revans2 I have updated the restful API docs to reflect use of elapsed time and component errors.  Please review.

    @revans2  Since security branch did not have restful API docs, I cherry-picked it and updated the restful API docs to reflect use of elapsed time and component errors.
