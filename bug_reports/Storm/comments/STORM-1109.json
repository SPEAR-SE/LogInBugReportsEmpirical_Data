[[~kraks],

I think this is the worker and not the supervisor that is crashing., Its both actually, I have provided the error that I see in  supervisor.log in the issue description just below the worker log stack trace.

we run storm-supervisor with supervisord, with 999 retries but it wont comeback.
However, if we clear the supervisor state by clearing the folders/files under storm/supervisor and start the supervisor it comes back
