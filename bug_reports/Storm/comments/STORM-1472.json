    [STORM-1472] Fix the errorTime bug and show the time to be readable

    1. Checking the code, find a bug in storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/ui/core.clj
    "time" changed to "errorTime", however the REST info is still "time".
    Error log link can not show any info for time.
    
    2.In the error log link of UI, long of millisecond dates makes little sense to user. It would be nice to change it to be readable date.
