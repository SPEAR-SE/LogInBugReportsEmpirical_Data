    The change looks good to me I am +1, but it would be nice to see a test case that reproduces the error.

    Thank you for your advice @revans2 . I have added a new class named ExclamationTopologyWithMetrics to reproduce the error. The newly added class is based on the existed ExclamationTopology class. For testing, I set the parallelism of the bolt named "exclaim1" to 3, and its task number to 6, and the parallelism and task number of the second bolt named "exclaim2" to 2 and 6, respectively. After running the topology, I got the following results:

    As shown in the Figure, the task "4:exclaim1" has repeated twice of the metric reporting, and the task "11:exclaim2" has repeated three times, as we expected.

    I was thinking more along the lines of a unit test, but a manual test is OK too.  I would prefer to not merge it into the final release though.

    @troyding I tend to agree with @revans2. Can you add a clojure unit test for this?

    hi @revans2 and @ptgoetz, I have added a unit test function "test-custom-metric-with-multi-tasks" into the `metrics_test.clj` file. This test case will help to reproduce the error.

    +1 the test passes with the change, and fails without it.
