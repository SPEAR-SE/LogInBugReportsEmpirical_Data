    AFAIK, STORM-487 was intended to lay the foundation of unifying storm launch script.
    Do we have plan to change storm.cmd to use storm.py?

    @HeartSaVioR yes but wanted to keep the .cmd files for at least a release or two as there might be users who are depend on these. Since storm.py is now windows compatabile we can phase out the current storm.cmd

    Great! Looks good to me.
    Btw, it's better to point out storm.py's actual changed lines since it's hard to find difference.

    @HeartSaVioR bin/storm which used to be a python script now moved to bin/storm.py and in place of bin/storm we added storm shell script to give users a way to configure storm env variables. Because of this renaming files you see the diff like that.

    @harshach I know, I just want to point out that bin/storm is not only renamed but also modified a bit.

    +1. The diffs of `storm` vs. `storm.py` are minimal and related to windows compatibility.
    
    For easy reference, here they are:
    
    ```
    $ diff -w storm storm.py
    37a38,40
    > def is_windows():
    >     return sys.platform.startswith('win')
