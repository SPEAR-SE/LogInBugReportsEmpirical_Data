[[~daijy] should this be sufficient?

[~vikram.dixit] does this config propagate to AM in MiniTez? This is a client-side setting (as in, AM-side, for metastore cache)., Yes. It will propagate to the AM when we create the tez session. TestMiniTezCliDriver picks up the config from this site.xm and then the config is shipped from the client to the AM at the session creation time., Looks like it does apply. i wish I didn't forget to submit patch!,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12765491 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Looks like AM connects to zookeeper but always gets connection refused. No idea what this is about, will look tomorrow., ZK port needs to be propagated to Tez AM it looks like, The patch fixes config propagation for HBase tests (right now the config is reset immediately after HBase minicluster config is set), and also removes RawStore override for direct SQL when HBase metastore is used. I wonder if that override affected the tests... looks like it should have, maybe that's why HIVE-12167 doesn't break tests. Although config lineage is pretty confusing, the incorrect config set for HBase metastore in HIVE-12167 might have come from the override that this patch is removing.
[~alangates] [~thejas] [~daijy] can you take a look? small patch

, {code}
if (useHBaseMetastore) {
  startMiniHBaseCluster();
} else {
  conf = new HiveConf(Driver.class);
}
{code}

Isn't this going to result in an NPE for HBaseMetastore test cases since conf won't be set?, startMiniHBase.. actually sets it to a correct config including the HBase settings like the port, Ok, then +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12766695 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The LLAP tests were removed from LLAP run. I cannot repro other tests. TestLlapTaskSchedulerService was known to be flaky in the past, if I see it fail again I'll file another bug., Committed to master.]
