[Pool sessions remove themselves from openSessions; that is not a good idea while we are iterating the session list., [~vikram.dixit] [~sseth] can you take a look?, We were iterating, removing and then attempting to remove again.
+1 for the patch. It fixes the problem.

I'm not sure why we need a separate method to close default and non-default sessions though. A single shutdown hook, or invocation of stop() should be sufficient ?,
