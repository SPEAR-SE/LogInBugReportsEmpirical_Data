[Thank you [~spena]! I believe you had a file which reproduces this? Could we add a test for this?, Thanks [~brocknoland], +1, I forgot to add the alltypesparquet file, Patch re-submitted as Jenkins did not kick off the test job before., Hey [~spena],I don't think svn accepts binary files in patches. The way I handle this is:

1) Upload binary file to jira
2) Upload patch without binary file
3) Test which uses binary file will fail, committer will manually apply and test, Thanks [~brocknoland]

I attached the patch without the binary file. The file is attached as well.,
