[This patch changes ValidTxnListImpl to compress the string it produces if the string is > 256 bytes.  This is not a panacea, but it should reduce the frequency of the issue.

[~hagleitn] and [~mmokhtar], you may want to review this since you brought the problem to my attention.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12672850, This made it worse, the string encoding you're doing doesn't work with the process builder:

{noformat}, I'm not sure what values ProcEnv supports, but maybe base64 would be better?, Do you have a simple query with a transform in it that shows the issue with the process builder?, I use this script:

{noformat}
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
import random

for line in sys.stdin:
    print random.random()
{noformat}

and this query:

{noformat}
add FILE /home/gunther/rand.py;
select transform (<any column>) using 'rand.py' as (foo float) from <any table>;
{noformat}

Does that help?

, I am not sure what the distribution of the numbers are in this list but I assume encoding would help more than compression?, A new version of the patch.  The transaction list is compressed, as before.  However, with this patch I added a blacklist to the ScriptOperator to strain out specified conf variables and not make them environment variables.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12674786, [~alangates] could you comment on the test failures. At least testScriptOperatorEvnVarsProcessing seems related. Also, do you have a reviewboard entry for this?

Patch looks good though. I think the blacklist is a good approach. Will test tomorrow., The TestOperators failure is caused by this patch.  The rest I believe are unrelated.  I'll put up a new version of the patch that addresses the TestOperators failure.,

 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, LGTM +1, +1 for 0.14, Committed to hive .14 and trunk. Thanks [~alangates]!, [~leftylev] what needs documented here?, Doc note:  This adds *hive.script.operator.env.blacklist* to HiveConf.java, so it needs to be documented in the wiki.  Does it belong with the transactions parameters or in the general query execution list, or somewhere else?  Should it also be documented in Hive Transactions, with examples and guidance?

* [Hive Transactions -- Configuration | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions#HiveTransactions-Configuration]
* [Configuration Properties | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties]

Also, how about a release note?, Another doc note:  Explaining "hive.txn.valid.txns" in the default value of *hive.script.operator.env.blacklist* would be helpful -- it looks like a configuration parameter but isn't., It doesn't need to be documented in Hive Transactions.  There's nothing transaction specific about it.  I don't expect users to set this themselves.

I've updated the Configuration Properties with information on this value.  I'm glad you caught this, as I didn't realize we recorded all conf keys there.

I'll also add the same information to the release notes for this bug.

, Our messages are crossing paths.  Excellent release note, thanks!, Removed todo doc label as changes have been made to the docs for this., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
