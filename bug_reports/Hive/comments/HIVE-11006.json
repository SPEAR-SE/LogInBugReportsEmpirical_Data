I'm a little nervous about moving the debug statements in lock up to info, though I see why you're doing it because I've wished they were info before when debugging something.  Let's try it for now and see how it goes.  Hopefully it won't flood the logs with extraneous infos., The ones I moved to INFO are executed once per SQL statement - so I think it will increase logs only marginally., Committed to branch-1.2, branch-1, master.  Thanks [~alangates] for the review]
