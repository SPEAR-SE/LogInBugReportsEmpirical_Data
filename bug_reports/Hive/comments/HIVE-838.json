[i guess it would be good to include this fix in 0.4.

couple of comments:

1. can you change the query with the empty partition to be a non-aggregate query? need to make sure additional rows are not added to the result. something like:
{code}
select * from 
  (select count(1) from src 
    union all
   select 1 from srcpart where ds = '2009-08-09'
  )x;
{code}

2. remove the code instead of commenting it out., incorporated Raghu's comments, committed. thanks namit., havent committed to 0.4 yet., committed to 0.4.]
