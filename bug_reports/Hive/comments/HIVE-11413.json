ATTACHMENT ID: 12748049 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, Hi [~raajay],
Can {{saHooks}} variable be null? If so, then it would be good to validate that too. Or {{saHooks.isEmpty}} will fail with a Null Pointer Exception., Hi Sergio - 
From looking at the current code,  {{saHooks}} cannot be NULL. However, I agree that is better to add the NULL check to errorproof against future changes., Update a new patch with both non-null and non-empty checks,
