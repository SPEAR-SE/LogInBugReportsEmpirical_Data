ATTACHMENT ID: 12660527, Couldn't we introduce temporary view?, That could be supported, though I think temp view would be a less interesting case than temp table. This patch would still be independent of that - would still want to prevent people from defining normal views on top of temp tables., +1
I minor nit, its more of a style thing. Probably not worth updating the patch for it. in error messages i usually prefer stating what is not allowed. Eg 'Invalid view definition: View definition references temporary table tmp1.'  This is on lines of "Permission denied: File permissions are â€¦". But I think the error message is clear as it is., Committed to trunk. Had to re-generate create_view_failure10.q.out., Document this in two places in the DDL wiki:  Temporary Tables (list of limitations) & Create View.

* [DDL -- Create View | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-CreateView], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
