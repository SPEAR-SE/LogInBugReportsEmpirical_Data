[[~ashutoshc] fyi, Do you have sequence of steps which resulted in this?, I added a bug to StatsTask (some exception in the method that sets the stats up starting with the above line).
When running a q file with this issue StatsTask threw, insert results were still propagated to the table and stats accurate was stil ltrue from the previous query iirc.]
