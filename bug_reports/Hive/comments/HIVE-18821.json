[This is the way that 'beeline' works.  Beeline is a pretty simple client that simply forwards your statements to a HiveServer2 instance.  Therefore, if providing a JAR file path that is local, the file must be locally accessible to the HiveServer2 receiving the request, not the client submitting it.  The 'hive' shell is a thick client and it processes the statements itself, internally, therefore when it receives an {{ADD JAR}} command, it will be able to successfully access the file.

You are better off putting your JAR files into {{hive.aux.jars.path}}
