ATTACHMENT ID: 12689297 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The patch looks OK, but it has not yet been applied to the DOAP.
Please fix the DOAP., Hi [~sebb@apache.org], how can I apply it to the DOAP? Sorry for my newbie question., Ask on the dev list for the Hive project; someone must know how to update the DOAP file in the project SVN tree., I see, actual the trunk will be automatically synchronized with the SVN repository after this patch resolved. I do not have the commit privilege and need one committer post +1 comment and resolve it.
Hi [~brocknoland], can you take a look of my patch when you have some time? Thank you! , The DOAP is not really a part of the source.
Perhaps consider storing it at

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hive/cms/trunk/content/

instead.

It should then be editable using CMS and won't affect Hive QA builds.

The files.xml which is used to create projects.a.o will have to be udpated if the file is moved.
Ideally copy it, ensure files.xml is updated, then remove the old file., Makes sense. [~Ferd] do you want to create a patch which deletes it from src and adds it to the website?, Thank [~brocknoland] for your suggestion. I attach the file here and remove the rdf file from the src. Can you please upload the DOAP to the http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hive/cms/trunk/content/ when you have some time? 
Thank you!, +1, Done! It's out there:

http://hive.apache.org/doap_Hive.rdf

Thank you for your contributions!]
