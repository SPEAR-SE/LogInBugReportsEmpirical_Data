[Moved to Hive as this is a Hive issue and not a Tez one. , Maybe This problem seems to be same as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13273, Does this issue already resolved?
([~wyukawa] mentioned at HIVE-13273 that the OOM Error does not occur after upgrading to HDP2.4.)

If not, I'll address this issue.
I'm trying to fix bugs around hiveserver2.

Thanks., After upgrading to HDP2.4, this problem doesn't occur.

So, I close this issue.

Thanks.]
