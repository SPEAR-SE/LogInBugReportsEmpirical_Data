[Did we not already handle the case with the non deterministic function support that we had added to predicate pushdown?
, we didn't push rand() but we pushed all other predicates in the clause. so rand() is getting applied after rows are filtered. the current behavior seems to be rand() gets applied before rows are filtered. not sure if there is a ANSI semantics, but this fix keeps the current behavior of Hive even when PPD is applied., +1

looks good - will merge if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Prasad, Can you add some constants ? like 1/2 for boolean false/true = may help in some debugging later on.

Also, it might be useful to add a dump() method which takes the inputbytebuffer and dumps the structure ?
This can be done in a follow-up later also, may be useful for other serdes also.]
