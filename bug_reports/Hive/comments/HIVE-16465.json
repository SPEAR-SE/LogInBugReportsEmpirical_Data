ATTACHMENT ID: 12865302 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Push to the master. Thanks [~colin_mjj] for the contribution., Hi [~pxiong], can we include this patch to release 2.3? This issue will lead to Parquet Vectorization unable to use due to a NPE. It was involved by HIVE-12767. Thanks., Sure. I saw you already run ptest on 2.3. Thus, it is safe to cherry-pick. Make sure you change the fixed version as well after you cherry-pick. Thanks!, Committed to the branch 2.3. Thanks [~pxiong]., Should this also be committed to branch-2 (for release 2.4.0+)?, Thanks [~leftylev] for remind. Committed to branch-2 as well., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
