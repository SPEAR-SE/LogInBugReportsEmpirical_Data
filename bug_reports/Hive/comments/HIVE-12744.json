[[~busyjay], i put a patch here. A simple solution is to set hive.multigroupby.singlereducer=false. The problem is like this. So in your case, you would like to use multi-insert and each of the insert contains a group by. The group by contains grouping sets. By default, Hive turns on "HIVEMULTIGROUPBYSINGLEREDUCER" flag. When this flag is on, Hive tries to optimize multi group by query to generate single M/R  job plan. In the single M/R plan, there is no map-side aggr. However, "Grouping sets aggregations (with rollups or cubes) are not allowed if map-side aggregation is turned off. Set hive.map.aggr=true if you want to use grouping sets". Thus, you have to choose between grouping sets and multi group by optimization. Thus, i would recommend turn the optimization off, i.e.,  set hive.multigroupby.singlereducer=false. Thanks., [~ashutoshc], could you please take a look? Thanks!, +1 pending test,
