[As a related point, it would also be good if we could set up another Hudson config running tests against 0.20S.  We used to have instances for 0.17 etc when we were still supporting them.
, Patch that addresses the issue. , There was an indentation issue in the previous patch. This patch fixes that., Tested/verified this patch works by running 'ant test -Dhadoop.version=0.20.0' which is the same command hudson runs. , https://reviews.apache.org/r/371/ is the reviewboard page., +1.  Will commit.
, Committed.  Thanks Devaraj!
