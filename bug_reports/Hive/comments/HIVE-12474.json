[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5607

It seems changed by design.
Release note from HIVE-5607

From 0.10.0 to 0.13.0, the following syntax for order by is allowed (though the doc doesn't specify):

select * from table order by (expr1, exp2);

From 0.14, the above syntax is illegal. Instead, the following should be used:

select * from table order by expr1, exp2; 

No?, As  Prasad Mujumdar pointed out, it should be documented, if this change was intentional. 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+SortBy, [~xuefuz], would you mind if I re-assign this to you? It seems that it is designed intentionally by your patch in HIVE-5607. I assume that the only thing that you need to do is to update the document for this. Thanks. :), Sure. I'll take it., Should 'cluster by'/'sort by'/'distribute by'/'partition by' allow for the use of parenthesis if 'order by' does not?, To be consistent, I think none of them should be allowed for parens. Otherwise, they will suffer HIVE-5607 as well. However, we need to check the grammar to make sure.]
