ATTACHMENT ID: 12854453 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1, This can be made more robust by making sure type of dimensions is in PrimitiveGrouping.STRING_GROUP and type of metrics is in PrimitiveGrouping.NUMERIC_GROUP and throw exception if this is not the case. Outside of these groupings we cant handle other types any way.
 Current assumption of default assuming dimensions make code less predictable and results in hard to debug issues., [~jcamachorodriguez] can we add a unit-test for this case ?, [~ashutoshc], that is a good idea, I will add that check and throw that Exception.

[~bslim], AFAIK, this will only be reproducible at runtime, thus we would need integration tests. Or I could refactor the code and extract the switch on _type_ to a new method, then add a negative test for that method; however, that seems an overkill since we would be only testing a switch statement. If you have any other idea for testing it, let me know and I can add it.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12854934 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~jcamachorodriguez] seems like the contract of {code} getHiveRecordWriter{code} is to parse the {code} tableProperties{code} object and build stuff like aggregators.
Thought would be to mock {code} tableProperties{code}  and make sure that we get the right aggregators/dimension specs or that we get an exception for the case of timestamp. If you think it is an overkill that's ok we can skip it.
Overall i am +1 , +1, This appears to have stalled. Commit?, [~sershe], we need to move to Calcite 1.12, then we will verify that it is fixed and close it accordingly. There are a bunch of Druid issues that are in the same situation., [~jcamachorodriguez] This one doesnt need calcite 1.12, does it?, [~ashutoshc], you are right, I got confused with other issue. I had not pushed it because I was doing some testing in my environment. I will push it shortly., Pushed to master, thanks for reviewing [~ashutoshc]!]
