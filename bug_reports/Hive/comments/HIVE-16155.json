[~xuefuz] would you mind take a look at the patch? It's trivial and does the following changes:
1. Check the small table size first. So if the small table doesn't fit, we don't need to clone query plan or creating map join, which can be time consuming.
2. Don't create conditional task if no map join is created. Before the patch, if no map join is created, we still get a conditional task containing only the original common join, which is unnecessary and makes the query plan confusing., +1, Committed to master. Thanks Xuefu for the review!]
