ATTACHMENT ID: 12670727, Failure is unrelated to patch., +1, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks, Mohit., Does this need documentation?  The Parquet wikidoc has examples with strings in map, array, and struct for Hive 0.10 - 0.12 as well as Hive 0.13+.

* [Parquet -- HiveQL Syntax -- Hive 0.10 - 0.12 | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Parquet#Parquet-Hive0.10-0.12]
* [Parquet -- HiveQL Syntax -- Hive 0.13 and later | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Parquet#Parquet-Hive0.13andlater]
* [Parquet -- Limitations | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Parquet#Parquet-Limitations], This jira fixes a bug in Char and Varchar support in Parquet SerDe. 

Limitations section already mentions that these data types are supported starting 0.14.0, so no additional documentation is needed.

Thanks, [~leftylev].

, Good to know, thanks., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
