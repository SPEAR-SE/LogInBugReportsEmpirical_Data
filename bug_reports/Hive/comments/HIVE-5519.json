[I think it would be useful to add some JavaDoc on the params added in Server.java (at least the new ones), I think it would be useful to add some JavaDoc on the params added in Server.java (at least the new ones), [~ekoifman] Agree with what you say. Also TestDriverCurl.pm needs some modification to replace the deprecated APIs with the new ones. I will make these changes as part of HIVE-5617, https://reviews.apache.org/r/14916/, Addressed the comments made by [~eugene.koifman], Great job on the doc.  It could be useful to add 1 line how these param can be used to support pagination since it may not be obvious

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the review, [~thejas] Updating the change as per [~thejas] '  comment. The bug with the previous upload was that even though the counter was incremented correctly based on the filter condition, the records which do not satisfy the filter condition do not get skipped. The fix is to continue and skip the current record, if the filter condition is not satisfied in  Server.showJobList()., Looks like the patch needs change to handle filtering out of the jobs before starttime. ,  I think it would be more useful to use the jobid instead of the start time in the API. One problem with the time is that it is start time of jobtracker server, which won't change until restart. Also, webhcat will be isolated from changes to the jobid string format if we use the entire string. , Addressing [~thejas] ' comments.,
