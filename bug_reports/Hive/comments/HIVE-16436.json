ATTACHMENT ID: 12863230 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, minor change added to .2. Using endTimeHasMethod to be consistent with startTimeHasMethod., To make sure if .2 works, [~rajesh.balamohan] did you see the end time to be negative as well? Made a minor change in .2 to make it consistent. If that does not work, I will commit .1,
