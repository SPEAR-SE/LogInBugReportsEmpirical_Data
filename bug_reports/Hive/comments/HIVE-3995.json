[I'm attaching patch that is fixing the upgrade scripts. I've tried to assign the jira to myself but it seems that I'm not in the "contributor" group in the jira. Might I ask someone to add me?, Jarcec, thanks for this! The PostgreSQL scripts were not supported until recently, so it's possible the syntax in existing scripts is incorrect.

I left some comments on the review., Attaching updated patch including Mark's notes from review board., +1 (non-committer)

Thanks Jarcec! I left a comment (no action required from your side) on Reviewboard that "false" seems to be the right value to put for existing rows. Perhaps, [~gangtimliu] or [~namitjain], who were involved with HIVE-3649 can confirm.

I like the new approach of adding the new column as Nullable, updating the existing null values and then setting the column to not-null. The only other approach I can think of is to use a default value (of false) but that seems more risky in the long run., Committed. Thanks Jarek and Mark, Integrated in hive-trunk-hadoop1 #75 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/hive-trunk-hadoop1/75/])
