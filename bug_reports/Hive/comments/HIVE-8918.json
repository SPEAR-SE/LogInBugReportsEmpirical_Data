[FYI [~Ferd]. You worked on moving jline2, so you might have some ideas about what is happening., Have you done the steps mentioned in HIVE-8609 which will be DOC before starting the beeline?

"One thing needs to be DOC that users should backup and remove the jline-0.9.94.jar file under the path $HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/yarn/lib/jline-0.9.94.jar which is conflict with beeline's dependency before using beeline. Once YARN-2815 resolved, the jline-0.9.94.jar will be removed.", Thanks [~Ferd].

That was the problem. I deleted the jline-0.9.94.jar found on the hadoop lib directory and it worked., Future internet visitors, see this fix: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8609?focusedCommentId=14242978&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14242978]
