[Thanks for reporting this Matthew. This looks like a bug. Do you think a query like 
{code}
CREATE TABLE foo ROW FORMAT SERDE '....JsonSerDe' SELECT host as host from table1;
{code}
could serve as a work around for this?, We thought of that too, unfortunately it makes no difference, and the same issue persists., It does not reproduced in trunk. Could you consider upgrading (v0.10.0, which is not yet released)?]
