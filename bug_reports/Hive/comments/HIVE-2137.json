[This patch can set character encoding in the connection string.

For example,
jdbc:hive://10.68.160.236:10000/default
->
jdbc:hive://10.68.160.236:10000/default?characterEncoding=UTF-8

If you set "characterEncoding", string is decoded by character code which was set.
If not set, it's the same as before.
, @Jin,
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute has guidelines on how to contribute. Essentially you need to generate a one svn friendly patch instead each for different files., Sorry for my patches were not conformed to guidance.
I re-maked a patch.
This new patch supports fixed charset "UTF-8".
, I have ran into the same trouble. Thank you for your patches.
But, I think I had found some way easier to solve the problem by setting your encoding of .class files when compiling the source files. 
here is the command:
javac -encoding UTF-8 XX.java
or you can set it in eclipse., Can some committer comment on this issue please? Will this issue be resolved and/or will a patch be applied? Which version could contain a fix for this?,

This message is automatically generated., I wonder if my change really affects TestE2EScenarios.testReadOrcAndRCFromPig.
I've just only added test code and test data for HiveQueryResultSet after the build successfully finished., I forgot to drop the table I added in tearDown.
Thank you for your advice, tamtam180!,
