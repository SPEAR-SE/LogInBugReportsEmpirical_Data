[Root-cause
==========
ant-contrib is not configured in ql/build.xml

Solution
========
Add it to it. Reference is here http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/
, The directions on the wiki are outdated. We not longer support running ant from any of the subproject directories -- you have to run it from the root directory instead. Let me know if you have time to update the wiki and I can add you to the ACL. Thanks!, Yes, please 

so that I can update it today.
