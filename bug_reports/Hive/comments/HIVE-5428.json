[cc: [~sershe], Hmm, I was able to catch direct SQL errors with tests recently... for example in HIVE-4888
Let me take a look, it looks like the first query (which is in this case the only query) is affected, sershe requested code review of "HIVE-5428 [jira] Direct SQL check fails during tests".

, cc [~sershe], cc [~sershe], cc [~sershe], 3 copies of the comment for reliability ;)
I was in the source tab, and didn't see the comments and was wondering why the comment is not appearing each time I type.
, Also it was after I attached that patch :), there's something extremely strange with this check. The self-disable doesn't work, but if I add logging statement to the method to see the value it starts working. Let me investingate, sershe updated the revision "HIVE-5428 [jira] Direct SQL check fails during tests".

, +1, I ran the tests on my centos machine... all passed except a few tests in thrift and load_hdfs_file_with_space_in_the_name on Minimr, which are probably unrelated and passed on reruns, Committed to trunk.
