[added missing file to assembly descriptor, NO PRECOMMIT TESTS, Sorry, can you explain what this does?, this file was added in HIVE-5511.  It used to be included in the tar during 'ant' build but was missed in Mavenization.  Basically this enables 'percentComplete' reporting in WebHCat job status (with Hadoop 2), +1, [~rhbutani] It would be great to have this bug fix in hive 0.13.
, +1 for 0.13, Patch committed to 0.13 branch and trunk.
Thanks for the contributions Eugene!
