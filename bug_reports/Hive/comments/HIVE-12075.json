[WIP patch for backup with all the plumbing. The code is there, but probably doesn't work, and the API doesn't actually do anything - work is put in there queue and never done.
, Patch with the actual implementation and plumbing for added columns that would be needed for HBase pushdown., On top of HIVE-12061, Patches on top of HIVE-11675, so I could start testing them all together. Actually applies to master with one small conflict., Needs q tests too, Fixing some issues, adding a test., Left some comments on RB., 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:

ATTACHMENT ID: 12774459 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, -1.  I think putting the ORC specific methods in PartitionExpressionProxy is letting the file format implementation bleed through the interface.  These should be generic methods with ORC specific implementations., Moved the methods into file-format-specific proxy., +1, looks good., Committed to master. I may port it to 2.0 later if I have time to test it a little bit more before 2.0 is cut., The org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.plugin.TestHiveOperationType.checkHiveOperationTypeMatch test failure is caused by this patch. It was not an 'unrelated' failure.
, Doc note:  "ANALYZE TABLE (table-spec) CACHE METADATA" will need to be documented in the Statistics wikidoc for release 2.1.0, and *hive.metastore.hbase.file.metadata.threads* belongs in the MetaStore section of Configuration Properties.

* [Configuration Properties -- MetaStore | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-MetaStore], [~asears] documented *hive.metastore.hbase.file.metadata.threads* in the wiki:

Thanks, Andrew!

The HiveQL syntax still needs to be documented for 2.1.0, so I won't remove the TODOC2.1 label yet.]
