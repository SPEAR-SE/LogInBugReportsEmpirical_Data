[[~thejas] I think this is what you were mentioning about ZK network partitioning issues., [~harisekhon] I want to clarify. Was this HS2 having trouble starting up because of of ZK availability issue, or was it an instance running and working fine, which went down after these zk errors ?
, [~thejas] it was working fine for a long time, then it went down when it could no longer contact ZooKeeper., Guys,

I am also facing the same issue. Is there any work around till issue gets fixed?
, Along with this I am seeing an issue that every time I try to start HS2 it creates a memory leak and after few hours RAM is exhausted. I am not sure others noticed this.]
