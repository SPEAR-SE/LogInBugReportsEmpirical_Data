ATTACHMENT ID: 12678110 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I'm not sure I see what issue is here.  hive-txn-schema-0.14.0.mssql.sql is identical to hive-txn-schema-0.13.0.mssql.sql.  If the previous one is ok, why isn't the new one?, My only worry is that this is a ms sql script and I'd like to make sure that these line endings aren't required for it. [~xiaobingo] are you able to give this a spin?, Patch doesn't apply. If we decide to go with this, I'll dos2unix before commit instead of applying patch. I'm assuming that unit tests are irrelevant anyways, we're not testing these scripts afaik., When you generate a patch with {{svn merge}} there are zero new lines in that file which results in the patch comes out corrupt. This is only really an issue when merging between branches and I've resolved it for the spark branch for now.

Perhaps we can just add a single new line to the end of the file. I'll try that., Attached patch adds a single newline to the end of the file, [~hagleitn] Sorry for latency, just saw this thread. Are there anythings I can help?, Actually I just executed queries in hive-txn-schema-0.14.0.mssql.sql on Windows by text copy-paste as well as sqlcmd CLI. Both work well., Seems a safe change then. Thanks [~xiaobingo]. +1 for .14 and trunk.,
