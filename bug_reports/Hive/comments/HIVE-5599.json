I went through some query logs and I see that logging at INFO level isn't making the logs too big.

, This needs to be documented in the wiki, with a version note, when Hive 0.13 is released.  Or it could be documented now as an upcoming change with a link to this JIRA.

In Getting Started, the third sentence of the [Error Logs|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs] section says:  "The default logging level is WARN and the logs are stored in...."

If you want this documented now, I can take care of it.  If later, do we have a doc-in-next-release label?  I've seen one somewhere, but don't know if it's being checked at release time., Thanks for pointing that our Lefty!
Lets document it now and note that this will be part of next hive release (0.13). Yes, if you can take care if it, that would be great!
, Now documented in Getting Started:  [Error Logs|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs].

The default logging level is WARN for Hive releases prior to 0.13.0. Starting with Hive 0.13.0, the default logging level is INFO.
