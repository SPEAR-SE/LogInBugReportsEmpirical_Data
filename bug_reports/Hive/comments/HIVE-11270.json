[Moved jira to Hive. \cc [~hagleitn] , this happens only when tez is used as the processing engine, on MR it just runs fine.. , what is the workaround for this issue ? , @kannanpoem1984: This used to happen intermittently on tez engine. To unblock, we are using MR as an execution engine. Are you hitting this issue ? ]
