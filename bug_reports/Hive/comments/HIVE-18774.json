[This is not as simple:
Union All 
may create
warehouse/t/HIVE_UNION_SUBDIR_1/000000_0
warehouse/t/HIVE_UNION_SUBDIR_2/000000_0
or
warehouse/t/1/000000_0
warehouse/t/2/000000_0
and I suppose
warehouse/t/1/000000_0_copy_1
warehouse/t/2/000000_0_copy_1

More generally, if something other than Hive is writing, it may not be safe to assume 1 level subfolder depth., suppose you have 2 Load Data statements in 1 txn
1st one creates delta_7_7_0/ with 0000_0 and 0000_0_copy_1
2nd one creates delta_7_7_1/ with 0000_0 and 0000_0_copy_1

so you can't simply take N from copy_N and use it as stmt id]
