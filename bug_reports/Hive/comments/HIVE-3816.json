[Hmmm... this is a lot of boolean logic. Lets simplify your solution by using De Morgan's law. 
if(!runningViaChild) ->
!(!ShimLoader.getHadoopShims().isLocalMode(conf) || conf.getBoolVar(HiveConf.ConfVars.SUBMITVIACHILD)
ShimLoader.getHadoopShims().isLocalMode(conf) && !conf.getBoolVar(HiveConf.ConfVars.SUBMITVIACHILD)

Your solution would always run jobs via a child VM in distributed mode. Is this intentional? I would think running a distributed job via a JobClient in ExecDriver would be ideal instead. If you want to simply debug a child jvm then set HIVE_DEBUG_RECURSIVE according to HIVE-2500. 

I would like to run a Job in the same JVM due to unit/integration test concerns (I'm using an in-memory mock Accumulo). Could anyone shed some light regarding why runningViaChild takes local mode into account and isn't simply to SUBMITVIACHILD  i.e.
runningViaChild = conf.getBoolVar(HiveConf.ConfVars.SUBMITVIACHILD);  (git history took me back to HADOOP-3601)]
