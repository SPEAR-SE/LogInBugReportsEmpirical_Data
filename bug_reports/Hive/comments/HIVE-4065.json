[Lefty recently finished copying all of the old xdocs over to the wiki. I'm in favor of making the wiki the official location for Hive documentation and removing the version specific links from the website. We also currently provide links to javadocs for non-public internal APIs. I think these should be removed., bq. ... links to javadocs for non-public internal APIs. I think these should be removed.

Which javadocs are those?  Do you mean we should remove the API links from the menu altogether, or purge javadoc comments on non-public APIs, or something else?

As for ditching xdocs in favor of wikidocs, where are the howls of protest?  (If nobody else speaks up for xdocs, I might have to do it myself.)  Plenty of pros and cons on both sides.]
