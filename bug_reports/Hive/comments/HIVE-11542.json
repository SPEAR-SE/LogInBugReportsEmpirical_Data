ATTACHMENT ID: 12750203 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I don't see HdfsUtils class being used anywhere. Remove it? Otherwise looks good to me +1, Will remove HdfsUtils for now, I guess, committed to master. I guess I'll have to do another merge into metastore branch, Doc note:  This adds *hive.orc.splits.include.fileid* to HiveConf.java, so it needs to be documented in the ORC section of Configuration Properties for release 2.0.0.

* [Configuration Properties -- ORC File Format | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-ORCFileFormat]

(Typo alert:  the parameter description says "thaty" for "that" which would be nice to fix sometime.), HIVE-11675 fixes the typo in the description of *hive.orc.splits.include.fileid* for release 2.1.0.

By the way, this parameter was originally introduced in the llap branch by HIVE-10067.]
