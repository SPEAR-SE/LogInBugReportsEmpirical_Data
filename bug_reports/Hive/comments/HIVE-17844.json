[According to the discussion that Zoltan refers to, the double represents float precisely, but the printed representation is different., [~akolb], yes, that's true, but it doesn't represent the initial user-supplied number faithfully any more.

If the user supplies the value 125.32, it can not be represented as a float precisely, but rounding rules during displaying that float will still display 125.32. However, when converting that float to double, different, more precise rounding rules start to apply, resulting in 125.31999969482422 getting displayed instead of 125.32. It is true that the double value is precisely the same as the float value, yet although none of them is precisely the same as the user-supplied value, the float gets displayed as the original value and the double isn't.

If 125.32 is stored directly to a double, then it is approximated more precisely and will display correctly. When it is stored as a float and then converted to a double, this is no longer true.]
