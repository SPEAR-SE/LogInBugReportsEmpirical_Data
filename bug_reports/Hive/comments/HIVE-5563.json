[HIVE-5546 got committed an hour back, which supposedly fixed this., Actually, this was done correctly in HIVE-4113 and then broken in HIVE-5391., Just a note/question? How is rcfile effected by these changes. Do we have api fragmentation going on are both formats effected? I am not seeing any end-to-end test in hive-5546 what are we doing to prevent code rot, and to ensure this mistake does not happen again?, RCFile doesn't have a vectorized reader so it wasn't broken by HIVE-5391.

HIVE-4113 changed both RCFile and ORC.

There certainly does need to be more testcases for the interface between Hive and the file formats although testing the effects of column projection are pretty tricky.

The current InputFormat API is a mess with a lot of special cases and hidden settings in the configuration. It seriously needs to be redesigned at some point.]
