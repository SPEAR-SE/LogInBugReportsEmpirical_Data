[[~namit] [~ashutoshc] fyi, Removing the SerDe interface as originally intended.
Serializer and Deserializer cannot be easily removed, because serde-s implement both. Removing deprecation from these.

[~ashutoshc] [~jdere] can you take a look?, Most of the changes are just due to using AbstractSerDe instead of SerDe everywhere,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12838466 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, All the tests are known flaky tests (PPD one is HIVE-14936, the rest are very old).

, [~ashutoshc] ping? , +1, Committed to master. Thanks for the review!, Should this (and HIVE-4007) be documented in the wiki?, bq.  We should un-deprecate (reprecate? precate?) them.

I like reprecate, but perhaps dedeprecate would be clearer.  Or how about de2precate?]
