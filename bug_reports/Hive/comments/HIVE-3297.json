[+1 on the idea!, Here is the patch which flips the default value in HiveConf to true. I kept the value as false for unit tests because tests which is testing for auto-converting joins is anyways setting it to true. For tests which which aren't setting it to true, assumptions and intent of original test will be changed and thus semantic they are testing will be different., https://reviews.facebook.net/D9159, +1

[~ashutoshc], can you commit it if the tests pass ?, Committed to trunk., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2004 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2004/])

, hello,I find while the code had updated ,the configurate file hive-default.xml is the old version.
this makes me confused.
Should we update that???

<property>
  <name>hive.auto.convert.join</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>Whether Hive enable the optimization about converting common join into mapjoin based on the input file size</description>
</property>, Yes, hive-default.xml.template needs to be updated for the new default value of *hive.auto.convert.join*.  Now it's on my fix-it list.

The wikidoc has been fixed:

* [Join Optimization:  Prior Support for MAPJOIN |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+JoinOptimization#LanguageManualJoinOptimization-PriorSupportforMAPJOIN]
* [Configuration Properties:  Query Execution |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-QueryExecution] -- search for "hive.auto.convert.join", I added notes about hive-default.xml.template showing the wrong default.  Presumably HIVE-6037 will fix the error, since its patch has the correct default.
