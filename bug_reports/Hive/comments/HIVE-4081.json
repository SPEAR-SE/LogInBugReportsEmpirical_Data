  The change looks good from my perspective, just one minor nit below. I'll mark HIVE-4110 as a duplicate.

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/SemanticAnalyzer.java:406 Is there a better variable name than aggregationTrees2?

  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/TypeCheckProcFactory.java:522 Do we also need to add TOK_PARTITIONBY, KW_ROWS, KW_RANGE, TOK_ORDERBY to this set ?

, Also it will be good to add following tests using newly added over10k dataset.
{noformat}
select s, si - lead(f, 3) over (partition by t order by bo desc) from over10k limit 100;
select s, i - lead(i, 3, 0) over (partition by si order by i) from over10k limit 100;
select s, si - lag(d, 3) over (partition by b order by si) from over10k limit 100;
select s, lag(s, 3, 'fred') over (partition by f order by b) from over10k limit 100;

, the changes are as specified in the previous review. Also fixed the issue in HIVE-4111
But didn't do a arc diff against the previous commit; which maybe why this is a new review., ashutoshc has accepted the revision "HIVE-4081 [jira] allow expressions with over clause".
