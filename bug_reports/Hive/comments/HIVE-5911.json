ATTACHMENT ID: 12616618, The MySQL and Postgresql upgrade scripts are supposed to start by printing the name of the corresponding patch to stdout, e.g:

"SELECT '< HIVE-3255 Storing delegation tokens in metastore >';"

I noticed that this echo statement is missing in the following scripts:
MySQL: 14, 15
Postgresql: 11, 14, 15

Would you mind fixing this issue in this patch?

Everything else looks good to me.
