ATTACHMENT ID: 12697376 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I tried query as posted and it failed to compile on various DBs (except mysql) :
{code}
create table staging (a int, b int);
select * from (
     select * from ( select 1 as id , "foo" as str_1 from staging ) f
  union	all
     select * from ( select 2 as id , "bar" as str_2 from staging ) g
) e ;
{code}

* Postgres 9.3 : ERROR: column "foo" does not exist: select * from ( select * from ( select 1 as id , "foo" as str_1 from staging ) f union	all select * from ( select 2 as id , "bar" as str_2 from staging ) g ) e
* Oracle 11g : ORA-00904: "foo": invalid identifier : select * from ( select * from ( select 1 as id , "foo" as str_1 from staging ) f union	all select * from ( select 2 as id , "bar" as str_2 from staging ) g ) e
* MS-SQL 2012 : Invalid column name 'foo'.: select * from ( select * from ( select 1 as id , "foo" as str_1 from staging ) f union	all select * from ( select 2 as id , "bar" as str_2 from staging ) g ) e
* MySQL 5.6 :  <Success with EmptyRS>.

Given above, we should check SQL standard, should allow this behavior only if standard permits.

[~ErwanMAS]  Are you migrating some workload to Hive. In that case, on which system you were able to run this query? Else, you were simply playing with Hive., Interestingly, following succeeded for all 4 DB engines:
{code}
create table foo ( dummyfoo int ) ;
create table bar ( dummybar int ) ;

select * from (
     select * from ( select 1 as id , dummyfoo from foo ) f
  union all
     select * from ( select 2 as id , dummybar from bar ) g
) e ;

select * from (
     select 1 as id , dummyfoo from foo	f
  union all
     select 2 as id , dummybar from bar g
) e ;
{code} 

This is from [~ErwanMAS] example in comments., Aah.. I see, its about quoting constant column values, not union schema. Following works in all 4:
{code}
select * from (
     select * from ( select 1 as id , 'foo' as str_1 from staging ) f
  union	all
     select * from ( select 2 as id , 'bar' as str_2 from staging ) g
) e ;
{code}

Note 'foo' vs "foo" in this and previous example., Since in Hive we allow quoting by " as in mysql, I think we should allow this. Looking into patch now., LGTM 
+1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Navis!, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
