[In TestExecDriver for each test it fails to compare the result files with static files because the content of the result file is double then expected.
On further investigation found that the static initialization block in TestExecDriver is executed twice, hence for second run src table is updated 2 times.

Below are some log statements from hive.log:

2017-04-26T06:34:04,699  INFO \[main\] hive.log: Updated size of table src to 5812
2017-04-26T06:34:05,188  INFO \[main\] hive.log: Updated size of table src2 to 5791
2017-04-26T06:34:33,996  INFO \[main\] hive.log: Updated size of table src to 5812
*2017-04-26T06:34:35,510  INFO \[main\] hive.log: Updated size of table src to 11624*
2017-04-26T06:34:35,695  INFO \[main\] hive.log: Updated size of table src2 to 5791
*2017-04-26T06:34:35,934  INFO \[main\] hive.log: Updated size of table src2 to 11582*, Couple of probable fixes are:
1. Not to use TestExecDriver reference in TestOperators class.
2. Write the code for cleanup in TestExecDriver.class.
The second option will need an explicit call for cleanup from TestOperators as it is a static call. I am going with the first option as only code used is creating instance of ExprNodeColumnDesc.

Let me know if any inputs., Changes made to move remove TestExecDriver references., +1, Pushed to master. Thanks, Yussuf!, Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
