, Pushed to branch-2 and master. Thanks Vihang for the work and Thejas to review., Thanks [~aihuaxu] Updated the fixed version to 2.3.0, Thanks for the catch!, [~vihangk1], why did you update the fixed version to 2.3.0?  Will there be another commit to branch-2.3 sometime soon?, oops sorry I didn't realize that the branch-2.3 is already cut out of branch-2. [~aihuaxu] Can you please commit this in branch-2.3 as well since we decided this is a must fix before releasing 2.3.0. Thanks [~leftylev] for pointing this out., Just pushed to branch-2.3. , Thanks [~aihuaxu], Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
