ATTACHMENT ID: 12741205 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Looks like vector_partitioned_date_time.q needs to be udpated for the MiniTez tests as well., Update MiniTez test for vector_partitioned_date_time.q, +1, Patch v3 - updating decimal_udf2.q as well, which has stats/file size differences on Windows due to CR differences on text files. Fixing the test by changing the table type to ORC rather than text, which should have more consistent data size between platforms. The actual stats values look different from before, but stats are not really important for this test.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12741338 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, test failures are unrelated (failed on next run as well)., Actually it looks like a couple of the test fixes are not necessary - I had 2 different build environments, and one of them had git core.crlf=true which caused the files to have Windows style CRLF line endings, which affects some tests. In patch v4 I've removed the changes for decimal_udf2.q and describe_comment_indent.q., Patch needed rebase after HIVE-11037,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12741433 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failure does not appear to be related. It passes for me locally on both Mac/Linux with the patch. Not to mention the patch contains only q-file changes., Committed to master]
