[It turns out to be simpler than I thought. We don't need to pass ObjectInspector because the class already knows the number of fields.

Also added a test case.
, looks good for handling the null columns case.

btw - getNumFields and ordered_types have the same length. doesn't seem to me that the SerDe assumes that the record has to have all fields (bails out when it hits stop even if all fields have not been read). So if we are trying to solve any outofbounds issue - not sure this is going to resolve it.
, You are right. The getNumFields actually returns the same value as ordered_types. It's not related to the actual non-null fields in the record.
I thought that might be a problem but it's actually not.  In reality, we have not seen the array index out of bound error.
, +1, Had to change the test case to make sure the output is deterministic.
