[As noticed by [~thejas], this came inadvertendly in last merge from spark.  It had been added at a time when Spark1.3 was not yet released.  Removing it.  

Also spark ended up releasing 1.3.1, so using that instead of 1.3., +1

[~sushanth] Another candidate for 1.2.0 .

ATTACHMENT ID: 12731098 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to master, thanks Szehon for review., [~sushanth], it seemed that this didn't get into 1.2.0. Do you think that it makes sense to include it?, [~xuefuz], thanks for the catch! I do think it makes sense to include this. Also, on that note, I have a further question before I pick this - In itests/pom.xml, in the spark-test profile, there is a download-spark goal which downloads the following:

{noformat}
http://d3jw87u4immizc.cloudfront.net/spark-tarball/spark-${spark.version}-bin-hadoop2-without-hive.tgz
{noformat}

Is there a better place to download this from, or would it make more sense to remove this section for the 1.2 release?, [~sushanth], this artifact is only need for testing, not for build. Thus, I think it's okay to have it there. This is different from what was removed via this JIRA. Also, in the previous release, we had a similar site for this, but we didn't have a private maven repo for build artifacts.

Of course, it's nice if there is a public (apache) place where we can host binaries for testing, but we don't have it at the moment., Committed to branch-1.2. Thanks, all!, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
