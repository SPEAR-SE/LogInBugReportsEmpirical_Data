[Here's the patch.

The new test file (parquet_add_field_to_struct.q) contains the queries to test this fix.

[~amalakar] Could you verify that this is the correct patch by testing it with your data?, [~spena] I have been using hive 0.14 with HIVE-8909 applied on it. This patch doesn't apply cleanly on top of that, as this patch seems to be meant for trunk. On the other hand I am unable to compile trunk against hadoop 2.3.0 as it complains about package KeyProvider etc. I would need to port this patch for 0.14, with HIVE-8909, to be able to test it., Thanks [~amalakar]. If you can test this patch on hive 0.14, it would be great.

Regarding the KeyProvider issue. Is a compilation problem? or a runtime problem?
There is a patch for hadoop + keyprovider incompatibility issues here HIVE-9957 that was committed to trunk 2 days ago. This is for runtime errors with hadoop lower than 2.6.0.,
