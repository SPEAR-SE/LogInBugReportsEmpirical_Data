[Attached patch fixes the issues., Now that remoteAddr is never null, get rid of null check while logging., Could we limit the visibility of the thread-local variable to package-private (as opposed to public). The patch introduces a indentation problem in HadoopThriftAuthBridge20S.java. Looks good otherwise., Updated patch incorporating Devaraj's comments. Made thread-local variables package private and corrected unintentional indentation problem., +1, Can any committer take a look?, Could you post it to review board?
