[Can you possibly supply a positive test that fails before the patch and succeeds after the patch?, Sorry Ed, I'm not sure what you mean by a positive test.The additional condition I added in TestStandardObjectInspectors.testStandardPrimitiveObjectInspector causes that test to fail without the change to PrimitiveObjectInspectorUtils. Timestamp/TimestampWritable wasn't covered by that test previously.

, I meant 
Can you write a .q file like the other ones we use to test hive? This would do something like select some data with a primitive timestamp and fail. Otherwise your just altering a current test class and it is not obvious how hive is effected or what was broken. 

, Gotcha, will do., Thank you. I realize it is a bit overkill but have .q files for end to end testing will help prevent future regressions., Its good to have a .q file test since it demonstrate the functionality bug as well as provides protection against regression. But, in this case bug is quite clear and is covered by junit test case. Ed, I propose that we commit this patch as it, otherwise bug will keep lurking in our codebase till Sam circle back with new testcase. What do you say?, Pinging [~appodictic], Wow I totally lost track of this one. yea lets do it. Are we committing on 0.10 release at this point or just trunk?, Cool. Trunk mostly., Ashutosh, I am assuming you are committing it.
Can you file a follow-up jira for a test for this one ?, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Sam!
