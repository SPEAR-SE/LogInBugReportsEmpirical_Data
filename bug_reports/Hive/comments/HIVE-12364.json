ATTACHMENT ID: 12771436 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Pushed to master. , Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug., +1 for backport to branch-1., I holded it back as some other patches for related to copy/move did not land in branch-1. , Hey, [~prasanth_j]. I'd be keen on knowing what other patches this might need. Were these also critical bug-fixes?

This patch seems pretty self-contained. It's the result of Hive's own InputFormats implementing old-api, while DistCp uses the new MR apis. We ran into this problem today. I also ran into a similar problem when introducing a custom MR job for something else I'm working on. (That I'll explain in another JIRA.)

, HIVE-11940 and HIVE-7476

Looks like HIVE-7476 backported recently. HIVE-11940 needs to go. Without HIVE-11940 distcp could be wrongly triggered. distcp should only be triggered if move across different fs or encryption zones. HIVE-11940 removes one of the probable invocation of distcp. , Brilliant! Thank you, Prashanth. I'll check on these bugs for our internal branch. 

IMHO, given that they solve problems with an officially released version, we really should consider pulling them into branch-1. , We also need HIVE-11607 and HIVE-11820. I am now cherrypicking all these patches to branch-1. Let's see how it goes. , Committed all relevant patches to branch-1 along with this patch., Superb! Thanks, dude.]
