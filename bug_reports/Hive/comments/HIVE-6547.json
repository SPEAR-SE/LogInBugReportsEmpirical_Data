[HIVE-6547.thriftapi.patch - thrift api change for review
, Looks good. Do you want to qualify fields in new structs with required ?, Thanks for the feedback. Will make them required.
While I am at it , i will also make the fields in GetPrincipalsInRoleResponse,GetPrincipalsInRoleRequest required. With the semantics of the functions, it does not make any sense for them to be non-required.
Those are similar functions that were added recently, HIVE-6547.thriftapi.2.patch - addressed thrift api feedback.
, HIVE-6547.1.patch - includes thrift gen files
, The patch also remioves additional fields  - principalname and principaltype in 'show role grant user user2" output, as that is redundant information. Also removes role createtime from this command output as that is not relevant to role grant information., Ran tests locally and they passed.
, Patch committed to 0.13 branch and trunk.
Thanks for the review Ashutosh!
