Thanks., Please submit a review request on Phabricator or Reviewboard. Thanks., And please exclude the test updates from the review request to make it easier to read., I have binaries in the diff and can't use arc then ......
, I don't see any binaries in the patch. Not sure what you're referring to., https://reviews.facebook.net/D3603
,  https://reviews.facebook.net/D3603, ping ..., Looking at it now..., @Shuai: Please see my comments on phabricator. Thanks., On a related note, it looks like the inputs for views are incorrect. For example, view.q does the following:

{noformat}
CREATE VIEW v8 AS SELECT key from db1.table1
PREHOOK: type: CREATEVIEW
PREHOOK: Input: db1@table1
PREHOOK: Output: db1@v8
...
PREHOOK: query: SELECT * FROM db1.v8
PREHOOK: type: QUERY
PREHOOK: Input: db1@table1
PREHOOK: Input: db1@v8
#### A masked pattern was here ####
POSTHOOK: query: SELECT * FROM db1.v8
POSTHOOK: type: QUERY
POSTHOOK: Input: db1@table1
POSTHOOK: Input: db1@v8
{noformat}

When selecting from v8, db1@table1 should not appear in the list of inputs.
