[[~ctang.ma]: that actually looks like a cross-product even pre-optimization. The optimizer is not the one generating a cross-product unless there's a missing t1.key = t2.key there?, Yeah, with the  t1.key = t2.key, the query plan looks right and there is not cross-product. Thanks for pointing out.]
