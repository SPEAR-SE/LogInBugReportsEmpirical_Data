All tests passed!
, you should also get rid of the assert at line 2349:     assert joinCond != null;

In general looks like asserts are not being enabled. we have tons of asserts all over the code - but they may not be firing.
, removed the assert - will enable asserts in a separate patch, +1

looks good., did a svn up and generated the patch again after resolving conflicts
Zheng, can you commit now ?, Just found that the output file is 6M? Can we make the test case output a bit smaller?
Otherwise the source tree will be growing too much unnecessarily.
, reduced the test and generated the patch again, Committed revision 724047.
Thanks Namit. Please update the internal svn with the reduced test case output.
, HIVE-111. Support join without a ON clause. (Namit through zshao)]
