[+1, Pushed to master to disable running this test. Keeping jira open until we figure out root cause for this., Attaching stack trace that shows jstack when its hanging.
, The commit in HIVE-12159 has lead to the hang of this test case. Reverting it avoids the problem.

Also note that the problem is seen only when the batch is run, not when just the regex_extract test is run.

{code}
mvn  test   -Dtest=TestCliDriver '-Dqfile=index_compact_2.q,vector_grouping_sets.q,join11.q,lateral_view_cp.q,vectorized_bucketmapjoin1.q,non_ascii_literal2.q,sort_merge_join_desc_4.q,transform_acid.q,union17.q,parquet_avro_array_of_single_field_struct.q,regexp_extract.q,expr_cached.q,llap_partitioned.q,vector_join_filters.q,vector_interval_mapjoin.q'  

{code}, Marking as blocker to track re-enabling the test for 2.1, Ok, more details, the real problem is llap_partitioned.q. Taking that test out of the mix makes the batch pass and it also fails when run on its own. It is getting an array out of bounds exception in the vectorized ORC reader and I'm working on tracking down how/why.
, Since Matt reverted the change for HIVE-12159, and I've updated that patch with the fix to this (and reverting this patch), we should probably close this as a duplicate., This got closed as part of HIVE-12159.]
