ATTACHMENT ID: 12861118 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Hi [~csun], this is off the topic here, but IIRC, HoS uses raw data size (if any) for map join, and HoMR uses file size for map join. Now the property {{hive.spark.use.file.size.for.mapjoin}} seems to suggest it can make HoS also use file size for map join. But in fact that's not the case, right?, Yes, it still uses data size. The name is confusing. I think it's better to call it {{hive.spark.use.ts.stats.for.mapjoin}}., Discussed with Xuefu & Jimmy offline. I think instead of  rejecting branches with RS, we can reject branches that contain either JOIN or LATERAL_VIEW, which could potentially increase output data size. We mark those as big table branches, and, if we have more than one such branch, the JOIN op cannot be turned to a MAPJOIN op. This opens up more opportunities for optimizations.

Attaching patch v2 which realizes the above idea.,
