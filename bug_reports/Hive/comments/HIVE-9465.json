[Hive manual says that the dynamic columns must be specified last. And thus I think they are matched by position instead of name.

, [~xuefuz] Thanks a lot for reply. But I think it should be a feature for Hive sql to use table alias while do dynamic partition loading., Yeah. In that case, this JIRA should be an improvement rather than a bug. There is no bug as this is by design. Also, you need to think about backward compatibility when proposing your solution.]
