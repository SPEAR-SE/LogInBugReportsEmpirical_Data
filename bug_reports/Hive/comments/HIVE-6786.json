[[~gopalv] Thats looks like an off-by-one error. It should be >=. I think this case will only be hit when the stripe statistics is missing, in which case the stripeStatistics.size() will be 0 and all stripes should be included.
The attached patch fixes it.

I am curious how is it missing stripe statistics? Is it an old ORC which did not have stripe statistics or is the ORC file generated via other means (apart from hive)?, [~gopalv] Was it throwing ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception when PPD is enabled?,
