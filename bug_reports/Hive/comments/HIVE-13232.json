    https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/118

    fix stripe size smaller than expected

    I saw there's a Jira item: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13232 moved the compressed = null out of if block. But that is not seem to be a complete fix. To calculate the right value, we cannot use all bytes that a reserved, but should use bytes are filled. Thus I change the capacity() to position().
    ```java  
    public void flush() throws IOException {
        spill();
        if (compressed != null && compressed.position() != 0) {
          compressed.flip();
          receiver.output(compressed);
    //Should move compress = null out of if block, (already been moved out in 2.1.0 code)
    //otherwise its capacity will count for all following stripes even it is not used by them.
          compressed = null;
    }
        uncompressedBytes = 0;
        compressedBytes = 0;
        overflow = null;
        current = null;
      }
    ```
