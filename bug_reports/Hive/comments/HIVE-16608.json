[We are also hitting this issue, but the proposed fix doesn't work either. Running the same query in spark sql works without issue. It is quite surprising this issue was created a year ago and noone else is encountering any issues., Running the query with 

SET hive.cbo.enable = false;

is a workaround for this issue also., Another work around is to write query like this

where nvl(TABLEA.attr, 0)= CASE WHEN TABLEB.attr IS NOT NULL THEN TABLEB.attr ELSE 0 END

Converting one of the NVL statement to CASE statement is enough]
