ATTACHMENT ID: 12844921 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~jcamachorodriguez], the patch sounds like a magic to me... :) I am wondering why we have those redundant code in the past. And when I traced back, it was generated in HIVE-13191 by yourself. :) Could you put some comments in the jira explaining why the code works now? Thanks., [~pxiong], the basic idea behind that code (HIVE-13191 was just an extension) was that if we have multiple values in one of the join inputs that are equal, we do not need to have them in the RS operator multiple times (and thus shuffle them). Instead, we can have the value only once in the RS operator, and then the join will read _x_ times that same value to produce the correct output. In fact, the code was not working properly originally till HIVE-10582 went in.

The problem is that MapJoinOperator does not support duplicate values for left outer join properly: there is an assumption for the row container about the join output columns being the same as the input columns. I have not had the chance to check that code in detail. Till then, this fix will avoid producing incorrect results by not reusing the value in the RS and thus producing it multiple times.

I will add a TODO to the code, and as I said in the issue description, I will create a follow-up issue to tackle the root cause of the problem., I see. It makes more sense now... +1. :), Pushed to master, thanks for reviewing [~pxiong]!

I have created HIVE-15524 to tackle the root cause of the issue.]
