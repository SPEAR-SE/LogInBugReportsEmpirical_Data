ATTACHMENT ID: 12811497 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~sershe] what if instead of return null we return a -1? 
I like to avoid null values in case a future developer uses the method without validating the null causing NPE exceptions., I actually like it for the same reason - it's easy to have invalid values slip by (just like with 0 here), but with null, the error would usually be caught earlier ;)
I can change it in this case where it doesn't matter that much, What about throwing a checked exception? I agree with you of invalid values. I see that a NULL value can be returned in case the filter couldn't be formed correctly. If NULL means an error, then a checked exception should be better handled by developers, shouldn't it?, null means "filter cannot be pushed down", which is a normal condition, many filters cannot be pushed down; some of the methods (e.g. get partitions) evaluate it in metastore instead, using partition name list, some give up and fall back to ORM path. Perhaps I can c/p the evaluation path., Nm, this actually uses filter not expr... I just c/ped the better way to handle it without the exception from the other filter call. If GetHelper::getSqlResult either throws or disables directsql for itself, the caller falls back to JDO. Added a comment to this effect... it looks like JDO path also exists for this call.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12812067 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Test failures appear unrelated (hashmap ordering) or known., Hey Sergey, sorry I am still against the null value. I was thinking that if a filter push down couldn't be done, then the method should throw an exception with the reason of that. While I was running some tests with HIVE-14063, I did a test you mentioned about falling-back to ORM if direct-sql fails, and ORM also failed but with an exception returned by {{getNumPartitionsViaOrmFilter}} due to problems with the filter. In this scenario, I could know exactly what the problem was.

In my opinion, I think that we should throw a checked exception in case an internal error happens, and let the caller decide what to do with it. [~ashutoshc] [~sushanth] what do you think about this? I'd like to know other opinions., Hmm... the thing is that not being able to push down a filter is not an error, it's an expected condition - most filters cannot be pushed down here, only a narrow set of filters is supported. I could separate it into two functions, one returning boolean, and the other non-nullable, but an exception shouldn't be used in this case., Updated. I think we should fix the bug first and then refactor the existing code conventions (all other methods in directSQL that have internal restrictions have the same semantics with nulls). So, if this affects branch-1, we should still commit patch .01 there, Agree. Let's fix this in another jira.

I took a look the the patch, and it looks good.
+1

Let's wait for HiveQA to verify the patch.,
