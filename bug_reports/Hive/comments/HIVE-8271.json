ATTACHMENT ID: 12671539, +1 for 0.14., +1 for the patch as well., Committed to trunk and branch-14, thanks [~vikram.dixit], [~gopalv] [~vikram.dixit]

This is causing TestHCatLoader to fail. I do not know why pre-commit did not find this. The error:

{noformat}
java.io.IOException: Failed to execute "create table junit_unparted_basic(a int, b string) stored as AVRO". Driver returned 1 Error: FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask. org.apache.avro.Schema$Field.<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/apache/avro/Schema;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/codehaus/jackson/JsonNode;)V

I extracted the class and ran {{javap}} on the class. You can see that it has the relocated name while HCatalog is compiled against the non-relocated version. Since Jackson is used publicly by avro, I don't think we can relocate it.

{noformat}
$ javap org/apache/avro/Schema\$Field.class | grep org.apache.avro.Schema
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Djava.awt.headless=true
public class org.apache.avro.Schema$Field extends org.apache.avro.JsonProperties {
  public org.apache.avro.Schema$Field(java.lang.String, org.apache.avro.Schema, java.lang.String, org.apache.hive.org.codehaus.jackson.JsonNode);
  public org.apache.avro.Schema$Field(java.lang.String, org.apache.avro.Schema, java.lang.String, org.apache.hive.org.codehaus.jackson.JsonNode, org.apache.avro.Schema$Field$Order);
{noformat}, I have not reverted the commit, but since this issue is clearly still open, I am re-opening as a blocker for 0.14., Looks like both this Jira and HIVE-7420 (which added Avro HCatLoader tests) were both committed on the same day, so the precommit tests passed independently for both, but fail when both patches are applied., We should revert this & move to hadoop-2.5 instead (HIVE-7960).

I can revert this tomorrow, unless someone gets to it first., Reverted on trunk & hive-14.

There is no way to fix for this problem as it exists today, because Jackson is used in public API signatures within hive-exec.jar.
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
