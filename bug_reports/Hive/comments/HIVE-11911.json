[[~prasanth_j] can you take a look?, JDBCStats publishing is having all sorts of issues with key prefix. I don't think thats a problem with counter and fs based stats. Do we really need to support it? [~ashutoshc] Any thoughts on this?

Excerpt from this link http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/76469/mysql-varchar-length-and-performance
"It has some consequences for InnoDB, too. Index size is restricted to 3072 bytes and single column indexes, to 767 bytes.", I agree. There is no point in maintaining 5 diff stats collection module. Is there a good reason for not using fs based stats collection here.
2.0 is a good time to get rid of these stats collection modules.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12761528 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~prasanth_j] see the exception text I added; you can increase prefix size by configuring mysql.

[~ashutoshc] maybe, but that's a separate discussion. For now we should fix it. , Test failures are unrelated, known bad tests, Tez failed due to some DFS cluster issue
, +1 for this patch. Ideally we should drop unused stats collectors., committed to master]
