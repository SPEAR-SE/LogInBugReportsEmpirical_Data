[[~gopalv] fyi... I might take a look at (1) at some point, will probably fix (2) with it, unless something happens earlier, [~navis] fyi if you have some easy fixes in mind :)

Example of logging I get 
{noformat}
2015-08-26 17:52:16,695 INFO [InputInitializer [Map 1] #0] metastore.HiveMetaStore: 0: Opening raw store with implemenation class:org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.ObjectStore
2015-08-26 17:52:16,730 INFO [InputInitializer [Map 1] #0] metastore.ObjectStore: ObjectStore, initialize called
[snip]
{noformat}

The call stack for the above is:
{noformat}
	at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.createMetaStoreClient(Hive.java:3054)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.getMSC(Hive.java:3074)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.getAllFunctions(Hive.java:3299)
	at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.reloadFunctions(Hive.java:175)

	at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcInputFormat$MetastoreCache.getHive(OrcInputFormat.java:1544)
{noformat}
Then
{noformat}
2015-08-26 17:52:16,761 INFO [InputInitializer [Map 1] #0] hive.metastore: Trying to connect to metastore with URI thrift://[snip]:9085

{noformat}
, I will take a look tomorrow. This is causing annoying and unobvious problems on some setups., This changes the reloadFunctions call to be done once globally, but on the object, so that it is done after the proper config is set. 

It also improves retry logic to not retry on some non-recoverable errors, like a missing method.

[~gopalv] [~ashutoshc] can you take a look,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12753084 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sushanth] can you take a look? https://reviews.apache.org/r/37980/, [~sershe] Making static call in Hive was one of the my worst decision on hive. I was so tired of rebasing the patch for years and new things like permanent function bothered too much of me and I couldn't think of any better idea in that day. , [~navis] np :) can you review the change?, +1., committed to master]
