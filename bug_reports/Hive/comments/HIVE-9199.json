[The attached patch is to change DummayTxnManager to determine the lockMode for DDL based on output writetype, while still using "complete" for DML operations. 
Please help review on RB https://reviews.apache.org/r/29374/ , thanks in advance., With my limited understanding, the patch looks okay. To be sure, [~alangates], would you mind taking a look also?, +1.  I didn't actually write this code, I just moved it to DummyTxnManager from Driver. But looking over the patch, it makes sense.  Completeness doesn't have any meaning for DDL, only for DML.,
