[[~thomas_nys] You are likely missing adls jar in your application classpath. Do you see it in your classpath?, Hi

I can confirm this was found on my application class path:
[info] * Attributed(/Users/thomas/.ivy2/cache/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-azure-datalake/jars/hadoop-azure-datalake-3.1.0.jar)
[info] * Attributed(/Users/thomas/.ivy2/cache/com.microsoft.azure/azure-data-lake-store-sdk/jars/azure-data-lake-store-sdk-2.2.5.jar)

Are these the correct ones?

, [~prasanth_j] can you confirm these are the correct ones?
 , That looks like correct jars. Are you shading jars using maven-assembly plugin by any chance?, Hi

I had to add them to my application dependencies(sbt) to have them in my class-path. Is this not the correct way to go?
 , Maybe you are running into this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17265002/hadoop-no-filesystem-for-scheme-file, Hi

I am not deploying into one jar. So I guess not.

I also tried the suggested solution with loading config files from the cluster, based on: [https://github.com/mradamlacey/hive-streaming-azure-hdinsight/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cbre/eim/HiveStreamingExample.java], this didn't solve the issue either.
