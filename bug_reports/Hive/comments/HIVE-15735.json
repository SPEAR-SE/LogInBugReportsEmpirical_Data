[~aihuaxu], could you review the change? Thanks, The change looks good. One minor comment: can you change the message in the test likes the following to match what it's doing?

assertFalse("Table is not direct input", CheckInputReadEntity.readEntities[2].isDirect());, In ReadEntity, view and table all belong to type table. So the error message for test should be OK., I see. 

Looks good to me +1., Committed to master branch. Thanks [~aihuaxu] for the review.]
