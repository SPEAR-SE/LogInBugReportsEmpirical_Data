[Um, sorry. HIVE-4148 removed it from ql, which doesn't have any dependencies on it. It seems only shims and metastore depend on guava right now. We also used to include two versions of guava, which I think is unnecessary - for the stuff we're using, it seems 11.0.2 is compatible with r09. So only the newer one should suffice., Still testing, but the attached patch should fix the issue., Thanks for taking a look at this Gunther. Your patch worked for the place I was getting an exception. I'll assign this to you., Glad it worked for you [~mwagner]. I've ran tests and they look good. This issue need to be backported to 0.11, I think., +1, Committed to trunk and 0.11 Thanks, Gunther!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #162 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/162/])
