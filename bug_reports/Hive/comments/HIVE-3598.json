[After HIVE-3403, an auto sortmerge join can be performed.
However, consider the following scenario:

T1 - big table: 3 partitions : big partitions
T2 - small table: 1 partition

both T1 and T2 are sorted/bucketed on the same key.

If a join is being performed between T1 and T2, with HIVE-3403, T2 would be picked up as the table on which the mapper would run.
Ideally, if T2 is so small that it can fit in memory, a better approach would be map-join. 
The physical optimizer should change the sort-merge join task into a backup task, with all tables being candidates for map-join
(similar to auto convert mapjoin).
, Done as part of HIVE-3403, This issue is fixed and released as part of 0.10.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
