[+1, [~csun] I believe you were the release manager for 1.1.1. Does this look good for 1.1.1?, [~csun] This is good for review., [~vgumashta], patch looks good. +1. Thanks for fixing this!
One minor thing: under the project root pom.xml, do we need to change {{hive.version.shortname}} to 1.1.1 too?, [~csun] Good point. Made the change in v2.]
