[[~pvillard] are you able to provide a way to reproduce this without the Aginity driver? It will be difficult to make any progress otherwise I think. It would also be good to have the Aginity team investigate the problem if you have a support relationship with them., Hi [~cartershanklin]. I am not, unfortunately... and I clearly agree this is something that must be fixed on Aginity side since everything is working correctly with other drivers (I sent them an email with relevant info). My intention here was more about catching the NPE and maybe provide a relevant message.]
