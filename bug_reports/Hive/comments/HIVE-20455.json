[The intention is to retry ASAP when exception happen in hope it is recoverable and don't delay synchronizer. But log pollution is a bigger problem for sure. Which one is the typo, can you clarify?, Yeah, the retry is basically looping around with SBA (which has less security around it, but still used a lot).

The typo is in the class name - the missing 'r' in PrivilegeSynchonizer, You are right. How come I didn't spot it. Attach patch to fix typo and move sleep out., LGTM - +1 tests pending.,
