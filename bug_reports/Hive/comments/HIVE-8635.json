[[~ashutoshc] [~jpullokkaran] tiny patch, can you guys check?
In this method, when getColsByRegex is called, it passes "true" as the last argument, to ensure unique columns.
This check was not extended to the clause of the if that doesn't call getCols... but just adds the thing directly.
Now it's being extended, +1, +1 for hive .14,
