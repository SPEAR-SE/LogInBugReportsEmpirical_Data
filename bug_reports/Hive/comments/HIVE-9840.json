[[~pradeep_bhadani], I tried mysql and postgres, they returned the same results without any exception. [~jpullokkaran] and [~ashutoshc], could you please take a look?

Mysql:

mysql> select count(*);
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|        1 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select count(*) src;
+-----+
| src |
+-----+
|   1 |
+-----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> explain select count(*) src;
+----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------------+
| id | select_type | table | type | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref  | rows | Extra          |
+----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------------+
|  1 | SIMPLE      | NULL  | NULL | NULL          | NULL | NULL    | NULL | NULL | No tables used |
+----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

Postgres

tmpdb=# select count(*);
 count
-------
     1
(1 row)

tmpdb=# select count(*) src;
 src
-----
   1
(1 row)

tmpdb=# explain select count(*) src;
                   QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=0.01..0.03 rows=1 width=0)
   ->  Result  (cost=0.00..0.01 rows=1 width=0)
(2 rows), (1) When there is no from clause, aliasToOpInfo.isEmpty() in Semantic Analyzer. And, Hive will create a dummy table, which only has a single 1 in it. Thus, select count(*) will be rewritten as select count(*) from `_dummy_table`
{code}
if (aliasToOpInfo.isEmpty()) {

      qb.getMetaData().setSrcForAlias(DUMMY_TABLE, getDummyTable());

      TableScanOperator op = (TableScanOperator) genTablePlan(DUMMY_TABLE, qb);

      op.getConf().setRowLimit(1);

      qb.addAlias(DUMMY_TABLE);

      qb.setTabAlias(DUMMY_TABLE, DUMMY_TABLE);

      aliasToOpInfo.put(DUMMY_TABLE, op);

}
{code}

(2) When there is no from clause, but followed by a table name that does (not) exist, hive will give you an AST like this
{code}
TOK_QUERY
   TOK_INSERT
      TOK_DESTINATION
         TOK_DIR
            TOK_TMP_FILE
      TOK_SELECT
         TOK_SELEXPR
            TOK_FUNCTIONSTAR
               count
            -----table name -----
{code}
Hive will ignore the table name when parsing this.

(3) MySQL, Postgres, MSSQL etc uses "dual" table
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUAL_table
And, "The DUAL table is a special one-row, one-column table present by default in Oracle and other database installations. " which corresponding to the dummytable in Hive. However, Hive does not allow you to use "select 1 from dual" explicitly:
{code}
hive> select 1 from dual;
FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10001]: Line 1:14 Table not found 'dual'
{code}
And, there is already a jira ticket for this : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1558

[~pradeep_bhadani], do you think it is OK to close this ticket? Thanks.

, [~pxiong] , It makes sense to have dual (dummy) table in MySQL or Oracle , as you can access this table and can do some testing operation.
But in Hive , this table is not accessible. So I don't know what is the logic behind this dummy table in Hive. At least we should be able to access this table , otherwise it do not see any use of this table. 

If dummy table is implemented as per  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1558 , then it might be useful for some cases. 

If the ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1558 do not go for implementation , then the above statement should show some ERROR or aleast WARn message that we are trying to access dummy table and we cannot access this table or do any operation on this table.

, [~pradeep_bhadani], the logic behind this dummy table is mentioned in my previous comment (1) and it is already implemented there. However, as I mentioned in (3) the dummy table is different from dual table. The function of dual table is mentioned in  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1558  but not implemented. You are very welcome to either add a warning log in the source code of Hive when dummy table is used or implement the dual table as you wish. Either way, we can help review your code. Thanks!]
