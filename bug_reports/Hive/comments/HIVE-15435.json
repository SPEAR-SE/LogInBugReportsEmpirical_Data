[can not reappear it. env: hadoop 2.7.3, tez 0.8.4 , hive 2.1.1, But I find another problem. i will dig it , can anyone reappear this problem?
I find another problem, maybe related to this. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15444, You can find attached my pom.xml. I compiled with "mvn clean package -Pdist -DskipTests -X".
Maven 3.3.9 and Java 1.7 were used for the compilation. I hope this can help to reproduce this use case.]
