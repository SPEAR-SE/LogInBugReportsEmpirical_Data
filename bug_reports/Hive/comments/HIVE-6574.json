ATTACHMENT ID: 12633254, The above test failure is unrelated. Patched committed to trunk. Thanks Brock for the review., Thanks! I think we should also commit this to 0.13., Yes. I communicated this in the release email thread. Do I need to actually commit it or the release "manager" will?, ported to 0.13, Thanks, Harish!]
