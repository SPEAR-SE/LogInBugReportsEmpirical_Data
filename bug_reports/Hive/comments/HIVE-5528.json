[This is now documented in the wiki, in the Error Logs section of Getting Started with a link to this JIRA (see [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs]):

bq.  Note: In local mode, the log file name is ".log" instead of "hive.log". This is a bug which will be fixed in a future release (see HIVE-5528)., AFAICT I fixed this in HIVE-5676., Let's mark this resolved for now and reopen if it persists post HIVE-5676., Did HIVE-5676 fix this?  If not, the wiki needs to be revised where it says "This is a bug which will be fixed in release 0.13.0."

* [Getting Started:  Error Logs |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs], [~brocknoland] and [~thejas], can I change the wiki to say this was fixed in Hive 0.13.0?

The logs are stored in the folder:

* /tmp/<user.name>/hive.log
Note: In local mode, prior to Hive 0.13.0 the log file name was ".log" instead of "hive.log". This bug was fixed in release 0.13.0 (see HIVE-5528 and HIVE-5676).
