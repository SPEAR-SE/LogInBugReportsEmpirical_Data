ATTACHMENT ID: 12688239 - PreCommit-HIVE-SPARK-Build, Committed to trunk and spark branch. Thanks, Jimmy.
(Sorry that my commit message may have said Chao, but Jimmy still got the credit for this.), [~xuefuz] This patch had a list of failed tests and seemed not have any following fix. How could it be committed to trunk? Anyway, this caused fail of nonmr_fetch and virtual_column., [~navis], Sorry that I missed that. I will revert the patch and reopen the JIRA. Thanks., Patch reverted in trunk., Attached a new patch.,
