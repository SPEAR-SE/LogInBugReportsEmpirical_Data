[~daijy] Can you please take a look at this change? Thanks!, +1, Patch pushed to master., [~daijy] Thanks for the help. I uploaded another patch to include more unit tests. Please take a look and see if we can commit that as well. cc [~thejas], [~taoli-hwx]
Since this has been committed already, it would be better to put additional patch with new UT in separate jira (just new diffs).

, [~thejas] Sounds good., This jira is resolved and released with Hive 3.0 If you find an issue with it, please create a new jira.]
