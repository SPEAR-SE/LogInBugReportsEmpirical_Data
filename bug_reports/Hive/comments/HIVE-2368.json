Review request for hive and Paul Yang.


Summary
-------

To determine if a column descriptor is unused, we call listStorageDescriptorsWithCD(), which may return a big list of SDs. This can severely slow down dropping partitions.

We can add a maximum number of SDs to return, and just ask for 1 SD, since we are just doing an existential check.


This addresses bug HIVE-2368.
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2368
