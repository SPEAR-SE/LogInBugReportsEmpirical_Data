ATTACHMENT ID: 12701347 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Is this fixed by HIVE-10778? That just needs to be ported back probably, We did confirm that this patch also works. Perhaps they are redundant (HIVE-10778 might clean it earlier). We can still commit it for now, +1

[~thejas] [~olegd] thoughts?, Committed to master; we will resolve the duplication during the llap branch merge., Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug.]
