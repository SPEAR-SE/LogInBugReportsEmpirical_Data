HIVE-4350: Support AS keyword for table alias.  Add simple test.

SQL standard supports AS optional keyword, while creating an table alias.

http://savage.net.au/SQL/sql-92.bnf.html#table reference

Hive gives a error when the optional keyword is used -
select * from tiny as t1;
org.apache.hive.service.cli.HiveSQLException: Error while processing statement: FAILED: ParseException line 1:19 mismatched input 'as' expecting EOF near 'tiny'

TEST PLAN
  Query test table_alias.q

, As this is an optional keyword that does not change the plan, I think it will be safe to modify an existing test case to use this keyword, instead of adding a new one. That we can avoid adding couple of seconds to the test runtime., thejas has commented on the revision "HIVE-4350 [jira] support AS keyword for table alias".

  Instead of adding a new .q file for testing this, I think one of the existing test cases can be modified to use this optional keyword. That way it won't add few seconds to the test runtime.
