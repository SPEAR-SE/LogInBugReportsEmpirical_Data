[Hi, sorry for the late response, just noticed this, and thought I should respond.

I'm afraid this patch is not doing the right thing - createDefaultDB / createDefaultRoles / addAdminUsers are not schema creation, they are application logic that inserts rows into the tables that should already exist from manually creating schema. i.e. this is not schema creation, this is data insertion.

Thus, we should not be disabling them if autoCreateSchema is off.

It does look like you have an issue with hive creating schema automatically (whether through hive or datanucleus) when you run this section of code, but that is something that you will probably encounter even if you create a new hive table or partition or any such other use of the metastore. I remember that with DN, we had an issue a while back where we not only needed autoCreateSchema to be set to false, but also fixedDataStore to true(this maybe due to us working across multiple versions of DN depending on deployment).]
