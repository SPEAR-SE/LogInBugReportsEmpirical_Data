ATTACHMENT ID: 12653308, Can you explain whats the bug here? Not having a test case is ok, as long as we understand what is the bug here., I cannot reproduce this but in a complex query with correlation optimizer, I've seen the value inside the same DateWritable instance is changed between set-time and write-time, making invalid stats., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Navis!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
