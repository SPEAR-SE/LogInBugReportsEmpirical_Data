[Ow man. Maybe now is a good time to move most of these features into the hive binary. Hacking up /bat files to work like these sh files is going to be a ugly., Hi Edward, It is a good idea. Let me understand the scripts and think about it. Do you see any unused/retired scripts in this list?

Thanks
Kanna, None of them are retired. They each start up different hive components., The attached patch has the windows native command scripts, which can run hive on windows without Cygwin. We attach this patch because we already have the windows specific command scripts. We will deal with the unification of scripts in a separate JIRA. Additionally, unit test scripts will follow., The CMD scripts attached in the patch have been tested reasonably well through end-to-end scenarios. I will be writing and uploading unit tests in the next few days. I am thinking of writing the unit tests in Java, so that when we do unify the scripts later, we have a good set of unit tests to test for regressions. 

If this patch is accepted, then I will create a new JIRA for unifying the scripts into the hive binary itself., For HIVE-3129.2.patch, I added CMD scripts for beeline, hiveserver2, and metatool. I also added bin placing changes in the build.xml which will drop the CMD files to the build location., [~xifang] Looks like HIVE-6982 supersedes this. Should we mark this as duplicate?
