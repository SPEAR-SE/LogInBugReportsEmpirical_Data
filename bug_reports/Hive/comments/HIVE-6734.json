[[~rhbutani] This needs to be in 0.13 as well., Ran tests locally, all looks good., [~alangates] Can you create RB entry for it ?, I changed the grain of locking for DDL statements.  In the initial checkin I had set all DDL statements to exclusive lock.  But this results in a whole table being locked so that a partition can be added.  This is excessive.  So I went back and added a DDL_EXCLUSIVE, DDL_SHARED, and DDL_NO_LOCK so that different DDL statements could obtain appropriate grains of locks.  For example, add partition is now a shared lock, drop partition is an exclusive lock, and add function is no lock., Created review board https://reviews.apache.org/r/19736/, Left some comments on RB., New patch that addresses Ashutosh's comments., +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12637249, Committed to 0.13 & trunk., I use DummyTxnManager as the default value of hive.txn.manager. I noticed that the CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION requires a EXCLUSIVE lock while it's writetype is DLL_NO_LOCK in the DummyTxnManager. Maybe it's a good idea to check the DLL's writetype in DummyTxnManager too.]
