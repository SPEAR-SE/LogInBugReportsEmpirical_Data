[Edward,

Could you submit a patch for this?

Thanks,
Prasad, I have started to look into the code. Would the correct patch for this be to trap the error and throw a new exception? Should this be a runtime exception? , I am looking at this. Would the best way to handle this be to extend runtime exception with a custom error class?, Yeah, we should catch if the correct driver doesn't exist. If we start adding clients it might bloat the distribution with jars that not all of users may not need., changing the component to metastore since the bug has morphed into catching non-existent jdbc drivers for the configured in hive-site.xml , derby.jar is now present in lib/ dir. No more NPE.]
