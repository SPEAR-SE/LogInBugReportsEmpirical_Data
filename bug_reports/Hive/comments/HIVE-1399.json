<https://reviews.apache.org/r/2146/#comment5933>

    Need a better error message here since
    
    (a) this validation rule applies to builtin aggregate function such as SUM also (so we should just refer to "aggregate functions" rather than UDAF's)
    
    (b) this error message also shows up if you try to use an aggregate function in the WHERE clause (or anywhere other than SELECT/HAVING)
    
    So either we need to discriminate the two contexts, or else come up with a wording that covers both without causing confusion.

, Other than error message details, patch looks good.
, Hello folks. I think there are more issues. I saw an NPE today on a query which did not have a nested UDAF. I applied the patch and it gave me "not allowed error" . Here is the query : 

{noformat}
select p_id as pid, 
       sum(1) as reqs
from table
where date = 20120110
and (p_id = 15368 or p_id = 15369 or p_id = 15370)
group by p_id, 
       sum(1)
{noformat}

What am I missing here. This should be allowed, no?, My version is 0.8-r2 . Last commit : 0f94fa57d516a8c994dacc1d62c6eab9854f368e, All. This patch looks good. Lets not let this sit over an error message. 

{quote}
Aggregate functions should not be nested and can not be in a clause other than a SELECT or HAVING clause. 
{quote}, I agree. Ed, your error message looks appropriate to me. Can you update the patch with that? After that, please commit the patch if tests pass., Hi Adam,

I haven't seen an update in a while. Do you mind if I take this up?

Brock, Sure, please go ahead., Yes. Please do.

, OK great! I'll have an updated patch shortly. Doesn't look like I have privileges to assign the jira to myself., Hi,

I think we can close this issue and link it to HIVE-2956. HIVE-2956 has resolved this issue.

For example, the below output comes from a trunk build:

{noformat}
hive> select avg(avg(key)) from src;                      
FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10128]: Line 1:11 Not yet supported place for UDAF 'avg'
{noformat}, Fixed via HIVE-2956]
