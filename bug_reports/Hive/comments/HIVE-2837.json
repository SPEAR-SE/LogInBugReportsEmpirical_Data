[maybe add a read only keyword or table property?, I dont want to it table-by-table.
The only other option I can think of is add another configuration variable., Internal tables can have a location as well., If this is to be added it should definitely be configurable, with the default off, since this is a major backwards incompatibility., njain requested code review of "HIVE-2837 [jira] insert into external tables should not be allowed".

  HIVE-2837 By default, the behavior does not change. It is backward compatible

  This is a very risky thing to allow.
  Since, the external tables can point to any user location, which can potentially corrupt some other tables.

, I have added a new parameter: hive.insert.into.external.tables which is true by default.
If you set it to false explicitly, the inserts will fail.

, From looking at this, it seems like it applies to external tables on HDFS as well. Can you please confirm this is correct?
Technically, insert into should be ok for external tables on HDFS (and S3) as well. Seems like a storage file system level thing to specify whether insert into is applied and implement it.

Some context for you:
Historically, there hasn't been any real difference between creating an external table on HDFS vs creating a managed one. However, if we disallow insert into on external tables, that would mean that folks with external tables on HDFS wouldn't be able to make use of insert into functionality even though they should be able to. This would make new tables to be biased towards managed tables but what about the people who already have their entire Hive warehouses based on external tables?, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #54 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/54/])
