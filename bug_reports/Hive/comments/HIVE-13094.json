ATTACHMENT ID: 12789019 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~pxiong], could you take a look?

When we fold the CASE expression _expr1_, if we are left only with a single expression _expr2_, we need to add a cast on top of it; otherwise, if the type of _expr1_ is different than the one of _expr2_, Calcite will throw an error.

This fix will need to be ported to Calcite., +1, pending QA. Thanks.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12789187 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Pushed to master, thanks for reviewing [~pxiong]!, [~jcamachorodriguez], Did this ever get ported to Calcite? Looks as if CALCITE-1502 is similar., [~julianhyde], we verified that issue was fixed by CALCITE-1502 indeed. Once we moved to post Calcite 1.10, the changes introduced by this patch (except the test) were removed, i.e., _HiveRexUtil_ does not exist anymore in the Hive codebase and we rely on Calcite code.]
