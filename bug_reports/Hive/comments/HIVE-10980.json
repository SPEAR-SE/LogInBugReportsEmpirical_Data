ATTACHMENT ID: 12755080 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~gopalv], I have reviewed failed tests:
org.apache.hive.hcatalog.api.TestHCatClient.testTableSchemaPropagation - was failing for many build before my patch
org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver_index_auto_mult_tables_compact - is failing for other patches as well, and I wasn't able to reproduce this failure locally. 

What is the best way to re-run tests?

, [~yalovyyi], you can re-run tests by cancelling the patch (using a button on the top line) and then resubmitting it (using the Submit Patch button that will appear in the same place as the Cancel Patch button)., Thank you!
The patch is re-submitted., +1, Pushed to master. Thanks, [~yalovyyi]]
