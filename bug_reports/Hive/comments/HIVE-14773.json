org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.StatObjectConverter.fillColumnStatisticsData(String, ColumnStatisticsData, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object)
{code}

is missing date column handling., There are several problems.
(1) If we turn on the fetch column stats configuration, MR will have the same problem
(2) This will happen on Tez running ObjectStore. HBaseStore does not support data type yet.
(3) fillColumnStatisticsData is missing  date column handling. And it can not be combined with Long. We should handle it specially.
(4) extrapolation should also support date.
(5) timestamp is ok as we only support its avglen., +1 tests pending.,
