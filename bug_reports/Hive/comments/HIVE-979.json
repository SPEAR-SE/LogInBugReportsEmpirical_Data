[blocker for 0.5, Does something like

{code}
A)
Select Operator
    selectStarNoCompute
B)
Select Operator
   SELECT * (no compute)
{code}

Seem good?, Either one is fine. I would vote for B, but either one is fine, Ran all the tests and it seems like lateral view is the only explain that had a selectStarNoCompute. I did get a heap out of memory error with groupby_bigdata.q, but that shouldn't be related to this change., +1

will commit if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Paul]
