ATTACHMENT ID: 12673469, Update patch to also remove these intermediate exceptions, This might be a little bit of an overkill, but otherwise all this chain will be displayed to the user, https://reviews.apache.org/r/26582/diff/#
[~ashutoshc] can you please review?
The patch:
1) Doesn't print exception when column stats are missing; the column stats missing statement is still printed from the callee.
2) Removes some exception wrapping in Hive.
3) Unwraps some wrapping added by Calcite via reflection.,
