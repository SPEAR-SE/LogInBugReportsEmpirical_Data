[Does HIVE-5728 address your needs, or is that a separate issue?, Yes, it is the same issue but from a non-Hive developer. As such, I do not want to dive into Hive source code and look for appropriate classes and methods. I need two things:
1. Clear documentation with fields, sizes, types, offsets, etc. that allows creation of an ORC file without using Hive code
2. Clear and comprehensive user guide (preferably with usage examples) for any Hive API that can help in creating an ORC file. I can be a tester for such documentation (and any other if it takes reasonable time).
, This is a dangerous approach, as we make no guarantees to keep Orc's structure the same across releases.  For example, the HIVE-5317 work includes significant changes to Orc's file structure.

It would be better to file a jira (or re-purpose this jira) to be: provide simple classes to read and write Orc without forcing you to pull all of Hive's jars into your code.  This is much safer from a forward and backward compatibility viewpoint and something we need to do anyway.  If you are wanting to run outside the JVM this obviously does not help you though., You are correct about creating a new issue for simple classes. 
Still, I believe that maintaining clear documentation for everything (including ORC format) is the correct way.
