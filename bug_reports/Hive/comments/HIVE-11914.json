[this should have a test in TestStreaming which is easier after HIVE-11983 is committed, prelim patch, [~alangates] could you review please, Looks ok, but why is the unit test in TestStreaming?  It seems like it belongs in TestTxnHandler., Partly because the modified code path is part of Streaming API path, but mostly because it there were no other tests that covert heartbeat logic in Streaming API.,
