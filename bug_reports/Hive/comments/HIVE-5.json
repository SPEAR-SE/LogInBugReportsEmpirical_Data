[That link's busted (JIRA included the question mark, a totally valid move). The actual link: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/show-variables.html, I have fixed the wiki to reflect that set does not support extended.

Also I have verified that SET works with the latest version.

Keeping this open for SHOW VARIABLE syntax., do we really need this? 

the current command is modeled after the export shell command. export x=y sets the variable. export with no args prints all the current settings. we are missing an equivalent of export -n (to unset stuff).

if this is not a good model - then we should switch it with something different altogether. , One thing that is quite powerful in the show variable syntax is that ability to use like matching. I do not think that is covered by the SET syntax per se. With show variables we could do

SHOW VARIABLES like '%mapred%'

and that would show the values of all variables which has mapred somewhere in its name., I am going to mark this as invalid for now. Set; does work I believe. I do not think set extended ever did something in open source hive. It you want to re-open or suggest a specific feature that is fine.]
