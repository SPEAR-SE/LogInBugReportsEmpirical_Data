[Packaging of HIVE HWI is currently "jar" , which is not correct and should "war"

Please find attached Patch "HIVE-8214.1.patch" on the same.
, Packaging of HIVE HWI is currently "jar" , which is not correct and should "war"

Please find attached Patch "HIVE-8214.1.patch" on the same.
, Please find update V2 patch with changed assembly., After going through history , It appears that major refactoring have been done in terms of packaging between v0.12.* and v0.13.*.  With this, Hive HWI packaging had been changed from war to jar. and also not incorporated assembly xml.   

I don't know if it was missed or made intensionally.  

Attached "HIVE-8214.2.patch" will resolve the issue.
, This is actually a duplicate of HIVE-7233 where there is a patch already attached to. The problem is that it needs both the jar and war, so just building the war won't be enough. See hwi.sh under bin/ext:
export HWI_JAR_FILE=$(ls ${HIVE_LIB}/hive-hwi-*.jar)
exec $HADOOP jar ${HWI_JAR_FILE} $CLASS $HIVE_OPTS 

The patch in HIVE-7233 builds both the jar and the war.
, We are getting the same issue with hive latest stable version 1.2.1. When staring hwi with default configuration it is giving below error:
{quote}
HIVE_HOME/lib/hive-hwi-*.war: No such file or directory.
{quote}
Any update on this?? Do we need to change any configuration for running hwi?,
