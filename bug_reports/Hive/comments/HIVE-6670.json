[Added patches for both trunk and branch., [~ashahab] Can you add a testcase with your patch? You can use JsonSerDe (in hcatalog jar) to repro this issue in .q file
Also, if you can create ReviewBoard entry for this, that will be great., [~hashutosh] I can write a test case. Is there a similar testcase that I can look at?
I'm not sure how to create a ReviewBoard entry. It'd be great if you can do that once I upload the test.
, Query you posted in description is a good testcase. Just add it in as .q file in ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive/ where all other test queries are. More info at [wiki site | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveDeveloperFAQ#HiveDeveloperFAQ] You can create review request on [review board | https://reviews.apache.org/r/new/] , I tested manually and I am able to repro. Also, with patch it succeeds. Thats, good. 
However, I think instead of passing on cmd line, better to pass it via Conf object using {{hive.added.jars.path}} variable , the way its done in MapRedTask. That way its consistent across two types of task., But I don't want to overwrite existing added jars.

, You need not to. You can append.,
