[An alternative approach is to specify that right in the query:

MAP table.col1, table.col2
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'JSONSerDe'
USING 'python filter.py'
AS x1, x2
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'JSONSerDe'

This makes the syntax for specifying row format the same in map/reduce scripts and in create table statement.
At the same time we will be able to support ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' etc.
, With HIVE-785, we should use RecordReader and RecordWriter together with the JSONSerDe for transforms.]
