ATTACHMENT ID: 12821120 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, +1. Changes look good. 

One question: Do these tests fail in 2.1 release too? The commit seems to be a part of 2.1.0-rc3. If yes, it makes sense to get 2.1.1 out soon. cc [~jcamachorodriguez]

Secondly, can we merge this to branch-2.1 soon? I'm kind of blocked on this for something, Thanks. 



, I will commit to both places. It's a test-only issue though, so I dunno if it should really impact the release plans., Committed to master and branch-2.1]
