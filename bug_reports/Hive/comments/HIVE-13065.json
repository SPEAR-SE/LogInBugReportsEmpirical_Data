[Fix by check null before write separator(key-value) and value. , How about the reading part? If we skip the null values, would it affect the reading part?
And what if we have a null value in key set? This is possible in theory.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12788108 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The failures are not related., [~Yibing], the reading part works fine, in my patch, there is a select query in the test which list the insert results. The null works fine. The "skip null value and its separator" is a way to tell hbase the value is null. 
This jira is only handle null values.
Without any fix, the null key case does not throw exception. But the return value looks strange. For example the map {null, 'value'} becomes {} . I think hive and hbase do not support null key yet. 

, The patch looks good. +1., Committed to master and branch-1
Thanks [~aihuaxu] for reviewing the code. ]
