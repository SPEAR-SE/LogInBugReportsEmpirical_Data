[Removing the jackson-databind and calcite-avatica from the hive distribution did the trick, but have to remove both for some strange reason., This is because calcite has a shaded 2.1.1 version of jackson-databind in it. You can probably remove that from the jar and leave the jackson-databind alone in the hive distro., Hi, i run into the same issue, can not simply remove calcite-avatica jar... i replaced calcite-avatica jar with this one https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/calcite/avatica/avatica/1.7.1/avatica-1.7.1.jar

then it works, but not sure what is the difference between avatica jar and calcite-avatica jar... really very ugly hack here...
