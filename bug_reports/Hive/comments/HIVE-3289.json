bq. I also am not a fan of hive.mapred.mode  If you turn it off, you may unintentionally turn off other checks, and it uses strict/nonstrict instead of true/false which is easier to validate. That's, at best, a problem for another JIRA, though, as it's fairly well established.

I agree with Kevin, but I don't think this should be postponed for another JIRA. Please add a new configuration property now instead of further overloading what is an already ill-defined and poorly documented configuration property.
, Two more points which are tangentially related:

* The patch is not attached to this ticket, and it looks like Phabricator stopped automatically attaching patches some time ago. Is anyone at Facebook looking into fixing this?
* Part of the agreement when we started using Phabricator was that the tool would automatically copy review comments back to JIRA. This feature hasn't worked in months, and unless it starts working soon I think we should stop using Phabricator and switch back to ReviewBoard. Is anyone looking into fixing this? If not we should probably just switch back now., https://reviews.facebook.net/D4377

Added a new conf. parameter, I think, the discussion to use phabricator/review board/patch should be done on the dev mailing list, instead of this jira., Regarding the diff, I'm +1 on it, Carl?, +1. Thanks for making these changes.
