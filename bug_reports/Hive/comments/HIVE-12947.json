[Can you elaborate on the root cause? As such, the patch looks good, +1 pending tests, Added more description on the cause of the issue. I guess my question to you is that is it okay to clear the cache of all the keys in case of SMB? Is there any assumption on the reuse of cache by a different task (that is not doing the join)?, Actually, that's a good point. I didn't realize that was THE cache. It will prevent plan reuse from working completely, as far as I can tell, maybe other things. "we try to reconnect the work items and fail." - why does it fail specifically, does it get a wrong item from cache? Is plan modified in the container?, It is the latter, the plan is modified in the container. It looks like we need to detect that the modification of the plan has already occurred in case of retrieving from cache and not try to re-modify the plan. Alternatively, I could just clear the specific work items from the cache in the same way we put this in the cache.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12784748 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Would it be possible to not cache the plan under these conditions, or avoid modifying it, rather than nuking the entire cache? The assumption behind plan cache is that plan should not be modified., Instead of clearing the cache, I changed it such that we detect that the plan is already modified and just use the cached plan., +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12785251 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, smb_cache test probably failed due to one of the recent CBO-related changes (user-level explain, strict mode or removal of the strict check), it just needs an update before commit. TestHBaseAggrStatsCacheIntegration needs to be checked locally..., The Hbase test passes locally:

Running org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.hbase.TestHBaseAggrStatsCacheIntegration
Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 109.936 sec - in org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.hbase.TestHBaseAggrStatsCacheIntegration

I just updated the results for the smb_cache tests., Not committing to branch-1?]
