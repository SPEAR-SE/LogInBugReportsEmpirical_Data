[Is it the right patch?  It looks like this is adding dependency to distcp, so how will it solve the issue?, Incorrect patch., Thanks [~szehon]. 
I submit the correct patch., Thanks Sergio.  It looks ok to me, only comment is that old tables need to be re-created, which might warrant a release note.

Also, some old version of mysql before 5.0.3 doesn't seem to support varchar beyond 255, not sure if its a concern.  [~brocknoland] do you happen to know?  Thanks, That's a pretty old database and will be older when we release 0.15. I think we should move ahead..., Sounds good.  Another thought came to mind, what do you guys think about rename the table to v3?   I saw it was done for a schema change in HIVE-2471 awhile back.

That way, users dont have to manually drop the table/schema, and we can just in release notes doc to say that you can delete v2.  Just wanted to bring it up, not sure what you guys think.  Thanks.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12679872 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, thanks., HIVE-8735 is also addressing the same problem. Usually the client which publishes provides the key (FSOperator, StatsTask) has some logic to trim down the length of the key using MD5 hash. If the key gets greater than max stats key prefix (from hive config), Utilities.getHashedPrefixKey() method is invoked to get a smaller length key. Can you try with the patch from HIVE-8735 to see if the test case works? HIVE-8735 truncates the key before publishing., That patch works well [~prasanth_j].

We can use the one from HIVE-8735 instead., Thanks [~spena] for confirming! I will close this issue as duplicate of HIVE-8735.]
