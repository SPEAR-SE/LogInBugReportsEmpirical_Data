[[~epaliwal]: try disabling the console update configs - {{hive --hiveconf hive.tez.exec.inplace.progress=false}};, Gopal V :
Hello Sir,
I tried doing that as mentioned by you but gives me error
"Missing Hive CLI JAR"
but I make sure this is not from the HIVE file because I tested it with the help of echo. I am not sure where this message is coming from. What should I do?, Please help me sir., The jansi library is dependent upon MSFT Visual C++ 2008 Runtime Executables.

"Windows XP Users: The JNI library that JANSI uses depends on the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable" You can get a free copy from MS at:

source: https://github.com/fusesource/jansi

If this is the only thing driving the requirement of this library, perhaps a workaround should be considered., [~epaliwal] What resolved this for me was making sure I had the right version of jline in the classpath (2.12)., Thank you Shawn for replying. So do I need to download latest jline library from http://jline.sourceforge.net/ ?, It's also in Maven.
