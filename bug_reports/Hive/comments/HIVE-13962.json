[[~jcamachorodriguez] [~pxiong] can you take a look? Started happening recently. , Apparently this was broken by HIVE-13903. To reproduce, taken from {{create_func1.q}}:

{noformat}
describe function extended qtest_get_java_boolean;
{noformat}

After HIVE-13903 went in:

{noformat}
PREHOOK: query: describe function extended qtest_get_java_boolean
PREHOOK: type: DESCFUNCTION
POSTHOOK: query: describe function extended qtest_get_java_boolean
POSTHOOK: type: DESCFUNCTION
Function 'qtest_get_java_boolean' does not exist.
{noformat}

Apparently the UDF does not appear as registered, but it should. Before HIVE-13903 went in:

{noformat}
PREHOOK: query: describe function extended qtest_get_java_boolean
PREHOOK: type: DESCFUNCTION
POSTHOOK: query: describe function extended qtest_get_java_boolean
POSTHOOK: type: DESCFUNCTION
qtest_get_java_boolean(str) - GenericUDF to return native Java's boolean type
Synonyms: default.qtest_get_java_boolean
{noformat}

[~prongs], could you take a look?, I am going to close this one as Invalid, and revert and reopen HIVE-13903, as the regression needs to be further studied before that code can go in. Thanks]
