[[~gopalv] Can you take a look?, Hi [~prasanth_j],
Can we use {noformat}((Number)literal).longValue(){noformat} directly instead of {noformat}Long.valueOf(((Number) o).longValue()){noformat}?
And it would be great to add some unit tests to get rid of regression. Thank you!, Removed the explicit boxing. [~Ferd] Its a performance regression. There is no issue with functionality., Thank you for your update. LGTM for the new patch.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12708803 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~prasanth_j]: Patch fixes the performance regression, so +1 once the tests run successfully (the smb_mapjoin seems to be a flaky run).

I still see the list re-allocations at runtime for the ArrayList<>, which needs to be a follow-up JIRA. Can you file one which targets refactoring the PPD planning layers?

We need to normalize types during predicate construction, so that a user can get a warning during an "EXPLAIN" query that PPD is turned off - particularly because the IN() clause is intended to be a type-safe list., Committed to trunk. Thanks for the review [~Ferd] and [~gopalv]!, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
