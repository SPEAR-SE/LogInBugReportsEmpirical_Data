[Can you also try MySQL? decimal(6,6) can store a data range of 0.000000 to 0.999999 (-/+). 0 has a precision/scale (1,0). Looks like 0 is a special case, and maybe 0 should be cast to .000000., mysql> select cast(0 as DECIMAL(6,6)) f1;
+----------+
| f1       |
+----------+
| 0.000000 |
+----------+
, Also happens in version 0.13.0, see bug HIVE-8592, which was resolved as it was a duplicate of this one., Looks like this is the same issue as HIVE-11835]
