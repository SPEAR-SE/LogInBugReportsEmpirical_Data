[The issue is caused by HIVE-12187, and it is fixed by 
HIVE-12556 : Ctrl-C in beeline doesn't kill Tez query on HS2 
For MR, only the fix in Driver.java is needed:
+      try {
+        releaseResources();
+      } catch (Exception e) {
+        LOG.info("Exception while releasing resources", e);
+      }

The releaseResources will call driverCxt.shutdown(); The shutdown will close the task. ]
