[[~sseth]: any logs from the LLAP side - the auto-auth is configured exactly the same way the HS2 web UI is configured., I don't have logs at DEBUG level, will try generating them the next time I have a secure cluster.

I did a quick scan of the code, and it seems to be identical to HS2 handling. HS2 does not have this enabled by default - so I wasn't able to test that out. I suspect that will not work either when secured.

At info level, these are the only relevant logs. The UI shows the same thing. This was after logging in with the same user as the one running llap.
