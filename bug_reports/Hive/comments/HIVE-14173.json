[[~ctang.ma] are you taking a look? I can take a look if needed, MetaStoreDirectSql is not initialized at the beginning when hive.metastore.try.direct.sql is disabled. But when it is enabled in the middle of the session via set metaconf, we should ensure that it has been initialized in GetHelper before it is used., [~sershe], [~spena] could you review the patch. Thanks., Just one issue - it's not threadsafe., Actually, nm, looks like we have ObjectStore per thread. Sigh..., +1 pending tests, Resubmit the patch to kick off the precommit build,
