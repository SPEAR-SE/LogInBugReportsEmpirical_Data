ATTACHMENT ID: 12765204 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 pending on test., The test failures are not related., Look at the patch again and it seems that it handles the case where the remote spark client is in a bad state when trying to submit a spark job. This is good. However, it's unclear that what's going to happen when either getDefaultParallelism() or getExecutorCount() is called in such a situation. Also even in case that exectue() is called, the remote client can become bad right after the isActive() check.

Therefore, I think we need to define a scope for this JIRA. If we want to be resilient to the connection loss, then we need to consider more cases and the way to handle it. However, it's also acceptable in my opinion that we can detect the error and ask user to log out and log in again to get a valid session. The latter seems simpler and easier., For getDefaultParallelism() and getExecutorCount(), connection drop doesn't break the query. We log a warning in this case. That's why I didn't touch them.

Right, the remote client can become bad right after the isActive() check. User will get an exception in this case. We can enhance the error message and ask the user to re-try the query, which should be more convenient than logging out and in again., Discussed it with Xuefu, added patch v2 that changed the exception message to ask the user to re-try., +1 to the latest patch.,
