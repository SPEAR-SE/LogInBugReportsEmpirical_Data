[Patch which should fix this.

1. It changes a 'aborted && interrupted' check to just say 'aborted'
2. It changes completeInitialization - to do a future.get with a timeout, and check the abort status between these waits.

cc [~prasanth_j], [~sershe], Left some comments in RB, Updated patch with review comments addressed., Looks like RB went down when I was commenting. Adding the comments here
1) CancellationException seems to be not caught. Is it not expected?
2) I think we can remove the TODO for throwing HiveException and replace it with InterruptedException. IIRC throwing InterruptedException will also clear the interrupt status flag, so the Thread.interrupted() call is also not required. TezProcessor anyways catches Throwable, so it should be safe to throw InterruptedException., Updated patch with comments addressed.

Throwing an InterruptedException does not clear the InterruptStatus (-catching it probably does-. Don't think catching it does anything either.). Going by most recommendations - I've removed the code to clear the interrupt status. Also, propagating InterruptedException all the way out of the Hive processor., LGMT, +1. Pending tests, [~sseth], what is the status on this one? I plan to create the first 2.1.0 RC tomorrow and this is marked as Critical. Should it go in and can it be deferred? Thanks, [~jcamachorodriguez] - this is pending a jenkins run - which is next in line. If it comes back clean, I'll commit it.
I would ideally like to include it in 2.1 - given that preemption in LLAP can run into issues without this. If you're creating the RC tomorrow - I guess it gets documented as a known issue and will get fixed in 2.1.1 or 2.2,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12806662 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, The test failures are unrelated. This particular run took over 4 hours compared to other runs which take 2 hours. However, from the logs it looks like the mvn build started at 23:00, and the test run completed at 01:19 - which is a 2h20m and consistent with other runs. Looks to be a delay in the run actually starting.
