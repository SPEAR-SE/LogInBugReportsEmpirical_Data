[[~hsubramaniyan] Any update on this one?, [~ashutoshc] This is a low priority issue since as per the discussion last week, you wanted to :
1. Move the TestPerfCliDriver to TestMiniTezCliDriver 
2. Move from derby to hbase metastore (as part of point 1).

I will create a new jira for the above points when I start working on it and mark this as unassigned for now since this issue can be worked around by hive.metastore.fastpath=false (which is by default).

Thanks, [~daijy] , [~sershe] Can you guys comment where {{hive.metastore.fastpath=true}} is incompatible with ObjectStore(RDBMS) backed metastore? , cc [~alangates], I think he added the fast path. IIRC it's compatible with ObjectStore, it's not compatible with either remote metastore or local metastore, I don't recall, From the code, fastpath is not compatible with remote metastore. It can only be used in local metastore. I am sure sure about the reason. [~alangates], do you see any issue skipping retry in remote metastore?, Then we must throw better exception than what we have today. Current error message of "Deadine is not registered" in such scenario will confuse users and devs and doesn't provide any hint on what actual problem (and potential fix) is., The fastpath is not compatible with the remote metastore because it makes some assumptions about shared ownership of the thrift objects that are only true when the hbase metastore is in use and there is no thrift metastore server.

AFAIK this was never tested with ObjectStore (only HBaseStore) and shouldn't be used with it.]
