[RB https://reviews.apache.org/r/26427/, Doesn't this disable it whenever indexes are enabled at all? They are not necessarily present. So if someone turns this on it will turn CBO completely off, [~hagleitn] could you please take a look at [~sershe]'s comments and let me know if my understanding is wrong?, [~pxiong] Sergey is right. This way you'll disable CBO whenever someone turns on the index optimization. That works, but is a blunt way of handling it. I've looked at the code a little bit. Since you can't tell from the semantic analyzer if any indices qualify, they only other way to handle this is to find out why CBO and index optimizer actually conflict and then address that.

Can you share the testcase/result on this ticket that shows the conflict?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12673462, In this patch, 

(1) index is enabled for the following test cases in CliDriver: alter_concatenate_indexed_table.q,alter_index.q,authorization_index.q,drop_index_removes_partition_dirs.q,index_auth.q,index_auto.q,index_auto_empty.q,index_auto_file_format.q,index_auto_mult_tables.q,index_auto_mult_tables_compact.q,index_auto_multiple.q,index_auto_multipleX.q,index_auto_partitioned.q,index_auto_self_join.q,index_auto_unused.q,index_auto_update.q,index_bitmap.q,index_bitmap1.q,index_bitmap2.q,index_bitmap3.q,index_bitmap_auto.q,index_bitmap_auto_partitioned.q,index_bitmap_compression.q,index_bitmap_rc.q,index_compact.q,index_compact_1.q,index_compact_2.q,index_compact_3.q,index_compact_binary_search.q,index_compression.q,index_creation.q,index_serde.q,index_stale.q,index_stale_partitioned.q,show_indexes_edge_cases.q,show_indexes_syntax.q,udf_index.q

(2) the "fetch.task.conversion" optimization is disabled for index_auto_partitioned.q and index_bitmap_auto_partitioned.q because it will block index optimizer.

(3) And, index is enabled for ql_rewrite_gbtoidx.q in TestMinimrCliDriver, I think we may change the title to "Enable index when CBO are used"....., +1, Will commit after HiveQA,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12674571, is set_hiveconf_validation2 related?, Yes, it is related. I am fixing it right now., address test failures , committed to trunk [~vikram.dixit] ok for 0.14?, Doc note:  This adds the value "none" to configuration parameter *hive.fetch.task.conversion* so the wiki needs to be updated (with version information):

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.fetch.task.conversion | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.fetch.task.conversion]

(TODOC## label to follow, pending decision about 0.14.), +1 for 0.14, [~leftylev], thank you for your comments. I will try to address your concern after I get the permission to write. :), [~pxiong], I don't see a request for wiki edit access on the user@hive mailing list yet.  You just need to send your Confluence username:

* [About This Wiki -- How to get permission to edit | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AboutThisWiki#AboutThisWiki-Howtogetpermissiontoedit]

This is such a simple fix, I could do it for you.  But you'll probably need wiki edit access in the future, so you might as well get it now., Done. Thanks [~leftylev] , committed to 14, Doc note:  Removed the TODOC14 label now that the "none" value of *hive.fetch.task.conversion* is documented in the wiki (thanks, [~pxiong]):

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.fetch.task.conversion | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.fetch.task.conversion], Hi. After the recent run in HIVE-8395, it looks like most of the tests stopped using indexes again. They worked correctly when I was preparing the updated patch for that run., True. Previously, for example, 
we have predicate: ((UDFToDouble(key) > UDFToDouble(80)) and (UDFToDouble(key) < UDFToDouble(100))), 
now we have predicate: ((UDFToDouble(key) > 80.0) and (UDFToDouble(key) < 100.0))
This makes it not work. I will generate a patch soon., Left a comment in RB. Can you attach patch to JIRA so HiveQA would run?, HIVE-8510 tracks the update, er, HIVE-8501, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
