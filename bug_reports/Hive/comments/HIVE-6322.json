[+1 pending test, Well, it's interesting. The test result didn't reflect the error. BTW, HIVE-6310 didn't attempt to fix what is described here., HIVE-6310 cover this problem by changing the expected output file to the wrong result. This should be the right fix., Looks like precommit test never ran, uploading patch again.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12625971, I doubt the failure in root_dir_external_table.q is related is related to the changes in this patch., Was about to commit this but had to update the diffs, as there are new pre/post hooks in the qfile output due to some of the auth changes. Patch v3 has the new qfile output changes.  I'll go ahead and commit if there are no objections., Committed to trunk., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
