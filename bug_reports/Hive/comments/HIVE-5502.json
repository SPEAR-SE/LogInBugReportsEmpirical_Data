[Attached is the output of a failed and passing test., [~brocknoland] I think this is because of the difference in JVM heap size. More JVM heap size will generate lesser number of stripes and hence the file dump information will be less. Can you please try using the same heap size (probably with same ANT_OPTS and MAVEN_OPTS) and see if this issue happens again?, Hey [~prasanth_j] this is generated by running the test twice in a row in the exact same environment. Meaning I executed these exact commands in succession:

{noformat}
$ rm -rf /tmp/fail; mkdir /tmp/fail; while mvn -o clean test -Dtest=TestFileDump; do ls -l target/tmp/TestFileDump.testDump.orc;done; cp -R target/* /tmp/fail
$ rm -rf /tmp/pass; mkdir /tmp/pass; while ! mvn -o clean test -Dtest=TestFileDump; do ls -l target/tmp/TestFileDump.testDump.orc;done; cp -R target/* /tmp/pass
{noformat}

to generate my data and and the failures. Note however the above commands won't work on the maven branch since I am working on a patch to fix the branch post vectorization., Hi [~brocknoland].. seems like the test case failure is not related to the file size of TestFileDump.testDump.orc file.. TestFileDump unit test file contains two test cases ( testDump() and testDictionaryThreshold() ). These two test cases creates an ORC file with the same name (look for testFilePath variable initialization in openFileSystem()). This should be fixed to write to two different files which is based on the test case function name. 
I think the reason for seeing 2 different file size in your case is the passing test case contains the output of testDictionaryThreshold() whereas failing test case contains the output of testDump(). But the file size of TestFileDump.testDump.orc is not really important for these test cases. Its the contents of orc-file-dump.out file that is more important. Doing a diff of generated orc-file-dump.out vs golden file shows that 1st strip expects 5000 rows but it got only 4000 rows. This is the reason for test case failure. I faced similar non-determinism when I run the test case from eclipse vs from console. From console I always get the correct result but when I try to run the test case from eclipse it fails all the time with the same issue (4000 rows vs 5000 rows). The golden file in this case might have been generated by running "ant test -Dtestcase=TestFileDump". Since now you are testing using maven there might be some difference in ANT_OPTS vs MAVEN_OPTS. Thats my guess.

Moving forward there are two ways this can be fixed
1) Implement a deterministic memory manager that doesn't depend on the available memory for ORC test cases
2) Overwrite golden file when we move to maven, Gotcha. Thanks for taking a look.

OK these two together make sense as I was seeing the failures under maven with the exact same M2_OPTS.  I suppose it's possible that that some no M2_OPTS cause non-determinism and my current ANT_OPTS do not.

bq. Overwrite golden file when we move to maven

I am not sure this will work since we cannot control. M2_OPTS on developers machines.
