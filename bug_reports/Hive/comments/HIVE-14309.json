[Since hive used to be the only place to pick up orc it seems a bad idea to change package names of released versions. Why can't you move the class names out of the way in a new ORC release? As you say from 2.2+ this shouldn't be an issue anyways., The names in org.apache.orc were internal names that were created as part of the split from Hive. The users of Hive still use the traditional package name of org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc. I shouldn't have put any of the classes into the org.apache.orc package until ORC was ready to release them, but I screwed up. I've looked through the source code for Spark, Storm, Flume, Pig, and Oozie and no one is using the org.apache.orc classes and they using the original org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc class names. 

Unfortunately, Hive's users now can't use both the current ORC library and Hive 2.0.1 or Hive 2.1.0. That really sucks and will cause a lot of problems down stream. By just renaming the packages to org.apache.hive.orc, we won't change the functionality and the two versions of ORC will live side by side.

While the org.apache.orc package is an implementation detail from Hive's point of view, it is the primary API for ORC. So no, moving the package in ORC doesn't make sense., I've looked at the classes that would be impacted. If I'm not mistaken you're talking about 100 classes which are pretty much all of ORC. 70 of those are non-test classes. Since hive used to be until very recently the only source of orc I also don't see a way to guarantee that no one else is using these classes and wouldn't be affected by changing this on released lines going back over 6 months.

I also get that you don't want to change those in ORC upstream now. That would mean you have to move a lot of stuff out of the way.

As a consequence I think the best thing to do is nothing for 2.0 and 2.1. If someone wants to use ORC with hive on the classpath in those versions they should probably just use the hive classes. Starting with hive 2.2 they will be able to switch to ORC proper. If they absolutely must suck in the new ORC project they should probably shade it in their code for the time being. That also will get them over the hump.

, I've had multiple users complain about this now. :(

Managing classpaths is *really* error-prone in a lot of different contexts.

None of the solutions are great, but this one makes it very clear what happened. We move all of classes that hive publishes out of org.apache.orc to orc.apache.hive.orc., I'm moving this JIRA out of 2.1.1 release as it is not a blocker nor critical for a 2.1.1 RC version. Feel free to commit it to branch 2.1 if the patch is ready before the release., I've found a way to use hive-storage 2.2.1 and orc-core 1.3.3 to work with hive 2.1. , GitHub user omalley opened a pull request:

    HIVE-14309. Shade the contents of the hive-orc jar to be in org.apache.hive.orc.

----
, Ok, this pull request https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/191 does:
* rename the packages in hive-orc to org.apache.hive.orc
* updates the references to the moved packages from other modules

No clients use org.apache.hive:hive-orc so this just makes the classes internal to hive where they don't conflict if clients use both the hive and orc jars. In hive 2.3 and later, this is unnecessary because hive uses the orc project's artifacts., +1, as long as this is applied only to the 2.2 branch.  As it just changes import statements it seems ok. 

It would be good to put a detailed comment in the orc/pom.xml explaining how this works now, as anyone who has to maintain this later is going to be seriously confused as to why the files have imports for org.apache.hive.orc yet the files list their packages as org.apache.orc.

, [~owen.omalley], you committed this to branch-2.2 on May 31, so please update the status and fix version.

See commit fd1188a6a79c6da868d463c1e5db50c017c3b1a2.
