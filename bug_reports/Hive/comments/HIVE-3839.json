, [~ashutoshc] and [~thejas] this caused me some grief on Mac OS X when cloning the hive git repo on Mac OS X. I believe it's due to some files in the hive repo that already contain CRLF that weren't normalized. I created HIVE-3858 and submitted a patch there. It's a fairly cosmetic change. Can you please take a look and comment?, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #54 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/54/])
