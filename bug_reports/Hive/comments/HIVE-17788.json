[Hi [~alangates] I noticed this [comment|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/standalone-metastore/metastore-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java#L480] which mentions this JIRA.

// Now, we need to look for any values that the user set that MetastoreConf doesn't know about.
// TODO Commenting this out for now, as it breaks because the conf values aren't getting properly
// interpolated in case of variables. See HIVE-17788.
/*
for (Map.Entry<String, String> e : conf) {
 if (e.getKey().startsWith("datanucleus.") || e.getKey().startsWith("javax.jdo.")) {
 // We have to handle this differently depending on whether it is a value known to
 // MetastoreConf or not. If it is, we need to get the default value if a value isn't
 // provided. If not, we just set whatever the user has set.
 Object prevVal = prop.setProperty(e.getKey(), e.getValue());
 if (LOG.isDebugEnabled() && MetastoreConf.isPrintable(e.getKey())) {
 LOG.debug("Overriding " + e.getKey() + " value " + prevVal
 + " from jpox.properties with " + e.getValue());
 }
 }
}
*/

It looks like by commenting out the above for loop we would be breaking HIVE-6990 Any plans on fixing this? Let me know if you need any help from my side. Is it enough to duplicate {{HiveConf.getConfSystemProperties}} method in MetaStoreConf to re-enable this?
