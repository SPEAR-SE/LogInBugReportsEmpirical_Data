[Hi Tariq,

I am not able to reproduce this issue on trunk or 0.11:

select sum(viewtime) , sum(distinct userid) from hive_npe order by 1 asc
POSTHOOK: type: QUERY
POSTHOOK: Input: default@hive_npe
#### A masked pattern was here ####
NULL  NULL

I ran it as a unit test. It may be something to do with your configurations. Are you aware of any specific non-default configuration you might be using?, {noformat}
select sum(viewtime) , sum(distinct userid) from hive_npe order by 1 asc
POSTHOOK: type: QUERY
POSTHOOK: Input: default@hive_npe
#### A masked pattern was here ####
NULL  NULL
{noformat}, It would be great if you could post the error/stack trace as well., I was using a version of hive in which this was not fixed. I got the latest version and see that it is fixed now.

We are working on a UI for hive administrators and I think i connected using a different driver. You can see it here: http://www.aquafold.com/dbspecific/apache_hive_client.html

Apologize for the late response]
