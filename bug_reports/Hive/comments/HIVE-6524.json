 Stripes:
-  Stripe: offset: 3 data: 102311 rows: 4000 tail: 68 index: 224
+  Stripe: offset: 3 data: 144733 rows: 5000 tail: 68 index: 235
{code}

And everything else changes because of the first stripe being 5k rows.

A previous 21k orc writer was causing a leak into the next file, which ended up with 4k rows for 1st stream instead of the full 5k., LGTM. +1 (non-binding), Committed to branch. Thanks Gopal!]
