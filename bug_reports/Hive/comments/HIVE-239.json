[previous patch was relative ql instead of hive/trunk, Looks fine to me.

The error message though has a misspelling for column...

Can you fix that. I will check it in once that is done..., fixed the spelling mistake, +1, some of the tests failed due to the change in the error message. Can you recapture and upload a new patch.
, updated two test outputs to match the incorrect spelling, committed. Thanks Prasad!!]
