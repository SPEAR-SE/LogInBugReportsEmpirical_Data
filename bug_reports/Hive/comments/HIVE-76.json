[The following test case leads to the error:

CREATE TABLE dest1(key1 INT, value1 STRING, key2 INT, value2 STRING) STORED AS TEXTFILE;

FROM src src1 JOIN src src2 ON (src1.key = src2.key)
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest1 SELECT src1.*, src2.*;

where src has two columns (key INT, value STRING)

In this situation we should not be getting a column mismatch error as the destination has 4 columns and SELECT src1.*, src2.* also should
have 4 columns. However, due to a bug in SemanticAnalyzer we add all the columns in the select list to the row resolver as many times as an
expression of the form alias.* appears.

As a result it is impossible to insert into a destination table. A workaround is to enumerate all the columns and not use alias.* in the select list
with joins when inserting the results into a table., Fix for the bug and test case., submitted patch., can you add a select also in join10.q.
I mean select without the explain also, like all other tests, New patch which also fixes join10.q

Note that join10.q was already broken before., +1, I just committed this. Thanks Ashish!]
