ATTACHMENT ID: 12839946 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, failed UTs are not related?, hi [~prasanth_j] could you please commit it to master?
failed cases are not related
i found that some cases fail in master without commits. And someone had reported on JIRA, Yes. All the test failures are flaky and are tracked under HIVE-15058. Committed patch to master. Thanks [~ferhui] for the contribution!, thanks]
