[I will take a look., There are 2 things that make these tests failed: 
1) the recent change of default file format from HiveInputFormat to CombineHiveInputFormat makes the merge job submission fail. The current mini HDFS implementation used in minimr doesn't support CombineFileInputFormat. 

2) even though I changed to input format to HiveInputFormat and make the merge using a mapreduce job rather than map-only job, it still failed because of a bug that exist in that code path. HIVE-1980 was filed for that.

For now we should remove merge_dynamic_partition[23].q from minimr.query.files since otherwise they won't be tested in regular TestCliDriver. I will add the equivalent test cases to minimr test in HIVE-1980., +1.  Will commit.
, Committed.  Thanks Ning!
