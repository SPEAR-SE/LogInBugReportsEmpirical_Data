[[~sushanth] Maybe you also want to update that page as well., FWIW, I think the software we used to update the website went out of service by Apache so I am not sure how this is done anymore., Dmitry's update worked a month ago (HIVE-11584, svn commit r1696694).  Has something changed since then?, Don't think so, I could be wrong :), Somehow the bookmarklet does not work anymore. The editor page brought up by ASF CMS (the link from https://cms.apache.org/hive/) does not have the changes from last a few commits, and does not match what we see on the production page. , [~Ferd] Please review the patch and it is same as that I posted in HIVE-10718. Thanks., Hi [~ctang.ma], Could you add [~lars_francke] to the committer list and move [~sushanth] to the PMC list as well?, [~lars_francke] Could you provide your information?, Thanks! Sure:
