[I suspect this problem was introduced by HIVE-6888 - if one of the Driver instances calls CombineHiveInputFormat.getSplits() (and thus HiveInputFormat.getSplits()), the global Utilities.gWorkMap is cleared out, which not only removes the map/reduce work for that query, but for any other queries that are being executed by other threads. If any of these other threads tries to call getSplits(), gWorkMap will no longer have the map/reduce work cached, and the current logic doesn't look like it allows the client to be able to get the plan if it's not already cached.
Possible fixes might be
1) getSplits() should only remove the map/reduce work for the current query, rather than remove all cached work.
2) Utilities.getBaseWork() should be modified to allow the map/reduce work to be loaded if it is not already cached., Patch to prevent getSplits() from removing cached plans from other queries. Talked to Gunther and he said he can eliminate the call to clear the cached plan from getSplits() altogether, so this may not be the final fix., Thanks [~jdere]. My plan was to do this purely in HiveSplitGen for Tez. But I think Vikram re-introduced a path that doesn't go through HiveSplitGen (rather - I broke something, he fixed it by adding that path back in). [~vikram.dixit] - can you confirm that?

If that's the case the patch you uploaded is probably the best fix.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12650358, [~hagleitn][~vikram.dixit] does this fix look ok?, +1, [~hagleitn] In case of bucket map joins in tez, the getSplits is not going to take the SplitGenerator path as in case of other hive queries. We will still need this path for cleaning up.

[~jdere] As discussed offline, there is another method already in this class that takes a configuration and cleans up cache and plans on HDFS. However, we should not be clearing up the plans on hdfs until the query has completed. You will need a new method for this partial clean up.

Thanks
Vikram., Thanks for the info Vikram. It sounds like the current patch will be fine then, as it adds a new method to clean up the work map entry without removing the plan file from HDFS., Minor comment. Can you refactor the code used in the method clearWork in the Utilities class to use your method instead., Attaching patch to address comments by [~vikram.dixit].
Additionally, it appears that Utilities.clearWork() has a bug where it will not do any cache or hdfs cleanup if either the map or reduce plan path is null.  The updated patch includes a fix for this. , +1 LGTM. Good catch there Jason.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12650673, I've seen several of these tests failing on previous tests. Ran MiniTez dynpart_sort_optimization.q, TestHCatLoader#testReadDataPrimitiveTypes, TestHiveServer2 locally and these pass for me. Will commit this patch shortly., Committed to trunk. Thanks Gunther/Vikram for the review., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
