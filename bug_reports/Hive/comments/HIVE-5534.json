[Poking more seems like this a problem with all hcatalog scripts so starting hcatalog server is affected as well:
{code}
-rw-r--r--  1 mgrover  staff   2048 Oct  9 18:50 ./hcatalog/share/hcatalog/scripts/hcat_server_stop.sh
-rw-r--r--  1 mgrover  staff   3003 Oct  9 18:50 ./hcatalog/share/hcatalog/scripts/hcat_server_start.sh
-rw-r--r--  1 mgrover  staff   4698 Oct  9 18:50 ./hcatalog/share/hcatalog/scripts/hcat_server_install.sh
-rw-r--r--  1 mgrover  staff   7141 Oct  9 18:50 ./hcatalog/sbin/webhcat_server.sh
-rw-r--r--  1 mgrover  staff   4243 Oct  9 18:50 ./hcatalog/sbin/webhcat_config.sh
-rw-r--r--  1 mgrover  staff  10013 Oct  9 18:50 ./hcatalog/sbin/update-hcatalog-env.sh
-rw-r--r--  1 mgrover  staff   4540 Oct  9 18:50 ./hcatalog/sbin/hcat_server.sh
-rw-r--r--  1 mgrover  staff   2543 Oct  9 18:50 ./hcatalog/libexec/hcat-config.sh
{code}

I update the title of the JIRA to reflect the above., Looks like the same issue as in HIVE-4559.  On trunk at least the 'x' bit is set as appropriate after 'ant package', This looks like a problem with the "tar" target in build.xml. It is setting the permissions again and ignores existing permissions of the files .
, Removing fix version of 0.12 as part of the 0.12 release process. The fix version will set when the patch is committed .]
