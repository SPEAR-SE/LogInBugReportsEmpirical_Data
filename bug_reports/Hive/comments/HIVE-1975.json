[Any update on this particular issue? 

I am trying to do the same but using s3 storage and it seems hive can only create one new directory and not a full structure. Is this a limitation? , Are you asking if hive can export a partitioned table to a flat directory? please include more details in your report. Such as describe extended dept_j;, what's the use case here?  the user can always first create the parent dir. But users misspell the dir name, they may not want the dirs created. Or worse, the data got loaded to some other place they not noticed., Use case is if we want to insert into multilevel directory like '/HIVEFT25686/chinna/'
(insert overwrite directory '/HIVEFT25686/chinna/' select * from dept_j) this is failing because  "fs.rename(sourcePath, targetPath)" is failing rename to multilevel directories, so first created the target path.

>> But users misspell the dir name, they may not want the dirs created.Or worse, the data got loaded to some other place they not noticed.

This one will happen in the normal scenario also  what ever the location user specifies it will move the data to that location.

But as u said if the rename operation fails it should delete the created directory. I will update the patch with this case. ,

, Some minor comments:

1. Can you add a testcase  - use build as a temporary directory to add data ?
2. Add some comments explaining that the multi-level directory move is not atomic.
   In your example, it is possible that /x/y/z/1/2/3 is created, but /x/y/z/1/2/4.
   It is same as any multi-partition insert (dynamic insert), but would be good to 
   explicitly call it out.
, it is good to add a conf for this, and by default disable it., Addressed  Namit & He Yongqiang comments,

, Hey Guys,

I'm using hive 0.11.0 and I just verified that I'm facing this exact problem.

I first tried to ask hive to create a multilevel path and I got: "return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.MoveTask" 

When I switched to using a simple one level directory, my query succeded and I could seem my data written out.

Can anyone else corroborate?

Thanks!]
