[The issue is in FetchOperator not understanding that it needs to read ACID compliant directories recursively., This patch fixes FetchOperator to always read files recursively if the directory is in ACID format.

This steals some code from HIVE-7812, since I needed the new AcidUtils.isAcid method that was added in that patch.  If that patch is committed before this one this patch will need to be rebased.,
