[https://reviews.facebook.net/D4575, While executing in local mode, the process to collect failed job information is a different process from running local MR job. Each process reads a different log4j property file. One points to hive.log and another is MR job log.
No communication on 2 processes yet on job log. There are some ways like external files etc.
Consider the bug impact itself (log file location), easy way is to pass MR job stream and pick up log file location and output in CLI stream., +1
