[Random with no args is seeded by current time in millis, so when run from two different JVM's there's still a tiny chance that we can end up with the same query ID.  If we want to avoid that, we can use UUID instead:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html

But if we only care about uniqueness within the same JVM, then +1.
, +1 for using UUIDs
, It seems like this JIRA is partly duplicate what HIVE-1019 is trying to do. HIVE-1019 patch also uses UUID as the job ID to name the HIVE_PLAN file. But based on Zheng's comment, it will disable the resumability of failed jobs. 

Namit, can you take a look at the patch in HIVE-1019 particularly the newly added unit test and see if your patch passes?, I am trying to do something simple.

For the audit logs generated inside facebook, I wont to log a unique queryId - so that different map-reduce jobs can be co-related.
I will switch to UUIDs, but it should not affect anything, added UUID, +1.  Will commit if tests pass.
, Committed. Thanks Namit and John!
