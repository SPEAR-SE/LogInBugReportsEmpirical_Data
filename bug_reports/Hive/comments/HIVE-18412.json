[[~bbonnet] do you have repro query?, Hi [~ekoifman], 
in our use case, we have 2 tables : a raw table named "raw_table" that is partitionned by date, and an ACID table named "clean_table" containing the same columns as the ones in "raw_table".
"clean_table" has 3 buckets.
Then, we have a cleansing query that will delete from "clean_table" all rows that exist in a specified partition of "raw_table". Comparison is done on a combination of functional keys (key0,key1,key2 and key3).
That job is made using 3 reducers (enforced by a parameter set before executing the query).
Here is how it looks like :
{code}
set mapred.reduce.tasks=3;
DELETE
    FROM clean_table
    WHERE concat(CASE WHEN key0 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(key0 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN key1 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(key1 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN key2 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(key2 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN key3 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(key3 AS STRING) END)
        IN (
             SELECT concat(CASE WHEN mt.key0 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(mt.key0 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN mt.key1 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(mt.key1 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN mt.key2 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(mt.key2 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN mt.key3 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(mt.key3 AS STRING) END)
             FROM clean_table clean
             LEFT SEMI JOIN(
                             SELECT concat(CASE WHEN key0 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(key0 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN key1 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(key1 AS
 STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN key2 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(key2 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN key3 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(key3 AS STRING) END) AS key
                             FROM raw_table
                             WHERE (year='2017' AND month='01' AND day='01' AND INPUT__FILE__NAME like '%20170101%') AND 1=1) raw 
             ON concat(CASE WHEN clean.key0 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(clean.key0 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN clean.key1 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(clean.key1 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN clean.key2 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(clean.key2 AS STRING) END,'#',CASE WHEN clean.key3 IS NULL THEN '' ELSE CAST(clean.key3 AS STRING) END) = raw.key
            );
 {code}
Execution plan confirms a multifile sprayer is used to run that request.]
