[Looks like the test is relying on the hive-exec JAR being installed to the local maven repository, and it's not there yet during the maven test phase.  [~brocknoland], would it be more appropriate for TestExecDriver to be added to itests? Or is it expected to run "mvn clean install -DskipTests" before actually running any tests?, You must do mnv install before running any tests. Not as part of the install., Ok, thanks for the clarification., I consider this fact as very annoying. Every Hive newcomer reading the GettingStarted guide and executing the instructions written there, will get into this frustrating situation. See for example
