[The "show create table" output should use SERDE instead of DELIMITED for row_format and SERDEPROPERTIES for the DELIMITED properties if any. It can ensure a table with any kind of serde/fileformat to be recreated correctly.
{code}
row_format
  : DELIMITED [FIELDS TERMINATED BY char [ESCAPED BY char]] [COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY char]
        [MAP KEYS TERMINATED BY char] [LINES TERMINATED BY char]
        [NULL DEFINED AS char]   -- (Note: Available in Hive 0.13 and later)
  | SERDE serde_name [WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, property_name=property_value, ...)]
