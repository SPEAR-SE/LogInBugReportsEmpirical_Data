[Fixed partial matches.
Added tests for REGEXP., The changes look good - will commit if the tests pass, Not quite ready - need to update udf1.q, Updated udf1.q.out
Added logging for empty regexp, @HIVE-236.2.patch:

The warning should not be outputted for every call - we had seen problems with too many repeated log messages that filled up the log file.
Can you add a boolean variable "warned", so that we only warn once?

Also, it may help if you put all the test cases in a single query. That helps to reduce the time of running tests.
, Modified REGEXP to log only the first time when regexp is empty.
Consolidated tests in udf_regexp.q into a single query., Looks great! Will commit after testing.
, Committed. Thanks Paul!]
