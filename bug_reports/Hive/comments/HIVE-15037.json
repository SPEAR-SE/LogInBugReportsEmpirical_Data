[I have filed LEGAL-298 to ask for advice on whether this jar is acceptable., I made a mistake.  This jar is not released under the SCSL 3.0 license.  When I run the license report in maven it tells me it doesn't know what the license is (see 1 below).  Several of the jars did that, and I found licenses for those jars using Google search.  Based on https://java.net/projects/jta-spec/ it would appear that this is released under CDDL 1.0, which is acceptable for distribution with binary artifacts, per https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html

I don't know why I thought it was under SCSL 3.0. 

I'm going to mark this as resolved and file a bug to fix the license for jta to be correct.

On the up side, we received an answer back from LEGAL that SCSL is not an open source license.

1. You can reproduce this by doing {{mvn project-info-reports:dependencies}} and looking in {{metastore/target/site/dependencies.html}}
