[This issue is related to a Thrift communication. 

The FLOAT data is correctly loaded on HS2, but in order to send it to beeline, it needs to cast it as DOUBLE because Thrift does not support FLOAT data types. This is where the decimals got extended. 

This is the code where it happens:
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/thrift/ColumnBuffer.java#L368

{noformat}
case FLOAT_TYPE:
      nulls.set(size, field == null);
      doubleVars()[size] = field == null ? 0 : new Double(field.toString());
      break;
