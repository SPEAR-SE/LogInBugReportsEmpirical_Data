[On a relatively slower centos machine I was able to reproduce the flakiness that was either causing assertion error or test timeouts. The reason for that is AbstractJdbcTriggersTest waits until last expected message appears in STDERR here https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/itests/hive-unit/src/test/java/org/apache/hive/jdbc/AbstractJdbcTriggersTest.java#L164. 
In the tests, the last expected line json line from WM event summary. When I printed the STDERR, the json output gets printed first followed by text summary. But assertion happens for text first followed by json. When json output appears in stderr while loop is exited and assertion fails as there is no text output. 

I made it consistent. The post hook prints json and text summary and all tests also asserts in the same order (json first and then text). , [~sershe] can you please take a look? , cc/ [~jcamachorodriguez] with this the retry annotation should no longer be required (although doesn't hurt)., Hmm... will this also cover when it times out? +1, Hopefully. On the repro cluster I tried this patch several times and it never failed (without it failed with timeout and assertion error). , Pushed to master., This is released in Hive 3.1.0.]
