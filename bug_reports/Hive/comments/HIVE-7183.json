[+1(non-binding), [~swarnim] what does that meaning of "non-binding"?

do u know how to change this issue's status to 'solved or patch-available'?, [~suyeon1222] I am only a contributor on the project and not a committer. So my vote counts towards being a non-binding. A committer's vote is considered as a binding vote which you would need to get this patch accepted. For further information, refer to [1]

You just need to click on the "Submit Patch" button to change the status to "Patch Available". One of the committers probably need to add you to the contributors list so that you can assign JIRAs to yourself., [~swarnim] thanks a lot!! it is truly helpful for me.,
