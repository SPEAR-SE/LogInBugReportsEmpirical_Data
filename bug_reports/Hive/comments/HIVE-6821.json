ATTACHMENT ID: 12638382, Looks like I missed a couple of .q.out files in patch, will regenerate patch.
Not sure how TestCommandProcessorFactory.testAvailableCommands would be affected by this patch, since it's only modifying .q files., patch v2 - generate diff using "git diff -a" to include the missing .q.out files (which git treated as binary files). Also regenerated merge3.q.out since it had changed due to HIVE-6808.,
