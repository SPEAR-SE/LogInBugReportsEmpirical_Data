[Your are doing {{hiveContext.hql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hivetesting")}} in Scala schell of the Spark project.

What this shell is doing ? Query to remote metastore on non existing table (see on your provided stack).
The remote metastore throws {{NoSuchObjectException(message:default.hivetesting table not found)}} because Spark code call {{HiveMetaStoreClient.getTable(HiveMetaStoreClient.java:854)}} on non-existing table. It's the right behavior.
You should check on Spark code why a query is done on non existing table.

I think Spark does not handle well the {{IF EXISTS}} part of this query. Maybe you could fill a ticket on Spark JIRA.

BUT, it's *not a bug* in HIVE IMHO., thanks, i will report to Spark , [~haimei] Glad to help ^^]
