[Extending the vectorized processing to the reduce side is a complex undertaking. None of the vector mode operators are implemented in reduce side. The thinking is that the bulk of the CPU intensive processing occurs on the map side and our goal was to provide maximum feature coverage (ie. implement as many operators as needed to cover the most queries) but atm vectorization only works for map side of first stage. I'm not sure whether at this stage we can call the map side effort stable/mature/complete enough to warrant a focus shift to reduce side., [~rusanu] Agreed that there are no vectorized operators on the reducer side atm.  Purpose of this JIRA is to take the first step in enabling it on the reducer side for simple queries. , I agree with Remus. If you do want to get good performance with vectorization on the reduce side, you'll need to think carefully about how you can efficiently create full VectorizedRowBatches. Single-row or small VectorizedRowBatches will not give performance gains. Also, if it is expensive to load rows into the batches on the reduce side, that could dominate total runtime., Rebased to trunk and with the additional changes to RowObjectInspectors.

This still respects tagging, but it might be almost impossible to tag vectorized row batches on the operator side., Comments on rb., Can you share the rb link?,
