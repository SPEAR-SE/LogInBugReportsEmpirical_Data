[Wrote a small expected benchmark at 

https://github.com/t3rmin4t0r/boyermoore/blob/master/src/main/java/org/notmysock/benchmark/BoyerMooreHorspool.java, I made an initial implementation. It copied [~gopalv]'s code. It works similar to Pattern and Matcher in JDK. StringExpr::compile() returns a Finder object. A Finder object uses Boyer Moore Horspool algorithm to find its pattern.

I tried to combine compile and find into one, but it made performance loss. Then I tried to use ThreadLocal or synchronized blocks to implement in StringExpr::find(), and both of them made performance loss, too. Separating compilation from finding was the most performant way.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12849908 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Left a couple of comments on RB about tests, overall looks good.

+1 tests/comments pending., I added more unit tests, and found a bug. It makes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions when its pattern is an empty string. I fixed it.,
