[[~mmccline] [~gopalv] fyi, Re. The default precision and scale for the implicit decimal cast are max,max, ie 38,38. 

Can you give an example for this?, [~xuefuz] see the new Q file added in  HIVE-13957. Before the fix there (that disables vectorization for IN for such cases), the vectorized query returns no results. 
The code in vectorization that adds casts to arguments (before evaluating them) for UDFs like IN, and gets precision and scale for the cast depending on the type, is the problem., Got it. Thanks for the explanation. Yeah, casting based on the input's max precision/scale is problematic as decimal(38, 38) applies practically no values. Using target type is one option. The other option is to use default decimal precision/scale which is (38, 18). Such default is assumed as the type for any decimal value that doesn't have precision/scale., Yeah, we could do that too. Perhaps I should also do it in the other patch as part of the quick fix.]
