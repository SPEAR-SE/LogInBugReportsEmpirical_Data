[[~hagleitn] can you take a look?, This patch removes SARG logging from split generation. But there is going to be log lines for every split during reader creation (OrcInputFormat.setSearchArgument()). 

Also, regd. the log line immediately after HiveConf object creation. Can we create a SARG once, cache it in the Context? We can avoid multiple creations for SARG that way. 

Ideally, we should have SARG object created once and logged once per query. , Are you sure setSearchArgument is called for splits? I don't think split generation ever creates the actual record reader, it only creates ReaderImpl for metadata.
As for caching sure, will make a v2, Actualy never mind. serSearchArgument is called during during reader creation i.e for each splits. That shouldn't be a big problem I guess as it happens after split gen and goes to task logs. Few log lines per task should be fine. , Patch with caching ,
