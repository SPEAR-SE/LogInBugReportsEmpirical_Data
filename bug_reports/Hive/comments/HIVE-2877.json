[There are two distinct problems:

1) Many of the queries in split_sample.q and sample_islocalmode_hook.q are nondeterministic. This can be fixed by adding ORDER BY clauses.

2) The second problem is more serious. Both of the tests set mapred.max.split.size=300 and hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize=1 in an effort to force the generation of multiple splits and multiple output files. However, Hadoop 0.20 is incapable of generating splits smaller than the block size when using CombineFileInputFormat, so only one split is generated. This has a significant impact on the results of the TABLESAMPLE(x PERCENT). This issue was fixed in MAPREDUCE-2046 which is included in 0.23.

Suggested Fixes: 
# Make the queries deterministic
# Restrict these tests to Hadoop versions >= 0.22
