[Can you get HIVE code from apache.org? We are not supporting the version on mirror.facebook.com any more.
, I download from
http://mirror.facebook.com/facebook/hive/hadoop-0.17/dist.tar.gz, Hi YihueyChyi,

As Zheng said that is really old code and does not have a lot of fixes. I will take it down this week so that there is not much confusion.

Please go to

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/hive/trunk

to checkout the version of hive

and then

run ant -Dhadoop.version="0.17" clean package

This will generate the hive distribution in

build/dist

under 

hive

set your HADOOP_HOME and then execute bin/hive
, the mirror.facebook.com/hive site was already taken offlne., cool..

then we should not be getting into this confusion for future users :), Hi 
 
I Build the Code ,but I get error like this:

thriftif:
     [echo] Executing thrift (which needs to be in your path) to build java metastore APIs....

BUILD FAILED
/hive/trunk/build.xml:95: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/hive/trunk/service/build.xml:35: Execute failed: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "thrift" (in directory "/hive/trunk/service"): java.io.IOException: error=2, No such file or directory

Please help. Thank you., Hi YihueyChyi,

There is an issue with service/build.xml. It currently assumes that you have thrift installed. I am attaching the diff which will allow the build to proceed even if you dont have thrift (this is ok since we are checking in the thrift generated code as well). Please apply this patch (by running patch -p0 < hive-150.1.patch in the hive top level directory.
, +1, Committed the patch from Raghu. But not closing this issue since this issue is about "group by count(1) will get error".
, Thanks for your support. 

I compiled successful., I guess the problem is already fixed in the new source repository. Reopen if there is still a problem.
