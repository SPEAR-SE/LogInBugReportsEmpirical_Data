[In spark branch, I am thinking of running a few tests only on spark, and exclude them from MR tests (for example, setting spark to run parallely, joining MR and spark bucketed tables, etc).

But for that to work, we may need to do this sooner rather than later, as we need to add another exclude flag from CliDriver test.  So when we merge back to trunk, it doesn't screw up the trunk build., Gotcha. To do this I think we'd just need:

1) Put the files themselves in source control
2) Pull in the SVN source via system property
3) Map a "profile" (generated in the jenkins script) to a branch (in a local file)
4) Change ptest to checkout this SVN code to get the properties file
