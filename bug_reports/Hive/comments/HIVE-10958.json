ATTACHMENT ID: 12738205 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, Pushed to master & branch-1.2, Is it also committed to branch-1 ? 
Everything in branch-1.2 should go into branch-1 as well, as branch-1 is the 'trunk' for future 1.x releases.
, I am not sure if it is also committed to branch-1 too. [~ashutoshc], could you please take a look at [~thejas] question? Thanks., [~pxiong] why "Centos" in the JIRA name and description?, [~damien.carol], I put CentOS in the name because mergejoin.q fails on CentOS 6. Generally speaking, the q test cases only run on our mac and the OS in jenkins (which may not be CentOS). ]
