[I think we can disable aggressive dedup if any parent of RS5 has more than one child, and leave it to the normal case., This might be a DUP of HIVE-16100, [~gopalv] yeah the v3 patch of HIVE-16100 has the changes I intend to make here. Marking this one as a dup., [~lirui] If you have test case for it, can you please share it. It will be good to add it as part of HIVE-16100 fix., [~ashutoshc], the following query can reproduce the issue:
{code}
explain from (select key from src cluster by key) a
  insert overwrite table d1 select a.key
  insert overwrite table d2 select a.key cluster by a.key;
{code}
The insert to table d1 will be lost.]
