[A succinct way of wording the problem is:
- Hadoop daemons create the /tmp/hive-<username> directory with their group ownership
- User data loaded via LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH is staged in /tmp/hive-<username>, inheriting its group ownership
- User data is moved to the table directory, but keeps the group ownership of /tmp/hive-<username>

The desired behavior is:
- Data loaded with LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH inherits the group ownership of the table directory

This could be solved by:
- Removing the need to stage the data in /tmp, OR
- Adding a step to LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH to change the group ownership, after the load completes (this one is probably an easier solution)]
