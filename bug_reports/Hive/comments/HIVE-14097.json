[We don't plan to run TestCliDriver with hbasemetastore by default currently. To run TestCliDriver with hbasemetastore, apply enable.patch first. (also Note the patch need to apply after HIVE-13560, there will be conflict otherwise), I still see 24 failures remaining attribute to the following categories:
1. rounding difference for partition key (hbasemetastore store key in actual type): partition_timestamp, smb_join_partition_key, alter_partition_coltype, partition_timestamp2
2. order difference for partition (hbasemetastore sort key with actual type): rand_partitionpruner2, ppr_pushdown2, load_dyn_part15, input42, ppd_vc, input_part0, input_part8, escape1, escape2, load_dyn_part14, explain_dependency, vectorized_parquet_types
3. stats minor diff (stats extrapolate has different implementation in hbasemetastore): extrapolate_part_stats_partial, extrapolate_part_stats_partial_ndv, acid_table_stats, autoColumnStats_1, autoColumnStats_2, insert_values_orig_table_use_metadata
4. table constraint is not implemented: create_with_constraints
5. BD literal is not recognized: partition_coltype_literals

#1, #2, #3 should not be an issue. I will address #4, #5 in followup tickets.]
