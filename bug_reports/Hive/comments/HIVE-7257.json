ATTACHMENT ID: 12651501, [~wilbur.yang].  Thanks for this patch, I do have one concern. the query
{noformat}SELECT format_number(CAST(12332.123456 AS FLOAT), 4),{noformat}

shows a result like :
{noformat}12,332.1230{noformat}

It doesn't look correct, unless I'm missing something?  I would expect 12332.1235, like it shows in decimal., [~szehon], thanks for the review. That particular case seems to be a quirk with floats -- I [tested System.out.println((float)12332.123456);|http://ideone.com/oP4NDJ] and it prints 12332.123. I suppose the question now is whether or not we want it to behave like this., Ah, I guess that is most bits that fit into that float.  I'm ok with the change then, +1., Committed to trunk.  Thanks Wilbur for the contribution!, I mentioned this bug fix in the wiki here:

* [UDFs -- String Functions | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF#LanguageManualUDF-StringFunctions], Does format_number work for decimal(n,m)?
{code}
SELECT format_number(CAST(12332.123456 AS decimal(32,12)), 4),
{code}
hive 0.13.1 (hdp-2.1.3) gives me
FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10016]: Line 4:28 Argument type mismatch 'amount': Argument 1 of function FORMAT_NUMBER must be "tinyint" or "smallint" or "int" or "bigint" or "double" or "float", but "decimal(32,12)" was found.
, [~apivovarov], please see [HIVE-7279|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7279]. Thanks, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
