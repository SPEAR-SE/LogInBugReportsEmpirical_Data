ATTACHMENT ID: 12670828, HIVE-8221.2.patch - fixing test failures. Also made it possible to enable/disable read authorization on databases/tables using hive.security.metastore.authorization.auth.reads flag., Patch looks good to me. Having a flag there that allows a user to turn it off is important, and I'm glad you have it - I suspect this will be very frequently called. I'm +1 on it.,
