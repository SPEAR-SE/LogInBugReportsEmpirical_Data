https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/10138/testReport/org.apache.hive.beeline/TestBeeLineWithArgs/testEscapeCRLFInTSV2Output/, I reverted TestBeeLineWithArgs changes in master and branch-3 for HIVE-18493/HIVE-18806., Bumped into this issue of  TestHiveCli taking forever to run and causing timeout. This is due to HIVE-18493 commit which added call to {{beeLine.getOpts().getEscapeCRLF()}} in Rows.  If it is not beeline getEscapeCRLF tries to get hive conf using {{beeLine.getCommands().getHiveConf(true)}} and eventually calling {{Commands::getHiveConf}}. But this method again can call to Row:Row() resulting in infinite loop. This is what is causing TestHiveCli timeout., [~vgarg] What do you recommend?  Should I revert EscapeCRLF?   Or, do you see the fix?, [~mmccline] Sorry I missed your comment earlier. I pushed a fix for this in HIVE-20149. I updated getEscapeCRLF to not try to initialize/create conf and uses an existing one if it is initialized or otherwise just return false.
, [~ashutoshc] HIVE-20149 only fixes TestHiveCli. TestBeeLineWithArgs still need to be looked at so this shouldn't be marked resolved.]
