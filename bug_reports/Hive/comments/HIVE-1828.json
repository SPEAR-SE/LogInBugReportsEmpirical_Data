[One minor comment:

In case of 

show locks <T> extended;

Does anyone check that the table exists ?

The DDLTask can do that before calling zookeeper , For "show locks <T> extended;", DDLTask is now validating the table and partition information in getHiveLockObject(). , can you add the new patch ?

also, can you add a negative test (if you have not done so already) ?, +1

running tests, Committed. Thanks Yongqiang]
