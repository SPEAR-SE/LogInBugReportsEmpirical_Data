ATTACHMENT ID: 12633789, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Eugene!, Should the userdoc mention this bug and when it's going to be fixed?

* [Language Manual DDL:  Describe Table/View/Column |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-DescribeTable/View/Column], it's a WebHCat bug and I don't think it needs a doc, (Didn't notice it's WebHCat.)  Should this bug be documented here?

* [WebHCat Reference GetTable:  Parameters |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+GetTable#WebHCatReferenceGetTable-Parameters], Okay, thanks Eugene., patch applied to 0.13 branch]
