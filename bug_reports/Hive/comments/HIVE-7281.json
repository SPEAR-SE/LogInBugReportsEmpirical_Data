[Ideally we could lock only partitions that are potentially being written to by the dynamic partitioning write.  But this would require significant changes in the TxnHandler to handle the notion of locking partitions matching a pattern.  Rather than make those changes, for now it is easier to lock the table., Attaching a patch that locks at the table level rather than locking the dummy partition (as before).,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12659090, Patch looks fine. 
But, I wonder if Entity type of DummyPartition make sense at all. It seems this entity is created only in DP case to be used for locking and authorization purposes. And since in locking case (as argued in this ticket) as well as auth case (probably) it make sense to use Table entity. I dont see what useful purpose DummyPartition serves. On the contrary, it results in confusion like the topic of this jira. Shall we just delete this DummyPartition entity. cc: [~thejas], I'm fine with doing that, but do we need to link that change to this?  Can we file a separate JIRA for that?, Filing a separate ticket and unlinking it from this one is fine, only that it will be left to the mercy of someone who will do it : )  
Fixing a root cause is always better (in this case deleting error-prone DummyPartitions) but since immediate bug can be fixed by current patch. +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Alan!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
