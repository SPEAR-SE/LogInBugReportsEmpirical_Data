[cc-ing [~thejas] for review., +1
Thanks for the patch Hari!
, Committed to master and branch-1.2. Thanks [~thejas] for the review!, Committed to branch-1 as well, The issue still happens when the jars need to be shipped for MR task, I believe they should be added as part of aux jars path before HS2 is started., cc-ing [~sushanth] for review. Tested the patch in windows and it seems to fix the issue addressed here.

Thanks
Hari, +1, looks good to me - it's now similar to the linux hive parsing of HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH. Thanks, Hari!, Committed to branch-1, branch-1.2 and master.

Thanks, Hari!]
