[You could use the Hive datediff function:
SELECT DISTINCT customerid FROM Customer_date WHERE 
datediff(Customer_date.my_date_mmdyyyy, CURRENT_DATE()) >= 7;

Note that you are subtracting the current date from the stored date, which is most likely a negative number unless the dates are in the future, which means the check >=7 will not return any rows. You might want to switch the arguments around:
datediff(CURRENT_DATE(), Customer_date.my_date_mmdyyyy).]
