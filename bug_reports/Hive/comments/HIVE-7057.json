[@Thejas could you review this?  When checking in please "chmod u+x" on all .sh files.  The patch files can't capture this., +1
, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks for the contribution Eugene!
, I forgot to update the permissions of the files. I have done that now.

chmod+svn-commit does not update the permissions in svn, so I did the following before commit -

cd  hcatalog/src/test/e2e/templeton/deployers/
svn propset svn:executable true *.sh
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
