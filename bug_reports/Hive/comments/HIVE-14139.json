[[~lirui] are you looking into it? I can take a look today or tomorrow otherwise., Which version is this, btw?, The problem is that we failed to register the function with {{Hive.registerAllFunctionsOnce -> reloadFunctions}}. When we call {{FunctionRegistry.registerPermanentFunction}}, we set registerToSession to false so that the custom jar won't be downloaded and we end up with a {{ClassNotFoundException}}. Therefore we get the NPE when we try to drop the function.
[~sershe] - I found this with latest master code. BTW do you know why we choose not to register the function to session when calling {{Hive.registerAllFunctionsOnce}}?, The v1 patch registers function to session when loading them. Verified it fixes the issue on my side., Another way to fix this is adding the function resource to class path when calling {{FunctionRegistry.registerPermanentFunction}}, regardless whether need to register to session. I think this makes sense because the UDF class needs to be loaded anyway.
[~sershe] which way do you prefer or do you have better ideas? Thanks., The code to not register it to session goes all the way to the original session registry patch.
I think the reason might be performance - we don't want to load the function resource for all the functions from metastore, which might be a lot of functions. It may be loaded on first use, not sure. I think we should handle at remove time rather than loading all resources before they are needed..., Thanks [~sershe] for the explanations. I agree performance is a valid concern. But not loading the resources leaves the system registry in a somehow inconsistent state: the function is registered in {{mFunctions}} but not in {{persistent}}, causing this NPE. If we think that is acceptable (although there's an assert to check this), maybe we can just ignore {{persistent}} if the function doesn't exist?
Or we can make {{persistent}} a  map from ClassName (instead of class) to RefCount? Would like to know your opinions, thanks.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12815715 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Patch v2 makes the persistent map of className -> refCount. This way, we don't have to load function resource if not registering to session. And we don't have to load the resource just in order to drop the function.
Also adds a UT to cover this.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12816044 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Just realised I missed some update to the new test. Upload patch v3 for that., It is consistent logically, we know about the function but don't load it until requested. We can just add safety check on removal and not assume it's loaded, does it make sense?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12816188 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~sershe] - do you mean we should just return if {{refCount}} is null?
{code}
  private void removePersistentFunctionUnderLock(FunctionInfo fi) {
    String className = fi.getClassName();
    Integer refCount = persistent.get(className);
    assert refCount != null;
    if (refCount == 1) {
      persistent.remove(className);
    } else {
      persistent.put(className, Integer.valueOf(refCount - 1));
    }
  }
{code}, Sorry, I was looking at the wrong patch (01). I am not sure that the class name in isPersistent will be the same as the one in add.. given the UDFBridge stuff, UDTF resolver etc. Would it make sense to not remove it from the map if it's missing? 
I actually wonder, the NPE results from us not adding it in the first place, so wouldn't using string lead to the same problem where we don't add the string (rather than not adding the class) so we cannot find it?, Hi [~sershe], sorry the code in my last comment is the patched version. What we have in upstream is
{code}
  private void removePersistentFunctionUnderLock(FunctionInfo fi) {
    Class<?> functionClass = getPermanentUdfClass(fi);
    Integer refCount = persistent.get(functionClass);
    assert refCount != null;
    if (refCount == 1) {
      persistent.remove(functionClass);
    } else {
      persistent.put(functionClass, Integer.valueOf(refCount - 1));
    }
  }
{code}
You can see why we don't add it in the first place is because we don't load the function resource, so we don't have the class to put into {{persistent}}. So using class name instead class will fix this. But if the class name can somehow be changed like you said, I'm also OK to just return if {{refCount}} is null. What do you think?, Patch v4 adds safe check to avoid the NPE.
[~sershe], could you take a look and let me know if it reflects what you have in mind? Thanks.,
