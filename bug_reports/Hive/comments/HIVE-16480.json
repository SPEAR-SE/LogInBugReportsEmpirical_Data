[I didn't know if I should put this here or in ORC jira, but found this after upgrading from 0.14.0 hive to 2.1.1 so felt I would start here., We can use this jira to backport the fix from ORC-285., GitHub user omalley opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/285

, This patch applies to branch-2.1 and branch-2.2. In branch-2.3 and above Hive uses the ORC project artifacts, so we'll need to release from ORC. Once the patch goes in, we should start that process., [~owen.omalley]

Â ORC-285 already included in ORC 1.4.3 version. Could you start to review this patch?, Is there a work-around for this issue? We've tried the turning off vectorization in Hive 2.3.2 but it still seems to take the vectorized path, hitting this bug.]
