[Ashish said this would be resolved by predicate pushdown, Marking this as a critical as there is a workaround for this by putting the predicate on the partitioning column within a subquery.

In the example above, this can be achieved by

FROM (FROM xxx a SELECT a.xx, a.yy, a.ds WHERE a.ds=2009-01-05 .... JOIN (SELECT aaa.* FROM aaa WHERE aaa.ds-2009-01-05) e ....
, I think HIVE-578 will fix this as well., Duplicate of HIVE-578, duplicate.]
