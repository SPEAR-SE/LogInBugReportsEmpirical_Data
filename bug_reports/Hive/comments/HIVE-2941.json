[travis requested code review of "HIVE-2941 [jira] Hive should expand nested structs when setting the table schema from thrift structs".
Reviewers: JIRA

  Update ReflectionStructObjectInspector, when returning its type, to return an expanded struct containing fields and their types.

  When setting a table serde, the deserializer is queried for its schema, which is used to set the metastore table schema. The current implementation uses the class name stored in the field as the field type.

  By storing the class name as the field type, users cannot see the contents of a struct with "describe tblname". Applications that query HiveMetaStore for the table schema (specifically HCatalog in this case) see an unknown field type, rather than a struct containing known field types.

  Hive should store the expanded schema in the metastore so users browsing the schema see expanded fields, and applications querying metastore see familiar types.

  DETAILS

  Set the table serde to something like this. This serde uses the built-in ThriftStructObjectInspector.

  alter table foo_test
    set serde "com.twitter.elephantbird.hive.serde.ThriftSerDe"
    with serdeproperties ("serialization.class"="com.foo.Foo");

  This causes a call to MetaStoreUtils.getFieldsFromDeserializer which returns a list of fields and their schemas. However, currently it does not handle nested structs, and if com.foo.Foo above contains a field com.foo.Bar, the class name com.foo.Bar would appear as the field type. Instead, nested structs should be expanded.

TEST PLAN
  Manually verified table schema is set correctly. Can improve testing after getting feedback on this approach.

, Here are some additional details about the issue. Consider the following create table statement. Columns will be discovered for the table by reflecting on the {{Person}} object (instead of explicitly specifying them).

{code}
hive> create external table travis_test.person_test 
    >   partitioned by (part_dt string)
    >   row format serde "com.twitter.elephantbird.hive.serde.ThriftSerDe"
    >     with serdeproperties ("serialization.class"="com.twitter.elephantbird.examples.thrift.Person")
    >   stored as
    >     inputformat "com.twitter.elephantbird.mapred.input.HiveMultiInputFormat"
    >     outputformat "org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat";
{code}

Current behavior does not expand nested structures, listing the class name of nested structs as the field type. Users browsing the schema do not get a full definition of the table schema.

{code}
hive> describe extended person_test;                                                                    
OK
name	com.twitter.elephantbird.examples.thrift.Name	from deserializer
id	int	from deserializer
email	string	from deserializer
phones	array<com.twitter.elephantbird.examples.thrift.PhoneNumber>	from deserializer
part_dt	string	
{code}

This patch expands nested structures, showing the full table schema. Here's an example of what the table looks like with the patch:

{code}
hive> describe extended person_test;
OK
name	struct<first_name:string,last_name:string>	from deserializer
id	int	from deserializer
email	string	from deserializer
phones	array<struct<number:string,type:struct<value:int>>>	from deserializer
part_dt	string	
{code}

In both cases, the table storage descriptor is unchanged - both list the columns as {{cols:[]}}.

I believe the reflected table schema should be copied into the partition storage descriptor when adding a new partition, but that could be a separate change., Would it be possible for someone to take a look at this?, +1 will commit if tests pass., Good news : Your patch works. Bad news: Since now we have correct schema, following tests fail which were generating schema having class name as type. Can you update the patch with ant test -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=case_sensitivity.q -Doverwrite=true and so on.
* case_sensitivity.q
* input17.q
* input5.q
* input_testxpath.q
* input_testxpath2.q
* inputddl8.q
* join_thrift.q
, Looking... In general running the Hive tests are a hassle because they take so long. I poked around a bit and found https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/ which can build github projects. Ideally I could post the patch and link to CI showing tests pass., Wow.. that service looks pretty neat. Would certainly try it out. I think you should send an email to dev-list so that other devs  can also make use it. , Diff updated:

CI failed due to {{org.apache.hadoop.hive.service.TestHiveServerSessions }} which I believe is unrelated:
https://travis.ci.cloudbees.com/job/HIVE-2941/3/, @Travis,
Can you also upload the patch here on the jira?, Done., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Travis!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1470 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1470/])
