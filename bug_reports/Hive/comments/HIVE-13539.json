    HIVE-13539: HiveHFileOutputFormat searching the wrong directory for Hâ€¦

    I believe this is a fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13539
    
    When there are several reducers (or speculative execution) there becomes multiple output dircetories for the task attempts.  Previous behaviour threw exception incorrectly as it assumed multiple HFiles.
    
    Here, I am attempting to start the descending directory search from the task attempt folder and not from the higher directory for the table.

    HIVE-13539: HiveHFileOutputFormat searching the wrong directory for HFiles

----
, Patch is visible on
https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/74, [~timrobertson100] Can you write a Unit Test and/or Q file (e.g. using your repro) that verifies this fix?  I'm looking at reviewing this change so it get committed., Thanks [~mmccline].
I will but it won't be for a couple of weeks at least.
, Attached are the Q file and its output.  I used the query text above as a starting point.  No failure on master...  Perhaps older versions of software are broken.

hbase-handler/src/test/queries/positive/hive_hfile_output_format.q
hbase-handler/src/test/results/positive/hive_hfile_output_format.q.out, The command I used from itests directory was:

{code}
mvn test -Dtest=TestHBaseCliDriver -Dqfile=hive_hfile_output_format.q -Dtest.output.overwrite=true -Phadoop-2
{code}
, Q file succeeds on branch-1   (after removing the dfs command)., I other words, I can't get the non-patched code to fail.  Without a test case, the code patch cannot be reviewed and committed., The issue could only be reproduced when multiple reducers are used. [~timrobertson100], would you like to provide a new qtest?, qtest is not able to reproduce the seen issue since it runs the test using local mode MR which runs multiple reducers sequentially. Manually tests have been done to reproduce the issue in cluster and verified the patch fixes the problem.
Attached patch is same as [~timrobertson100] provided, except some code to throw out an exception instead of hanging for the case where the last component of the specified hfile does not match the column family name.,
