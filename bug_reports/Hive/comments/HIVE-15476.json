ATTACHMENT ID: 12844123 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~aihuaxu] When the query ends up being "tableName == t1 && dbName == t2 && ()", we would want the query to be {{"tableName == t1 && dbName == t2}} right? so that should still return the stats for all columns in the table? With the patch, we just return when the column list is empty, so no table stats for that table are returned. 
What should the behavior be? Thanks, patch-2: minor change to add comment for the function., From the directSQL implementation, we are returning NULL when columns are not provided. ,
