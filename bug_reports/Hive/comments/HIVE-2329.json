[simple walk-around, Good catch.  Can you submit an updated patch which includes a testcase (.q and .q.out) files, and then create a Review Board entry?

Review request for hive.


Summary
-------

If map aggregation is set to false, DISTRIBUTED BY followed by GROUP BY with same key fails in runtime. ReduceSinkDeDuplication optimization should be avoid if child of child RS is GBY. 


This addresses bug HIVE-2329.

, njain requested code review of "HIVE-2329 [jira] Not using map aggregation, fails to execute group-by after cluster-by with same key".
Reviewers: JIRA

  HIVE-2329

  hive.map.aggr=false
  select Q1.key_int1, sum(Q1.key_int1), sum(distinct Q1.key_int1) from (select * from t1 cluster by key_int1) Q1 group by Q1.key_int1

  resulted..

  FAILED: Execution Error, return code 2 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.MapRedTask

  ........

  I think the problem is caused by ReduceSinkDeDuplication, removing RS which was providing rs.key for GBY operation. If child of child RS is a GBY, we should bypass the optimization.
