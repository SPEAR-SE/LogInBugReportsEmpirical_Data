[+1, The previous patch was not including hcatalog jars in the 'tar' target but only the 'bin' target.  This patch properly includes them in both., Thanks Alan. Patch worked. I checked it in 0.11 branch. But, patch doesn't apply on trunk. Can you also provide a patch for trunk?, Sorry, student driver., A version of the patch that applies cleanly to trunk., Committed trunk version as well. Thanks, Alan!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2089 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2089/])
