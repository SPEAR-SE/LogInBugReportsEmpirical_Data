[Testing locally I am not seeing the exact same error message, but also failures in checkstyle. The patch seems to take care of it., Seems like we can just remove the .gitignore file as well., +1.

, [~ashutoshc]/[~traviscrawford] I see that the checkstyle entry has many directories/file types to exclude. Instead of excluding the ones could we change it to include only **/*.java? , This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.]
