[We have also faced the same issue.
We have a simple select statement having a join of two tables.
The timestamp columns are getting shifted back by 1 hour for one table.

Although, individually firing select query for each table is working fine as expected.
We are not able to find the root cause and still looking for it.
Can it be due to clock out of sync issue of one of the mapper/reducer node?, [~srajat], [~397090770], have you been able to reproduce this consistently? I am trying to reproduce in another environment but so far no luck.]
