[Attaching a fix, that moves the hive-common's build-resource specification to the "dist" profile as well.

Normal invokation of "eclipse:eclipse" outside of "dist" profile will not try to add this as build-resource., My bad. +1, Committed to trunk.  Thanks Navis for review!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
