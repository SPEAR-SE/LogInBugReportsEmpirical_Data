[Hive-881.patch fixes this bug. , add support to LineTerminator, FieldEscape, etc in row format. Also fixed an existing bug in genScriptPlan, +1.
BTW, how hard it is to support "CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE"? If not, we might want to add that feature in as well.
, Also, do we support "ROW FORMAT SERDE" as well?
, It's probably not hard to create external table in CTAS. It was left out just because it's probably not very useful to create an external table holding the query results (seems the motivation for external table is that the data are already there and we just want queriability on them). If there are really needs to create external tables, we can make it a bootcamp task. The only think need to change is probably the parser, the file location, and the FileSink's destination URI. 

The CTAS currently support row format serde (there is a test case in ctas.q and an example in the wiki documentation)., Looks good. Can you add a bootcamp task for that?
I will commit this one as soon as it passes the test.

, Committed. Thanks Ning!, By the way, as a use case for "CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS", CTAS and "INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY" will share almost exactly the same code, and HIVE-634 can be solved as well.
, That's right. Exporting results to a local file may be used for porting to other DBMSs. I'll open another JIRA.]
