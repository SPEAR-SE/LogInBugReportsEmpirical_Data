[this seems to be result of a bug/feature in Hadoop Trash.moveToTrash() function

The comment for the class Trash (see below) says that the deleted directory should retail the full path in .Trash/Current directory but the actual code is only the name of the directory is used. I will try to check the actual policy of the deletes and see whether we need to implement our own moveToTrash function.

/** Provides a <i>trash</i> feature. Files are moved to a user's trash
 * directory, a subdirectory of their home directory named ".Trash". Files are
 * initially moved to a <i>current</i> sub-directory of the trash directory.
 * Within that sub-directory their original path is preserved. Periodically
 * one may checkpoint the current trash and remove older checkpoints. (This
 * design permits trash management without enumeration of the full trash
 * content, without date support in the filesystem, and without clock
 * synchronization.)
 */ , need resolution on this before the first release., fixed by patching hadoop]
