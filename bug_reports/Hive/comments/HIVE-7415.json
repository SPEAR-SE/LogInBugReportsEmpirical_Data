ATTACHMENT ID: 12656407, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Navis!, One of the reason ql_rewrite_gbtoidx is still failing is that the test uses counter type stat and it fails sometimes in test bed. I'll make a following issue for it., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
