[I think that this is caused by partition properties not being populated in the metastore db. , Also this does not happen on tables "stored as avro" without avro.schema.literal or avro.schema.url defined. , [~johndee] I could not reproduce this error in Hive trunk. The output I got for DESC episodes_partitioned  PARTITION (doctor_pt=4) is
{code}
