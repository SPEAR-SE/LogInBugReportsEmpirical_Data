Review request for hive, John Sichi and Carl Steinbach.


Summary
-------

Currently, if Driver fails executing any of the task, it tries suicide by System.exit() which should not be happened in our use cases.

This is simple hot-fix I've provided to my coworkers. Someone could do more elaborated work.


This addresses bug HIVE-2264.
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2264

, Unlinking from 0.9, This patch is very useful. like the idea.
Non-Committer +1., Ran into this myself. +1., Hi,

I rebased this patch on trunk (attached) and removed the commented out System.exit().

Brock, Navis, you can use my rebased patch to update review board or if you don't have interest in this any longer, no worries, I'd be willing to take it up., I'm applying this for all internal hive releases and wish to be reviewed/applied into apache hive. But sadly, no committer seemed interested in it. 

It's already in patch-available status. Do you have more idea to be merged with this? Then I'll happily assign it to you., [~navis] You have been running with this patch for quite a long time? In regards to getting it merged, I think the best we can do is update the review board item with the rebased patch. Another item that may bring it up in terms of visibility is linking it to HIVE-2935 as it's quite important for HS2., I think we should mark this as a blocker as this can kill HS2 which can have dozens of jobs running in the cluster for clients., Navis, if Brock rebased the patch you can commit. I am +1 as well., navis requested code review of "HIVE-2264 [jira] Hive server is SHUTTING DOWN when invalid queries beeing executed.".

, Ok, let's make this committed. Rebased to trunk., Navis,

Edward already +1'd the patch. Are you looking for a +1 on the rebased patch?, I was intended to do that but I've reminded comments from [~namit] 'dont commit our own patches' (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3171?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=13440920#comment-13440920)., Marking as blocker for 0.11., @Navis: we relaxed that rule. You can commit your own patches as long as you get a +1 from another committer. You're good to go., Committed and was my first commit. Thanks to all., navis has abandoned the revision "HIVE-2264 [jira] Hive server is SHUTTING DOWN when invalid queries beeing executed.".
