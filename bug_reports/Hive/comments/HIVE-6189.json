ATTACHMENT ID: 12622691, +1, Apparently the nonsupport of top-level UNION ALL never got documented, so for starters that needs to be fixed in the wiki for Hive 0.12.0 and earlier.  Then we'll need documentation for this ticket, which could go in a release note or directly into the wiki:  [Union Syntax|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Union]., Thanks [~navis] for the review. I've added .3 because [~rhbutani] showed me a much better way to do this. He showed me how I can do all the necessary rewrites in the grammar without having to mess with the tree in semantic analysis. This is much cleaner., I'm pretty sure Harish is more proficient than me for this kind of works. Good to hear that hive supports top level union! ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12623031, [~leftylev] - the documentation in the link you sent looks good. We could specify that unions can be used in views, insert, and ctas statements, but this I'm thinking that's almost self explanatory. As for hive .12 and below - the restriction was that unions could only be used within a subquery. I.e.: 

"select_statement union all select_statement union all ..." had to be written as "select * from (select_statement union all select_statement union all ...) unionresult"

Ditto for CTAS, insert, create/alter view as.

Does that make sense?, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks for reviewing [~rhbutani] and [~navis]!, [~hagleitn], how's this wiki revision?
