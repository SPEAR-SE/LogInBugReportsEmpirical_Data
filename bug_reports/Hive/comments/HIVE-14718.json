[[~spena] does this make sense? I did what other pom files appear to do, not intimately familiar with Hive pom files anymore :),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12827471 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, I think it does, but I'm not too familiar with this either.
[~xuefuz] You who worked on hive-on-spark, could you help review this pom.xml patch for it?, Can we get some clarification on the problem? I understand the downloaded file may be leftover, but what still runs, spark test, or downloading the file?]
