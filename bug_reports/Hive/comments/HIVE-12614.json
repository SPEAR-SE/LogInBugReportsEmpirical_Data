[[~nemon], could you add a little description for the problem?, For a given hive connection with spark session already started ,the spark session will be closed after "set hive.execution.engine=mr".
However ,"reset" command doesn't have this effect ,which also set hive.execution.engine back to mr ., [~nemon] do you have plans to work on this? If not do you mind if I assign it to myself?, [~stakiar] Thanks for taking it over. :),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12862958 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~nemon] could you take a look? RB: https://reviews.apache.org/r/58376/, Approach is pretty simple, when reseting the configs in {{ResetProcessor}}, use the {{SetProcessor#setConf}} method which already handles closing the spark session if the execution engine is changed to something besides {{spark}}., Patch looks good. Minor comment on RB.,
