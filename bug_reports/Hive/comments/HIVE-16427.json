[[~ychena] Seems the patch on HIVE-14519 fixed the issue partially. Here's another test case that is causing multi-insert query to fail., Yes, it is a different case, HIVE-14519 fixed the case that null return caused by filter. This test case is the null value caused by limit statement., Process the case for limit 0,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12863423 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, The failure is not related., Logic to determine if its a multi-insert query is not correct. It assumes its TS-SEL-LIM pipeline which is not necessarily true, you may have arbitrary number of operators between LIM and TS. You need to traverse the tree. Similar improvement needs to be made for where false case as well., [~ashutoshc], is it true that from TS to LIM0 (or the null Filter), if there are any branch between the two operations, the need to convertMetadataOnly will be false ?
For example:
TS -OP1-OP2-OP3-LIM0 will need to convertMetadataOnly,

But following will not: 
{noformat}
TS-OP1-OP2-OP3-LIM0
        |
      OP4
{noformat}, No. Imagine  a case where  OP4  and OP1 are RS and OP2 is Join. OP4 may have TS its parent as RS. That pipeline is essentially a join pipeline where this optimization is still valid. , Thanks [~ashutoshc], I just attached patch2 to handle both cases:

{noformat}
TS-OP1-OP2-OP3-LIM0
          |
        OP4
{noformat}

{noformat}
TS-OP1-OP2-OP3-LIM0
  |____|
         OP4
{noformat}

The basic idea of the patch is: if all the streams from TS go into lim0/filterfalse, then the TS can be optimized with MetadataOnly

ATTACHMENT ID: 12863691 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Patch looks good. Couple of stylistic improvements:

* Can you rename canSkipData() to isNullOpPresentInAllBranches() ? 
* Also, add a comment  for method something like following : {{ We need to make sure that Null Operator (LIM or FIL) is present in all branches of multi-insert query before applying the optimization. This method does full tree traversal starting from TS and will return true only if it finds target Null operator on each branch }} Add/edit comment as you find appropriate.
, The failures are not related.
Thanks [~ashutoshc] for the review, attached patch 3 addresses the issues. , +1, Pushed to master. Thanks, Yongzhi!, Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
