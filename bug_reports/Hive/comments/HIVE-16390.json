ATTACHMENT ID: 12862164 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Patch looks good.
One question is what impact does this have when there may be two different queries trying to access the same data. Earlier the read would be using the daemon configuration. Now it's two configuration instance with potentially differing values. Likely does not make a difference. The patch accounts for ZCR. Anything else that should be looked at?, I don't think it should make a difference cause we are only using it for ORC stuff pretty much (or other reader stuff). It's all local to one IO thread and specific to one reader/readerimpl.
I looked thru OrcConf.java and didn't see anything else that would need an override. Let me know if you see smth.
