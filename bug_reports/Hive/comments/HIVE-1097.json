[* Increased mem from 256MB to 300MB for groupby_bigdata, It might be a good idea to increase to 384MB to make sure we don't run into this problem in a while.

Also the following piece of code looks suspicious. It is possible that something else happened, but we went out-of-memory while doing stringifyException?
Let's "LOG.warn" the exception type and message first, before do "LOG.warn" on the stringified exception text.

{code}
ScriptOperator.java:
      } catch (Throwable th) {
        scriptError = th;
        LOG.warn(StringUtils.stringifyException(th));
      } finally {
{code}
, * Increased mem to 384
* Added LOG.warn() before stringifyException

Using the added LOG.warn(), I also verified that there was a OOM exception before stringifyException threw another OOM., +1

looks good, committed. Thanks Paul, Namit, can you apply the patch to branch-0.5? Thanks!, applied in 0.5 also]
