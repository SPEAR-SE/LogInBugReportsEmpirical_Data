[The SMB Join or Bucket MapJoin?

The BMJ can have different paths because there's no ordering required., Thanks for pointing this out. SMB it is. I will update the JIRA., Proper implementation of assert.
[~gopalv] Can you please review?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12879692 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, The patch took me a few reads to understand.

If someone removes the assert, it ends up with the last path replacing all others, which might not be obvious.

{code}
for (int i = 0; i < splits.size(); i++) {
{code}

is better written with i=1, so that the loop only compares and doesn't do a put().

+1, with that minor nit., Updated the patch with cleaner code., Thanks, LGTM - +1.,
