[You can express this as:
{noformat}
select distinct 
DELOGCE, l
from
(
select kastr.DELOGCE,
, lag(kastr.DEWNKNR) over ( partition by kastr.DEKTRNR order by kastr.DETRADT, kastr.DEVPDNR ) as l
from RTAVP_DRKASTR kastr
) a
{noformat}

What is going on is: we do the windowing function processing last, after the joins, group by, having etc. Distinct is handled internally as Group By and so is performed before Windowing. Hence the error message. 
You can get around the issue by stacking an outer query as above. Not clear if the semantics you are expecting, is  what the Spec mandates. Will check on Postgres.]
