[Retest with the latest top of trunk/branch-1, it seems to be fixed. I didn't chase what actually fix it.

The only thing left is to add the test case of HIVE-11438 to make sure this will not be broken going forward.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12752065 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~daijy] is this a duplicate of HIVE-11438 ?, No, this patch only takes the test case of HIVE-11438 to make sure there is no regression going forward. The symptom of HIVE-11438 no longer occur on branch-1 and master even without the fix of HIVE-11438., +1, Patch committed to both branch-1 and master. Thanks Thejas for review!]
