ATTACHMENT ID: 12883786 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Patch committed to master.
Thanks for the patch [~sankarh] and for the review [~anishek]!
, Resolved wrong jira, reopening!
This is not committed., [~sankarh]can you rebase it, does not apply cleanly currently. Also can you provide a pull request for the same please. 

one initial comment, 
The replicationSpec should not be updating the currentEventId in TableExport, all of that should be done before we call table export, for replication that is done already in RepldumpTask for export this should be done in ExportSemanticAnalyzer and not in TableExport., Added 03.patch after rebasing with master and fixing Anishek's comment.
Request [~anishek] to review it., +1
