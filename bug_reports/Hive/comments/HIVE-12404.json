[This is probably a fix in the wrong layer, because the type promotion exists elsewhere in the codepath (i.e bigint > 1).

What's the SQL meaning of 

{code}
(cboolean1 < 0)
{code}

??, Thats a valid argument. However, given that Hive has permitted these kind of operations historically, not supporting them for a particular file format will surprise user. Further, ORC already supports that as well, it throws exception only when a particular optimization is enabled. 
IMHO, in presence of such questionable semantics ORC should be defensive and should turn off ppd (which is what this patch does) and let upper layer do the evaluation of condition.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12772123 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The semantics needs a fix, this is handled for some of the numeric types in TypeCheckProcFactory.

{code}
        // Try to infer the type of the constant only if there are two
        // nodes, one of them is column and the other is numeric const
{code}

That's the case which needs to inject an inference for Boolean.

bq. such questionable semantics ORC should be defensive and should turn off ppd

The value class equality is complex when you do something like {{cbyte > 0}} or {{cbigint > 0}}.

This approach might be defensive, but to handle it optimally this patch needs to handle all the implicit inferences implemented for HIVE-10286., This is no longer an issue after HIVE-12017 which inserts casts as needed., This is still an issue., This got fixed as a side-effect of HIVE-12596]
