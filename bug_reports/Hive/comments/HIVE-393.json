[We've seen this problem several times. We only need to enable the FileFormat checking in the MoveTask when loading data.
This will reduce the impact of the problem a lot, since it's a big waste of the time, if the query takes a long time but we are not able to get the query result.

, Skipped the checking of file format except in loading data.

looks good - running tests, will commit if the tests pass, committed. Thanks Zheng]
