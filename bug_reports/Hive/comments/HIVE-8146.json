ATTACHMENT ID: 12669228, I was confused for a bit looking at the patch before I looked at the description of this jira as to why the Hadoop jars were replacing a shims check, but it makes sense from the perspective of what the test is intended to test. :)

Looks good to me, +1.
, Committed to trunk, thanks for review Sushanth, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
