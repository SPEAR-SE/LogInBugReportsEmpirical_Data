, hi,[~aihuaxu],can you plz take a look?, Thanks for the patch [~txhsj]!

I was eyeing this rs, stmt closure too, but I did not have time to work on this yet :)

The patch looks good to me, and the test failures should not be related.
But it is strange to have so many failures, so it would be good to attach the same patch again with a different name (HIVE-16645.2.patch), so the Pre-Commit test should run again.

Thanks,
Peter

ATTACHMENT ID: 12867743 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, I go through the failed UT and think the failure is not related to me.what's your opinion?[~aihuaxu], [~txhsj]: You can find the current flaky tests here: HIVE-15058

What I usually do is list them like this:
"The failures are know flaky:
- HIVE-15776 - Flaky test: TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver vector_if_expr
- HIVE-16606 - Flaky test: org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[vector_join30]"

The other ones are not related, since they are failing since 23 builds.

Overall: LGTM +1 (non binding)

, Thanks Saijin., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
