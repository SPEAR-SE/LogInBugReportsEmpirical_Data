ATTACHMENT ID: 12660949, Thanks Navis! (You beat me to it with a patch :-) - seemed like a easy fix for newbie like  me! )

- Agatea, [~thejas] We've missed this in HIVE-3815. Could you review this?, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks [~agateaaa] and Thejas., [~navis]/[~thejas] should this go into hive .14?, [~hagleitn] I agree, makes sense to include it in 0.14 . It is a small change, should be safe. 
But this is fix is not as crucial as before, since we fixed the issue in HS2 unsecure mode, that was causing FileSystem cache leaks.

cc [~vikram.dixit]
, I'm taking over from [~vikram.dixit] - so +1 for 0.14., Committed to 0.14 branch as well.
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
