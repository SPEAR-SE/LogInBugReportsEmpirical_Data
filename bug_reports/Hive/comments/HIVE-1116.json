[I remember doing this quite sometime ago(only for non-external tables). Are you sure it doesn't work in any scenario?, I think this is fixed in HIVE-592. We need to verify it's actually fixed or not., yeah - positive.  it might work 'once'. but if u repeat the recipe - it will fail because 'a' points to 'a_tmp' next time., yeah - positive.  it might work 'once'. but if u repeat the recipe - it will fail because 'a' points to 'a_tmp' next time., interesting - i am hitting on our internal clusters. 592 seems pretty old., Joydeep is correct; there is still a bug here.

This works:

create table a(i int);
alter table a rename to b;
describe extended a;

But this does not:

create table a(i int);
create table c like a;
alter table c rename to d;
describe extended d;

Nor does this:

create table a (int);
alter table a set tblproperties ('EXTERNAL' = 'FALSE');
alter table a rename to e;
describe extended e;

Here's what is going on.  

(1) When ALTER TABLE RENAME sees a table with the 'EXTERNAL' property (regardless of the value), it treats it as an external table and does not do the relocation.  This is incorrect, since when 'EXTERNAL' = 'FALSE', it is not an external table.

(2) CREATE TABLE LIKE always adds an EXTERNAL property (setting it to FALSE unless the table is an external table).

So, the bug will typically only show up on a table which was originally created with CREATE TABLE LIKE and then renamed.
