[The default settings in common/src/main/resources/hive-log4j2.properties need to be updated.
, https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/common/src/main/resources/hive-log4j2.properties#L51 gets deleted after 30 days., Thanks for pointing that out [~prasanth_j]!
So its only hive1 line with log4j v1 that has this issue.
As people migrate to hive2 this is less of an issue.
, [~anagarwal] any changes for this would be applicable only to branch-1 of hive.
, [~thejas] Looks like the delete facility via  "log4j.appender.DRFA.MaxBackupIndex"  is provided as part of org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender and not  org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender. Additionally the PidDailyRollingFileAppender has to be extended from RollingFileAppender.

Please do let me know if i go ahead with the respective changes for this ?
, Looks like the behavior of RollingFileAppender is to rollover the files based on size, not on the date. I am not sure if we want to change the behavior in the hive1 line as we strive for backward compatibility with changes there. Is there any straightforward way to delete the old files without changing the date based rolling of log files ?

Updating PidDailyRollingFileAppender is optional as it seems to be targeted at the hive-cli use case, which is not likely to run for days and require rollover of log files.
, the hive 1.x uses log4j v1 where the daily rolling file appender does not support the ability to delete logs older than x days, the only way is to move to rolling File appender which will then change the rollover capability based on size rather than date.

Since date based roll overs allow a better /  easier way of look at logs of the system, we have decided to not do anything on this branch for now. 

logs older than 'x' days have to be either manually deleted of a cron job looking at file patterns in the log directory can be scheduled to remove older logs.]
