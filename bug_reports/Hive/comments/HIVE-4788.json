ATTACHMENT ID: 12662453, This is really a simple patch. Could anyone review this?, @[~Navis]: Could you please clarify why this solves the problem? Wouldn't this have an effect on data that's compressed using, say, GZip?, I met the same problem with BZip2Codec, but Gzip is ok.  If codes is BZip2Codec, it already have resetState in createInputStream. Repeat create lead to can't read the header, because the position of stream is end.,
