[Do not log out the error for get_database in RetryingHMSHander.java. With this change, we only got one line warning:
15/03/11 00:55:22 WARN metastore.ObjectStore: Failed to get database nonexisting, returning NoSuchObjectException
HIVE-7737 and HIVE-8564 solved the similar issue for get_table to an nonexisting table.
Please review the patch and thanks,
