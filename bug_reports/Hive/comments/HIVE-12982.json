[We found out the root cause of this issue in WebHCat. The issue with the plugin version of javadoc we were using in maven project. We had javadoc plugin version 2.9.1 in pom.xml.
To fix this issue we had to downgrade the plugin back to 2.4 i.e.

<maven.javadoc.plugin.version>2.4</maven.javadoc.plugin.version> 

And this resolved the problem.]
