[[~jdere] Patch is ready for review., Talked to Vaibhav offline and confirmed that the changes are supposed to have the desired logic:

| |AUTH_TYPE param not set|heading 3| | |
| NOSASL	| Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_SIMPLE	| Do nothing | Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_SIMPLE | Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_SIMPLE |
| KERBEROS | Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_TOKEN | Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_TOKEN | Do nothing | Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_TOKEN |
| OTHER |  |  |  |  |, Whoops, pressed "Add" before I was done with creating the table. Logic supposed to match this:

|*AUTH MODE* | *AUTH_TYPE param not set*| *AUTH_SIMPLE* | *AUTH_TOKEN* | *AUTH_OTHER* | 
|*NOSASL*| Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_SIMPLE | Do nothing | Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_SIMPLE | Set AUTH_TYPE=AUTH_SIMPLE |
|*KERBEROS* | Use TGT from Ticket Cache | Use TGT from Ticket Cache | Do nothing | Use TGT from Ticket Cache |
|*OTHER*|Do nothing |Do nothing |Do nothing |Do nothing |, +1,
