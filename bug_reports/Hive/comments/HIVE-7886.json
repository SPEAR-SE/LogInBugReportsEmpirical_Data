[The data files are in correct RCFile format. When I run 'select *' on this table, the data is returned correctly., The same issue occurs in Hive 0.12. But it worked when column pruning was disabled by setting the property 'hive.optimize.cp' to false.
For Hive 0.13 this property was disabled as part of [HIVE-4113|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4113].
, The reason is the difference in behavior of InputStream between HDFS and S3. For a HDFS file, the input stream used is DFSInputStream and for an S3 file, the input stream used is NativeS3FsInputStream. Filed a JIRA in Hadoop Common - [HADOOP-11270|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11270].

Will close this ticket once the Hadoop issue is fixed and the Hive query is verified.]
