[For non-temp tables (and temp non-external tables), it looks like Warehouse.getDnsPath() is used to properly format the table location string before the location is saved. This needs to be done for temp external tables as well., Attaching patch. Looks like MiniMR does not catch this issue for some reason, therefore I am not updating the temp_table_external test.,
