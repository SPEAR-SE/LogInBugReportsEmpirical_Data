[Add hive.resultset.use.unique.column.names (HIVE-6687)., Copied from HIVE-6037 (edited for brevity):

HIVE-5843 introduces 13 new config params, but HIVE-6606 removes two of them.

* hive.txn.manager, -hive.txn.driver- (removed), -hive.txn.connection.string- (removed), hive.txn.timeout, hive.txn.max.open.batch, hive.txn.testing, hive.compactor.initiator.on, hive.compactor.worker.threads, hive.compactor.worker.timeout, hive.compactor.check.interval, hive.compactor.delta.num.threshold, hive.compactor.delta.pct.threshold, hive.compactor.abortedtxn.threshold

Note added later:  hive.txn.testing has also been removed., HIVE-6903 changes the default value of hive.metastore.execute.setugi to true in trunk (for 0.14.0)., * HIVE-6743 added hive.tez.log.level (for 0.13.0).

* HIVE-6447 added hive.convert.join.bucket.mapjoin.tez (for 0.13.0)., HIVE-6741 added more information to the description of hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop (for 0.14.0)., The old hive-default.xml.template file includes two entries for *hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown* (from HIVE-6070 and HIVE-6188).

That will be fixed by HIVE-6037, but we should add the name of another parameter to the description as done in the HIVE-6188 patch and the wiki:

* [HIVE-6188 patch | https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12637478/HIVE-6188.patch]
* [wikidoc for hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown]

For details see:

* [HIVE-6188 comment about duplicate parameter | https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6188?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=14001236#comment-14001236], According to a comment in HiveConf.java (from HIVE-4440), *hive.mapjoin.bucket.cache.size* should be removed: 

{quote}
+ // hive.mapjoin.bucket.cache.size has been replaced by hive.smbjoin.cache.row,
+ // need to remove by hive .13. Also, do not change default (see SMB operator)
{quote}

Also, that comment has a typo in the name of the parameter replacing *hive.mapjoin.bucket.cache.size* and the typo is replicated in the HIVE-6037 patch -- the new parameter is *hive.smbjoin.cache.rows*, not hive.smbjoin.cache.row., The fix for hive.user.install.directory in HIVE-6582 has been included in release 0.13.0, so it isn't needed here., bq. The fix for hive.user.install.directory in HIVE-6582 has been included in release 0.13.0, so it isn't needed here.

Actually, the patch for HIVE-6037 should be checked for four semicolons ( &lt ; and &gt ; ) in the description of hive.user.install.directory -- they are missing from HiveConf.java in HIVE-6037.17.patch although HIVE-6037-0.13.0 has "<" and ">"., Descriptions are available for hive.metastore.try.direct.sql & hive.metastore.try.direct.sql.ddl (see patch for HIVE-6188 or wiki).  They are included in the 0.13.0 hive-default.xml.template file., Descriptions for hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys & hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable were added to hive-default.xml.template in Hive 0.13.0 by HIVE-6188.  They are also in the wiki:  

* [hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys]
* [hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable]
, HIVE-7140 changes the default value for hive.metastore.client.socket.timeout from 20 seconds to 600 seconds in Hive 0.14.0.  The change was made in HiveConf.java but not in hive-default.xml.template., See HIVE-7227 for a list of parameters that don't have descriptions yet., HIVE-7219 adds hive.exec.orc.encoding.strategy with a description in hive-default.xml.template for release 0.14.0., Transfers from HIVE-6037 comments (through Feb. 23, 2014):

HIVE-860 might add hive.cache.runtime.jars in release 0.14.0 with a description in hive-default.xml.template.

HIVE-6429 added hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys in 0.13.0.  HIVE-6188 added a description to hive-default.xml.template so it's in the 0.13.0 release but isn't in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0 (link below).

HIVE-6455 added hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition in 0.13.0 with a description, which is in the release but isn't in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0.

HIVE-3635 added hive.lazysimple.extended_boolean_literal in 0.14.0 with a description in hive-default.xml.template.

* [patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0 | https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12634329/HIVE-6037-0.13.0], That's it for transfers of parameter comments from HIVE-6037 (through June 30, 2014).  Other parameters mentioned in HIVE-6037's comments are already included in release 0.13.0 and their descriptions are in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12634329/HIVE-6037-0.13.0).

Just for completeness:  HIVE-7227 has a list of parameters without descriptions.  They don't have to be fixed with this jira ticket., HIVE-6689 added hive.display.partition.cols.separately in 0.13.0.  It isn't in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12634329/HIVE-6037-0.13.0)., HIVE-6492 added hive.limit.query.max.table.partition in 0.13.0. It isn't in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12634329/HIVE-6037-0.13.0)., HIVE-6782 added hive.localize.resource.wait.interval & hive.localize.resource.num.wait.attempts in 0.13.0. They aren't in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0., HIVE-6749 changed the default value of hive.auto.convert.join.use.nonstaged to false in 0.13.0.  The change isn't in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0., HIVE-6697 added hive.server2.authentication.spnego.keytab and hive.server2.authentication.spnego.principal in 0.13.0. They aren't in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0., HIVE-5351 added three HiveServer2 configuration parameters in 0.13.0.  Patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0 includes them without their descriptions, which are:

* hive.server2.use.SSL:  Set this to true for using SSL encryption in HiveServer2.
* hive.server2.keystore.path:  SSL certificate keystore location.
* hive.server2.keystore.password:  SSL certificate keystore password., HIVE-6643 added hive.exec.check.crossproducts in 0.13.0.  It isn't in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0., HIVE-7209 changes the description of hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager in 0.14.0., HIVE-4209 added hive.cache.expr.evaluation in 0.12.0, but patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0 truncates its description to just the first sentence.  The full description should be:

{quote}
If true, the evaluation result of a deterministic expression referenced twice or more will be cached. For example, in a filter condition like ".. where key + 10 > 10 or key + 10 = 0" the expression "key + 10" will be evaluated/cached once and reused for the following expression ("key + 10 = 0"). Currently, this is applied only to expressions in select or filter operators.
{quote}, HIVE-7231 adds hive.exec.orc.default.block.size & hive.exec.orc.block.padding.tolerance in 0.14.0 with descriptions in hive-default.xml.template.  It also changes the default for hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size to "64L * 1024 * 1024" (HiveConf.java) or "67108864" (template, same value).

Note:  The description of hive.exec.orc.block.padding.tolerance is slightly inaccurate -- instead of saying "as a percentage of stripe size" it should say "as a decimal fraction of stripe size."

Update 28/Jul/14:  HIVE-7490 changed the default of hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size, so that doesn't have to be done here., HIVE-6846 added hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist in 0.13.0, with a description in the HiveConf.java comment which isn't in hive-default.xml.template (nor in patch HIVE-6037-0.13.0).

The wiki has a revised description -- I recommend using it without the full parameter list, just refer to HIVE-6846 for the list:

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist], /**
 *===============   Patch 20 for HIVE-6037 has been committed.   ===============
 */

* [Patch 20 | https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12655439/HIVE-6037.20.patch.txt], HIVE-6503 updated the description of hive.server2.authentication to include PAM (for HIVE-6466).  That update needs to be added to the new, improved HiveConf.java., Also, a new value for hive.server2.authentication needs a description:  NOSASL.  It was added in 0.13.0 by a JIRA that I can't find, although there's helpful information in HIVE-4232 including this from [~cdrome]:

* [comment on HIVE-4232 from Chris Drome, 04/Apr/13 | https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4232?focusedCommentId=13622931&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13622931]

{quote}
...to summarize the current state:

hive-site.xml -> transport -> JDBC connection string

1. hive.server2.authentication=NOSASL -> raw transport -> jdbc:hive2://host:port/dbname;auth=noSasl
2. hive.server2.authentication=NONE -> plain SASL transport -> jdbc:hive2://host:port/dbname
  (*DEFAULT*)
3. hive.server2.authentication=KERBEROS -> Kerberos SASL transport -> jdbc:hive2://host:port/dbname;principal=<principal>
{quote}

Googling "Hive NOSASL" also turned up some information in Cloudera & Hortonworks documentation.  Cloudera says Beeline doesn't work with NOSASL, and Hortonworks says hive.server2.enable.doAs can't be true when hive.server2.authentication is NOSASL.

* [Cloudera's Hue issues -- Beeline conflict | http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/CDH4/4.3.0/CDH4-Release-Notes/cdh4ki_topic_1_14.html]
* [Hortonworks' ODBC Driver doc -- hive.server2.enable.doAs | http://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Hortonworks-Hive-ODBC-Driver-User-Guide.pdf]

What JIRA ticket added NOSASL to hive.server2.authentication in 0.13.0?  (It was committed before 26 Sept. 2013 -- see NOSASL in HIVE-4763 patch.), HIVE-4123 added hive.exec.orc.write.format (default changed by HIVE-5091﻿) with a skimpy description.  An improved description is available in the comments to HIVE-4123 or the wiki., Descriptions of some of the parameters added by HIVE-5728 in 0.13.0 have been fleshed out in the wiki:

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.exec.orc.default.row.index.stride | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.exec.orc.default.row.index.stride] 
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.exec.orc.default.buffer.size | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.exec.orc.default.buffer.size] 
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.exec.orc.default.block.padding | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.exec.orc.default.block.padding], The description of hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size (added by HIVE-5425 in 0.13.0) should specify units:

bq.  Define the default ORC stripe size, in bytes., Some parameter descriptions from HIVE-6360 could be improved, although two of these are trivial:

* hive.exec.orc.zerocopy should be augmented with Hadoop version information:  "Use zerocopy reads with ORC. (This requires Hadoop 2.3 or later.)"
* hive.tez.input.format should capitalize Tez and explain what AM means:  "The default input format for Tez. Tez groups splits in the AM (ApplicationMaster)."
* hive.tez.container.size should add "... the default":  "By default Tez will spawn containers of the size of a mapper. This can be used to overwrite the default."
* hive.tez.java.opts, also add "... the default":  "By default Tez will use the Java options from map tasks. This can be used to overwrite the default.", HIVE-6586.patch addresses all the fixes listed in the comments (except ones that had already been fixed), tidies up some line breaks, and makes minor edits to parameter descriptions.

The template file generated from the revised HiveConf.java is also attached., I'm going to need some help posting the patch on RB.  Its UI kept cycling back to "Select a repository" after I gave it the base directory.  And apparently RBTools for Mac OS X needs Debian or Ubuntu, which I don't have and don't want to install just for one tool.  Should I try a browser other than Safari?, No help needed -- Firefox solved my UI problems on the Review Board., Added review https://reviews.apache.org/r/25682/., Rebased and fixed a few issues, including inability of template file to display angle brackets properly.  Generated and verified a new template file (also attached).  I'll update the review board.  Another comment will list the parameters that have significant changes to their descriptions -- no new parameters are added by this patch., Patch 2 adds descriptions for 7 parameters, removes angle brackets from descriptions of 2 parameters, improves descriptions of 24 parameters, and makes trivial edits and format changes to many more.

If that's too much to review, I can strip out the trivial changes and create a new patch.  (But I'd only try to get the changes in at a later time, so why not deal with them now?)

If you don't have time to review the whole patch, please review the parameters you created.

7 descriptions added:

* hive.metastore.try.direct.sql -- HIVE-4051, [~sershe]
* hive.metastore.try.direct.sql.ddl -- HIVE-5626, [~sershe]
* hive.txn.manager -- HIVE-5843, [~alangates]

* hive.server2.keystore.path -- HIVE-5351, [~prasadm]
* hive.server2.keystore.password -- HIVE-5351, [~prasadm]

2 sets of angle brackets removed:

* hive.metastore.disallow.incompatible.col.type.changes -- HIVE-4409, [~dilipjoseph]
* hive.cache.expr.evaluation -- HIVE-4209, [~navis]

24 improvements:

* hive.server2.async.exec.shutdown.timeout



, Patch 2 has been uploaded to the review board:  https://reviews.apache.org/r/25682/., A few small comments left on review board., Marking as blocker to get included in 0.14.0.

Error in previous change list:  hive.server2.authentication doesn't have a new description, it just adds PAM and NOSASL to the existing description.  PAM was added by HIVE-6466 ([~vgumashta]) but I don't know which jira added NOSASL.  Sorry about the false alarm, [~cwsteinbach]., Giving this jira ticket a new title, since no parameters are being added.

New patch coming soon...., Cancel patch2 in favor of patch3., Patch 3 is for branch-0.14, not for trunk., Patch 3 incorporates Alan Gates' review suggestions and omits inessential changes (minor edits and line breaks)., My attempts to upload patch 3 into the RB failed.  I'll try again tomorrow.

I suppose the problem was that I said trunk was the base directory, which it was for the first two patches but for patch 3 the base directory was branch-0.14.  Entering "branch-0.14" in the RB's "Update Diff" window gave an error, though.  I think I need remedial RB training.  Or do I just need to open a new review request based on branch-0.14?, Here's the list of changes to parameter descriptions in patch 3 (in order of appearance in HiveConf.java and the template file):

hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode        -- add nonstrict value to description
hive.metastore.try.direct.sql                -- add description

hive.merge.orcfile.stripe.level               -- add "or hive.merge.tezfiles" to description 
hive.exec.orc.write.format                    -- explain possible values

hive.tez.cpu.vcores                             -- add line break
hive.stats.dbclass                               -- add "fs" to description and explain values 
hive.zookeeper.client.port                    -- add line breaks and space between words

hive.txn.max.open.batch                     -- improve description (already reviewed by Alan Gates)
hive.compactor.initiator.on                   -- improve description, revise per Alan Gates' review

hive.server2.keystore.password             -- add description
hive.tez.dynamic.partition.pruning          -- add line breaks (needed \n), capitalize Tez, Patch 3 doesn't apply cleanly on trunk., [~leftylev] - just make your patch work against trunk. I'll take care of committing it to .14 when it's ready to go., Patch 4 has the same changes as patch 3 but it's based on trunk instead of branch-0.14.

It revises some transaction parameter descriptions per [~alangates]' review, and omits most of patch 2's minor edits and line-break changes., Patch 4 uploaded successfully to the review board:  https://reviews.apache.org/r/25682/.

(They're calling it #5.)

Could someone please review it?, +1 LGTM, .5 is the same as .4 - just reuploading to trigger a build. ([~leftylev] please do not upload another hive-default.xml.template, I think that's confusing the system)., bq.  ... do not upload another hive-default.xml.template ...

Okay, sorry about that.  Thanks [~hagleitn].,
