[same, Hello,

I had just the same error with hive-1.1.1 and hadoop-2.6.0
Changing to hive-1.2.1 (hadoop-2.6.0) solved it for me.

cheers

ps: I first mistakenly kept my $HIVE_HOME (in .bashrc) set to my hive-1.1.1 home dir, and got the same error while running hive-1.2.1/bin/hive client. So watchout and remember to update your $HIVE_HOME when upgrading.,
