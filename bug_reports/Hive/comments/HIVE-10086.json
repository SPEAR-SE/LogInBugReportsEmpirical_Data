[Attached is the patch that handles schema that do not match between Parquet and Hive.

The access to Parquet data is with name matching in this case. The table column may have different schema order, but if the name matches the parquet column name, then the value is retrieved.

Also, if the Hive schema has columns and struct elements that do not match with the Parquet schema, then it will return NULL values instead. , [~xuefuz] [~szehon] Could you help me review this patch?, Add link to RB
https://reviews.apache.org/r/32499/, [~rdblue] Could you help me review this?, +1 to the latest patch. Looks great!,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12707844 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I think the test failure on smb_mapjoin_8.q is not related - I've seen it before, and also the same test succeeded on my local machine., Committed to trunk. Thanks Sergio!, Interesting, [~csun], I was not able to find the commit history in trunk git log. , This is the commit message in SVN:

Sometimes it take a while before git shows the commit.., Hi [~ctang.ma], I think git repo is not sync up with svn repo. You can get this commit information from SVN. I just tried. :)
