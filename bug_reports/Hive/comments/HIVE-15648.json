[[~thejas] [~anishek] can you please review?, +1
Please go ahead and commit.
, Committed. Thanks [~thejas], It turns out the inclusion of powermock in base pom.xml was an error in applying the patch. My guess is that I must have done a 'patch -p1' which applied the beeline/pom.xml changes to base pom.xml while it failed to apply rest of the changes, and later used 'patch -p0' to apply the whole patch.
Thanks for pointing this out [~anishek]. 
[~anishek] Can you please create a new jira to remove it from base pom.xml ?

, New Jira @ HIVE-15656, I have reopened this issue: explanation can be found in HIVE-15656. Thanks, Will track fix via new commit for HIVE-15550 .
