[What is the callstack for the exception you are getting? If it's in directsql, the problem is better solved there. It's already fixed in partition retrieval code, See this code:
{noformat}

    // Get full objects. For Oracle, do it in batches.
    List<Partition> result = null;
    if (batchSize != NO_BATCHING && batchSize < sqlResult.size()) {
      result = new ArrayList<Partition>(sqlResult.size());
      while (result.size() < sqlResult.size()) {
        int toIndex = Math.min(result.size() + batchSize, sqlResult.size());
        List<Object> batchedSqlResult = sqlResult.subList(result.size(), toIndex);
        result.addAll(getPartitionsFromPartitionIds(dbName, tblName, isView, batchedSqlResult));
      }
    } else {
      result = getPartitionsFromPartitionIds(dbName, tblName, isView, sqlResult);
    }
{noformat}, Thanks for the info [~sershe]. I posted the stack trace above and the it's in JDO query. I followed the deleteDB() to put the code in HiveMetaStore.java, but probably it's better to do it in ObjectStore.java?, Oh, nm, then the patch makes sense, I didn't realize JDO is also affected by this. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12745441 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Seems the failures are not caused by the patch, but TestEmbeddedHiveMetaStore is important test case for this patch. Resubmit the patch to get it tested.,
