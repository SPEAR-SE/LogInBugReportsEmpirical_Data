[bq. ALTER TABLE foo ADD PARTITION (b='07', c='08');

Is the right fix to do type safe partition creates instead of accepting strings there?, Thank you [~gopalv],

Would that keep compatibility? For instance, on such an existent table? And will inserting a b=7 produce a second partition?

Can the GenericUDFIn not be changed to match MySQL approach instead, where the IN(â€¦) types are converted to match the column type instead of vice-versa? The class-doc states it was done to keep consistency with other UDF approaches.

 * Also noteworthy: type conversion behavior is different from MySQL. With
 * expr IN expr1, expr2... in MySQL, exprN will each be converted into the same
 * type as expr. In the Hive implementation, all expr(N) will be converted into
 * a common type for conversion consistency with other UDF's, and to prevent
 * conversions from a big type to a small type (e.g. int to tinyint)
