[I have the same issue., version: hive-0.7.1-cdh3u2, version: hive-0.7.0-update
I only write a UDTF 'desc_t' to solve the problem temporarily.
, can you paste your UDTF here?, The source code is too long, so i write the steps:
1. Get the data from metadata---mysql tables(COLUMNS, TBLS);
2. Write the UDTF, and the parameter is the table name.

You can write a function to extend GenericUDTF and to override the process method., The problem is org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.formatting.TextMetaDataFormatter.describeTable() use DataOutputStream.writeBytes() to output column info string. Unfortunately, DataOutputStream.writeBytes() will only write out lower byte of each character in the String, which cause garbling problem when column comment contains non-latin1 characters.

This simple patch solved Unicode character garbling problem when describe table in Hive client., Simple patch to resolve the garbling problem of column comment which contains unicode characters., navis requested code review of "HIVE-2905 [jira] Desc table can't show non-ascii comments".

Reviewers: JIRA

HIVE-2905 Desc table cannot show non-ascii comments

When desc a table with command line or hive jdbc way, the table's comment can't be read.
1. I have updated javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL parameter in hive-site.xml file.
   jdbc:mysql://...:3306/hive?characterEncoding=UTF-8
2. In mysql database, the comment field of COLUMNS table can be read normally.

This message is automatically generated., Can we add some comments stating that unicode comments are ok bit not columns / tables. It might br nice to add to a faq language manual as well., I am removing the Patch Available status since there is an open request from a reviewer., [~brocknoland] You do not necessarily have to cancel the patch over it, comments do not need retesting. It would be a nice to have not a blocker., Also I do not always bounce back petty things like this or spelling mistakes to the original author. It's a big time suck I just fix them and commit., [~appodictic] Sounds good and thanks for the feedback!  I am trying to help cleanup the PA queue and it's good to get feedback as to how aggressive I am being., It just depends how 'letter of the law' we want to be. Sometimes if you ask for something small and people get busy the issue gets delayed days or weeks, the the reviewer gets busy then it gets delayed again. I would not kick a patch batch for a typo or a checkstyle violation, I usually just fix it and re-upload the patch, just use your judgement. I am going to email the list on a few related items., added to FAQ(https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/User+FAQ#UserFAQ-DoesHivesupportUnicode%3F), +1, Thank you everyone involved. Great to see hive adoption in languages I do not understand!, This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.]
