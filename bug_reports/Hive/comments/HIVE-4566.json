[The patch is to fix the NPE., As in original description, I like the idea of printing "No current connection" in such scenarios but I don't think current patch prints it. Can you modify your test to make sure that indeed gets printed?, Patch updated with the following assertions in the test case:

+   Assert.assertTrue( output.contains("No current connection") );

Commadline console output with the fix:

beeline> !typeinfo   
No current connection
beeline> !nativesql
No current connection

, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Xuefu!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2129 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2129/])
