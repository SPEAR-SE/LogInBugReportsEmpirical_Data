ATTACHMENT ID: 12655851, Patch only added new q file tests, the other failures are not related., +1, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks for the contribution Jason!
, This jira just adds tests so it doesn't need any user doc, but quoted identifiers for names should be documented.  Which jira would that be?, The quoted identifier support was added as part HIVE-6013 by [~rhbutani] . This is just testing that it works with role names as well. If i remember right, HIVE-6013 talks only about column names because only that was tested as that part of the patch.

Yes, we should document that role names can also be quoted identifier., Good, HIVE-6013 is already documented so it's easy to add this to the wiki.  Thanks, Thejas.

One question:  why don't these tests specify hive.support.quoted.identifiers?  Oh, nevermind, its default setting is column., Another question:  If hive.support.quoted.identifiers is set to none, can back-ticks be used for regular expressions in user & role names?  I'll try to dodge the issue in the doc, for now.

Presumably quoted user/role names can have Unicode characters, since the test's role name has a space (create role `src Role2`).  But the SQL Std Auth doc says user names are managed outside of Hive, so maybe Unicode doesn't work for them.

And presumably this applies to both SQL standard based and default authorization, so I updated both docs with identical information:

* [SQL Standard Based Hive Authorization -- Names of Users and Roles | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization#SQLStandardBasedHiveAuthorization-NamesofUsersandRoles]
* [Hive Authorization -- Names of Users and Roles | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Authorization#LanguageManualAuthorization-NamesofUsersandRoles]

But if Unicode is permitted in user/role names, then the description of hive.support.quoted.identifiers should be revised to include them.  Or even if Unicode isn't permitted, the parameter should mention user and role names.

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.support.quoted.identifiers | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.support.quoted.identifiers], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
