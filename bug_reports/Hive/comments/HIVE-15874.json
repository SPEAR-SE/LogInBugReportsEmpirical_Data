[Use MR engine. 
Before CBO optimize, processPositionAlias will be called once. 'select 2017 as a, b from alias_test_02 group by 1, 2' will be transformed into  'select 2017 as a, b from alias_test_02 group by 2017, b'.
When CBO optimize failed and reAnalyzeAST is set to true, processPositionAlias will be called twice. '2017' will be considered to column alias. Error : 'Invalid position alias in Group By' will occur.
Obviously, we just need process position alias one time. So the most intuitive and effective way is stepping processPositionAlias out of genResolvedParseTree., LGTM +1,
