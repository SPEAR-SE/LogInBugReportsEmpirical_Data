[I have verified with trunk code if set a value for "mapred.reduce.tasks" this property it will take effect and it will start that many reducers.

Can u add u r scenario with little more details.

What is the suggested value for setting number of reducers is
http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/JobConf.html#setNumReduceTasks(int)., I think, you mentioned about "mapred.reduce.tasks.force" means there're some situations when "mapred.reduce.tasks" is not working.

For example, ORDER BY col1 SQL statement should run on only 1 reducer because it requires global sorting.

So I wonder if "mapred.reduce.tasks.force" is set, should reducers numbers always apply for every case even though result can be incorrect?

anyway, more detailed scenario will be helpful.]
