Review request for hive and Carl Steinbach.


Summary
-------

The Hive server currently has the framework to process the Cli commands like 'set'. But it returns an empty schema definition for these resultsets. The patch here is to add a getSchema() to the CommandResponse interface. The SetProcessor is modified to build a schema object which is returned with getSchema.
HiveServer is modified to call the getSchema for command cases as well.


This addresses bug HIVE-2398.
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2398

Please add a testcase. Also, I tried running 'set -v' from the CLI after setting hive.cli.print.header=true, and I don't see the column name in the output. This seems like a bug?

    Checkstyle: static final variable names should appear in ALL CAPS

    bld? Might be good to change the name to getSchema. Also, since setColName is a constant there's no need for this method to have an input parameter.

<https://reviews.apache.org/r/1605/#comment4247>

    Please add static imports for STRING_TYPE_NAME, SERIALIZATION_NULL_FORMAT, and defaultNullString.

    This comment is no longer valid. Also, it might be cleaner to remove the else clause.

Review request for hive and Carl Steinbach.


Changes
-------

Changes per review comments. 
Added a JDBC test.

The CLI behaviour does look like a but. The JDBC and ODBC client are working fine, but CLI is not printing the header. I will go ahead and log a separate Jira for that.

The Hive server currently has the framework to process the Cli commands like 'set'. But it returns an empty schema definition for these resultsets. The patch here is to add a getSchema() to the CommandResponse interface. The SetProcessor is modified to build a schema object which is returned with getSchema.

    Need to assert that the size of the resultset is > 0. Might also be good to log the contents of the resultset.

Review request for hive and Carl Steinbach.


Changes
-------

Added check for resultset non empty. 
The full "set -v" output would be too long, also most of the rows will different in each test setup. Hence I am suggesting not to do that. Let me know if you disagree.


Summary
-------

The Hive server currently has the framework to process the Cli commands like 'set'. But it returns an empty schema definition for these resultsets. The patch here is to add a getSchema() to the CommandResponse interface. The SetProcessor is modified to build a schema object which is returned with getSchema.
