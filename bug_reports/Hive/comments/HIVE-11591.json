[The patch. We can commit it now, and then presumably get the benefit when someone upgrades to 0.9.3 and re-gens the files, or we can wait and regen/commit after 0.9.3 upgrade., If 0.9.3 is not yet released I say we wait.

I eyeballed the generated code, the only differences in Java files, other than the dates being gone, are the removal of Foo.valueOf(bar) when returning things (e.g. return getBlah() instead of return Long.valueOf(getBlah())), Thrift 0.9.3 is stable and is available on homebrew for mac, [~sushanth] [~thejas] [~ashutoshc] fyi,
