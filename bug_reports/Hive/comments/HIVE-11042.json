ATTACHMENT ID: 12740423 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The one failure is not related. Its age is 2.
[~csun], [~szehon], could you review the change? Thanks, This code overlaps a lot with the existing replaceTaskId(String, String). Is it possible to just modify that method?, Also, comments for this method needs a little improvement. For instance, "for example" -> "For example", "This method, pattern is in taskId." -> "In this method, pattern is in taskId", etc., [~csun], it will cause more confusing if I change the existing replaceTaskId(String, String), the major part is different and can not combined. In replaceTaskId(String param1, String param2)  use case is pattern in param2, get pattern from param2, get lengh from param1 and replace param2. param2 called bucket number but it is major for bucket file(I think).
replaceTaskId(String param1, int param2) Is get pattern and length from from param1 and use param2 number .
It is not just switch order of the two params. 
I will change the comment and resubmit the patch. Thanks, PATCH 2 is attached. Please review. , But it is confusing to have to replaceTaskId methods (although slightly different parameters), and doing very different things.
Maybe rename them? Also, why this method is public instead of private? The comments for Patch #2 is still not changed., [~csun], I think replaceTaskId( string , int) is a right name, we may need fix other method names. I will submit a different jira and work on it once I am fully understand other methods' use case. 
I make it public because I could do some unit test on it. It should have no harm. We have a couple of replaceTask...method is public too.
I do not know why my git diff always give me previous version of change, but after I create a new branch and cherry-pick my change, the issue is solved. Attach new version of patch 2. Thanks. ,
