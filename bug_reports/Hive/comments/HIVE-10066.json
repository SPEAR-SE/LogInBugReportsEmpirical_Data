[added a new property to webhcat config to specify additional artifacts to include with Hive job submission.  This can be used, in particular, to ship Tez client to the node actually executing the command.

[~thejas], could you review please?, [~ekoifman] Some questions about the objectives, based on the config param description - 

bq. If the path /foo/bar is a directory, the contents of the the entire dir will be localized  and ./foo/* will be added to HADOOP_CLASSPATH
Is it /foo/bar that is localized or is it /foo ? If it is /foo/bar, why is /foo/* added to classpath ?

bq. In the example above, "./tez-site.xml:./tez-client/*:./lib/*" will be added to  HADOOP_CLASSPATH.
Or is it "./tez-site.xml:./tez-client/*:/tez-client/lib/*"
, this is the way "hadoop jar -files /foo/bar" works.  If bar is a directory, it will create bar/ in CWD of the task with contents of bar/.  If bar is a file, it will create ./bar., Then it sounds like the right description is - If the path /foo/bar is a directory, the contents of the the entire dir will be localized and *./bar/** will be added to HADOOP_CLASSPATH, patch 2 addresses comments from [~thejas], +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12707814 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to trunk.  Thanks [~thejas] for the review., Doc note:  This adds *templeton.hive.extra.files* to webhcat-default.xml and webhcat-site.xml, so it needs to be documented in the wiki for release 1.2.0.

* [WebHCat Configuration -- Configuration Variables | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Configure#WebHCatConfigure-ConfigurationVariables], HIVE-9486 added dependency on hive-common.jar, FYI, this patch's call to {{FileStatus#isDirectory}} does not work when linking against Hadoop 1 using {{-Phadoop-1}}.  I included a fix in my patch for HIVE-10444, which reported a similar problem elsewhere in the code., Thanks [~cnauroth], This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
