[When a mapper returns an empty result set, the ngram UDAF has nothing to merge during the reduce phase, merge(). The code
{code}
int n = Integer.parseInt(partialNGrams.get(partialNGrams.size()-1).toString());
if(myagg.n > 0 && myagg.n != n) {
        throw new HiveException(getClass().getSimpleName() + ": mismatch in value for 'n'"
            + ", which usually is caused by a non-constant expression. Found '"+n+"' and '"
            + myagg.n + "'.");
      }
{code}
In the code snippet above, the variables "n" and "myagg.n" refer to the same value (the n in nGrams). This value gets added to end of the partial nGrams list generated by each mapper. However, this value gets initialized during the map phase (iterate() method call). So if iterate() is never called, when the mapper resultset is empty, this value is never initialized to the "n" value from the query so defaults to java integer default of 0.

The merge() method currently checks for null partial objects
{code}
    public void merge(AggregationBuffer agg, Object partial) throws HiveException {
      if(partial == null) {
        return;
      }
{code}

Given the design, there is atleast one element is this partial buffer (the "n" value) so it may never be null. The merge() should be a no-op if the value of "n" is ZERO.

I will upload a patch shortly.
 , The merge() method during the reduce phase of the ngram UDAF should be a NO-OP when the mapper returns an empty set. The value of ZERO returned in the list (one and only one item) is an indicator that the iterate() method was never called in that map job. So returning from merge() with no action.,
