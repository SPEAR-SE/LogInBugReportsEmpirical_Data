[Does this happen when HMS is embedded in HS2? In case of remote HMS we avoid leaking {{JDOPersistenceManager}} by issuing a {{cleanupRawStore}} in {{deleteContext}}. May be we need to the same in HS2 by detecting if HMS is in embedded mode., Yes, it is happening with embedded metastore in HS2. , GitHub user sankarh opened a pull request:

ATTACHMENT ID: 12932101 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, I took a look at the patch it is unclear to me why the leak is happening. I see that in the initializeHelper method if there is a exception you are issuing a shutdown on the ObjectStore to clean up persistenceManager but shouldn't this uncaught exception cause the thread to be closed in the first place and thereby cleaning up the threadlocal rawstore anyways? Is it better to issue a shutdown on the threadlocal rawstore from {{ThriftBinaryCLIService#deleteContext}} method instead? Based on my understanding it looks like we are trying to keep track of the threadlocal rawstore using custom implementation of Thread in a map and depend on finalize method to do cleanup. This in theory means that cleanup is only happening when the threads are GCed instead of doing it as soon as when sessions are closed. Also, if a thrift thread is reused there would already be an entry in the {{threadRawStoreMap}} and {{cacheThreadLocalRawStore}} will overwrite that entry which can also cause a leak. This can potentially be verified by keeping the min threads and max threads as equal (so no thread is ever GCed) you keep opening and closing connections to HMS, eventually these threadLocalRawstore should pile up., Thanks for the feedback [~vihangk1]!

{quote}

- The PersistenceManagerFactory object "pmf" is a static object which keeps references of the allocated PersistenceManager in pmCache Map. That's why PersistenceManager doesn't get GC'ed and need explicit shutdown for any exception. In this case we retry instead of closing the thread which overwrites the pm object and leaks the old one.

{quote}

- That's a good point. But, I'm not sure if there is any reason for keeping the current implementation with  threadRawStoreMap.

- I think, overwriting the entry by cacheThreadLocalRawStore doesn't cause any leak, because, it overwrites with thread local rawStore which is active in this thread. If the thread local rawStore is changed, it means, the older one was already shutdown gracefully before re-create. Also, threadRawStoreMap shouldn't pile up as we use the same thread id. 

Please let me know if I miss anything., {quote} The PersistenceManagerFactory object "pmf" is a static object which keeps references of the allocated PersistenceManager in pmCache Map.

I see. Thanks for the explanation.

I think you are right. Looks like the model of cleaning up is optimistic in the sense in case the thread is reused, {{Hive#getInternal}} method does some checks to make sure if we can reuse this threadlocal rawstore and cleans it up in case the owner is different or the config is not compatible. So looks like we are good in case of thread re-use because the object which is being overwritten in the {{ThreadWithGarbageCleanup.threadRawStoreMap}} is either replaced with the same object or when the previous one was closed. So that code path looks good to me. This is all very tricky business and I hope there is no other code path which is still leaking the rawstore. 

This patch looks good to me. +1, Thanks for the review [~vihangk1]!
