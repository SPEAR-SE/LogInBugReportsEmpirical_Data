ATTACHMENT ID: 12761542 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks for catching this and the patch [~chengbing.liu]!
Can you also please add a test case for this ? (You can refer to existing tests for examples).
, [~thejas], I find it difficult to add a test case for it from scratch. Do we need to mock {{Table}} and even {{Path}}? And we have to consider HDFS ACL for {{StorageBasedAuthorizationProvider}}..., [~thejas], I think we can add test cases for the authorization part in another JIRA and check this in first, if you think the patch is ok., [~chengbing.liu] It is better to include the tests with fix as far as possible. Otherwise, the tests don't often get added, and we won't notice the regression if it happens again.

Please take a look at the test cases in TestStorageBasedMetastoreAuthorizationReads or TestStorageBasedMetastoreAuthorizationDrops for examples on how to create the test case.
Let me know if you need help with that.
, [~thejas], thanks for the hint. I wasn't aware of itests back then... Uploaded the fix with tests updated.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12767754 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Failed tests are not related., [~chengbing.liu] Thanks for adding the tests for the case where StorageBasedAuthorization is used in the client side.
Can you also please add a test case for StorageBasedAuthorization when used in metastore server, as that is the recommended mode for StorageBasedAuthorization ?

A quick way would be to add this to TestStorageBasedMetastoreAuthorizationReads.java - 
{code}
  @Test
  public void testReadTableSuccessWithReadOnly() throws Exception {
    readTableByOtherUser("-r--r--r--", true);
  }
{code}

, Patch updated., Thanks for the update!

ATTACHMENT ID: 12767946 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The test failures are unrelated.
, Patch committed to master and branch-1 .
, Thanks [~thejas] for review and committing!, Should this bug fix be documented in the wiki?  (If it started with HIVE-7895, it's been around since 0.14.0.)]
