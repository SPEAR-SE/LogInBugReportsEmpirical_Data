[Interestingly, if I write a .q to test this, (and changing QTestUtil to not mask out the location), I do not notice this. This happens only in a deployed cluster. Thus, I do not currently have a unit test for it, but we have a trivially simple reproducer as above., Patch attached., [~alangates], could you please review/look at this? This skirts close to the territory of your Insert/Update/Delete work, and maybe you know a better way of handling this?, [~hagleitn] : One more that should go in for 0.14 - this is a pretty important bug., +1, +1 for hive 14, since this is a regression. It would still be nice to have a test., 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass

I will take on a task on another bug to try and extend the current .q test framework to be able to test this, and file a jira for that., Filed HIVE-8719 for that., Err... HIVE-8741, sorry., Committed to 0.14 and trunk. Thanks Alan & Gunther!, (@[~leftylev] : Again, a bugfix, nothing to doc here.)]
