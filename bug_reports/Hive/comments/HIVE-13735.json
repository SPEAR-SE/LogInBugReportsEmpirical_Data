[Hi, [~rajesh.balamohan].
If there is no one working on this issue, I will try.

However, I imagine that my solution may be ad-hoc; the corresponding code will be executed only under the condition like:
(the query is select) && (have distinct clause) && (select_expr is a partitioning key) && (...).

If it is OK, could anyone assign me to this issue? Thanks., Thanks [~Takuma] - I have updated the assignee.]
