[Code looks good. It might be good to add a test case for this., added test, and also a comment as to what was the problem and the fix will be nice. :), is null, null etc. were moved to generic udfs recently.
PartitionPruner had special handling for udfs, but not for generic udfs - Due to that, it was missing some parititions for queries like:

select * from T where <part_col> = 'val1' and col2 is not null;, +1. Testing. Will commit when passed.
, Committed. Thanks Namit.]
