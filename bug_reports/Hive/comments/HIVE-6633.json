[Code review at https://reviews.apache.org/r/19140/, Looks good to me. Once the precommit tests on this pass, I can commit it., (to be explicit) +1, Committed to trunk after local testing, since the precommit queue is pretty long., Thanks for the fix, Eric!, [~thejas] Can you commit this to 0.13 please?, [~rhbutani] Can you approve this to go into 0.13 please?, +1 for 0.13, Committed to 0.13. Thanks Eric and Harish!, Sushanth, thanks for getting this in to 0.13!, This patch is missing from trunk, Hi,

I'm afraid this patch modified only org.apache.hcatalog.* files, and those were pruned out with the removal of deprecated classes for 0.14. So this patch was committed to trunk, but the changes effectively blown away.

To make commit log tracking easier in this scenario, I'm going to clone this jira to track addition of this same patch to org.apache.hive.hcatalog as well. Eric, could you please regenerate your patch for that?, Re-marking as resolved, and tracking the org.apache.hive.hcatalog issue on HIVE-7901, Thanks Sushanth for tracking down the problem. I'll regenerate the patch and track that on HIVE-7901.]
