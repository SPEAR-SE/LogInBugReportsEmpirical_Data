[Updated UDAFcount to count everything but null., Zheng, 
I submitted a patch. Today I am targeting low hanging-fruit. I hope this is not anything you were looking forward to doing :)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_(SQL)

If one is not interested in reading the reference it works like:

mysql> use test;
mysql> create table the_null( a int);
mysql> insert into the_null (a) values (NULL);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)

mysql> select * from the_null;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| NULL | 
+------+
1 row in set (0.04 sec)

mysql> select count(a) from the_null;
+----------+
| count(a) |
+----------+
|        0 | 
+----------+
1 row in set (0.08 sec)

mysql> select count(*) from the_null;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|        1 | 
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
, Edward, hive trunk/branch 0.4 is using GenericUDAFCount which already has the fix.
We should remove UDAFCount.java from the code base.

I guess you want this for an early version?


, Haha. No, I was just going through some open issues to see if I could lower the count of open issues. I did not realize this was obsoleted. I should have noticed when looking at the function registry. Ow well good practice. Could we comment / remove obsolete jira. Otherwise I will have to ask before starting on something., Already fixed when we move to GenericUDAFCount.]
