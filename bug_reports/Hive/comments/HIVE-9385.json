[[~nimartin], somehow two issues got created for this (HIVE-9384 and HIVE-9385)., [~nimartin] I don't understand your problem.
Do you complain about double format inaccuracy? Or did you expected another result?, [~damien.carol] So I have ~150m rows of sales data in an ORC table and there's a column for the sales amount I'm storing as a double. When I sum on that column I get the value I reported above (4.7...). The true sum of that field is ~$2.5b or so.

When I do the exact same thing (create the same table, store the sales column as a double, sum on that column) but store the table as textfile I get the correct amount. 

So, I'm saying I think there's something going on with sum() on doubles in ORC tables and am hoping someone could give it a shot in their environment and let me know if it appears to be a bug or not., [~nimartin] Could you provide SHOW CREATE TABLE <sales> and the query you use to store sales amount.
Another thing, if you must have precise value for amount, you should use DECIMAL, As we experimented the same issue (double sum excessive value in an ORC table). I did some tests. My table was partitionned and bucketed. Changing the bucket's column did nothing. So I re-created the table without the partition and tadaaa ! My sum is now perfectly correct ! 
Hope it helps!, We are using hive 1.2.1 and facing the same issue.

Is this bug occuring in hive 2.0 also?, hi, 
we are getting the same issue in hive 1.2.1. 
My tables is orc table and partitioned. calculating sum on a double field is not giving accurate value.
expected value is 2.7115388423211*4*E14 but sum value comes as 2.7115388423211*378*E14
 
instead 114 it comes as 11378.
I do not see any round off issue also, I have tried by typecasting it to decimal prior calculating sum. but the getting incorrect result.

is this issue still exist in 1.2.1]
