[The root cause of missing some part of join result is because the join value for the small table is an empty array list (or multiple empty array list). 
So everytime the jdbm will  serialize the nothing on disk for this empty array list.
Also the jdbm will read nothing from disk, which will cause the wrong result problem.
Because it still need this empty array list when doing the join work. 
, I resolve this bug in hive-1641, Can you add a test for the same ?
Set hive.mapjoin.cache.numrows to a lower number, it is set to 25000 currently.
