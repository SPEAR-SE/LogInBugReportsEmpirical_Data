[Clarification:
1) I can set serde for partition. The error I got was due to not having quotes around the serde value
2) The change comes from HIVE-4475. 

So this is not a bug after all but actually a feature. I hope Hive release notes would mention breaking changes like this. Otherwise it's very hard to notice these things. For example, we experienced a correctness bug after upgrading to Hive 11 that forced us to revert to Hive 10 until the bug is fixed. And the next time before we upgraded to 12 we spent a month doing upgrade testing, but still we couldn't catch this. ]
