[We are upgrading to DN 4 somewhere, so maybe we can also switch to a new fancy connection pool after that. Syncing around the connection pool is not really an option, so I don't know what a workaround would be... connection pool threadpool where we kill stuck threads?, This bug maybe a red herring.
but if it isn't there is a way to tell bonecp to timeout getConnection() after specified time.

I agree that it is time to upgrade - last bonecp release was in 2013., case of premature blaming of bonecp]
