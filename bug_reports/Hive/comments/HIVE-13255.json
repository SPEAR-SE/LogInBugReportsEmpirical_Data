[3 perf related issues found in FloatTreeReader.nextVector(). 
1) i2l java bytecode found in inner loop. batchSize is long and loop index is int. This inserts integer 2 long casts in inner loop
2) SerializationUtils.readFloat() has 4 invokevirtual whereas a readDouble has only one as readFloat is not buffered
3) The JVM bytecode size for FloatTreeReader.nextVector() is 334 bytes which will prevent this method from being inlined though being hot (has to less than 325 bytes for hot method inlining)

After the patch the bytecode size is reduced to 300 bytes and float reader perf is <10% in perf-map

cc/ [~gopalv], LGTM - +1.

bq. in.read(readBuffer, 0, 4);

does this need a check for the return value? 

I know that InStream always returns the asked size, but that's not in the contract of InputStream., Updated readFloat and readDouble to honor InputStream read() contract., It definitely needs <0 check. But might not need the looping until requested size satisfied logic. Since we are passing the InputStream instead of InStream (does not need looping logic), I added that as well to the latest patch. Branch prediction + inlining should mitigate the branch cost. ,
