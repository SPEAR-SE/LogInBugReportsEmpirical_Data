[Pls check for the given input data this may be the correct regex

"^(.*data)(.*data).*$", *data
*data
*$, I can't tell in which way you are suggesting the regular expression should change.

If it is about the presence of the backslash before the parentheses, well the hive command line processor seems to require these.

If it is the dot slashes, then the JIRA text editor seems to be mangling. Each Set of parentheses should contain "dot star date" and then there should be "dot star dollar" at the end.

In any case, none of this would account for the fact that "select part1, col1, col2" and "select *" produce different results.

, From jira editor i got this " ^(.data)(.*data).$ " regular expression that's why i suggested like this regex  may be the wrong.

But when i updated the comment i realized that what ever the regular expression is given in the defect description is correct because of the jira editor it is showing wrong regular expression., When ever the regular expression is not matching it is returning null but it should return null row. Same thing is happening with the empty row also., Sorry, this one has gone stale...could you rebase against trunk?, patch is rebased against trunk.
, Can you add a regression test (test fails without patch and passes with patch)? Because currently, serde_regex.q does 'select \*' and passes. , All existing testcases passed in my environment. I have added one testcase for this scenario., Chinna, the testcase passes without the patch also. Can you verify it again?, Please open new jira, still it is a problem on master.]
