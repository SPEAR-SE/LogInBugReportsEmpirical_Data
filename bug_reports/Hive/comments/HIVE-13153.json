[[~vikram.dixit] Can you take a look? I hope I am not breaking CallerContext logging. , Switched log lines before renaming thread per [~gopalv]'s comments., Change logging to debug? Also, should the 2nd call in CliDriver be reset, rather than update? I am not sure about the original logic compatibility, this logic looks good to me., I just copied over the same log level from reset thread name logic. No. I think both are setting the thread name in the original code. Resetting in CliDriver is done elsewhere. ,
