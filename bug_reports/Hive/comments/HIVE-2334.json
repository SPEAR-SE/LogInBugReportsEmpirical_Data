, Patch to fix issue.  The problem was that some commands, such as {{use default}} do not have an associated schema with them from the query processor, but this is expected in the header printing code.  It's questionable if the QP should return a schema object with two null fields, but that should be addressed in another issue.

After patch:

OK
Time taken: 4.013 seconds
hive> set hive.cli.print.header=true;
hive> use default;
OK
Time taken: 0.0090 seconds
hive>{noformat}

The actual fix is simple, but a bit of refactoring was necessary to test it.  I normally wouldn't want to include such refactoring in a bug fix, but this class is ripe for it and the refactorings are a good first step.  The check this via an actual unit test, mockito is introduced, as was also the case in HIVE-2171; whichever goes in last will need to be updated to remove the new library.

The patch is on trunk.  I can generate one for 7.1 if requested.,

    There's already some very limited test coverage for the hive.cli.print.header feature in print_header.q. Why not extend this testcase instead of adding a new unit test?

    We need to manage this dependency with Ivy. The Hive build currently runs against hadoop-0.20.1, which does not include mockito-all-1.8.2.jar

This is how it was in the original code.  All of this can actually be done quite a bit better.  I'm happy to switch to tokenizer; the patch is a bit schizophrenic about refactoring/improving.  I didn't change this since it's not directly related to what I was trying to test.

Because this is an actual unit test against a specific regression, which has value separate from the print_header.q integration test.  I can add additional content to print_header.q, since this test is easier to identify what's gone wrong and runs in about 0.2 seconds, this one seems more useful.

I'm sorry; I don't understand.  This is being brought in by Ivy?  As part of HIVE-2171, I had mentioned we need to make sure testing related jars don't get included during binary/package, but that should be done in a different JIRA.

I'll update cli/build.xml to not be a no-op, unless there's some reason to?

Yup, it needs to be update, or your test will never get run. Inheriting the test target definition from build-common.xml is probably the best option if it works.

Right now the dependency on mockito is unsatisfied. I tried updating cli/build.xml to fix the test target problem and ended up getting a bunch of compilation errors since the mockito jar is not on the classpath.

bq.  As part of HIVE-2171, I had mentioned we need to make sure testing related jars don't get included during binary/package, but that should be done in a different JIRA.

Ivy supports this behavior through the use of configurations. We need to add a 'test' configuration to the root ivy.xml file:

<conf name="test" extends="compile" visibility="private"/>

And then add mockito to the list of dependencies:

<dependency org="org.mockito" name="mockito-all" rev="${mockito-all.version}" conf="test->default"/>

Ok. Please update print_header.q with some additional tests.

Review request for hive.


Changes
-------

* Removed star imports in unit test.
* Added test case to integration test.  Call to use default NPEs before patch, succeeds afterwards
* Removed no-op from cli/build.xml to ensure test runs
* Added mockito into cli's ivy.xml.  The top-level ivy.xml doesn't need changed since the ivy settings aren't inherited.
* Didn't change the split call to tokenize, since it was as is in the original patch.  No need to introduce unnecessary changes.
