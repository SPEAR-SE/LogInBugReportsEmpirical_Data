[Just doing a quick grep audit of other settings, I think the following is also mismatched:

In the format: hive-default.xml => HiveConf.java

hive.default.partition.name => hive.exec.default.partition.name
  - I believe HiveConf.java has the correct value, Yes, HiveConf has the correct values always.

Can you submit a patch for this ?, HIVE-1594.patch applies cleanly to 0.6 and trunk.

Separate patch for branch 0.5 as it was missing the smallfiles.avgsize setting altogether., Yun, we are not actively patching 0.5 right now.
I will review the changes for trunk and 0.6, Committed in 0.6 and trunk. Thanks Yun]
