Seems good., Up for review

https://reviews.apache.org/r/9642/, Updating patch to match review comments., Updated to throw an exception if the cloner throws a SemanticException wrapped around the IllegalAccess or Invocation exception that are possible (but unlikely)., cloneBean() only clones part of the data, does not do a true deep-copy., This is not a pair of operations as previously assumed, but does the deserialization repeatedly for each alias

{code}
 for (int i = 0; i < numAliases; i++) {
       ...
          // create map join task and set big table as i
          ObjectPair<MapRedTask, String> newTaskAlias = convertTaskToMapJoinTask(xml, i);
          MapRedTask newTask = newTaskAlias.getFirst();
          bigTableAlias = newTaskAlias.getSecond();
 }
{code}, Use serialization/deserialization of the MapredWork only for cases which require conditional work., with more comments & dead-code removed, Patch on top of HIVE-3891, HIVE-3996, HIVE-4071, Patch on top of these patches, Opening review once the patch adding AbstractJoinTaskDispatcher.java enters svn., Improvements are obvious and fast

, [~gopalv], does cloneBean() perform a complete deep copy ?, No, [~namit] cloneBean() does not perform a deep copy properly. I had dropped that approach during the third iteration.

SerializationUtils.clone() from apache-commons does do a deepClone, so does uk.com.robust-it's cloning lib. But those do not work because some of the tree items don't implement Serializable or depend on the getter/setter actions.

I updated the patch to not do a serialize/deserialize when the tasks are non-conditional, since the conversion doesn't need to be reversible.

That speeds up query27 by avoiding that step, but the conditional map-joins still need to go through the slow serialize/deserialize pair inside the for loop., [~gopalv] Since other patches on which patch this was based are not progressing, would you like to rebase this on trunk. Gains are impressive and patch looks benign to me, so lets get this in., Rebasing to trunk, Patch rebased onto hive/trunk, All tests passed. [~namit] Would you want to take another look or shall I proceed with commit?, Proceeding with commit, since it improves state of the art and if there is a better way of doing things we can explore that on a new jira. , Committed to trunk.
