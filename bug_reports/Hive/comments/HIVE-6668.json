[I guess it was broken by HIVE-6403 or HIVE-6144., Seems aliases returned from this line (https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/plan/ConditionalResolverCommonJoin.java#L178) is an empty set., TestConditionalResolverCommonJoin cannot catch this bug., Could you try with this patch? Needs some more time for making proper test cases., Looks right to me, you have to use the original work object because the clone creates new Operator objects.
Ran the test with the patch, confirmed that the ConditionalResolver resolves to a mapJoin. 
Navis thanks for jumping on this., kick test,
