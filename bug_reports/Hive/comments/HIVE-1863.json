[Right. Something gets "lost in translation" here because Hive Service is using the ArrayList<String> that comes from driver.getResults() which is designed for sending output to the final console not another serde. We should be able to re-write string and place the nulls back in carefully, however a better solution might exists., This may have been fixed by HIVE-1378 in trunk (0.7). Please give that a try., Boolean columns in Hive tables containing NULL are treated as FALSE by the Hive JDBC driver.]
