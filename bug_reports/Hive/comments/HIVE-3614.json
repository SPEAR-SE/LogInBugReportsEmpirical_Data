[Test failed for the first time in https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1748/ So, looks like HIVE-3544 might have caused it., I think the parse result for 'union.q' is made by running it solely, which making operator ids started from 0. Would this be a good time to update all of parse results to have 0-started ids by resetting it before each test?, I've made HIVE-3623 as stated above., [~navis] Now that HIVE-3623 is fixed, I believe this test will succeed. If so, can you resolve this as fixed., Fixed via HIVE-3623, This issue is fixed and released as part of 0.10.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
