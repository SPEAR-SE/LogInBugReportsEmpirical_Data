ATTACHMENT ID: 12807389 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, I don't know if there's any other elegant way that doesn't require writing extra code, whereas right now, we're able to accomplish this by calling an existing function.  Besides, the exception flow is only encountered in the first call -- so, still an improvement over downloading multiple times. , [~sershe], HIVE-6672 (which is marked in the code comment) was adding jars under a check, but later changes has removed the check. so, putting it back looks fine to me.
If no objections, would like to commit this. Thanks

, Committed to master and branch-2.1

ATTACHMENT ID: 12809451 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~sershe] and [~jcamachorodriguez], Can you review the changes put by [~prongs] ? The changes look fine to me., LGTM, +1, Committed. Thanks [~prongs]. 

Thanks [~jcamachorodriguez] for review., Hi [~prongs], just trying to get a little background on this one - was the JAR being downloaded once per session, or was it getting downloaded every time the UDF was being used, even in the same session?, Last I checked, it was getting downloaded more than 30 times for a single query containing udf. The query was being issued through an external thrift client. ]
