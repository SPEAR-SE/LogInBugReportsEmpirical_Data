[This patch file is based on Hive-1.2.1.
It will use the time stamp to name the data file under the table directory to avoid the conflict., Whatever name you chose you will always be susceptible to [TOCTTOU issue | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use] since name is chosen by different process (hive cli) then the one doing renames (Namenode) Until HDFS adds merge api (HDFS-9763) best way to handle this scenario is to turn on locking https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Locking
, Hi, [~ashutoshc]
Thank you for your comments. 
Yes, you're right. The issue hasn't been resolved by naming the target file with timestamp. We ran into it again...

We tried to set the following properties, but still got the error. 
Hive.support.concurrency -> true                                        
Hive.txn.manager -> org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager    

Are there any other properties required?

Thank you., DbTxnManager works with only ACID tables. For non-acid tables use ZooKeeperLockManager. However, if you are running in highly concurrent environment, its better to use ACID tables., Hi, [~ashutoshc]
Thanks a lot for your comment. 
It worked for us to set Hive with ACID supported.

I will close this defect as well., It could be resolved with Hive ACID supported.]
