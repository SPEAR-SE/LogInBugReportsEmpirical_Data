[Added trunk patch which honors the QOP setting of hadoop.rpc.protection variable when a Configuration is used to initialize the client/server connection., I will rebase this patch if the changes in HIVE-4232 are acceptable., This also affects the thrift metastore server., Does it make sense to push this as is and then have a follow-up issue tied to [HIVE-4232]?, I modified the previous patch to also enable SASL QOP support to the HiveMetastore server.

I also tested the patch on a cluster and verified that it works as expected., I requested review of the latest patch:

https://reviews.facebook.net/D10959, fwiffo requested code review of "HIVE-4225 [jira] HiveServer2 does not support SASL QOP".

Reviewers: JIRA

A trunk patch which honors the QOP setting of hadoop.rpc.protection variable when a Configuration is used to initialize the client/server connection for both HiveServer2 and HiveMetastore

HiveServer2 implements Kerberos authentication through SASL framework, but does not support setting QOP.

TEST PLAN
  I installed a patched version of Hive on a Kerberos enabled CDH 4.2.1 cluster with hadoop.rpc.protection set to both privacy and integrity. I observed the expected behavior from both HiveServer2 and HiveMetastore when using Hue's Python Thrift client (patched with HUE-1288).

This message is automatically generated., That test might be flaky as reported over in HIVE-4883. I am going to commit that and then we'll what fails here., Please prefer the patch (coming soon) associated with HIVE-4911 instead of this one. The underlying code uses the same QOP setting for external connections to HS2 clients as well as internal connections to Hadoop. HIVE-4911 fixes this restriction and allows independent configuration of QOP for external and internal connections., I haven't had a chance to review HIVE-4911 but so long as it works for both HS2 and the Metastore Server, I'm good with having an independent configuration., Shall we close this as duplicate of HIVE-4911 ?, Makes sense to me., Marked as duplicate of HIVE-4911 .
