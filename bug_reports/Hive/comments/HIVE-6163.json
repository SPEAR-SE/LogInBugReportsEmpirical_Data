[Confirmed on my side as well -- you end up with part-m-00000 files from the mapper in your home directory. I consider this a critical bug and a very simple fix.

, I think we should also check all other OutputFormats and make sure they all have the consistent behaviors on creating file paths. , [~yhuai], I agree all Hive OutputFormats should follow the same way to create file path. Shall we create another umbrella Jira for this task and fix this  this specific issue on 0.12.1?]
