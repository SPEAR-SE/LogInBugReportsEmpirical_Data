ATTACHMENT ID: 12840337 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Review of configuration parameters:  Please make the parameter descriptions more formal.

For example, for *hive.druid.http.numConnection* you could change "num connection used by the http client" to "Number of connections used by the HTTP client."  For *hive.druid.http.read.timeout* you could change "read timeout period for the http client" to something like "Read timeout period for the HTTP client, in <units>."

Also, what does "PT1M" mean (as the default for *hive.druid.http.read.timeout*)?  Usually a time interval is specified with a TimeValidator, for example:

{code}
      HIVES_AUTO_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT("hive.auto.progress.timeout", "0s",
        new TimeValidator(TimeUnit.SECONDS),
{code}, [~bslim], I have just checked the patch and overall looks good.

In addition to addressing [~leftylev]'s comments, could you remove the initialization for _numConnection_ and _readTimeout_ with hardcoded values in DruidSerDe? Since we will pass through the _initialization_ method and default values already exist in HiveConf.java, we do not need to hardcode the value for these properties. Thanks, [~leftylev] thanks for the comments ! i have uploaded a new patch.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12840684 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Thanks for the changes, [~bslim], now I understand the default value.

Quibbles:  "eg" should be "e.g.," but since you have the examples in parentheses I'd change:

bq.  "... ISO8601 format, eg (P2W, P3M, PT1H30M, PT0.750S), default is period of 1 minute" 

to: 

bq.  "... ISO8601 format (for example P2W, P3M, PT1H30M, PT0.750S), default is period of 1 minute."

Also, both parameter descriptions should end with periods.

The quibbles aren't important enough for a new patch, but if you're making a patch for other reasons you could include these changes., Pushed to master (applied latest suggested changes to doc by [~leftylev]). Thanks [~bslim]!, Doc note:  This adds *hive.druid.http.numConnection* and *hive.druid.http.read.timeout* to HiveConf.java, so the wiki needs to be updated.

Either we need a new section for Druid (perhaps after the HiveServer2 section) or the parameters should go at the end of the general section:

* [Configuration Properties -- Query and DDL Execution | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-QueryandDDLExecution], Document the parameter descriptions in the commit, not in the patch attached to this issue.

It's commit df9b2b57a05499c4848e95a24a591154640e40fb., The Configuration Properties doc should have a separate section for Druid because HIVE-15277 adds 11 more., Github user b-slim closed the pull request at:
