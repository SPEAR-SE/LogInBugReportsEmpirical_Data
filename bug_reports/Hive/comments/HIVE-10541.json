[I am still able to reproduce the issue in master as of 4/29/2015 on my mac shell (Darwin localhost 12.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 12.5.0)., It looks like a bug from jline (jline-2.1.2.jar), class jline.console.ConsoleReader.java method:
public String readLine(String prompt, final Character mask) throws IOException
{code}
                int c = pushBackChar.isEmpty() ? readCharacter() : pushBackChar.pop ();
                if (c == -1) {
                    return null;
                }
{code}
When reaching the end of line without \n, readCharacter returns -1 and readLine discard what it has read and return null. so the last command in sql script passed via -f will be ignored. 
It can be worked around by append a newline after the last sql command.
, Filed a JIRA for this jline2 issue: https://github.com/jline/jline/issues/10, A simple way to work around the jline bug. Various manual tests have been performed to verify the solution. 
[~szehon] [~xuefuz], could you review it? Thanks., [~ctang.ma] thanks for the patch!
The fix looks good to me, but I think it could use a simple test case in TestBeeLineWithArgs as well.
, Thanks [~thejas]. I will look into adding a test case for that., Add a unittest testLastLineCmdInScriptFile in TestBeeLineWithArgs. Thanks [~thejas] for review.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12729681 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The failed test seems not related to this patch. The new added test TestBeeLineWithArgs#testLastLineCmdInScriptFile passed., +1, Committed to trunk, thanks Chaoyu for patch and Thejas for review., Thanks [~thejas] for review and [~szehon] for committing the patch., Does this need to be documented?, I think it is not needed. Before, without this patch the last statement in the Beeline sql script was ignored and needed a newline in order to be executed. It is a bug and the workaround by appending a newline was not documented. This JIRA fixes this issue. , Okay, thanks [~ctang.ma].]
