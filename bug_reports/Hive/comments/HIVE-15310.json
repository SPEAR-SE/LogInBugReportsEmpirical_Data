The following test works in latest Master Branch:
create table test1 (id int) location '/tmp/test1/one/two/';
create table test2 location '/tmp/test2/one/two' as select * from test1;

Please let me know if I am missing something., Yes, seems this has been fixed on master. Not sure which change fixed it, but will close it as a Duplicate.]
