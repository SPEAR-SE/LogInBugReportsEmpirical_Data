ATTACHMENT ID: 12870823 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, I was not able to reproduce the failures of TestCliDriver[stats_aggregator_error_1], TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver[columnstats_part_coltype.q], TestPerfCliDriver[query14.q] in my local machine. They seems to be flaky tests and not related to this patch.
[~pxiong], could you help to review this patch? Thanks., LGTM +1, Committed to 3.0.0 and 2.4.0. Thank [~pxiong] for reviewing the patch., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
