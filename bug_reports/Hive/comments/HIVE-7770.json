[Yikes, will post a patch shortly., Changed HCatPartition to pre-cache {{this.sd.getCols()}} into a member variable. Slightly redundant, but it gets around having to change the exception signature of {{HCatPartition.getColumns()}}. And it amortizes the construction-cost for multiple calls. #silverlining,

I've gone over the previous patch again and verified that this should be the only backward incompatible change we made, and this puts it back correctly. Failing tests reported by the qa bot are not related to this change. Will go ahead and commit., Committed to trunk, restores Exception-signature for the getColumns(). Thanks, Mithun!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
