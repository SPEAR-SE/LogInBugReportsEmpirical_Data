There are more than 15 ptest runs in the queue; if we do not revert this, they will be wasted. Hence, I am going to revert HIVE-15550 and HIVE-15648, and reopen them. Please, push them once you get a clean QA run., [~thejas] i think we should get the original pull request from HIVE-15550 in :)
, Unfortunately, that is also not fool proof right now. The tests currently get kicked off the attached patch file, and not pull request. We should see if we can have tests run on the pull request instead.
, Will track fix via new commit for HIVE-15550 .
