[The patch makes the Connection.setAutoCommit method compliant with the JDBC spec. The method should throw only if the connection is closed.
The auto-commit mode for HiveConnection is always enabled. Per JDBC spec, "if setAutoCommit is called and the auto-commit mode is not changed, the call is a no-op".,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12749383 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The cause of the tests failure is unrelated to the changes introduced in the patch., The spec doesn't seem to specify what to do if someone calls setAutoCommit(false) and the engine doesn't support multi-statements transactions.  But it seems to me we should at least issue a warning in the logs and in the SQLWarnings., Submitted a new patch that gives a SQLWarning if the user tries to set auto commit to false.  Also added unit tests.

[~vgumashta] could I get a review on this?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12769664 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, TestHBaseCliDriver fails for me on master also.  All of the others pass locally for me in master and with my patch.  So I don't think these are related., +1, Patch 2 committed.  Thanks Michal for the original patch and Thejas for the review., Great. Thanks Alan., Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug., +1 on backporting this to branch-1 as well; it's impacting many users there, as you can see from https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/DBE-3115]
