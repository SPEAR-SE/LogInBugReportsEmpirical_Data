[Removing fix version of 1.2.0 in preparation of release, since this is not a blocker for 1.2.0., Close the issue because (1) The correlation between the join column and the predicate column is unknown after discussing with [~rhbutani] and (2) the current plan to join data_dim will generate 405000 rows as intermediate result and the other plan to join item first will generate 726850 rows. The accumulated cost is even higher.]
