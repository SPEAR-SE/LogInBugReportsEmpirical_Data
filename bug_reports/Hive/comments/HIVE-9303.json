[I see that 'select ... parquet_tbl' is doing the correct job to display the struct fields based on the definition level. 

So, I assume the problem is when creating the parquet_tbl from text_tbl, where text_tbl has NULL rows, and parquet is copying them as (n-1) definitions levels instead of 0, right? So, instead of detecting a:NULL (Level 0) is detecting a:b:NULL (Level 2)., That's my understanding. The same thing happens if you insert NULL into the Parquet table directly too, it's not just a problem with CTAS or reading from text.,
