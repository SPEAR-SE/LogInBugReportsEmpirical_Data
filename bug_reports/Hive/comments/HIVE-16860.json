[Actually, nvm - please ignore - that was based on looking at the code for .1.patch for HIVE-6900. The .2.patch with HIVE-6900 makes it so this should never happen. However, I saw that happening in a user's log and assumed that was still the problem. Clearly, though, that user has a weird hive version.

Closing this as invalid.
