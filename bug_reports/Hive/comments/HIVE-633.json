[is this issue still relevant, as i would like to work on this., This has been bugging me for such a long time with add jar 'blah.jar', add file "blah.py", source "file.sql" etc.

Seems like it would be a minor improvement to have the parser to do a string.replaceAll() or similar method to replace single and double quotes in these file tokens?]
