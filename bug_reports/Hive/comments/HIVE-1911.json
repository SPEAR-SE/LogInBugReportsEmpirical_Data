[John, can you please take a look?, Dupe of HIVE-1716.  It's a sporadic issue, probably due to a port lingering.  I'll see if I can add a sleep somewhere to squelch it.
, oops, I forgot I filed a JIRA for the same problem. It's now failing more often (3 times in a row). , Yeah, it seems to have gotten much worse since the concurrency patch with zookeeper got committed, so it may be some interference between the different instances of zookeeper.
