[HIVE-8772.1.patch - Simple patch that adds support for beeline-log4j.properties. I have avoided changes to beeline java code, because use of log4j is more specific to hive, and changing code would hamper the work in HIVE-6361 .
, [~hagleitn] This is very useful for the reasons mentioned in the description. It would be great to include this in hive 0.14 . It is also a small safe change.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12680102 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, +1 for hive .14, Committed to trunk and .14 branch., If it's configurable, it probably needs to be documented in the wiki.  But where?  With Beeline, JDBC driver, or logging -- or more than one?

Some possibilities:

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Beeline–NewCommandLineShell]
* [Setting Up HiveServer2 | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Setting+Up+HiveServer2]
* [Hive JDBC Driver | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveJDBCInterface]
* [Getting Started -- Error Logs | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs], This is beeline specific, I think it should be documented in [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Beeline–NewCommandLineShell], bq.  it should be documented in HiveServer2 Clients – Beeline

Okay, although a link from the logging section in Getting Started wouldn't hurt.  Thanks., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
