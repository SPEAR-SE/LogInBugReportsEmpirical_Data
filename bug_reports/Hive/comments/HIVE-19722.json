[[~xuzq_zander]:Â "An external table describes the metadata / schema on external files. External table files can be accessed and managed by processes outside of Hive.[..] Use external tables when files are already present or in remote locations, and the files should remain even if the table is dropped." - In Hive we do not change the existing file hierarchy for external tables. When dropped / renamed etc. we keep the original structure. AFAIK the Archive function would move exiting files/directories - not really clear what should we do with the EXTERNAL_TABLE files in this case. So I think that is why the author decided to implement the ARCHIVE function only for managed tables.

Hope this helps,
