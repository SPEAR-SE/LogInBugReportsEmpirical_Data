[Good work Mohit to identify these potential resource leaks. How did you find these leaks? Through manual code inspection or through some tool/lib ? Looks like later., Thanks Ashutosh, well it is both ways, team review and couple of static analysis tools, I will work on it and provide the patch., I am not surprised - I am not aware of any long hive server deployment, so this code patch has not been tested at all.

Do you want to add a stress test, which runs for a long time: say 10 hours or so ?
It may not be practical to run it before every commit - but we can schedule it on hudson, and monitor the results there, Also, take a look at HIVE-1908, it is also looking at a similar problem, Mohit, there are conflicts when applying the patch to the current trunk. Can you regenerate the patch based on trunk?, Patch needs to be rebased.,

Review request for hive and John Sichi.


Summary
-------

There are couple of resource leaks.
For example,
In CliDriver.java, Method :- processReader() the buffered reader is not closed.

Also there are risk(s) of resource(s) getting leaked , in such cases refactored the code to move closing of resources in finally block.

    Rename this to rc to avoid confusion with the processReader method name.

    Fix indentation for the try block.

    HIVE-1884. Potential risk of resource leaks in Hive

, Hello,

Could this lead to input files being ignored?

We have a query in which we are doing several "UNION ALL". Apparently, sometimes Hive ignores one of the SELECTs. Actually not sure if it ignores the SELECT or it doesn't see the input files for that select. There are 6 queries which are united using UNION ALL.

This happened several times with different SELECTs from that big query and the query i valid. This leads me to think it's either related to this issue or a memory leak.

Setup: Hadoop 0.20.1, Hive 0.6, Debian 5.0 x64

Thank you,

Flo, Hive is running in server mode as daemon.]
