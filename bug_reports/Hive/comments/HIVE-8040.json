[Looks similar to HIVE-7145. I think we should do as suggested there, ie move all reference from apache.commons-V2 to apache.commons-V3 and just depend on commons3 lib for both hadoop1 and hadoop2, Also the default profile for pre-commit builds is hadoop-2. Building both profiles per commit might be costly too. Should there be some build to test hadoop-1 profile periodically?, Quick fix. I'll commit this shortly after (I'm using hadoop-1 and this makes things really annoying)., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks Ashutosh!, Build seems still broken even after this commit, with a different error (caused by HIVE-7223 maybe):

{code}, I've changed ExitException to RuntimeException and confirmed test passed. [~mithun], could you check this?, Applied 2nd patch and ran 'mvn clean install -DskipTests -Phadoop-1'. Now it failed at:

{noformat}, With this patch on trunk, the hadoop-1 profile compiles., LGTM. +1 
Copying class from hadoop to hive seems ok since there is no dependency of that class .cc: [~hagleitn]
, Given that this is fixing the build, with Ashutosh's review I've committed it.]
