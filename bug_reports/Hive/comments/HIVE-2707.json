This is a problem because the 0.23.x tarballs contain symlinks., Shall we first check if tar command is available and then execute it? If not available, then invoke untar task only. Else, this will break build on systems where tar is not available even for 0.20x series., @Ashutosh: Chances are that if tar is not available on your system, then you probably shouldn't try to build Hive there anyway (e.g. Windows)., cwsteinbach requested code review of "HIVE-2707 [jira] Ant's untar task can't handle symlinks".
Reviewers: JIRA

  Execute tar directly instead of using Ant's untar task
