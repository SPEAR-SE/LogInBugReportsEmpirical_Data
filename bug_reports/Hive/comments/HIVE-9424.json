ATTACHMENT ID: 12693491 - PreCommit-HIVE-SPARK-Build, Sounds like this is a blocker? I have upgraded to blocker. If not, please drop priority., [~brocknoland] I'm fine making it a blocker - at least it blocks dynamic partition pruning.
Also, I don't think the test failures are related., [~csun], to clarify, w/o this patch, there is no problem. If this is case, I don't think this is a blocker (for 0.15). On the contrary, I'm a little concerned to include this in 0.15. Please share your thought., [~xuefuz] I think the issue will not happen with the current impl - it could only occur when the "main" SparkTask is not in the root task set, due to the post order traversing of the TaskGraphWalker. In my dynamic partition implementation this case could happen, since the "main" task could be child of pruning task.

Yes, I think it's OK not to include it in 0.15. It will not affect anything that we have right now.

, I see. Please feel free to include this in your prototyping. We will visit this when we review that work. Thanks.]
