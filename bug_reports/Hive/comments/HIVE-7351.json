[A quick fix should be to call this method with value 0. This doesn't throw exception in this case., Using this property seems to solve the problem.
{code}
<property>
  <name>hive.stats.jdbc.timeout</name>
  <value>0</value>
</property>
{code}
More a hack than a solution IMHO., You can also try {{set hive.stats.dbclass=fs}} This skips database altogether and instead uses filesystems for gathering stats., It's the problem of JDBC implementaion. By spec, SQLException should not be thrown in this case. We can catch SQLFeatureNotSupportedException and ignored it, which is introduced in JDK6, but PSQLException is not a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException, so it will not fix this problem., [~navis], [~ashutoshc]
A more simple way to fix this one is to change behavior for {{hive.stats.jdbc.timeout}} property.
If the value of {{hive.stats.jdbc.timeout}} is {{-1}}, HIVE does not try to set query timeout.
Like this :
{code}
if (timeout != -1) {
  stmt.setQueryTimeout(timeout);
}
{code}, Patch attached is doing exactly the same except it leaves a log message, complaining it's negative. But we have various walk-around for this issue and it seemed not necessary for any patch., I agree, [~navis], could you fix this this issue with your patch ?
You patch fix {{SQLFeatureNotSupportedException}} and add logs., Rerun test,
