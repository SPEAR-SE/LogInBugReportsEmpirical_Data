[Looks like the error may be occurring because the Hive is trying to look up the UDF by name during the UDF initialization in the reduce task. Ideally this lookup should only be happening during the compilation phase and not during the map/reduce tasks.  This looks like it works ok for built-in windowing UDFs (added to the FunctionRegistry), but custom UDFs are hitting some other logic that really should only happen during compilation. We would have to fix the way WindowingTableFunction is doing its initialization for this to work with UDFs added with ADD TEMP FUNCTION., Attaching patch to cache values when UDAF is first initialized in query compilation, and to use cached values rather than FunctionRegistry lookup., RB at https://reviews.apache.org/r/28921/, HIVE-4419 purportedly fixed this, but seems like this got broken again in meanwhile. I suggest we also do HIVE-4415 to future proof ourselves from this kind of breakage., Patch v2 - fixed qfile name in testconfiguration.properties., Looks like it HIVE-7143 broke this, but we didn't see this because the qfile test needs to be run by MiniMR to see the error. In any case I've added a new qfile test that runs in MiniMR., re-upload patch for precommit tests,

A natural extension of this is to move {{Noop}} TableFunctionEvaluator to contrib/ module and then do create function for it in tests where it is used. Currently, {{Noop}} lives in main src tree because of this bug but used heavily in tests. Since contrib/ jar is not on classpath of tests by default, having this test-used class live in contrib/ will help in both regards, keeping src tree free of any test classes and provide true test case for this functionality, since current test uses function which any way is available in classpath of tests.
Since above may require some refactoring, I am OK with doing that in a follow-up jira., Failures don't appear to be related.
I've committed this to trunk, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
