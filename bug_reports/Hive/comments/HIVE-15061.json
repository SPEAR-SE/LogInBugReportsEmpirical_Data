[I can take a look., In Hive alter table, both column name and type in the newTable object have been converted to lower case before it is passed to HMS APIs, therefore there won't be the case sensitive issues as seen in Impala. Impala might do the same way as Hive to work around this issue (which seems Impala is doing), or we might seek a way to validate column names/types and do the case conversion in HMS alter table., This patch is to fix the following issues:
1. alterTableUpdateTableColumnStats and updatePartColumnStatsForAlterColumns did not ignore the case when they compare the columns to determine if their stats should be updated or deleted
2. update_table_column_statistics/update_partition_column_statistics allow the uppercase column type to be populated to HMS backend DB, [~aihuaxu], [~mohitsabharwal], could you review the patch since you have done something related. Thanks,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12835876 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, The failed test seems not related to the patch. [~aihuaxu], [~mohitsabharwal] could you review it, thanks., LGTM +1

(I double-checked other places where coltypes are set
like StatObjectConverter - found that we are converting
to lower case there already), Committed to 2.2.0 and 2.1.1. Thanks [~mohitsabharwal] for reviewing the patch.]
