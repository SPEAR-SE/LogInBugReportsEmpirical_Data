[This appears to be a problem with variable ambiguity:

{code}
set key=value
{code} 

expands to: 
{code}
set hiveconf:key=value 
{code}

however,

{code}
select * from ${key}
{code}

expands to:

{code}
select* from ${hiveconf:key}
{code}

The question is basically, should we allow users to enter ambiguous properties, and if so should the {{key}} default to {{hiveconf:key}} or {{hivevar:key}}?, Correction:

{code}
select * from ${key}
{code}

expands to:
{code}
select* from ${hivevar:key}
{code}, [~sircodesalot], I think hiveconf is default if the name space part of a variable is not given. Thus, {noformat}${key}{noformat} is equal to {noformat}${hiveconf:key}{noformat} and {noformat}set key=value{noformat} is equal to {noformat}set hiveconf:key=value{noformat}.

Please refer to documentation https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+VariableSubstitution. To further make sure, please also check Hive CLI's behavior., Thanks, I'll go ahead and get a patch ready.]
