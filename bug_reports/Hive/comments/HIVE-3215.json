[@Ramkumar:
This seems related to HIVE-2804, which is using  HostUtil.getTaskLogUrl to get the URL., @Ramkumar:

The patch is nice. How about also update the corresponding URL construction in HadoopJobExecHelper.java?, Zhenxiao, Thanks for the comments. I will incorporate it.

HIVE-2804 is related, but this could be done independent of that jira.
, @Ramkumar:

Generally good to me, two things:

#1. I think it is OK to keep the following:
-        String taskUrl = (jtUrl == null) ? "Unavailable" :
-        jtUrl + "/taskdetails.jsp?jobid=" + jobId + "&tipid=" + task.toString();

-          sb.append("URL:\n  " + taskUrl + "\n");

Is there a reason to get rid of these info?

#2. I just checked, the only usage of JobTrackerURLResolver is:

[~/Code/studyHive]find . -name *.java | xargs grep JobTrackerURLResolver.
./ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/JobDebugger.java:      jtUrl = JobTrackerURLResolver.getURL(conf);
./ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/JobTrackerURLResolver.java: * JobTrackerURLResolver.
./ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/JobTrackerURLResolver.java:public final class JobTrackerURLResolver {
./ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/JobTrackerURLResolver.java:  private JobTrackerURLResolver() {
./ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/HadoopJobExecHelper.java:    String jtUrl = JobTrackerURLResolver.getURL(conf);
./ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/Throttle.java:      String tracker = JobTrackerURLResolver.getURL(conf) + "/gc.jsp?threshold=" + threshold;

How about also update Throttle.java, and retire JobTrackerURLResolver.java at all?

Thanks,
Zhenxiao, I can revert the taskUrl changes.
Throttle.java is checking the job tracker if its ok to start a new job, so there is no running job instance available. So that cannot be avoided., The task URL is constructed using hardcoded URI like taskdetails.jsp. It will be better to have the job tracking URL and the task ID instead., @Bhushan:

Could you send a phabricator review request? I will take a look.

Thanks,
Zhenxiao, Phabricator diff is at https://reviews.facebook.net/D4401, @Bhushan:

+1 
Good for me.

Running OK on MiniMRCluster. Needs to confirm it runs good on real cluster and local mode., @Bhushan:

There are lint problems in the patch in JobDebugger.java. Would you pleas fix them?

Thanks,
Zhenxiao, Uploaded updated patch., 
+1. New patch is good for me.
, Bhushan, could you update the patch, I can't apply the patch to try it out., Refreshed patch., +1 will commit, if tests pass., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Bhushan!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1794 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1794/])
