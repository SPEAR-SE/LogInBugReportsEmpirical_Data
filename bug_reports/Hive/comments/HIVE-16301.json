ATTACHMENT ID: 12860799 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Thanks [~pxiong] I have cloned this jira to HIVE-16316 for the master branch. Have you had a chance to look at the patch itself? Thanks again, LGTM, i think we just need more changes. Could u resubmit the patch with the changes for a ptest run? After that, I think we will be good., An additional change to the root pom.xml
{{<hive.version.shortname>2.3.0</hive.version.shortname>}}, [~pxiong] What ptest changes were you suggesting? I am not aware of any changes to the ptest scripts between releases. Could you please elaborate? Thanks, [~ngangam], i was talking about the ant, hwi and orc which do not exist after you re-clone. +1, pending ptests., [~ngangam], I just want to double check: when u update the versions, did u follow
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToRelease
and use 
{code}
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=X.Y.0-SNAPSHOT -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
{code}, [~pxiong] Yes, I was unaware of this documentation but I used maven's versions:set command, slightly different command though {{mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.3.0-SNAPSHOT -DoldVersion=2.2.0-SNAPSHOT -DgenerateBackupPoms=false}} to update the POMs. But for some reason, I thought it did not update the {{hive.version.shortname}} that I had to do it manually.

Since I am not creating a new release branch, and just updating the release version of the current dev branch, step #8 isnt applicable to me. Correct me if I am wrong., thanks. let's push this to master once ptest is done., you meant {{branch-2}} right ? :), both. note
{code}
Commit these changes to master with a comment "Preparing for X.Y+1.0 development".
{code}, I am tracking the {{master}} changes in HIVE-16316. That change is to mark master for 3.0.0. Is that ok ? Sorry for the confusion.,

sounds related?, yes, it sounds related. I will investigate., Also this is a fairly new test, I added in 2.2. Appears that this is a test issue. The test uses the HiveSchemaTool.doUpgrade() API incorrectly. The test intends to upgrade from 2.0.0 to 2.2.0. Instead, due to incorrect usage, it schema stays at 2.0.0 and compares the DB tables with the 2.0.0 schema files and succeeds.
{code}

{code}

But since the new version being added is 2.3.0, the schema is upgraded to 2.3.0 and hence it sees missing tables that were added in 2.1.0 and hence the failure.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12861145 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, The 2 test failures seem unrelated. The latest patch resolved the TestSchemaTool test failure. So it looks good to me. Please let me know it its ready to be committed. Thanks, pushed to master and 2.3 thanks [~ngangam] for the work!, [~pxiong] Thanks for the commit. Quick question though. Its my understanding that master should be 3.0.0 release, not 2.3.0. Am I wrong? Thanks, True, that is why i asked u to create 16316. We need to push 16316 to master as well, but not 2.3., I will have the patch for 3.0.0 uploaded today. Thanks for the review again.
Also you may have accidentally changed ownership of this jira. Flipping it back to me. If it was intentional, please let me know. Thanks, I never changed the ownership of the jira. Maybe it is because I renamed it...]
