[It will also be better to remove different out files (one for jdk7 and another for jdk8) as part of this jira/follow up/sub-task.

Example: 
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/join0.q.java1.7.out
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/join0.q.java1.8.out

These 2 files exists because of hashmap ordering differences between these two java versions., makes sense, created HIVE-13549]
