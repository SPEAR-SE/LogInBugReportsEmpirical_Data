[The fix. The hard-codes for {{part}} in the file-names have been switched to use the conf-setting for {{"mapreduce.output.basename"}}.

Sorry for the delay., Causes silent failures and potential data-loss (because last-write-wins). We should patch 1.2.0.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12748701 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Though test case is missing, it might be costly to add, since it involves upgrade Pig dependency to 0.15, and run Pig in Tez mode. The changes look simple and doesn't cause regression. So +1., Patch committed to master, branch-1 and branch-1.2.

Thanks Mithun!, Thanks for the fix - I have an additional question to verify if this causes a problem. In the case of appends, where a previous file already exists, it's possible that HCat would add an additional suffix to the resultant file, as noted by the following:

https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/hcatalog/core/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/hcatalog/mapreduce/FileOutputCommitterContainer.java#L650-L656

I want to make sure that this is not a surprise to you, and is okay?, Thanks for the heads-up, Sush. On the face of it, 
# In the first place, I'm not sure this'd be a problem, since Pig assumes "insert-overwrite" semantics, as opposed to "insert into". But then again, this is dynamic-partitioning, so it's not like Pig could check the output directory, _a priori_.
# Pig 0.14 uses prefixes (vertex_id + edge_id) to make sure the file is unique. I don't foresee that the suffix might mess with it.

Permit me to ruminate on this.
