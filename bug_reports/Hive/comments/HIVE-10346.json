Things you might want to consider: Do you want to do the logging in the second code patch (checkOutputSpec) on failure too? Since you're creating the format at init time now, do we still need the checkOutputSpecs at all?, checkOutputSpec is actually an API on outputformat; the one of FileSink is just a translation call between HiveOutputFormatImpl and real output formats inside the filesink... so needs to be called., Committed to trunk, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
