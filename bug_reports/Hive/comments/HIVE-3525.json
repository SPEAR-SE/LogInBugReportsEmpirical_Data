[Patch with unit tests that expresses the NPE on deserialization and during the roundtrip for serialization.

Also shows that the object inspector is behaving correctly., @Sean: Can you post a review request on review board or on phabricator? Thanks., It looks like this is because the Avro SerDe uses a Hashtable when reading out Avro Maps. The BinarySortableSerDe uses HashMap, so presumably it could as well., [~shreepadma] Sure thing. Should I wait till the patch contains a solution, or just while it's still the tests?, It looks like you have a patch attached to the JIRA page. Is this a work in progress patch? Is this something you would like us to review? Its a lot easier to perform the review on phabricator/reviewboard. , At the moment the patch merely shows the error described in the ticket, it does not solve it.

I placed it on [ReviewBoard|https://reviews.apache.org/r/7430/], because Phabricator was unable to register via my github account., [Review Board #7430|https://reviews.apache.org/r/7430/] Now contains a proposed fix as well as tests., Patch that corresponds to review board #7430, Reviewing..., +1.  Correct approach, good tests.  verified., @Jakob: thanks for reviewing this!

@Sean: +1. Will commit if tests pass., Committed to trunk. Thanks Sean!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1746 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1746/])
