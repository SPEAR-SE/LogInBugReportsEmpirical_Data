[Seems like there is one more bug lurking down there:
{code}
-ALTER TABLE "APP"."SKEWED_STRING_LIST_VALUES" ADD CONSTRAINT "SKEWED_STRING_LIST_VALUES_PK" PRIMARY KEY ("STRING_LIST_ID");
+ALTER TABLE "APP"."SKEWED_STRING_LIST_VALUES" ADD CONSTRAINT "SKEWED_STRING_LIST_VALUES_PK" PRIMARY KEY ("STRING_LIST_ID","INTEGER_IDX");
{code}
?, @Ashutosh,  thanks for catching that. Looks like this column INTEGER_IDX should included in the primary key of SKEWED_STRING_LIST_VALUES. 
Rest of the 0.10 schema scripts, mysql, oracle and postgres look fine., Additional patch per review comment, +1, Committed to trunk and 0.10. Thanks, Prasad!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1821 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1821/])
