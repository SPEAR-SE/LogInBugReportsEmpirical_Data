[I don't think the wiki should be the reference point, It is better if we stick with the SQL Standard thought. , Well it is not that easy to read sql standard apparently (its not publicly available). But in major implemetations (like ms sql and postgre) timestamp functions return values in user tz as far as I can tell. Especially in case of timestamp without tz.  ]
