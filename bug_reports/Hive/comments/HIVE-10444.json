[[~hagleitn] FYI..., Added to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+1.2+Release+Status as a blocker., Sorry for the HIVE-10223 breakage.  I'll pick this up.  [~prasanth_j], thank you for filing the bug report., I also found one occurrence of the same problem that was not introduced by HIVE-10223.  Instead, it was introduced by HIVE-10066.

I think the simplest thing to do is to revert to using {{FileStatus#isDir}}, which is present in Hadoop 1.2.1.  It's deprecated in 2.x in favor of {{FileStatus#isDirectory}}, but it's still usable.  I'm attaching a patch.

I verified a build locally for both {{-Phadoop-1}} and {{-Phadoop-2}}., LGTM, +1., [~cnauroth] After the patch #1 the code looks like that
{code}
if (!fileStatus.isDirectory()) {
..
} else if (fileStatus.isDirectory()) { // Checking isDirectory again? Do you expect different result here? I think "if" statement can be removed.
..
} else { // unreachable block below. Just remove it
..
}
{code}

BTW, each jira with patches should have RB link., correction
{code}
if (!fileStatus.isDir()) {
..
} else if (fileStatus.isDir()) { // Checking isDir() again? I think "if" statement can be removed.
..
} else { // unreachable block below. FindBugs will complain
..
}
{code}, [~apivovarov], thank you for your review.  I'm attaching patch v2.  Here it is in Review Board:

https://reviews.apache.org/r/33715/

Patch v1 basically just restored the logic to pre-HIVE-10223 state.  You're right that there was a redundant check and an unreachable block though.  There is no reason to maintain it this way now, so I made the correction in patch v2.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12729404 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, [~apivovarov], thank you for the review.

I reran the failed tests locally, and they all passed.

I also tried running the same tests with {{-Phadoop-1}}, and they failed due to a {{NoSuchMethodError}} in an HDFS class.  Looking at the test classpath, I can see it's picking up a 2.x version of the minicluster, even though I set {{-Phadoop-1}}.  I don't think this is related to the current patch., Yes I think test failures are not related.. tracked by HIVE-10514, thanks a lot for this fix., Committed to branch-1.2 and master. Thanks [~cnauroth] and [~apivovarov]!, Build is still failing even with this patch

bq. Build is still failing even with this patch

[~xuefuz], that one is a new problem introduced by HIVE-10151 just today after the pre-commit run for this patch.  I'm attaching an addendum patch to fix that.  If it's better to file a new jira to track the new patch, let me know, and I'll do that., That's okay. The new failure is captured in HIVE-10579. Thanks., Captured the HIVE-10579 change in branch-1.2 as well. Thanks Xuefu/Chris, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
