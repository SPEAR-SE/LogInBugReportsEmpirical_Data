[spark-shell is not part of Apache Hive, indeed. It's just a convenient way of invoking GzipCodec and experimenting with things. The issue is in GzipCodec, which is part of hadoop-common. I'm happy to create this as a standalone java project, but that is just the packaging ...
Is there a better project to log this bug against? Should this be moved to hadoop-common? , Note that the bug is an attempt to find the smallest reproducible issue. The original issue involved reading a Hive table that was stored as a ZIP compressed CSV file. In that scenario, I had a Hive table:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS foo (
    dummy string
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
Location 'hdfs://localhost:9000/user/aabes/test/'


Attempting to read the table returned binary data instead of the actual text in the compressed CSV.
