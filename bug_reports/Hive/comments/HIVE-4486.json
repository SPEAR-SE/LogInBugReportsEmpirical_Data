[attach yourkit profile (HTML), Root caused to the following code in HiveConf

{code}
private void initialize(Class<?> cls) {
    hiveJar = (new JobConf(cls)).getJar();

    // preserve the original configuration
    origProp = getAllProperties();

    // Overlay the ConfVars. Note that this ignores ConfVars with null values
    addResource(getConfVarInputStream());
{code}

addResource() calls reloadConfiguration() eventually, causing each new HiveConf(job) to parse all the conf xml files again., In above, 
{code}
HiveConf hiveConf = new HiveConf(job, FetchOperator.class);
boolean recursive = hiveConf.getBoolVar(HiveConf.ConfVars.HADOOPMAPREDINPUTDIRRECURSIVE);
{code}
could be replaced by
{code}
boolean recursive = HiveConf.getBoolVar(job, HiveConf.ConfVars.HADOOPMAPREDINPUTDIRRECURSIVE);
{code}

Could you make a patch for review?, Running it through the benchmarks now.

That looked like it did the trick. I will put up a patch for review , Patch based on Navis' suggestions., Opened https://reviews.apache.org/r/11047/
, Closed that (wrong diff), opened as https://reviews.apache.org/r/11048/diff/ instead., +1 can you run the unit tests?, I have already run all of tests in ql/ against svn (Wed May 8) already.

Will run all tests in some time & report back., [~owen.omalley] - all test pass on (bdd257f71bc0b65100dbd41425d7f8250ae27e57 + patch), I just committed this to branch-0.11 and trunk. Thanks, Gopal!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #201 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/201/])
