[[~pxiong], after seeing your [email | http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hive-dev/201703.mbox/%3CCAMs4YUe4Wn3ZABeet-aCN6sMHUp0k8ffgeu3W6m4Y9wgJFSPjg@mail.gmail.com%3E] about the Hive 2.2, 2.3, and 3.0 releases, I went to update the Hive Wiki with some of that information, but realized that I don't have enough context to explain the purpose of the various branches in Hive.

Can you suggest the best person to update the "Understanding Hive Branches" section of the Hive wiki page?

But I would encourage you to put an initial version here and we can help you review.]
