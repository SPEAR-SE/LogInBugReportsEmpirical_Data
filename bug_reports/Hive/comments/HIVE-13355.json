[Looking but not sure yet, I'm not seeing anything interesting in logs, for example hive.log in [http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build-7356/failed/TestSparkCliDriver-groupby3_map.q-sample2.q-auto_join14.q-and-12-more/].  It is just take a long time of upward of 2 hours to run, at which point I believe the test timeout., Spark executor logs show that it finish but somehow stays for about an hour more before shutting down (killed by timeout in this case).

After which point it goes on forever.]
