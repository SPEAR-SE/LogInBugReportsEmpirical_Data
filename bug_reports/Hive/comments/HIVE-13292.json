[With double type, it's usually by design, Yeah. Doubles are implemented in many programming languages in different ways. I'm not sure of if scala does it differently from java, but this seems to be the case. This issue seems insignificant if matters at all.

If users are concerned about minute difference like this, decimal type is strongly recommended.]
