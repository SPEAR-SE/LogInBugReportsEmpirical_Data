[Fixes include:
1. be able to open an impersonation session in an non-kerberized HS2
2. when working with non-kerberized HMS but with hive.metastore.execute.setugi set to true, remember to close the ThreadLocal Hive object thus avoiding using a stale HMS connection in a new session., [~thejas] Could you take a look at this JIRA and comment? I noticed that the change in HIVE-4356 (remove duplicate impersonation parameters for hiveserver2) made HS2 doAs (impersonation) only work with Kerberos env. Thanks, We do run ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION ... LOCATION 'hdfs://bla-bla' through JDBC as oozie-java-action. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. HiveServer2 'looses' passed username and sets username='anonymous' and refuses to add partition because user named 'anonymous' has no access right to partition location.
Whe does it happen from time to time? For example we have an oozie coordinator which adds 24 partitions during a day. It can work for a week and then suddenly fails with this 'anonymous' user.
, This issue should be fixed through the changes in HIVE-6312 (which changed non-kerberos codepath to be same as kerberos code path in this aspect), and HIVE-6864.
, [~ctang.ma] Apologies for not responding to your comments and patch sooner!
, [~thejas] No worries, as long as it has been addressed in recent HIVE-6312 and HIVE-6864. I am going to verify them with my case as well. Thanks!, Marking as duplicate as fixes were part of different jiras.
Please re-open if you still see the same issue.
, This looks like still a problem on trunk. I tried on latest trunk. Problem seems be that {{sessionHive}} object in {{HiveSessionImplwithUGI}} is never initialized if the authentication mechanism is not {{KERBEROS}}. Currently {{sessionHive}} is initialized in {{HiveSessionImplwithUGI.setDelegationToken}} only if the delegation token is not null. Delegation token is not null when authentication mechanism is {{KERBEROS}}. As {{sessionHive}} is null when {{HiveSessionImplwithUGI.acquire()}} is called a {{Hive}} object with MetaStoreClient of this session user is not set. So whatever the worker thread has {{Hive}} object in its thread variable, it will get used.

To repro it consistently set the following parameters in hive-site.xml and restart hiveserver2. And try creating tables as two different users.
{code}
hive.server2.thrift.min.worker.threads=1;
hive.server2.thrift.max.worker.threads=1;
{code}, Attached a patch which fixed the issue. It doesn't have any test case. I am in the process of figuring out how to write a test case where both MetaStore and HiveServer2 are running.

[~vgumashta] Appreciate if you have any feedback on fix., Reopening the jira based on Venki's report.
, Attaching a patch with testcase., Adding review board link, [~vkorukanti] Thanks for the patch. I'll look at it now. As a workaround, you can use HS2 with embedded metastore. ,

, Skip my last comment pls.
Hive build works fine with HIVE-6245.3.patch.txt, Attaching new patch.

Rebased on latest trunk, found out that the test is not working anymore. Had to do some changes to MiniHS2 also HIVE-7807., [~thejas] Could you review this? ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12663248, I have been working on a patch to fix the same thing in HIVE-7890. I tested this patch and it works for me so +1 from my side.

Since we've hit this a number of times I actually think we should commit both this one and HIVE-7890., Looks good. I just have some minor comments, added them in reviewboard.
, Attaching patch v5. Addressed review comments.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12664846, Ran 2 failed tests locally and both pass successfully., testCliDriver_dynpart_sort_opt_vectorization  failed in several previous builds as well.  (538-541)

TestHiveServer2.testConnection failed in build 540 too
http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/540/testReport/

Your build 542 does not have any additional failed test methods., Actually testCliDriver_dynpart_sort_opt_vectorization still fails locally, for some reason it didn't run previously might be due to incorrect maven args in my test run., +1, Thank you so much Venki! I have committed this to trunk!, [~venki387] The test in TestHS2ImpersonationWithRemoteMS seems to be failing frequently. Would you be able to take a look at it ?
, [~thejas] Sorry about that. I see in all Hive QA runs where the test failed, second connection is failed to establish. There isn't any info in hive.log to narrow down. I will try to repro locally and update (HIVE-7942 is created for tracking)., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
