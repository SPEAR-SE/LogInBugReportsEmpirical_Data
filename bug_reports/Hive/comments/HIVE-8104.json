ATTACHMENT ID: 12668847, I'm 90% certain that these failures are unrelated to my patch.  Looking at the error logs it appears the tests lost connectivity to Derby for a bit.  The tests pass for me on Linux and Mac.  But, as these tests don't usually fail and they are in the same general area I'm going to cancel the patch and reload the same patch to get a new run., Same patch as the first one, just reloading for a re-run., +1 pending tests,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12669201, TestOrcHCatLoader test issues are not related to this patch., Patch checked in.  Thanks Eugene for the review., bq.  This patch turns off vectorization when an acid operation is being performed.

Should this be documented in the wiki?, [~leftylev] yes, it should be documented.  When I get to writing up the acid changes for the wiki (hopefully this weekend) I'll include this., [~alangates], the Transactions wikidoc doesn't say anything about vectorization yet.  (Nudge, nudge.)  And the Vectorization design doc doesn't mention transactions either.

* [Hive Transactions | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions]
* [Vectorized Query Execution | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Vectorized+Query+Execution], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, [~leftylev], what did you want transactions and vectorization to say about each other?  They work together, mostly.  And the transaction code handles turning off vectorization in the cases where they don't work together, so it is all transparent to the user.  So I'm not sure there's anything to put in the user docs., Fine with me, [~alangates].  I was just going by your previous comment on Sept. 19:  "yes, it should be documented. When I get to writing up the acid changes for the wiki (hopefully this weekend) I'll include this."  So maybe you had something in mind that's already documented.]
