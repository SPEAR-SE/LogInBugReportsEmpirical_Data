{code}

    //When file system cache is disabled, you get different FileSystem objects
    // for same file system, so '==' can't be used in such cases
    //FileSystem api doesn't have a .equals() function implemented, so using
    //the uri for comparison. FileSystem already uses uri+Configuration for
    //equality in its CACHE .
