[this could be known issue ; but I wasn't able to locate a relevant jira - I'm using an at least 2-3 weeks old version of master, to provide better context: I'm working on reoptimizing the queries - so these queries are known to have a bad initial plan (usually map join is used - but its not gonna work; and will eventually get an oom) the problem is that it fails with timeout - in which case there won't be a retry..., I'm seeing this again with tpcds#64; I think this might be related to the fact that the query has a lot of locks

, Can you check GC logs to see if it's hitting heavy GC that causes things to time out?
Overall, if you can send me logs via some channel it might be helpful.]
