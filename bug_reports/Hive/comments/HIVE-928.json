[What is the behavior in hadoop streaming ? Do the custom mappers inherit the classpath ?, Namit, are you concerned that inheriting the entire classpath of the parent process is not a good idea? I agree that it's unnecessary and can modify the patch so that only the JARs that were added by the user appear on the classpath of the child process. Let me know what you want me to do.
, I wanted to know what does hadoop streaming do if I write a mapper in java - is the classpath passed ?

In any case, I think it is a good idea to do so, but we should only add the JARs that were added by the user.
, @Carl, are you working on modifying the patch so that only the JARs that were added by the user appear on the classpath of the child process, Yes, I'll post an updated patch by the end of the day. Sorry for the wait.]
