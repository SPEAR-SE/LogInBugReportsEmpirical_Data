ATTACHMENT ID: 12870079 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, The change makes sense to me. 
Re-directing output that is to be written to a process' STDERR into a file in /tmp can be a problem for users at certain financial institutions. They are generally required to save logs for an extended periods and defaulting to /tmp would not meet their requirements. Printing it to the console allows them to redirect them to a more "permanent" location via process managers/monitors that are use to start/stop hive services. Hope this makes sense. So +1 for me.

[~prasanth_j] and [~gopalv] Please do share your concerns if you have any., patch-2: redirect possible error to stderr console and let hive script to decide where to output. I think that makes more sense.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12870648 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~aihuaxu] I think I understand what you are trying to do. So the output to STDERR from the java process/command will be redirected to the console/shell running this bash script which can then be redirected (to file overwriting or appending) at the user's discretion. However, I am not certain a shell will let you redirect  that output to a file. Can you show output from any tests you may have run? Thanks, [~ngangam] Yes. After we redirect the error from the subprocess to STDERR, the user can call {{./bin/hive > log 2>err}} e.g., to get regular output and error. The errors from {{hadoop version}} e.g., will also show in err file., Thanks for the clarification. Makes sense to me. +1 on the new patch., Committed to master. Thanks Naveen for reviewing., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
