HIVE-3925 dependencies of fetch task are not shown by explain

A simple query like:

hive> explain select * from src order by key;
OK
ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE:
  (TOK_QUERY (TOK_FROM (TOK_TABREF (TOK_TABNAME src))) (TOK_INSERT (TOK_DESTINATION (TOK_DIR TOK_TMP_FILE)) (TOK_SELECT (TOK_SELEXPR TOK_ALLCOLREF)) (TOK_ORDERBY (TOK_TABSORTCOLNAMEASC (TOK_TABLE_OR_COL key)))))

STAGE DEPENDENCIES:
  Stage-1 is a root stage
  Stage-0 is a root stage

  Stage: Stage-0
    Fetch Operator
      limit: -1

Stage-0 is not a root stage and depends on stage-1.

, [~navis] I assume this will be a jumbo patch with nearly all .q.out files getting updated. Can you test and commit the full patch? Also, if you can attach a patch which you finally committed, that will be great., Ok, I'll try that. But how about waiting for a while? I'm worry that the changes by this patch will disturb other on-going test-fix patches., [~navis] I think we should move forward with this. This is very useful to understand the behavior of query planner. If you refresh your source only patch, I will take care of updating .q files and committing it., Agreed. And HIVE-4880 also should be included sometime. I'll really really appreciate if someone might make the huge diff file. I even don't know whether diff files for beeline should be included or not in these days. , Let me take a stab at generating mega diff for this one. I ll than follow-up on HIVE-4880. Sometimes later this week., With log changes,

This message is automatically generated., Changes in plan.xml files look susceptible. It seems with this change we will begin to serialize FetchTask and FetchWork in our plan and will send it to backend which is not required, since fetch task is executed from client itself. Backend doesn't need to know about FetchTask. This unnecessarily bloats the plan size. We need to figure out a way not to serialize fetch task in plans sent to backend., [~ashutoshc] I've missed your comment. I'll check that., This already implemented in HIVE-4880. Just removing 167 line in ExplainTask (fetchTask.setRootTask(true)) will do this. Could you check that first?, Forget the above mention. Updating the patch., Addressed comments. Expects many failures from newly added tests., seems like tests don't run on previous patch. In need of rebase., Rebased to trunk & Updated diff files, Seems like source (java files) changes are missing in latest patch.,
