[I think we should fix GenericUDFIn to use common type for comparison instead of generic common type. In this case, for common type of int and string, we should use int instead of string., Looks fine to me +1, +1 if the approach can pass all the decimal unit tests.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12774369 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, After looking into the issue more, I found it is not easy to fix this issue completely. We can fix the problem for int, but it is hard to fix it for double/float.

So I think it is better not change the current code. Users can work around
the issue easily.]
