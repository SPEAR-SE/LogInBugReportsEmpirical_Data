[Hi, JinsuKim, I have met the same problem these days, and I'm also trying to figure out the best solution.
I am afraid the performance of `get_json_object` will be slowed down heavily with this patch, when running in multi-thread mode.
I have even written a ConcurrentLRUHashMap to fulfill a distributed cache, but it does not behave as efficiently as I expected.
Perhaps making HashCache not static is an appropriate way., Besides, all the five HashCache Object have the same problem.
It must be beautiful when all the threads are fighting for these five locks : ), Hi, I had this problem some time ago as well, but they should be fixed with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16196 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16060, Already fixed by HIVE-16196, thanks JÃ¼rgen Thomann.]
