INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/UDAFTestMethodOverloading.java:44 Can you write a more complex test case for this ?

  I mean,

  2 iterates storing different states (I mean different datatypes).

  terminate returning different datatype results

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/UDAFTestMethodOverloading.java:44 Is this currently implemented? How would I find the right terminate method if it is overloaded? By the return type? I don't see any way in GenericUDAFBridge to determine what the return type of the UDAF should be.

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/UDAFTestMethodOverloading.java:44 IIRC, you can't overload based on return type (in either Java or Hive).
