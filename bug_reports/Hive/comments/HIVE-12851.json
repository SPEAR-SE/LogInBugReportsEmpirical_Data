[[~hagleitn] [~gopalv] fyi, The patch. I still need to test it, later today hopefully, -1 on the use of argparse - is a famously python3 module.

The default centos6 python version is 2.7, which is what we expect at a normal install location today., argparse is supported for Python 2.3 and later... I think it's reasonable to expect users to install it if missing. It's also a standalone module, so it can be copied if missing. When I was testing it, it was present on Python 2.6.6 on RHEL 6.6 and CentOS 6.6 (2 separate clusters). , QE  automation uses it, which might be how you have it., Fix the --chaosmonkey option and add "s" suffix to the template formats., 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:

[~sershe]: you're right, python-argparse makes this much neater - I'll eat my objections :)

I tested this on an insecure cluster as well, Slider ignores missing keytabs if there's no kerberos init., Committed to master and branch-2.0 (since it's unlikely to affect any other code)., With a Centos 6.5 minimal install and HDP 2.4 / Python 2.6.6 need to run the following to get argparse installed

yum -y install epel-release
pip install argparse

, Pip is probably not a repeatable install - using python-argparse RPMs is probably better

{code}, Thanks Gopal, do you think this can be included as part of Hive packaging/LLAP setup or argparse dependency removed?  Likely won't be an issue for customers running later versions of Python, though there are probably many who aren't and are in locked-down environments.

Here's some information on the recommended way of installing argparse from CA.

I think wiki needs some documentation around LLAP setup & dependencies.]
