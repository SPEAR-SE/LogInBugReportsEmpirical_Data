[On Hadoop 0.20 the 'dfs -count' command outputs a fully qualified file location:

{noformat}
dfs -count /build/ql/test/data/warehouse/hbpartition;
           1            3              23380 hdfs://localhost.localdomain:37780/tmp/hbsort/cf
{noformat}

But on 0.23 the file location is not qualified:

{noformat}
dfs -count /build/ql/test/data/warehouse/hbpartition;
           1            3              24792 /tmp/hbsort/cf
{noformat}

This is a causing a test failure in TestHBaseMinimrCliDriver.hbase_bulk.m
, Note: This problem only affects the 0.8.x branch. Trunk already uses different code for masking test outputs that prevents this problem from occurring.]
