ATTACHMENT ID: 12703732 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The description of *hive.default.fileformat.managed* should be rephrased to clarify which default is which:

bq.  Default file format for CREATE TABLE statement applied to managed tables only. External tables will be created with default file format. Leaving this null will result in using the default file format for all tables.

For example:

bq.  Default file format for CREATE TABLE statement applied to managed tables only. External tables will be created with the format specified by hive.default.fileformat. Leaving this null will result in using hive.default.fileformat for all tables.
, .2 addresses [~leftylev]'s comment and fixes the test case (apparently using a non existing path works on my machine but not for the build)., Looks good, thanks Gunther., [~leftylev]: While reviewing Gunther's patch I ran into some questions which the doc answered, but weren't obvious.

The quadrant of native vs non-native and external vs managed needs to be drawn somehow for this to explain the feature in the docs.

|| \ || Native || Non-Native ||
| Managed | hive.default.fileformat.managed (or fall back to the other) | not covered by default file-formats | 
| External | hive.default.fileformat  |  not covered by default file-formats | ,

The quadrant can be added to "Configuration Properties" and to the "File Formats" overview page (which is just a stub with links currently):

* [Configuration Properties -- File Formats | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-FileFormats]
* [File Formats | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/FileFormats], _Nudge:_  This has been committed (http://svn.apache.org/r1666524) so the status should be changed., Committed to trunk., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira., Doc done - *hive.default.fileformat.managed* has been added to the wiki:
* [Configuration Properties | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.default.fileformat.managed]

[~gopalv], thanks for the quadrant chart above.  It has been included with the parameter in the wiki.]
