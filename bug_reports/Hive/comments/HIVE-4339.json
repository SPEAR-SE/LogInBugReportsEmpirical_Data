[Fixes the build by keeping hcatalog at 0.11.0 for now. We can switch once snapshots are published. Real fix is to have hcat build against local hive artifacts..., Hey [~hagleitn]

I think just this one line change in hcatalog/build.properties fixes this issue:

{noformat}
-hcatalog.version=0.11.0-SNAPSHOT
+hcatalog.version=0.12.0-SNAPSHOT
{nofromat}

I am able to build hive successfully with this.

+ Vikram., That was the first thing I had tried, but that failed for me. Can you do a very-clean build and see if that works for you? This would obviously be a much better fix., [~vikram.dixit]: Tried again. What you suggests fails for me when I build from scratch. The quickest way to get the build back for me is still the original patch., +1 
This is a hacky. Proper fix is tracked in HIVE-4278 but that is under discussion and is blocked by HIVE-4304. Committing this in interim to get trunk back into buildable state., Committed to trunk., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2061 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2061/])
