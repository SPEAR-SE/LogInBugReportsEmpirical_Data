[WIP patch., Couple of suggestions:
* Seems like changes in MapRedTask are unintentional.
* Instead of modifying existing test files, I will recommend to create new test cases with names like tez_*, No .q.out because we have yet to integrate with tez test class., Updated after branch re-sync. , Review board request:

https://reviews.apache.org/r/14349/, Addresses Gunther's comments., [~vikram.dixit] can you take a look at .5?

I've added some comments, but also I think there were two code issues:

a) pos wasn't incremented in the else branch, which I think leads to an incorrect big table position

b) big table position -1 was used when all tables are empty., Looks good. Thanks Gunther!, Committed to branch. Thanks Vikram!]
