[Due to the way the testing infrastructure runs using LOAD DATA INFILE causes failure on standard mode.

org.apache.hadoop.mapred.InvalidInputException: Input path does not exist: file:/tmp/edward/hive_2010-12-16_13-25-49_419_5685676156670855494/data/files/T2.txt

I guess that is why dfs was used in the test case.
, Actually the test is failing for me in both local and mini-mr mode. Has this been disabled from hudson?]
