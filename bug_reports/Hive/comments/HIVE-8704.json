[Note that these scenarios are difficult to write unit tests for, since we'd require the ability to start a MiniAccumuloCluster and a MiniHBaseCluster in the same process, and an appropriate QTestUtil to use both of them, so I haven't written a unit test for them. However, the scenario is pretty easy to reproduce manually on a cluster where you have accumulo and hbase and system tests can detect them(which is where I got that above stack trace from). As long as HBase was the only SH that went through PTOF, we didn't notice this, but it's easy to verify now., Attaching patch that addresses this issue.

The changes here are as follows:

a) Make the realOutputFormat ThreadLocal
b) Remove the addition of PTOF to the substitute map
c) Add in a clause that makes sure we reset the realOutputFormat even if PTOF has already been resolved. (robustness - in case we have changes later on which winds up adding PTOF to the map elsewhere), [~hagleitn] : one more for 0.14, please.

[~ashutoshc], you're probably the person the most familiar with this section of code that I know of - could you please review?

[~elserj],[~ndimiduk] : Thought you guys would be interested in this bug. :), Nice find, [~sushanth]! Thanks for getting to the bottom of this.,
