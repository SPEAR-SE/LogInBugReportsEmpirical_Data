ATTACHMENT ID: 12635168, Have we confirmed that this change works both when Hive is installed as a tarball and when installed via bigtop rpms?, [~deepesh] said that none of the locations this script attempted to use were used by rpm.  Deepesh, could you confirm?, That seems accurate to my knowledge., Does that mean that a different fix is required with bigtop rpm ?
, no, it's exactly the same, +1, [~rhbutani] It would be great to have this bug fix in hive 0.13.
, +1 for 0.13, Patch committed to 0.13 branch and trunk.
