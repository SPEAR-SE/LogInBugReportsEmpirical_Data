[(Attaching addendum patch that was uploaded to HCATALOG-621), [~ndimiduk], I created this hive jira since I was not able to respond on HCATALOG-621, since that seems like it's been locked down.


+1 to the change, I'll go ahead and commit it.

I've experimented with both versions of the find command, and both work for me (with and without quotes, and in fact, I'm more used to the backslash notation). I'm using findutils-4.4.2-6.el6.x86_64. The main difference though, was that our offending jar is libthrift\*jar, not thrift\*jar.
, Committed. Thanks, Nick!, Thanks [~sushanth]!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
