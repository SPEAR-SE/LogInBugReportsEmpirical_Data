[This would be exceptionally useful - I have seen at least two implementations of TOPN UDAFs for this., preliminary patch: this adds code to WdwTabFn to react to a rank limit.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12651239, This is not going to optimize limit with rank like following :
{code}
select * from ( select p_mfgr, rank() over(..) from part) a limit 4;
{code}
Rather, this optimization is targeted for rank with filter predicates. It does seem like users are likely to write query with filter predicate given semantics of rank so this may not be an issue, but I think its good to note here so expectations are clear., Yes, in your case we can optimize as though 'rank < 5' was specified.  Though I cannot see a valid use case of writing a limit after a windowing expression, as you point out the more common case is a predicate on rank., Make sense. I left few comments on RB., thanks [~ashutoshc]. Have uploaded a patch addressing the issues you raised, +1,
