[Some of the file systems can return null if there are no objects to list.
Added a fix for that., From what I know about the java compiler it will simply stop evaluating the rest of the line if 
fstatus != null is false. So the brackets don't add anything. A lot of code is written with this knowledge in mind., I generated the patch from 0.7 branch and then rebased it to 0.8.
Didn't realize that it was already fixed in 0.8 while generating the patch.
I will resolve this.

Thanks
