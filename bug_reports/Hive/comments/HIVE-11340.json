[Workaround:

create table orc_table_2 like orc_table tblproperties ("orc.compress"="SNAPPY");, Fix it by adding orc.compress to schemaProps, Need code review. , Not sure why the build has not run yet, priority too low? 
Add more comments for easier to understand the change:
The fix is following same pattern as patch for HIVE-8450.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12748942 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The 3 failures are not related.
The 2 Minimr failures all have the error:
[Error 30017]: Skipping stats aggregation by error org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: [Error 30015]: Stats aggregator of type counter cannot be connected to
It may relate to network issue.
I tested them in my local machine, they all passed.
The testSSLConnectionWithProperty failure ages 5.
[~csun], could you review the patch? Thanks


, Add to RB:
https://reviews.apache.org/r/37218/, Change the test to use describe formatted.
It seems that in order not to be masked by the output, the property has to be explicitly used. Add get compress info in the OrcSerde initialize method. Also fix a bug in OrcConf.  ,
