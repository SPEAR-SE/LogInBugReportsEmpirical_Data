[Seems like we should instead check if the udf corresponding to the class has been whitelisted instead of the alias., Looks like this is true for permanent functions as well. Users will have to whitelist a qualified name of permanent function when using whitelist, like: db1.perm_funct, In other words setupPermissionsForBuiltinUDFs in FunctionRegistry.java also affects non built in UDFS.]
