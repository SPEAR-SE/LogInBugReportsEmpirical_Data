[Note without hsync, the content may not flush to hdfs., +1, Change the patch so that:
1. The process information is written to a separate file, which is closed so the content is flushed to HDFS
2. Initialize hive log4j setting, so it will pick hive-log4j.properties to do the logging, Looks good. How about writing the hostname as well ?
