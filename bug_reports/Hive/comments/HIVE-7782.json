[I am investigating this. 

In a hive session, when the first Tez job is executed, internally the mapreduce.framework.name property is set to "yarn-tez" (See TezSessionState.open() method). This setting causes all native MR jobs in this session to be sent to Tez for execution. 


When the execution engine is changed to MR (i.e. set hive.execution.engine=mr), this setting change is not reverted. So, the subsequent query, which used to go to native MR, now goes to Tez instead (as MR on Tez). That's why its faster than native MR, but slower than native Tez.
