[https://reviews.facebook.net/D6819, +1, Kevin,
I am not sure if you have looked at the discussion on HIVE-2800 Adding a null-check may just be masking an underlying issue. I think it might be worthwhile to uncover it, since this thrift nuisance (of null handling) may bite us again in future., Ashutosh, I missed that JIRA.  But based on THRIFT-1625 it sounds like we have to add a check to our code., Yeah, looks like adding null check is the only possible solution here. +1 
Kevin / Namit, feel free to commit., Committed. Thanks Kevin, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1811 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1811/])
