[Added support for TIMESTAMP column on the JDBC driver. I am not 100% sure of the precision and scale. Please do verify. I tested the sanity and I am able to retrieve a column upto nano-second precision., Patch needs a test case., Unlinking from 0.9, I updated the patch.
I added testcase and fixed the some issues which I found on running the test.
