[JDBC -
Hive includes a new JDBC client driver for HiveServer2. It supports both embedded and remote access to HiveServer2.
The JDBC connection URL format has prefix is jdbc:hive2:// and the Driver class is org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver. Note that this is different from the old hiveserver. For remote server, the URL format is jdbc:hive2://<host>:<port>/<db>. For embedded server, the URL format is jdbc:hive2:// (no host or port)
When connecting to HiveServer2 with kerberos authentication, the URL format is jdbc:hive2://<host>:<port>/<db>;principal=<Server_Principal_of_HiveServer2>. The client needs to have a valid Kerberos ticket in the ticket cache before connecting. In case of LDAP or customer pass through authentication, the client needs to pass the valid user name and password to JDBC connection API.

Hive includes a new command shell Beeline that works with HiveServer2. Its a JDBC client that is based on SQLLine CLI (http://sqlline.sourceforge.net/). Thereâ€™s an detailed documentation of the SQLLine options available at http://sqlline.sourceforge.net/#manual which is applicable to Beeline., Added the documentation under https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients]
