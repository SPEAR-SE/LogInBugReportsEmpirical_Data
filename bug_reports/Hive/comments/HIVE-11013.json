[The problem is that nobody initializes dummy ops on this case; mapjoin init bails in the beginning due to parent state, and then someone is supposed to call init on the dummy op, but doesn't. I'm looking further, I thought the problem was in serialization, but apparently GenTezUtils.removeUnionOperators called from somewhere actually removes the dummies (or rather replaces them with empty list)... digging further, The problem is that removeUnionOperators gets the dummies from the target work, and then sets them back after some machinations. 
MergeJoinWork implements setDummyOps, passing dummies on to the main work, but it doesn't implement get, so the latter goes to BaseWork and returns its own list, which is null. removeUnionOperators then cheerfully resets the list in ReduceWork to null.

Implementing get fixes the test.

[~vikram.dixit] [~hagleitn] you appear to have authored the code in MergeJoinWork and GenTezUtils respectively. Can you take a look?
Do we need the java file patch for trunk (out file change is llap specific)?

I also left an info log when this happens., +1. I vaguely remember having this code. Not sure if/when it got dropped. Good catch., master patch. Hopefully HiveQA will also run, committed to master, Hi, this is causing compilation failure, we should have waited for precommit tests to be run before commit.  The method is defined twice for the class.

Do you want to make a quick fix, or we should revert the change?, Will fix momentarily, Fixed, Thanks.]
