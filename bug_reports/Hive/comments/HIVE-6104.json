ATTACHMENT ID: 12620298, I don't think the above test failure is related, because the test passed on my computer., Even though it is short, if you put the patch on Review Board that'll make it easier to review., https://reviews.apache.org/r/16836/ (my bad for not having this sooner), Can someone please review and commit this bug fix? If I am not following the proper procedure, do let me know, don't ignore the jira. Thanks., Hi Steven,

I found your emails in my spam folder for some reason. Probably the reason for most people missing this. I will take a look.

Regards
Vikram., LGTM +1. I will commit this shortly., Committed to trunk. Thanks Steven!, Thanks, Vikram!]
