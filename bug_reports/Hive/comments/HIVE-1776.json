[the problem is that tasks are trying to modify the shared hive configuration object and trampling each other. fix is to clone the configuration object before modifying it in the Task., This line is removed from MapRedTask.java:

ctx.setOriginalTracker(conf.getVar(HiveConf.ConfVars.HADOOPJT));

I assume this is intentional.


, yeah it was - but shoot - i forgot to take out the corresponding call in the finally block to restore the tracker. will upload new patch.

these are no longer necessary because we are using a cloned configuration object that is discarded once the task completes., +1

running tests, Committed. Thanks Joy]
