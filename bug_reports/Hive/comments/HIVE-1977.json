[I think we can fix this by introducing a new configuration property that controls whether DESCRIBE uses the standard syntax or the Hive syntax., currently the following is working:

1. $describe table;
2. $describe table.column;

while, these are not working:

3. $describe column;
4. $describe database.table;
5. $describe database.table.column;

always errors about the starting element is not a valid Table.

Hive should support #3 and #5, since these are standard syntax, by updating Hive.g and related parser/lexer.

For #4, a new configuration property may be needed to distinguish #2 with #4.
Or, shall we always try matching both #2 and #4 when doing parsing? And error out if and only if neither matches? In this way, no new configuration property needed.

This is also related to HIVE-2228., bq. 3. $describe column;

This doesn't make sense since tables in the same schema are allowed to have columns with the same name. The correct syntax for describing a column is:

DESCRIBE table column

or

DESCRIBE db.table column
 , @Carl: Get it. Should follow the correct syntax.

In summary, should support the following:

1. $describe table;
2. $describe database.table;
3. $describe table column;
4. $describe database.table column;
5. $describe table.column;
6. $describe database.table.column;

Currently,
#1 is working
#2 is error out for database not a valid table name
#3 and #4 are having exceptions for invalid syntax
#5 is working

How about #6, are we going to support it?
currently, #6 also error out for database not a valid table name

And, to distinguish #2 and #5, a new configuration property is needed, or we try both, and error out only if neither matches?, Review Request submitted at:
https://reviews.facebook.net/D5763, Why do we need a new conf. for this ?
I like your idea: we try both, and error out only if neither matches?, It is making the code complicated.
Is the idea behind introducing a new conf. to handle the case if both table.column and database.table are valid ?
Seems very unlikely, cant we create a hierarchy : database.table preceeds table.column.
If the user really wants table.column in that case, they can always issue database.table.column which does not have any ambiguities., @Namit: Thanks for your comments. I updated the patch, did the following:

1. Instead of adding a new conf, try database.table first, if not valid(via tableValidCheck and databaseValidCheck), try table.column.
2. get rid of isStandardSyntax, re-work the code

, This issue is fixed and released as part of 0.10.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira., This could be documented in the wiki, but [~thejas] recommended leaving it undocumented:

Yes, DOT is also optional now, but I am not a fan of that syntax. It has
made it almost impossible
to extend describe statements to other commands, as you can see from
HIVE-5931<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5931?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=13924779#comment-13924779>
.
Lets just document the syntax with DOT for now. That way it be easier to
fix the syntax later if we choose to.

So if I get agreement here, I'll remove the TODOC10 label from this JIRA ticket.
