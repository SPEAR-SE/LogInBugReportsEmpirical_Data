ATTACHMENT ID: 12633644, When I run
{code}
mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources -DdownloadJavadocs -Phadoop-2
{code}

after applying this patch, I get following warning:
{code}
[WARNING] The POM for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0 is missing, no dependency information available
[WARNING] Failed to retrieve plugin descriptor for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0: Plugin org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Failure to find org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0 in http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced
{code}

Is that a cause for concern ? Though, I see that .classpath and .project files being created for different modules, which seem to indicate that patch is working., Please open new jira, still it is a problem on master.]
