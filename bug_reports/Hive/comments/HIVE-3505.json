[Code review here: https://reviews.apache.org/r/7238/, @Sean: comments on reviewboard. Thanks., This patch fixes a typo that existed on these lines before this fix. This patch is also in SVN format (as opposed to git)., +1. Will commit if tests pass., @Sean: Actually, would you mind making the same change to ql/src/java/conf/hive-exec-log4j.properties? Thanks., log4j.threshold and hive.root.logger specify two different levels. Should they actually be the same, in reality or should only one be paramterized? Which would be most intuitive considering how this file gets used?, Generally speaking they should be the same. The way you have it setup in hive-log4j.properties looks like the right approach to me., New patch applies the same change to hive-exec-log4j.properties, +1. Will commit if tests pass., Committed to trunk. Thanks Sean!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1698 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1698/])
