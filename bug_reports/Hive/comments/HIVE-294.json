[the new grammar will accept queries like this also

FROM src
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest1
MAP src.*, src.key, CAST(src.key / 10 AS INT), CAST(src.key % 10 AS INT), src.value
USING '/bin/cat' AS (k, v, tkey, ten, one, *)
SORT BY tvalue, tkey;


since the AS parenthesis can also contain  tableAllColumns. Would that mean the remaining columns from the MAP() should map to the remaining columns of src?, I don't think that will be accepted. The list after AS is an alias list.
, yeah, you are right.
