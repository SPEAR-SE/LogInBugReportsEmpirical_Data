[[~mmccline]: LGTM - +1 tests pending.

I can either open another JIRA with {{regexp_replace}} or we can overload this one (seems to need the same 3 lines)., Thanks!  I added regexp_replace, Lots of Hive QA submits failed due JIRA being down., 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:

ATTACHMENT ID: 12792971 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I notice some random Spark batches and other batches of tests not producing results in other builds, too.

Otherwise, it appears to have passed.
