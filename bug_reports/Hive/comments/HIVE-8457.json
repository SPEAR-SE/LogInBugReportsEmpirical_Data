[There are two problems I found:
1. one thread may be reused for multiple queries, and therefore, if one {{IOContext}} is bound to one thread, and the {{IOContext}} is not initialized, we need to clear it when we close the map record handler;
2. synchronization is needed - the thread who doesn't have {{IOContext}} initialized may try to retrieve before the thread who have {{IOContext}} initialized saving it. Right now, a thread will save {{IOContext}} right after initializing it. But, this is not a perfect solution., This patch also enables caching on input RDD, so once this is resolved, HIVE-8437 should also be resolved.,
