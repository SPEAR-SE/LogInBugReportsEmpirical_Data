ATTACHMENT ID: 12653354, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Thejas!, This needs to be documented for SHOW GRANT and presumably also SHOW ROLE GRANT:

* [SQL Standard Based Hive Authorization - Show Grant | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization#SQLStandardBasedHiveAuthorization-ShowGrant]
* [SQL Standard Based Hive Authorization - Show Role Grant | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization#SQLStandardBasedHiveAuthorization-ShowRoleGrant]

(Is this just for SQL standards based authorization?  If not, see [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Authorization#LanguageManualAuthorization-ViewingGrantedPrivileges] and [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Authorization#LanguageManualAuthorization-ViewingGrantedRoles].), Yes, this is applicable to both 'show grant' and 'show role grant'
This is applicable only to sql standard based authorization.

If a user is not in admin role, the user can run show grants only using a itself as the principal or a role the user belongs to as the principal. The show grant statements without principal names are not allowed for users not in admin role.
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
