[Is this an expected behavior ?
We are running into similar issue where in using "hive.auto.convert.join=true"  and using tables in join clause whose size is not more than 100 MB, we are seeing execution time of almost 5-6 hours !

We are using following settings :
set HADOOP_HEAPSIZE=5120;
set hive.auto.convert.join=true;
set hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask=true;
set hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask.size=1000000000;
set mapred.task.timeout=600000;

OR is there is a work around for the same
