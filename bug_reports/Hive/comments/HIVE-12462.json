ATTACHMENT ID: 12773190 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures are because of the missing cleanup (currently, the code cleans up TS expr separately and filter expr as part of processing, if TS expr is used in processing noone cleans up the filter). Patch soon, Updated the patch., I think the FIL path is having its Synthetic predicate removed too early. I'll take another shot at this., Hmm. The previous logic removed it exactly after processing, and then removed the TS one at the end. This one should do the same.., [~sershe]: yes, you're right. LGTM - +1., Committed to master., I've looked into this some more. This should have already worked. There are tests in dynamic_partition_pruner.q that check for this type of join condition (with udf). However these tests no longer work. HIVE-11634 broke them. [~hsubramaniyan]/[~jpullokkaran] can you please take a look at this? I don't think the patch proposed here is the right fix and should probably be reverted.

HIVE-11634 changes the golden file of the dynamic_partition_pruner.q - it effectively disables the optimization and I'm not sure why. The synthetic predicate in dpp is of the form (col IN (reducesink operator)) which for some reason gets lost in HIVE-11634.

HIVE-11634 also seem to leave you with different expressions in the table scan and the filter and I'm thinking this is wrong as well (i.e.: the fix in this patch shouldn't work either)., We should figure out the right fix for the above issue before reverting this. Do you want to track it in  HIVE-12462?, I think the reason for this patch from [~gopalv]'s query runs was precisely that TS predicate was a superset of FIL predicate. I was assuming that's by design., Created HIVE-12666 to track the issue that [~hagleitn] mentioned. My bad . After going through the change in HIVE-11634, the change in PCRExprProcFactory is the original cause for the dynamic partitioning event operator to disappear from many places since it aggressively removes the IN list predicates.

Thanks
Hari
, I've uploaded the patch with the potential fix on this issue in HIVE-12666, will be great if someone can review it. I am also reverting this patch as part of the fix.

Thanks
Hari, [~hagleitn] what is the status of this, is this relevant anymore?, I believe this jira is invalid and should be closed as 'Not a Problem' or something similar since HIVE-12666 tracks the underlying issue. Leaving it to the original owners of the jira, [~gopalv] / [~sershe] to take the required action.

Thanks
