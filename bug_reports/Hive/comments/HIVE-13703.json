[This patch fixes this issue. Could somebody review  it?, Would this be fixed by HIVE-14511, or otherwise should it use a similar approach (looking for the expected directory structure in the first place, rather than catching errors)?, Oh yeah, now I see that HIVE-14511 really fixes this issue. Thank you
