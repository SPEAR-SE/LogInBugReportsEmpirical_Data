[Here's the problem. Two of the optimization rules, ConvertJoinMapJoin and RemoveDynamicPruningBySize, are put into stats dependent optimizations and run together in TezCompiler. As ConvertJoinMapJoin is removing the reduce sink, it may also have removed a dynamic partition pruning operator chain. However, RemoveDynamicPruningBySize doesn't know this and still tries to traverse that removed chain, which ends up with no parent being found., The fix will be to remember the removed chain if any in ConverJoinMapJoin, and skip traversing that in RemoveDynamicPruningBySize., Upload patch 01 for testing, [~hagleitn] Can you take a look?, Can you please add a review board entry? Patch looks good, but I think you're not populating the new hash set in all places we remove the pruner. , Review board link added., Upload 2nd patch for testing.

[~hagleitn] Can you take another look?, Upload 3rd patch for testing.

[~hagleitn] Can you take another look?, Per discussion with [~hagleitn], this is okay to defer out to 1.2.1, so doing so - still marking it in the tentative list, so if it is reviewed and in by the time we finish our RC process, it'll be in, but otherwise, it'll track for 1.2.1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12730981 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures are not related. I see the same failures in previous tests too., +1, Committed to trunk., Committed to branch 1.2, Thanks for fixing this, I think this is the same issue as reported HIVE-8204.
I was able to reproduce this issue on Hive 1.0.0 and confirmed the patch works for Hive 1.0.0, Can anybody confirm if this bug affects Hive 0.14 as well?  I seem to have encountered it for a join query.  Setting either *hive.auto.convert.join* or *hive.tez.dynamic.partition.pruning* to false resolves the issue., [~seanpquig] Yes, this problem happens for 0.14 too., Thanks.]
