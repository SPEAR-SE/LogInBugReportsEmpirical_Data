The code says this is a stop gap fix, and I agree. Can you open a follow up jira for the fix using custom input initializer?, Address Gunther's comments.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12643166, LGTM +1. There are two small review items, but I can fix those up when checking in., Hi guys,

could you commit this patch to trunk and comment on whether it's stable to backport to 0.13 ?, Committed to trunk. It is stable to back port to 0.13.

Thanks
Vikram., committed to trunk., FYI, on testing 0.13.0 RC0, this patch seemed to be the one git bisect identifies as causing a couple of test failures.
The test failures are as follows:

org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMinimrCliDriver.testCliDriver_bucketmapjoin6

The logs for the git bisect run for this bug are available over at http://people.apache.org/~khorgath/releases/0.13.1_RC0/test_failures/HIVE-6926.bisect/

The .sh files there were the scripts used to test hive for the bugs in question, and the file prior.patch available there is the patch that you will need to apply on top of 0.13.0 if you want to arrive at the last clean state before this patch was introduced and the issue was observed., Correction on the URL above, should be http://people.apache.org/~khorgath/releases/0.13.1_RC0/test_failures/HIVE-6826.bisect/, This passes on my setup. Could be an intermittently failing test as I have seen this fail in other jiras as well., Yup, on re-testing, it seems to pass on my setup as well. I'm going to ignore the initial failure report. Thanks for checking up on it!, This jira has been fixed as part of 0.13.1 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.
