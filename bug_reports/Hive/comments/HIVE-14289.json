[i've narrowed it down to the {{maven-remote-resources-plugin}} ... not sure why it's needed...but with this patch the problem goes away...and i was able to install the root project; but it reappeared inside itests...and i was not able to skip that...i think this anomaly maybe related to the ant plugin...

i've created an ugly patch with this skip..hoping that it may help in any further investigations

I can't really see any solutions...if someone would give it a try - maybe a fresh mindset can help ;)]
