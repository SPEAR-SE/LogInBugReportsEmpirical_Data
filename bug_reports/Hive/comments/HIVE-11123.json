ATTACHMENT ID: 12742828 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I attach a patch file again., [~sinchii] thanks for the patch! What version of Oracle did you use for testing this? We saw some issues with existing code (without your patch) on Oracle 12 whereas it worked fine on Oracle 11. Just want to make sure that it works as expected between different Oracle versions., [~deepesh] Thank you for your comment. I confirmed version Oracle 11g R2 and 12c. And I could get the same value "Oracle" by both versions., This has been around for a while... I will commit today if there are no objections., I am not sure if this will work for mysql. Earlier, determineDbType() was overloaded which also executed actual logic alongwith db detection which will no longer be the case. e.g, {{SET @@session.sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES}} will not execute any longer for mysql, which may cause problems., Hmm.. it's a good point. It was only called during init before, though, I wonder how it ever worked. Luck? Magic? I will make a fix on top, btw, the patch needed to be rebased. Here's what I committed, HIVE-11668, Also, this patch broke hive working against mysql and potentially other dbs - I will follow up with comments on HIVE-11668. Testing with derby alone in unit test mode is problematic. Sorry I didn't catch this before it was committed., Thanks, guys. Should we revert this commit though?, I think HIVE-11668 is close to committing (after I verify), so I think we can hold off on reverting this, since it is actually still useful. Otherwise, I'd agree that this was a revert-candidate.]
