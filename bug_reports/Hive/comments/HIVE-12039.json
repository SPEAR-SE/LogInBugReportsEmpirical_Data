ATTACHMENT ID: 12765663 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, Pushed to master., The precommit results from this patch show that org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestSSL.testSSLVersion was still failing, so this may not have fixed the issue., Reopening as the test still fails.
, Removing fixed version (2.0) from Unresolved JIRA in preparation for the release. Please use target version field instead (if not already set) if you think this should be shipped as part of 2.0, [~vgumashta], could you please submit a patch for this? It now blocks HIVE-12773. Thanks., Another try. Test passes locally, let's see if it passes precommit.,
