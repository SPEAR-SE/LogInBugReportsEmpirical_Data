[[~mmccline]: The attached data-set has 2 ORC input files and the query to run. 

TPC-DS is entirely single integer joins - so can't really port the example problem onto TPC-DS., VectorMapJoinInnerMultiKeyOperator closeOp 10 batches processed and 53 rows forwarded, Turning off the Native Vector ReduceSink does not eliminate the problem.

Current guess: old pass-thru VectorMapJoinOperator passes a separate output batch with an identity (i.e. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) projection array.  VectorMapJoinMultiKeyOperator uses the input BigTable batch for output and has a non-identity projection (i.e. [0, 3, 4, 0, 1] -- don't worry about the repeated 0).  How does the VectorFilterOperator handle projection?, It doesn't appear that the VectorFilterOperator handles vectorized row batch projection at all., [~mmccline]: this seems to only repro for Date functions, which give me enough to deep-dive into this., The batch.selectedInUse and col.isRepeating were interfering with each other's semantics.

Fix for all Date UDFS + added test-case with 1 value column, with isRepeating=true, isSelectedInUse=true & .selected[0] = 42;

After the fix, it should not be trying to read col[42], but should operate on col[0] because isRepeating is true., [~prasanth_j]: can you take a look?, LGTM, +1. Pending tests,
