[The hashmap is filled in a static block (via registerType). Would it be better to (also?) replace it with a switch statement?, Yes, that might be better than adding more data into the typeinfo object.

The serialization of typeinfo pulling in PrimitiveTypeEntry objects without de-dup might be happening with the patch above.

The tests might pass, but I'm looking at the plan size changes with this patch.]
