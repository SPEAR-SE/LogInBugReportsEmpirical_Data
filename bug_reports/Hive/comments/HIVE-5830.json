ATTACHMENT ID: 12616595, Patch looks good. Can you add comments on what kind of query form we are generating through all new static methods.

Also cross join of subq with count * will be expensive. As an optimization we should convert such kind of joins where other side is an output of a function always into a map-join. This will also give us an opportunity in this case to pack subsequent LOJ into same MR task. 
Though, this optimization is independent of this work and would be generally useful outside of this use-case. Can you create a jira for that one?, added comments to SubQueryUtils.
Will add a new jira for optimization.,
