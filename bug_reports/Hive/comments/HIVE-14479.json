[[~ekoifman] Can you take a look?, I think the statements to run compactions don't do anything since you don't have an Worker threads running.
you can add SHOW COMPACTIONS to the test to check

I think it's a good idea to include compactions as part of the test but I don't know how to do that in .q file, I move the part for testing compaction into a JUnit test,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12822853 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, For the test in TestTxnCommands2, I would add a check that compaction actually ran.
See testCompactWithDelete() for example.  Otherwise, you'll never know if compaction failed and did nothing.

Also, in .q files, I see various options being set to trigger specific type of join.  Is that not needed in TestTxnCommands2?, patch 3 removes the qfile as the file size estimation in explain always changes depending on where the test is run. Moved the test into a JUnit test., it would be more flexible if the 2nd param in assertExplainHasString(String string, List<String> queryPlan, String testFor) simply took the whole message.  Then "switch" statement is not needed and it works for all future cases.

, patch 4 re-org'ed the test,
