[1. Diff on convert_enum_to_string.q seems  due to thrift version change. Since there were on other failures, it might be okay. However, we have to keep an eye on it, in case of any incompatibility that might arise.

2. dynamic_rdd_cache.q was merged from the branch, and test output needs to be updated due to recent master changes.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12748308 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Agree about convert_enum_to_string, also looked into this [here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10319?focusedCommentId=14647008&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14647008]
What change in master is responsible for dynamic_rdd_cache.q?, Good question. I don't know. The test case was added in Spark branch, so the test output was generated here. After merging from master to Spark branch, the test case output should have been updated but didn't because the test didn't run due to some testing environment issue. Nevertheless, this doesn't answer the question. The difference seems to be the order of the SELECT and FILTER operators. The output for spark was updated via HIVE-11296, which changed the order, while the test out for MR was missed because of the above mentioned test env issue.

[~csun], do you have any idea of what made the diff when we merged master to Spark branch in HIVE-11296?, I'm not sure either. Seems like an extra SELECT op is generated after merging from master., Looks like HIVE-11223 has similar changes in its diff, though those are in the Map join not the Reduce job.
Probably safe to consider this just a golden file update.

+1, I pinpointed HIVE-11333 changed the behavior.,
