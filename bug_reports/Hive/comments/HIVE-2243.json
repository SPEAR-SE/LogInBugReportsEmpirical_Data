[Hi Carl,

I can work on this jira if you are busy; let me know.
, Sounds good. Reassigning to you., can someone try the following command with credentials in the .m2/settings.xml and post the output? ( I don't have repo access to verify this). 
{noformat}
ant clean maven-build maven-publish -Dmvn.publish.repo=staging -Dversion=0.8.0
{noformat}
This would publish the artifacts to the apache staging repo. we can delete them post publishing.. by logging on to the repository.apache.org.

If the command works then I would submit a patch for gpg signing.
, I'm not able run the command successfully. It gives Access denied error.

{noformat}
maven-publish-artifact:

{noformat}

where as I'm able to publish to snapshots repo without any problems.
, Giri, Did you get a chance to look at why publishing to staging area is failing?,

Summary
-------

Fix for HIVE-2243. Can't publish maven release artifacts to apache repository.

With this patch in place I verified that I am able to publish to the snapshot
and staging repositories as follows:

% ant maven-build -Dmvn.publish.repo=snapshots
% ant maven-publish -Dmvn.publish.repo=snaphots

% ant maven-build -Dmvn.publish.repo=staging -Dversion=0.9.0
% ant maven-publish -Dmvn.publish.repo=staging -Dversion=0.9.0

I also confirmed that this patch applies cleanly to the 0.8.0 branch.

Please note that I had to move several taskdefs from build-common.xml
to build.xml in order to avoid OOM errors.

Testing
-------

* Verified that I can publish maven artifacts to the snapshot and staging repos.
* Verified that the jar, package, and test targets still work.


Thanks,

, +1.  Will commit when tests pass., While attempting to run ant test, I got a PermGen space OOM  (in the ivy-resolve after the metastore tests).

{noformat}

ivy-resolve:
[ivy:resolve] :: Ivy 2.1.0 - 20090925235825 :: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ ::

{noformat}
, @John: Which version of Ant are you using? Do you have ANT_OPTS or JAVA_OPTS set?, java version "1.6.0_14"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_14-b08)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.0-b16, mixed mode)

I did not set any special options.
, (Tests have been passing fine for me on the same box without this change.), Update:  Hit PermGen OOM testing an unrelated patch too, so I'm retrying this one after rebooting the machine used for testing.
, After reboot, still hit the PermGen OOM in the middle (this time right after pdk tests).

, * I commented out the body of the 'test' target in build-common.xml and then verified that the OOM error still occurs.

{noformat}
% export ANT_OPTS="-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGC -XX:+TraceClassLoading -XX:+TraceClassUnloading -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError"
% ant clean package test &> build.log
% cat build.log | grep '^\[(Loaded|Unloading)' | sort -n | uniq -c > event.log
{noformat}

The contents of event.log indicate that the 'ivy-init-antlib' target in build-common.xml
is getting called over twenty times, and the classes which are re-loaded as a result
of each call are never unloaded. Eventually these class definitions fill up the PermGen
space and cause an OOM error. I suspect that the 'typefound' task in the 'ivy-probe-antlib'
target has a bug, or that it doesn't work as expected when called via ant/subant/antcall
tasks.

The new version of the patch fixes this issue by relocating ivy-init-antlib target from
build-common.xml to build.xml.
, Will give it another run., Committed to trunk and 0.8.  Thanks Carl!
