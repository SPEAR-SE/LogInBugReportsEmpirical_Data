[Have the same issue., I got the same stack trace on CDH 5.3. The problem is fixed in CDH 5.4.
The problem happens if a ColumnChunk contains only nulls. The Statistics object for that ColumnChunk looks like this:

statistics = {
 max = null
 min = null
 null_count = 43927
 distinct_count = 0

Thus, accessing statistics.min.array() inside fromParquetStatistics() results in an NPE., after a bit more digging around, it is pretty clear that this is caused by 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-161, which was fixed in Parquet 1.6, under https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-136
