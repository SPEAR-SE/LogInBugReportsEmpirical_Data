[[~lirui], just curious, what's the cause? is that conf is null when submitting via child? 
Patch looks good.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12735156 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~xuefuz] - Yeah, when submitted via child, the ExecDriver is not initialized (ExecDriver extends Task) and the HiveConf is null. I'll look at the failures., The 4 tests fail on master as well. Don't suppose they're related to the patch here., Attach same patch to have another run,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12737091 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Hi [~navis], would you mind take a look at this when you got time?, +1, Committed to master. Thanks Xuefu for the review., Version question:  Since this was committed to master shouldn't it say Fix Version 2.0.0, or will it also be committed to branch-1 for 1.3.0?, Yeah. I think it makes sense to commit it to branch-1 as well., Thanks [~leftylev] and [~xuefuz] for catching this. I didn't realize master is on 2.0.0 now.
Committed to branch-1 as well., [~lirui] I don't know why I've not been notified but here is my late +1, Thanks [~navis] :)]
