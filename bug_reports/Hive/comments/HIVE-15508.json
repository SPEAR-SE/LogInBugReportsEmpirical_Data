[It seems like a hard problem in Java world. Should we just move any significant allocations to memory manager and buffers (GBY, PTF, etc.), and assume nobody allocates anything else unless they are running UDFs? :), Do individual operators not track how much memory they are using?, It's Java... how would they? , I don't think we are there yet :)
, It's already done for the hashtables. Assuming buffers and memory management within these. We could of course re-write everything in C....]
