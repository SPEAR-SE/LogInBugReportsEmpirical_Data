ATTACHMENT ID: 12690495 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I don't follow the testcase. Can't understand how expression cache will be used in your .q test, since no expression is repeated in that test. [~navis] Would you mind adding Matt's test in your test case, so that we have more confidence in the fix. , [~ashutoshc] In caching, identity was checked by comparing toString(). But for UDFs (not GenericUDF), these return always same class name (org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDFBridge) making them shared between different expressions. In the testcase, "length(key)" and "reverse(key)" are both UDFs, resulting length(key)=reverse(key) always. Now it's checked correctly with ExprNodeDesc itself (with isSame() method)., Should be included in hive-0.14.1, Aah.. I see. +1, Committed to trunk.
[~vikram.dixit] This is a correctness issue. Recommended to be included in 0.14.1, +1 for 0.14, Committed to 0.14 as well., Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
