[[~szehon] Here's another tiny fix for GIT so that HMS upgrade tests can publish the results. , +1, thought isnt it a general issue and not only git?, Thanks [~szehon].
It's true. It is not related with Git, but it was a bug I left when switching to Git.
I will change the subject., Thanks.
I committed to master., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
