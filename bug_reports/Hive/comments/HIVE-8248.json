[This patch fixes the test by explicitly setting HCatConstants.HCAT_DATA_CONVERT_BOOLEAN_TO_INTEGER=false in testReadDataPrimitiveTypes(). HCatContext.INSTANCE.setConf() seems to get called when PigServer is called with a set of conf properties., [~sushanth] does this fix look ok, or would there be an appropriate place in HCat to work in another call to HCatContext.INSTANCE.setConf()?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12671062, Looks good to me, +1., Actually, Jason, could we hold off on this till we get HIVE-7420 in? The two patches will wind up breaking each other, and the cost of rebasing the other one is much larger.

(I've tested that this still works after a trivial update after the other patch goes in), (Attached updated patch I tested with after application of HIVE-7420), Updated patch applied and committed to trunk and 0.14. Thanks, Jason!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
