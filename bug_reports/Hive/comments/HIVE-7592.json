ATTACHMENT ID: 12659131, Thanks for your patch. Can you create an review board entry for this patch?, [~Ferd] Linked review board entry, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks Szehon, for the review., Doc note:  This should be described in the Beeline section of the HiveServer2 Clients wikidoc before 0.14.0 is released, with release information and a link back to this JIRA ticket.  But I don't see any existing documentation for adding jars or files with Beeline, so that should be documented too.  Examples would help.

Also, the new "list" value for configuration parameter *hive.security.command.whitelist* should be added to the parameter description in Configuration Properties (again, with release information).

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Beelineâ€“NewCommandLineShell]
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.security.command.whitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.command.whitelist], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, Wrote missing beeline command section, and included addition of 'list' at:

[https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommands|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommands]

Seems 'compile' was not documented for HiveCLI command list as well, so leaving it for now for documentation of that JIRA.

Also changed hive.security.command.whitelist in [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties] to include 'list'.
, bq.  "Seems 'compile' was not documented for HiveCLI command list as well, so leaving it for now for documentation of that JIRA."

[~szehon], do you mean HIVE-5253 (Create component to compile and jar dynamic code)?  If so, it needs a TODOC13 label.]
