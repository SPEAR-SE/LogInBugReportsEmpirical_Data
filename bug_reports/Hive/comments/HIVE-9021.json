[Hive now checks if the user is owner of the database before creating table in the database., I don't think this feature is necessary. Hive has a [Storage-Based Authorization Model|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Authorization#LanguageManualAuthorization-1StorageBasedAuthorizationintheMetastoreServer] that uses HDFS permissions for authorization. If a user does not want other users to be able to create tables in his database, he should set the permissions for his database's directory on HDFS accordingly (such as to rwxr-xr-x).]
