[[~gopalv] Can you please describe how to repo this error? Thanks., The sample code from -  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-RunningtheJDBCSampleCode

With just hive-jdbc-standalone jar as a dependency without explicitly copying the extraneous jars from the hive build dirs (the docs describe the missing jars)., Added hadoop-common to the shaded jar so the JDBC users don't need to specify hadoop related jars in classpath., Tried this patch in master; it works and all that is needed is to copy the {{hive-jdbc-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar}} into jmeter-2.13 lib folder., Thanks [~rajesh.balamohan] for confirming.

[~taoli-hwx]: LGTM - +1 tests pending.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12834051 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Pushed to master, thanks [~taoli-hwx] & [~rajesh.balamohan]., Hi,

Do you have a time frame for 2.2.0?

Thank you,
Gary, Hi, 

Also, I do not see a SNAPSHOT build since this commit in https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/hive/hive-jdbc/2.2.0-SNAPSHOT/

And, I cannot build locally per [HIVE-15111].

Thank you,
Gary, [~garydgregory]: can you please send out a mail to the dev@ lists on Apache? That looks like it is not pushing any hive build jar to the public snapshots dir since Oct 13th., I did that the day you asked... any movement?]
