[Note. This patches two files: 
service/lib/py/thrift/Thrift.py
and 
service/src/gen-py/hive/ttypes.py

It looks like ttypes.py is generated automatically.  I'm not sure where that comes from so you may not want to patch that file.

Thanks, This is in thrift generated code. Needs to be fixed in Thrift project.]
