[There are going to be a bunch of one-time .q.out updates associated with this in order to bring everything into line., Patch file of code only; still working on regenerating test logs.
, Do you want to make inputs and outputs in BaseSemanticAnalyzer to SortedSet/TreeSet instead ?
This way we can be deterministic across all hooks., Blocked on HIVE-1601 for regenerating 0.17 test output.
, Will do.  I'll keep the sorting during rendering (even though it will be redundant) as well since there's no formal contract regarding sorting in the hook interface.
, Actually it's a pain to change that since a lot of places are already passing around HashSet.  So I'm going to leave that for a followup since the point of this patch is to fix the sporadic failures which are hindering testing of other patches.
, ok, Still running through tests on this one., Tests passed., +1, Committed. Thanks John]
