, Hi [~thejas][~bharathv]
Not sure what need to be done here? But I tried to connect mysql without useSSL option, and it shows following: 

WARN: Establishing SSL connection without server's identity verification is not recommended. According to MySQL 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+ requirements SSL connection must be established by default if explicit option isn't set. For compliance with existing applications not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'. You need either to explicitly disable SSL by setting useSSL=false, or set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification.

So I would propose to employ same policy like mysql. Are you OK with this? 

Or you were asking to build an secure way on http? like SASL?, I think ... plaintext passwords should *never* be sent across the wire....]
