Sorry about the delay in reviewing updated patch!
, Patch committed to master and 1.2. Thanks [~thejas]., Doc note:  This changes the default of *hive.zookeeper.session.timeout* so the wiki needs to be updated (with version information).

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.zookeeper.session.timeout | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.zookeeper.session.timeout], This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira., Doc done, so I'm removing the TODOC1.2 label.

Thanks go to [~sergeant] for updating the parameter description.]
