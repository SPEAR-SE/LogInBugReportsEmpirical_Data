[[~vihangk1] : as I've seen, you checked this on ptest env (HIVE-20860), did you try the test alone, or in the failing batch of qtests (please find it in the description). It's unlikely that tests could affect each other this way (as they're running in a serial way, right?), but maybe it worth a try...I've no better idea at the moment., Yeah, I tried running it locally and running with the same batch as well. Not sure why it fails intermittently. If you are seeing tab instead of space, can you force the test to use one of the two so that it is consistent and not environment dependent?, [~vihangk1] : okay, makes sense
to be honest, I cannot find the codepath, where result field separators are handled/described, i have to dig deep, I'll check it
however it's very exotic that cbo_rp_limit and cbo_limit are the failing tests, they have nothing to do with field separators or anything like that, and in case the preceding test makes them fail, we should have been able to reproduce I guess...]
