[patch-1: Change to only initialize history once and ConsoleReader will bind to that history. Removed some hacky code which seems to workaround jLine issue but from the test, I don't see any problems (not sure if it's caused by multiple history creations). 

Did manual tests., [~ychena] [~ctang.ma] and [~vihangk1] Can you help review the patch?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12841321 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Thanks for the changes. Patch looks good to me., [~aihuaxu], Does this history buffer only written to a file when shut down happens? Could the history input become too large?, I guess it should be handled by jLine already, but let me confirm. , There is a max_size setting there default to 500 and jLine handles such max_size., The fix LGTM   +1, Pushed to master. Thanks Vihang and Yongzhi for reviewing.]
