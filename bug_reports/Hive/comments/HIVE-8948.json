ATTACHMENT ID: 12683007 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~alangates] I thought prepDb() is only used for embedded Derby.  How does this end up with a deadlock?, prepDb is only used by Derby, and I don't know how it deadlocks.  But I can see it do it, about 1 run in 50, only on Linux (I can't reproduce it on Mac)., +1, Patch checked in.  Thanks Eugene for the review.]
