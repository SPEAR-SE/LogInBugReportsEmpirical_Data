[Updated golden file, I don't see a reason why it wont work on 20S also. Shall we just enable this test for 20S as well?, It does work on 20S. We've enabled it on that in the past, but forgot to update the golden., Confused myself again. ctas_hadoop20 runs 20 and 20S. That golden file is up to date. ctas.q runs only on 23. That one has been out of date, but I've updated it. So the patch is good., Makes sense. +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Gunther!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #151 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/151/])
