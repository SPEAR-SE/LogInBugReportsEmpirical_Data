[See the new tests in the patch to HIVE-4268. That is probably a better place to put BeeLine tests than in ql.
, I won't be able to work on get working on this soon, so making this unassigned so that this can get picked up by someone in meantime.

, TestBeeLineDriver has better support for diff masking and also allows you to run multiple qfile tests in parallel. I think we should start running the qfile tests with TestBeeLineDriver by default, and use TestCliDriver only for the subset of tests that depend on validating the output of pre/post execute hooks.]
