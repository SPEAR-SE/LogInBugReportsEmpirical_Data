[[~vgumashta] Thanks for catching this. I think we may actually want to remove these statements altogether, the rationale being that we probably don't want to write a message to the server's log every time a client tries to execute an illegal statement or calls an RPC with invalid input parameter values. Ideally this error information should be returned directly to the client instead., [~cwsteinbach] The jdbc driver itself does not do any logging, and relying on the application to follow good practices such as logging does not always work. Also, when something goes wrong, it is not always because of an user error. For debugging when something goes wrong, I think it will be very valuable to log the errors on server side as well. The error here can probably be logged in the server as INFO (or WARN) instead of ERROR.

cc [~prasadm], [~vaibhavgumashta] yes, that's a valid point. 
IMO would be useful to preserve the error for troubleshooting, perhaps at DEBUG level. The hive logs have lot of noise and errors like bad syntax and wrong objects are fairly common flood the log.

HIVE-5196: ThriftCLIService should use LOG.error instead of stderr to log error description

ThriftCLIService.java uses stderr to print the stack trace, it should use the logger instead. Using e.printStackTrace is not suitable for production.

, Logging it at error level will scare users. Lets use log.warn instead of log.error, we don't want to miss these logs either. Until we have a good way of distinguishing user errors from hive system errors, it is important to log them.
