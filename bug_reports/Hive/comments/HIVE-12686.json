[Removing 2.1.0 target. Please feel free to commit to branch-2.1 anyway and fix for 2.1.0 if this happens before the release., HIVE-12366 and related have moved the start of heartbeat logic to right after lock acquisition so this may be very easy now, I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release.]
