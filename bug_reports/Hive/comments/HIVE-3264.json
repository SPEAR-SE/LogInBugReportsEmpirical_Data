[Looking at the source, I'm seeing AvroSerDe code mapping BYTE to Constants.TINYINT_TYPE_NAME in Hive, but binary type (array/blob) already maps to Constants.BINARY_TYPE_NAME -- and inside the Hive constants, I see no "byte" type to replace TINYINT_TYPE_NAME, is there something I'm missing? I could not tell from the description whether the binary type is what you were discussing (looks like its already in place), or the single-byte type in specific. In that case, there is no replacement I can find for  tiny int on the Hive side. I didn't see anything on the binary array being implemented as tiny ints any more in the code. I am looking in the org.apache.hive.serde2.* packages.
, First swipe at updating Avro-Hive binary datatype conversions., This one bears a bit of scrutiny, first attempt here..., makes sure AvroDeserializer unwraps byte[] from ByteBuffer before returning deserialized byte[].

Still wondering why the tests did catch this the first time, looking at them, possibly a subsequent patch/JIRA on the way on that one...
, Should work at this point, adds integration test etc., Managed to miss the inclusion of one of the test files, should be a complete patch now., Added a .q.out file to the party, still figuring out the build pricess here. I'm guessing if I say this is a complete patch at this point it will represent some form of jinx, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.
, +1 will commit if tests pass., Actually, can we add to the .q file a describe on the table to verify that Hive sees the new type correctly/ Also, there should be an equivalent unit test added to TestAvroDeserializer.  Also, does this support serializing Hive binary to bytes? Sorry for this falling of my radar..., I see that describe is already there in .q file and its printing the expected output as well. Adding more unit tests is always welcome. Looks like it will serialize binary to bytes. I see the code there. But there are no tests, (.q is just testing desirialization) so not sure. It will be good to add a test for it., Marking as open, since looks like it needs some more work., This had fallen off my radar too, sorry. What needs to be done/added? When I was originally working on this, I was told the .q file approach was the test we needed. What sort of test should I add?
, The patch isn't stale yet (whew!), I'm working on a test...
, I rebased Eli's patch on the current trunk. I've also made  changes so that 'fixed' fields come out as binary as well. This isn't an exact match, but it's better than an array of tinyints I think.

As far as test cases, avro_nullable_fields.q includes fields of both fixed and bytes type, so that test serializing and deserializing. There are also unit test for each of those in TestAvroDeserializer and TestAvroSerializer., Also posted to RB: https://reviews.apache.org/r/12531/, Changes in response to RB comments. Also updated on RB., +1.  Looks good., btw, Mark, once this goes through, please update the AvroSerde info (with the version number): https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AvroSerDe  Ping the user list if you don't have write acesss.  Thanks., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Eli for the patch. Thanks, Mark for testcases.
