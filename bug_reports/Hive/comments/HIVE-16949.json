ATTACHMENT ID: 12883454 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~vihangk1], [~asherman], [~spena] could someone take a look? Most of the code changes are re-factoring to make the code more test-able. I added a call to {{ExecutorService#shutdown}} after all threads have been submitted, and then a call to {{ExecutorService#shutdownNow}} in a {{finally}} block., LGTM, left a comment on RB., [~vihangk1] addressed your comments., +1 LGTM., Thanks for the review [~vihangk1]. Merged to master., [~stakiar]
