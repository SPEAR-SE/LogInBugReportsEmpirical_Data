ATTACHMENT ID: 12856666 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~bslim], I was taking a look at the patch. LGTM, +1

Just to confirm, I guess we plan to add the logic to set the _druid.query.granularity_ property value to Calcite and that is why it is not part of this patch, right?, [~jcamachorodriguez] this is used by the indexer to reduce the memory pressure, and yes it will be used then by calcite if possible to infer the minimum granularity., Pushed to master, thanks [~bslim]!, Does this need to be documented in the wiki?, [~leftylev], no need, the max property was already in HiveConf, but it was not used properly. The granularity is an internal parameter that is inferred automatically. Thanks, Good to know, thanks.]
