[Hi Bill Wailliam,

Can you give exact scenario. I have tried with  below queries on master it is working fine.

{code}

drop table sample1;
create table sample1(a STRING, b int) partitioned by (partitionid string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE;
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/chinna/install/data/file1.txt' INTO TABLE sample1 partition (partitionid = "one");


drop table sample2;
create table sample2(a STRING, b int) partitioned by (partitionid string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE;
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/chinna/install/data/file2.txt' INTO TABLE sample2 partition (partitionid = "one");


INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sample2 PARTITION (partitionid = 'one') select a,b from sample1;

{code}]
