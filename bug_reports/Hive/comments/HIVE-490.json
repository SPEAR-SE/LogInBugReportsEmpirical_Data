[Added a comment to explain that hive will automatically find out the number of reducers by setting this propery to -1., hive-490-2009-05-23-3.patch includes parameters added in Hive-105. Thanks, Zheng.
Btw, this is the first step - auto inferring the maximum number of reducers can be done later., It seems there are some misunderstanding on the configure parameter hive.exec.reducers.max. Some one please help me confirm it.
{noformat}
+<property>
+  <name>hive.exec.reducers.max</name>
+  <value>999</value>
+  <description>max number of reducers will be used. If it exceeds the one specified in the configuration parameter
+	mapred.reduce.tasks, hive will use the one specified in mapred.reduce.tasks.</description>
+</property>
{noformat}

should the description be:
{noformat}
max number of reducers will be used. If the one specified in the configuration parameter mapred.reduce.tasks is negative, hive will use this one as the max number of reducers when automatically determine number of reducers.

, Checked the code and found what i suspected in previous comment is right.  , It seems one of the attached files is committed to truck?, Committed. Thanks Yongqiang.]
