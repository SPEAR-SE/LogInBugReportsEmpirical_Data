[Hi [~hsubramaniyan], thanks for looking into this. A couple of comments/questions:
1. In what situation the file to be deleted might be locked by other process?
2. Would you consider using File.createTempFile(String prefix, String suffix) to generate unique file names rather than having your own?, Hi [~xuefuz] Locking is more common in Windows OS where a user cannot delete file in use. In Linux, there is a round about way where the user can set the log files to read-only after the first run to avoid deletion (which is a somewhat uncommon case).  Here is a scenario where locking can happen/deleting the old log files is not possible.

 - mvn clean install -DskipTests -Phadoop-2(from Hive Root directory) which creates the *gen.log files in hive/itests/qtest/target/
- Set the *gen.log in to read-only (in Linux), If running in windows, just open one of the *gen.log files.
- cd itests
- mvn install -DskipTests -Phadoop-2

My point is that although this issue is very unlikely to happen with the way we run precommit tests and the way unit tests are supposed to be run in Linux, we should still avoid skipping the entire test suite if a similar issue happens in the future. i.e. the test framework should provide better resistance to such unexpected scenarios.

2. You are right, File.createTempFile actually will be a better option here than my own function. I will make the required changes in a new patch.

Thanks
Hari,
