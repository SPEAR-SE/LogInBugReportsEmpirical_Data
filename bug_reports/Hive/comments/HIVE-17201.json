[The following should clean up the build, for now., Submitting, to check the tests., I feel that disabling unit tests is a bad idea....it's not the tests which have been broken - I perfectly understand that the code have used these things incorrectly...but in the earlier state it was working...
Because these failures mark that the current code does not perform as expected - I think we should instead consider reverting the original change (HIVE-16844), 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:
