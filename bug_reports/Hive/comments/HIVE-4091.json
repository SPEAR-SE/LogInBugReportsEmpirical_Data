, [~ashutoshc] Sorry, I've missed this for sometimes. Yes, it only runs ql tests in probability of 50% or so., [~navis]: Can you explain how this patch works? I've looked at the diff and can't tell why this would have skipped tests sometimes or how this is fixed now. (I did however observe the same behavior and am interested in having this fixed.), [~hagleitn] Sorry, I'm not sure of this. What I've done is just replacing property to variable, value of which can be changed in runtime., I don't think this patch makes any difference one way or another. [~navis] would you like to resolve this as "Not A problem"?, Not happen theses days, navis has abandoned the revision "HIVE-4091 [jira] [REGRESSION] HIVE-3571 does not run all tests sometimes".
