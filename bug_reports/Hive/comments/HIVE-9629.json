[Just an update on performance numbers: (A follow-on to those quoted in HIVE-9588)

1. Dropping 2K partitions from a managed Hive table took 204 seconds on my Hive/HCat test setup (with remote metastore, backed with Oracle).
2. HIVE-9588 reduced this to 83 seconds.
3. The combination of HIVE-9631, HIVE-9681 and HIVE-9736 has reduced this now to 16 seconds.
(The patch for HIVE-9631 isn't currently up. Selina has an internal patch that works with Oracle.)

I'll be testing this some more. In the meantime, I'd be grateful if the patches (other than HIVE-9631) could be reviewed.
