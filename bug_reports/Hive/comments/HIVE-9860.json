ATTACHMENT ID: 12702630 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch looks good to me.
Brock, do you think the failure is related? The diff seems weird., No I don't think the failure is related. This code doesn't run in any test AFAIK due to the kerberos requirement., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks Brock., I guess we should also ensure that the token file is not world readable. I will log a followup ticket., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
