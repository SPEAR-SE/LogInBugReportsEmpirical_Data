[Tried this on MySQL, Postgres and Microsoft SQL Server 2015 (http://sqlfiddle.com) and all of them outputs one row.

This is due to the way NOT IN with co-related subquery is transformed (https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12614003/SubQuerySpec.pdf) which is wrong, Queries such as {noformat} select C from R1 where R1.A not in (Select B from R2 where R1.X = R2.Y) {noformat} is re-written into 

{noformat}
Select C from R1 join
    (
     select count(*) as c1
     from R2
     where B is null
    ) sq1
    on sq1.c1 = 0 left outer join
    ( select B,
      R2.Y as sq2_col0
      from R2) sq2
     on R1.A = sq2.B and R1.X = sq2.sq2_col0
where sq2.B is null
{noformat}


, With subquery redesign in HIVE-15192 this is not reproducible anymore.]
