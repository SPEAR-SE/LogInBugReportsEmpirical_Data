[[~thejas], [~hsubramaniyan] and [~szehon], could you take a look at the patch to fix the test. It is straightforward and just removes the not more available property. , +1, HIVE-10309 is the duplicate., Thanks [~hsubramaniyan]. In that case we'll stick to that since it was created before and has had a UT run. I'll close this as dup.]
