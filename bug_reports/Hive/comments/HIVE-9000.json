[[~mgrover] I think it's correct. You can acquire expected result by,
{code}
select t, s, i, last_value(i) over (partition by t order by s RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) 
from over10k where (s = 'oscar allen' or s = 'oscar carson') and t = 10;
{code}, As Navis pointed out, result from Hive is indeed correct. I further verified on postgres. Mark, you can use alternative query suggested by Navis if you want your resultset to look like that.]
