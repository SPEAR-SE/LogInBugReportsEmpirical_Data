ATTACHMENT ID: 12750476 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 Patch looks good. 
I wonder whether we shall just bump hadoop version for this (we are already at 2.6.0) instead of shiming., [~ashutoshc]: I kept the shim to allow -Phadoop-1 builds., But then why are you doing reflection within Hadoop23Shim., [~ashutoshc]: even though it's built against 2.6.x, not everyone runs hive-1.3.x on 2.6.0+.

There cannot be any assumptions that the build version is the runtime version (particularly when ORC is used via HCat/MR code)., OK., This shim isn't permanent and merely exists because of {{-Phadoop-1}}.

The FastTextReader reflection can be pulled into ORC code whenever hadoop-1.x compat is dropped., Committed to master & branch-1, thanks [~ashutoshc], any plans to add this in 1.2.x line?]
