[A simple patch to make sure field looking up is case insensitive., Patch looks good to me. [~jxiang], could you please explain the relationship between the NPE and the patch? Might we do something on the NPE as well?, Thanks a lot for the review. The issue is that when ExprNodeFieldEvaluator initializes:
{noformat}
field = structObjectInspector.getStructFieldRef(expr.getFieldName());
{noformat}
It tries to get the struct field based on the field name. Here, the field name is "fieldone". The object inspector is ArrayWritableObjectInspector, which saves the name to field mapping to a map. In the map, the name is "fieldOne",
so the line above gets a null field.  The patch is to make sure the lookup to be case insensitive.,
