[I implemented 1 and 3. Additionally, it caches a compiled Pattern object to reuse., Review request on https://reviews.apache.org/r/13702/, +1, Test {{global_limit.q}} failed., I wrote 2nd patch while assuming Text#getBytes returns entire valid bytes, but it was wrong. Text#getBytes returns valid bytes up to Text#getLength length. Following bytes are invalid. I fixed code to use Text#getLength to ensure data validity. This patch passes global_limit.q and udf_split.q tests.,

This message is automatically generated., mapreduce_stack_trace_hadoop20.q passed on my computer. The test doesn't call split(), so it is not related with this patch., Ran a simple micro test on splitting only and found it's not faster significantly (max 15%?) than current implementation (even slower for sometimes). But reusing previous pattern string seemed good idea. Furthermore, if OI for regex is constant type, comparing itself can be ignored. Could you do that too?, I applied [~navis]'s feedback. Most of SPLIT calls would use a constant value for its regular expression. So I optimized SPLIT for this use case.,
