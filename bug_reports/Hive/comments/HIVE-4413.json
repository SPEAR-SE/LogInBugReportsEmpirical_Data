[HIVE-3807 should resolve this (the specific need of @ in secure clusters), HADOOP-12751 is aiming to remove the limitation on characters within a username, eg. '@' will be allowed in a username. This is important for interoperability across different trusted domains which create usernames with their own realm included. 

The proper fix for this issue should be to allow these characters in a username, possibly by escaping them or quoted.

grant all on table tablename to user bolke\@ad.domain
grant all on table tablename to user "bolke@ad.domain"

, Apologies, quoting works fine with `]
