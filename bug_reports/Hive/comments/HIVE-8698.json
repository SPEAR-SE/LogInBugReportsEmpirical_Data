[HIVE-8698.1.patch - I don't know why this makes a difference wrt  hive-log4j.properties, but it does!
Even after this change, hive-default.xml.template file is still generated and placed in the package in conf dir.
, [~navis] Can you please review this ?
, [~brocknoland] Will you be able to review this ? I think you likely have most maven expertise among hive committers. 
Without this change, users will not be able to get hiveserver2 working out of the box. , I think this makes sense. Basically the block being deleted is overriding the {{src/main/resources}}. It should not be required since we have the antrun.

+1, Thanks for the quick review Brock!
[~hagleitn] I think this an important fix for hive 0.14. It will enable users to use hiveserver2 out of the box without any additional steps. Also fixes the default logging in hive cli.


, +1 for .14,
