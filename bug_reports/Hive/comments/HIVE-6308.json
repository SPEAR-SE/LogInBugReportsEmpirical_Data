[This is *critical* for Impala users! We want to be able to perform our Metastore operations via Hive's Thrift server, but this would create unhealthy tables for which we can not run ANALYZE. Such table's statistics cannot computed by Impala (statistics are absolutely necessary for Impala to run joins in an optimal manner), and this means that we need to create table via Impala over JDBC. This is less than ideal, and this issue is the only blocker from letting us create via Hive over Thrift.

Related IMPALA tickets: [IMPALA-867|https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-867], [IMPALA-1104|https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-1104], I can't seem to reproduce this. Should there be data loaded into the table?, Need code review,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12694386 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The test failures are not related to the change., +1, thanks for adding unit test, Committed to trunk.  Thanks Yongzhi for debugging and finding the fix!, Thank you Szehon!

This fix treats creating Avro tables without col defs in hive the same as creating table with all col defs. 
This fix does not address this kind of avro tables created before the fix.

Tested with hive command:  analyze table compute statistics for column. ]
