ATTACHMENT ID: 12833827 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Test failures are not related., Now that hadoop classes are also part of jdbc jar, I think we should relocate them as well. That will help to ensure that this doesn't cause issues with applications that might be using different versions of hadoop than what is packaged in jdbc standalone jar.

Looks like few more of them are candidates for relocation - 
com.facebook
org.apache.hadoop.<the hadoop parts>
org.apache.logging.log4j

I was surprised to see that we don't package zookeeper and curator. It seems like standalone jar isn't standalone even now, if you are using zookeerp service discovery. I haven't verified that by testing it yet. Adding those can be part of a different jira.

It seems like we are packaging some jars we should not need -
org.apache.slider
org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore


Can you make a call on the following as well and say why the should be excluded/included/relocated/not relocated ?
 com/beust/jcommander
 com/lmax/disruptor/
org/jamon/
javolution
 com/google/common/cache/
, I have relocated the below ones. Please see 2.patch.

com.facebook
org.apache.hadoop
org.apache.logging.log4j


“com/google/common/cache” has been relocated already with the first patch. Regarding the below ones, I am not sure how likely they will be used, so I would defer relocating those for now.

com.beust.jcommander
com.lmax.disruptor
org.jamon
javolution

Regarding removing the unnecessary artifacts, I created another JIRA: 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15080, [~thejas] "org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore" is a dependency of JDBC client so cannot be removed. We can probably remove "org.apache.slider".,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12835468 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, bq. Regarding the below ones, I am not sure how likely they will be used, so I would defer relocating those for now.
Do you know if we need them in the jar ?  (A best guess depending on their functionality would be OK)
What is the cost of relocating them ? Are you concerned about additional build time ? (I don't have a good sense of additional time this is adding).
, We can revisit if these artifacts are really needed in a separate JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15080

Regarding the relocation, I am actually not concerned about extra build time from relocation (I guess that should not cause any obvious difference). My hunch if that we can relocate the artifacts in a lazy way, and I think the jars such as from "com.lmax.disruptor" are unlikely to be used along with the jdbc. But I am also fine with relocating all of them in one shot., Added another iteration to add the below ones to relocation:

com.beust.jcommander
com.lmax.disruptor
org.jamon
javolution, [~thejas] Can you take a look at this change?, +1
, Thanks [~thejas] Would you be able to commit it?, Trying to get a unit test on the updated patch. Just kicked off build #14992,
