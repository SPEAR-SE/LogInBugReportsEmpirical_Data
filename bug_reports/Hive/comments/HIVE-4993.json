[These HCatalog documents must be converted to wiki markup and added to the Hive wiki:

* Overview
* Installation from Tarball [needs revision for Hive installation]
* Load and Store Interfaces
* Input and Output Interfaces
* Reader and Writer Interfaces
* Command Line Interface
* Storage Formats
* Dynamic Partitioning
* Notification
* Storage Based Authorization

Until they are converted, the wiki can have links to the HCatalog 0.5.0 docs on the Hive site.
, Added a section to the Hive wiki's home page for HCatalog & WebHCat docs and created pages for them: 

* [Hive Home|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home]
* [HCatalog manual|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog]
* [WebHCat (Templeton) manual|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat]

The organization of the wiki can be changed later, if necessary., The HCat docs are all converted to wikidocs.  You can find them here:

Some of them need review & revision.  In particular:

# Installation ([https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+Install]) starts with this disclaimer:
#* "This information is adapted from the HCatalog 0.5.0 installation instructions. Now that HCatalog is part of the Hive project, it is installed with Hive and therefore much of the information below is obsolete. Furthermore, there is no such thing as 'HCatalog 0.11.0' although that fiction has been substituted below for 'HCatalog 0.5.0' â€” until this wikidoc is revised to reflect current realities, you should be skeptical of what you read here."
# Load and Store has obsolete version numbers for jars ([https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+LoadStore#HCatalogLoadStore-JarsandConfigurationFiles]) so I just called them 0.5.0 examples but they should be updated: 
#* The version number found in each filepath will be substituted for *. For example, HCatalog release 0.5.0 uses these jars and conf files:
#** $HCAT_HOME/share/hcatalog/hcatalog-core-0.5.0.jar
#** $HCAT_HOME/share/hcatalog/hcatalog-pig-adapter-0.5.0.jar
#** $HIVE_HOME/lib/hive-metastore-0.10.0.jar
#** $HIVE_HOME/lib/libthrift-0.7.0.jar
#** $HIVE_HOME/lib/hive-exec-0.10.0.jar
#** $HIVE_HOME/lib/libfb303-0.7.0.jar
#** $HIVE_HOME/lib/jdo2-api-2.3-ec.jar
#** $HIVE_HOME/conf
#** $HADOOP_HOME/conf
#** $HIVE_HOME/lib/slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar
# Storage Formats ([https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+StorageFormats]) might need updates for two sentences:
#* "SerDes are provided for RCFile, CSV text, JSON text, and SequenceFile formats." --- What about ORC?
#* "However, Hive does not know where to find the HCatalog jar by default, ..." --- Is that still true?
# Authorization's section on Minimum Permissions ([https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+Authorization#HCatalogAuthorization-MinimumPermissions]) has needed more information since it first appeared, but nobody had time for it.
, I have reviewed and updated the links in above comment . Thanks Lefty for this huge work!

[~sushanth] Do you know if anything is missing in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+Authorization#HCatalogAuthorization-MinimumPermissions ? It looks fine to me.
, [~thejas] : Well, at this point, HdfsAuthorizationProvider has been deprecated, replaced by SBAP, but the information in the link is accurate.

Also, a few more patches that are in 0.13 are needed to make SBAP work on client-side, so I'd leave the documentation as-is for 0.12.]
