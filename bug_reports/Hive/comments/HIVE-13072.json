[I can not reproduce the issue in the master branch with query:
insert overwrite table rowninfo select row_number() over( order by num) as rowid, num from disrow;
disrow has 329210 rows with distinct values. 
After the insert statement, rowninfo has same number of rows with distinct row values. There is no duplicate.
[~Zyrix], could you share your reproduce?  Thanks, [~ychena] Did you try with version 1.1  Reporter has indicated that in Affect Version.
[~Zyrix] Can you provide repro query for this? Also, if possible can you try this on master ?, I tried hive version 1.1 for CDH, still can not reproduce the issue. , HIVE-11583 may have fixed this too.]
