[I found a simpler workaround :

SELECT collect_set(INT(NULL)) ;

This returns an empty array of type ARRAY<INT>., Just for my understanding, what does "INT(NULL)" mean in this case?, looks like "cast null as int", Exactly, it's the same as "cast(null as int)".
Only shorter and probably not ISO-compliant.
