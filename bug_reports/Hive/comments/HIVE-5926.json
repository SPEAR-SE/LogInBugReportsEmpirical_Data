[the problem is when the src is a single file or a pattern , Hive.java did not delete the dest path before move files.
, If I'm not mistaken, you're trying to load files with the same name into the same table. While it's valid to load multiple files into a table, I don't think hive should remove the destination. It's better to given an error rather than silently overwriting. The error msg from hive can be improved, but I think  the behavior is expected.

If you want to load the data twice, you'd better rename the data file before loading it again., I thought OVERWRITE means delete the dest path before load, Sorry I missed the "overwrite" keyword. This might be a bug indeed. I'll take a closer look., Add codes for remove and recreate dest path before load,
