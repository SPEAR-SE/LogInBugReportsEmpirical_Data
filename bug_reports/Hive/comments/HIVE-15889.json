ATTACHMENT ID: 12852299 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Attaching .2 version of the patch.

 {{TezJobMonitor::killRunningJobs}} was not getting invoked as its visibility got changed in HIVE-15473. 

This caused "java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.tez.monitoring.TezJobMonitor.killRunningJobs()" in {{TezJobExecHelper::killRunningJobs}} and tasks were not killed properly.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12852318 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Should TezJobExecHelper use setAccessible to avoid being affected by this? Also why does it have to use reflection? Also should it cache the method statically.. :), Thanks [~sershe]. Attaching .3 patch to address review comments. Used setAccessible and also caching it statically.

Reflection is used since there is an option to have tez optionally in earlier clusters.  Not sure this is still valid given it is the default engine now. But didn't want to change that code for backward compatibility. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12852443 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1, Thanks [~sershe]. Committed to master., Why are we having to use reflection here ? 
(I could be missing something that should be obvious, looks like was introduced long ago in HIVE-8393)
