[Now my temporary resolution is using the command: 'hive -f cmd.sql'. The file content are:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `test`(`key` string, `uid` int) STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler' WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("hbase.columns.mapping" = ":key,d:uid#b")TBLPROPERTIES("hbase.table.name" = "test");
INSERT INTO TABLE test select key, uid from reg;, I'm curious - did you add the hbase jars before executing the query with the add jar command?, yes, I add jar hbase-0.94.6.1.jar/hive-hbase-handler-0.12.0.jar/zookeeper-3.4.5.jar for it. even I set it in the hive-env.sh file like that:
export HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH=${HIVE_HOME}/lib/hbase-0.94.6.1.jar,${HIVE_HOME}/lib/hive-hbase-handler-0.12.0.jar,${HIVE_HOME}/lib/zookeeper-3.4.5.jar,${HIVE_HOME}/auxlib/json-serde-1.1.6.jar
but it seems not any help.
I don't think it's hbase jar problem because I can insert successfully if it run after the create operation., I digged into this a little bit and the fix for this is very similar to HIVE-5515. The reason being that the newly introduced property "hive.passthrough.storagehandler.of" with HIVE-4331 was not getting set. I was able to verify that the proposed patch in HIVE-5515 fixes this issue as well.

Marking this as resolved duplicate of HIVE-5515.]
