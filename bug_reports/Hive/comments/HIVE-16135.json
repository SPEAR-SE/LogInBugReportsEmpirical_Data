[The recent date handling is changed. So now it passes date/timestamp objects instead of string objects now. But VectorizationContext.getTimestampScalar only accepts string objects.

This patch makes VectorizationContext.getTimestampScalar to accept date/timestamp objects, too. Also it adds test queries in vectorized_timestamp.q., Left 1 comment on Review Board.  Added "Vectorization" to title., This patch applies [~mmccline]'s feedback; adding an integration test for date type. Thank you.,
