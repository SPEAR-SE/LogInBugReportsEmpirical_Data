[Attaching a patch that changes NUMBER(10) to NUMBER(19) datatype for long columns for Oracle metastore schema upgrade scripts., We haven't built install scripts for 14 yet as Ashutosh and I were discussing if there was a better method than creating the tables directly in the scripts.  So we can't apply this patch until we make a decision on that., Can we just take the upgrade parts of this (the 019-... script and the upgrade script) and leave the 0.14 versions of schema files for later?  That way we'll get this fix in where people have access to it., Its not clear to me as to where would the upgrade script (019-HIVE-7118.oracle.sql) be invoked from. It may not be desirable to call this from upgrade-0.12.0-to-0.13.0.oracle.sql script as people will miss it as they are already on 0.13. What do you think?, Good point.  For the Oracle scripts we should fix the hive-schema-0.13 and hive-txn-schema-0.13 scripts so they don't need to call the upgrade.  If they've already installed 13 and need to fix this bug they can just call the 019-HIVE-7118 script manually., I have attached a new patch which provides the following:
019-HIVE-7118.oracle.sql -> Intended for users who are already on Hive 0.13.0. Will need to run the script manually against their existing hive metastore schema.
hive-txn-schema-0.13.0.oracle.sql & hive-schema-0.13.0.oracle.sql -> For fresh installs., +1, Patch committed.  Thank you Deepesh., Thanks Alan for review and commit!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
