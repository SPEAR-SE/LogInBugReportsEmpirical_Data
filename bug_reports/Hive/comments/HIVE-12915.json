ATTACHMENT ID: 12783977 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1.
Couple of minor nits which you may want to fix in the commit patch.
- String[] defaultQueueList = defaultQueues.split(","); | Configuration has a method to get this trimmed - conf.getTrimmedStrings(). Would be better to use that, or whatever it uses.
- LOG.info("QueueName: " + queueName + " nonDefaultUser: " + nonDefaultUser +
          " defaultQueuePool: " + defaultQueuePool); | Also log hasInitialSessions, I don't think another jenkins run is required if addressing the comments., Updated the patch, will commit later today., Actually test does get stuck, so not just yet.,
