ATTACHMENT ID: 12690741 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thank you Mohit! I have committed this to trunk!, Does postgres.filter.81 need to be documented in the wiki?

{quote}
The dbType is required and can be one of:
 {{derby|mysql|postgres|oracle}}

* [The Hive Schema Tool | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Schema+Tool#HiveSchemaTool-TheHiveSchemaTool], Yes I think so... [~mohitsabharwal]?, Yes, we need to document the {{-dbOpts}} argument. And also add {{postgres.filter.81}} as the (only) valid value for this argument.

To the "The schematool Command" section, we need to add:
{code}
 -dbOpts <databaseOpts>             Backend DB specific options
{code}

As well as need another section, like:
{code}
The dbOpts is optional and can be set to:
 postgres.filter.81 : Postgres upgrade scripts contain "set standard_conforming_strings" command, which is not applicable for Postgress 8.1. Using this option will skip this command and, hence, prevent upgrade from failing. 
{code}

Thank you, [~leftylev] !]
