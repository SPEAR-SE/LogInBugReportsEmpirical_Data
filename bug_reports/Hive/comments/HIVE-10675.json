[[~sushanth] Can you please review the patch, I tested this locally. To disable Accumulo related Hive Tests, from itests directory, you need to specify 
mvn clean install -DskipAccumuloTests -Phadoop-2 -DskipTests

The default behavior is to enable the accumulo tests, so there should not be any diffs.

Thanks
Hari, +1 (non-binding). Changes look good to me!,

Could you please add a comment there that indicates that the profile activation clause will flip this to false as long as -DskipAccumuloTests is not specified? Thanks!, [~sushanth] Thanks for the review, attached the patch with comment.

Thanks
Hari, +1.

Thanks for the update!,
