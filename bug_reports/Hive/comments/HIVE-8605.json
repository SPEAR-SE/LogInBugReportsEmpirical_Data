ATTACHMENT ID: 12677133 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~alangates] I'm little worry about this. If we allow 'f' and 'l' in numeric part, should we allow 'd' for double, which is possibly conflict with 'd' for days?, As far as I know all of the time units were whole integers, so 'd' for double, and 'f' for float probably don't make sense.  'l' for long is the only one I know of people using (we found this when a co-worker copied a config file from 0.13 and used it against 0.14 branch).  So I could change the patch to just support 'l'.  We have to find someway not to break that backward compatibility without also breaking your changes to do the time units., +1 on 'l' only for this time. +1 also on hive-0.14.0., Posting a new patch that removes 'f' as an option, just supports 'l' as a now ignored modifier for time units.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12677637 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 for hive .14., Committed to trunk and branch., Should this be documented somewhere, or is it just a bug fix?, I would say it's just a bug fix.  Going forward we don't want people using 'l' as a modifier for time units, so it's probably better not to document it., Thanks [~alangates]., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
