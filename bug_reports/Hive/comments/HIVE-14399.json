[The test wait for EVENTS_TTL * 2 = 60s and assume events are cleaned up. In the meantime, DbNotificationListener.CleanerThread is invoked every 60s. It is possible cleanup thread doesn't get a chance to run during the test wait time.

I'd like to increase frequency of CleanerThread in the test to make sure it will get a chance to run during the waiting.,
