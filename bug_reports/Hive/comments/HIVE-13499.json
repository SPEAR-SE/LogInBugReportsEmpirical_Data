[Patch to temporarily disable the hanging test. Running this is only causing delays.
, I have applied the above temp patch to disable the test, so that the test queue doesn't unnecessarily spend time on this test.
, It looks like the derby connection can't be obtained. Maybe thats because the changing is causing concurrent connections to derby ?

{code}, [~thejas] Just notice that it's to disable the test. It makes sense since right now I'm not sure where the issue is yet and how long it will take to fix it. 

+1 for the patch. And I will create a follow up to investigate., [~thejas] I'm able to see the issue locally. I will investigate what's happening., Seems it's caused by the testSessionScratchDirs test case, not testConcurrentStatements., [~aihuaxu] Thanks for looking into the issue!

bq. Just notice that it's to disable the test. It makes sense since right now I'm not sure where the issue is yet and how long it will take to fix it. 
We can revert the disable change and put an actual fix via this jira as well. Whatever works.

bq. Seems it's caused by the testSessionScratchDirs test case, not testConcurrentStatements.
Interesting, I was able to reproduce  the hanging problem locally on my mac yesterday and it went away after disabling testConcurrentStatements. Let me try again.
, With testConcurrentStatements disabled, it runs for me -

Running org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestJdbcWithMiniHS2
Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 143.669 sec - in org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestJdbcWithMiniHS2

FYI, the way i narrowed it down to testConcurrentStatements was using jstack, I looked at what test it was running when it didn't complete after several minutes.

, However, this change doesn't seem to have stopped the hang in ptest2.

This run happened after the commit to disable the test - http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build-7573/failed/TestJdbcWithMiniHS2/ .
In the hive.log you can see that it was running for almost 2 hrs and it still has the derby error stack trace I pasted earlier. 
Maybe there is some race condition and more than one test are affected by that.

I think we should disable the remaining tests as well in TestJdbcWithMiniHS2 temporarily, as they are not running anyway and are delaying the test runs. What are your thoughts [~aihuaxu] ?
, Sure. We can disable them for now. It could be some race condition.

, Applied the new patch to disable the entire test class for now, until the issue is resolved.
, I'm investigating right now. I'm able to see testSessionScratchDirs fail when actually the test itself is finished but when it tries to clean up., Is it a failure or a hang in the clean up ?
, It's the same exception you posted. But seems it's caused from race condition, so not always reproducible from that test., [~thejas] You are right. The issue is from the test case testConcurrentStatements. After I comment out the multiple thread part, the issue goes away.

Seems it's caused by not thread safe issue of Hive object. I'm working on HIVE-13193 and the issue should be resolved there. Can you also take a look at HIVE-13424? This is the first step. , Yes, I will take a look at those patches.
However, leaving these tests disabled would not be a good idea, we might have more regressions getting committed that we will not notice for long time. For example, HIVE-12049 is adding new tests in same class.

I think we should revert the optimization inn HIVE-13149 temporarily because of the test case breakage and possible other production issues it might bring about (as we haven't really nailed down the interaction). We can bring it back after the changes you are making to make things thread safe (or other fixes to get the test working).
Does that sound OK ?
, Yeah. That makes sense. My fault that I didn't pay attention to the test which didn't have an output. I will rework on the patch. I just reverted. Could you please remove the ignore flag?, Reverted the temporary change to disable the test as the change that was causing this issue has been reverted.
, resolving as not a problem (anymore).
