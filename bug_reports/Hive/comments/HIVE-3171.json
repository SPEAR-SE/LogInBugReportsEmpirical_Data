[Small aliases can have multiple partitions or can have more buckets than driving alias or both., https://reviews.facebook.net/D4425

This is the last one.
, @Navis: I see failures in the following tests. Can you please take a look? Thanks.

* TestMinimrCliDriver bucketmapjoin6.q, bucketmapjoin3.q, smb_mapjoin_8.q
* TestNegativeCliDriver stats_aggregator_error1
, I think the patch is not reflecting various changes made on the FetchWork. I'll start working on this when HIVE-2925 is visible on trunk., @Carl: Fixed bug (thanks) and passed tests mentioned above. I'll update patch after passing full test., comments, Addressed comments. , +1. Will commit if tests pass., @Navis: Can you please attach the most recent version of the patch to this ticket? Thanks., Passed all tests, @Navis: Since the tests passed can you please commit this yourself? Thanks., @Carl: I've not yet received account for ASF, and is it ok to commit by myself? (I thought that the author and the committer should be different), @Carl, @Navis, we mostly don't commit our patches. There have been a few exceptions, but I think
we should try to stick to this policy: dont commit our own patches.

Also, can you hold off for a few hours - I wanted to take a pass at this patch. Should be done today itself.

, some small comments on phabricator, @Namit: The Apache Hive Project Bylaws are located here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Bylaws

The bylaws explicitly prohibit committers from voting on their own patches, but they don't prohibit committers from committing their own patches as long as another committer has already reviewed and +1'd the patch. It's also worth noting that the bylaws stipulate that the +1 vote must be sent to dev@hive, and that 24 hours must elapse between the first +1 vote and the point at which the patch is committed., @Navis: I added a couple small comments on phabricator. Thanks., @Navis, are you planning to work on this ?
Most of the comments are minor - it would be useful to get it in., I've addressed comments and just finished full test. Will update patch shortly., Passed all tests, +1. Will commit if tests pass., @Carl, let me know if you are busy.
I also ran the tests, and they ran fine.
I can commit it.

I need this patch for some other jiras, and the sooner I get it in, the easier it is for me., Committed to trunk. Thanks Navis!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1655 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1655/])
