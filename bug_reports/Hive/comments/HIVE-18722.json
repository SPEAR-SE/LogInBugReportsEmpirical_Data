[SUM(hash()) out of a Group-by query is not expected to be consistent (since JDK8), because it uses an iterator from a a HashMap

If you're seeing different results with {{set hive.map.aggr=false}}, then it might be worth investigating.

Integer operations are commutative, if they are of the same type - except it can be (long)(int)(a+b) & (long(a) + long(b)) within the partial result.

The GC canary in the group-by operator is the usual problem.]
