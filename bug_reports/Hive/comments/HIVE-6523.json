[Patch attached., [~alangates]/[~jdere], could you please verify/review this patch?, FYI there is also YARN-1758, which should fix the NPE in yarn. If we wait for this fix I believe the tests should work again without having to do a fix on our end., Not to mention doing the workaround on our end means having to patch every minimr test, of which there are many, Oh good that there's a patch up for that already. And yes, patching every minimr test with this is very much a hacky interim solution. We can ignore if that patch gets committed.,
