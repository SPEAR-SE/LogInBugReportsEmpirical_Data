[[~vishal.kamath] Thinking of implementing something like a InputSampler.SplitSampler. Would it be helpful for this case?, I think this might help. 

InputSampler.SplitSampler<K,V> would sample the first n records from s splits. 
getSample() would take the first numSamples/numSplits records

Would it be possible for you to explain your approach with an example ? Let us that you have 1,000,000 rows in your file and say 10 splits. , [~vishal.kamath] Booked an issue for split sampling described above. Wish it's helpful.]
