[Very strange - https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/physical/Vectorizer.java#L2110, It seems {{validateTableScanOperator}} is no longer used after HIVE-17433.
[~mmccline] could you please take a look?, HIVE-18191, [~lirui] and [~gopalv] thanks for determining cause.]
