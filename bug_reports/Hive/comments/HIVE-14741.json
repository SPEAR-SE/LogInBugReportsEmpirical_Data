[Issue probably is not related to boolean. I think its related to usage of case/IF with primitives that has nulls

Some more observations --

select sum(if((bool_col), 1, 0)) from bool_vect_issue;
708206

select sum(if((bool_col == True), 1, 0)) from bool_vect_issue;
697966

select sum(if((bool_col is null), 1, 0)) from bool_vect_issue;
868512

select sum(if(coalesce(bool_col,false)), 1, 0)) from bool_vect_issue;
231

select a.x, count(*) from (select bool_col as x from bool_vect_issue) a group by a.x;
NULL	868512
true	231

select a.x, count(*) from (select if(bool_col, true, false) x from bool_vect_issue) a group by a.x;
false	160537
true	708206]
