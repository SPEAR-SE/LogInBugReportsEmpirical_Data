I'll file follow-ups to fix. , LGTM +1, Committed to master. Thanks for the review!, I'm pretty sure in all these JIRAs 4.0.0 version needs to be retained.
It's possible to have smth fixed in 3.1 but not 4.0.0, esp. for versions of 3.X released after 4.0.0... but also even for regular 3.1 if some patch is not applicable to 4.0, You are absolutely right... Will add 4.0.0 back. (y), This is released in Hive 3.1.0.]
