[Added two options:
hive.index.compact.query.max.bytes - the maximum number of bytes that a query using the compact index can read
hive.index.compact.query.max.entries - the maximum number of entries to read from the index file during a query

If any of these thresholds are exceeded then an exception is thrown., We could set a reasonably high default hive.index.compact.query.max.entries=1000000 to prevent users from accidentally shooting themselves in the foot. For now the default is Long.MAX_VALUE. , The patch looks good to me. Can you put the new confs in HiveConf, and use HiveConf to get the value. And also please add these 2 new confs in hive-default.xml.

Yeah, please set hive.index.compact.query.max.entries to a very high number, like 10000000. Let's set the default file size to a 10GB by default., Also, add the new parameters in the subject of the jira - this helps 
in searching for these parameters in future., Adds the two options to HiveConf and hive-default.xml. Negative unit tests now work correctly., I've added the two options hive.index.compact.query.max.size and hive.index.compact.query.max.entries to HiveConf and hive-default.xml. Fixed the negative unit tests for this feature., the patch looks good to me, will commit after tests pass., Wojciech, can you upload a svn diff?, The patch is now from svn diff., Another SVN diff, now with all the files., will commit after tests pass., Committed! Thanks Wojciech! 
(still trying to figure out how to assign this task to Wojciech :) ), Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #742 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/742/])
