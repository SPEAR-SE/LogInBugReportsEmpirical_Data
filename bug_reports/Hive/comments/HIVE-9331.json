[mostly removing code, there was also a small bug in one of the classes. 

Path for now has optimized hashtable itself disabled, so that tests could run on modified code; PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT this patch even if tests pass and there's +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12691490 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, removing the old setting from the q file, forgot the out file. 
[~ashutoshc] can you take a look? code removal, Looks good. Few clarifications:
* Is there any difference between LazyFlatRowContainer and FlatRowContainer. From quick glance cant locate a difference. Mere renaming?
* What supersedes this optimization? Something already in trunk or is there something you working on., It's a rename.
Optimized hashtable supercedes these,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12692027 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failure is unrelated, will commit later today, committed to trunk, Doc note:  This removes configuration parameters *hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys* and *hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable* from HiveConf.java, so the wiki needs to be updated.  Their removal from the default list for *hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist* is automatic as of HIVE-8534 and doesn't need a wiki update.

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys]
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable]
* [_doc sample for removal_ | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.stats.map.parallelism]
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist]

A release note would be nice too., Doc done., Thanks!]
