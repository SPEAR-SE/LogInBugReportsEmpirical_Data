[Seemed fixed by HIVE-6684 or HIVE-6561 already. Will be included in next version., Should this be documented in the wiki as a bug to be fixed in the next release?

And what's the fix -- will newlines no longer be needed after each query in a file, or will the Beeline command just fail more gracefully?, The former (confirmed in my PC). Seemed not needed to be documented., Thanks, [~navis].  I just wanted to be sure., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, [~thejas], [~navis] Looks like the issue still exists in Hive 1.2. and is due to a jline2 bug (https://github.com/jline/jline/issues/10). I had a work it around in beeline, please review that in HIVE-10541, Thanks.]
