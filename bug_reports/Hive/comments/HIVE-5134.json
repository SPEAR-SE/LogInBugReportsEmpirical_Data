[Here's an example test (with some implementation), on top of HIVE-4914, that is not going to work.

If I remove the custom implementation and switch to UDFLike::likePatternToRegExp (moved into common to access from metastore), even fewer patterns from this test work.

We should be able to add this test and make it work in some way, or remove the code.]
