, This is because there is no PushFilterPastAgg rule. Just uploaded a patch for OPTIQ-425.
btw here is a simple query to reproduce this:
{code}
select syear, cnt
 from
 (select d1.d_year as syear ,count(*) as cnt
    FROM   store_sales
          JOIN date_dim d1 ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
 group by d1.d_year
  ) cs
 where cs.syear = 2000
{code},
