[Currently, we use only one size:

"hive.merge.size.per.task"

whose default value is 256M.

We should add another parameter

"hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize"

whose default value can be much smaller, say 16M.

We will only merge if the current average size of a file < "hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize".

This will make sure that merging will happen only in very bad cases., +1

looks good - will commit if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Yonqiang]
