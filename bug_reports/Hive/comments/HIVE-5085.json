This message is automatically generated., Ashutosh, it does not look like the metatool is written to use any parameters apart from the ones it explicitly mentions when you run -help. In fact, its commandline opts parser initialization errors out if they are present.

Also, there is precedence for the change I made - both rcfilecat and orcfiledump also use the same HIVE_OPTS nulling out in their scripts before calling execHiveCmd., I see. +1, Committed to trunk.
