["select queries" means "SELECT" without "INSERT", correct?

I agree that we should treat these queries differently, specifically, no compression (or maybe use lzo to same bandwidth - clients can be in other data centers) will be a big win.
, yes - it does make sense to differentiate result data from intermediate. if anything - there's probably a good argument to be made that we don't need a separate option for intermediate compression. it should default to whatever policy is being applied for map-reduce intermediate traffic. (that would be a better default than either true or false - that way admins have one less option to get right).

interestingly - result data also needs minimal replication. the client is single threaded and cannot exploit multiple replicas for bandwidth purposes. also - the data is temporary in nature and doesn't need reliability.
