[[~alangates] Can you look at the test case that I added in this patch? Its related to ACID DELETE operation. After deleting a newly added row, the select count\(*\) query return 0 rows instead of actual 1000 rows. Is this a bug/known issue or am I doing something wrong?,

I don't see an issue here.  You're setting every row in 2008-04-08 to have a key of foo, and then deleting all records with a key of foo, so that partition will be empty., Ah ok!. With hive convention of "INSERT INTO" I was thinking new rows will be appended to the existing partition and not replacing it., insert into should never replace rows.  You are changing the key of all rows to foo in the statement "update acid set key = 'foo'"  Then you say "delete from acid where key = 'foo'", so all rows get deleted., Thanks for the clarification [~alangates]. That was my mistake.. I should have added "where value = 'bar'" to the predicate to get the result that I was expecting. Updated the queries in this new patch., LGTM +1 (also for .14. fixes major issue and the change is small/safe)., Added more tests to cover cases where sorted dynamic partition is enabled and constant propagation is disabled to make sure the generated plan and results are correct.,
