ATTACHMENT ID: 12614000, [~jdere] Thanks for working on this. Please provide RB link when the patch is ready to be reviewed., RB at https://reviews.apache.org/r/15607/, +1, Patch committed to trunk. Thank Jason for the contribution., Here is a possible instance of this issue, can you run this case to see it is addressed by this JIRA in Hive 13?  Thanks!

Create a standard  textual linefeed delimited HDFS file with 1 row and  1 column, with contents like:
FEB

Issue the following DDL against the above data, filling in location [hdfs_path] appropriately:
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `HIVE_5825` ( month VARCHAR(3) ) STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION [hdfs_path]

Issue the following SQL, which fails in Hive 12:
select case  when COUNT(*) > COUNT(`month`) then ' ' else MIN(`month`) end from HIVE_5825

The Hive 12 failure message generated is:
java.sql.SQLException: Error while processing statement: FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10016]: Line 1:57 Argument type mismatch '`month`': The expression after ELSE should have the same type as those after THEN: "string" is expected but "varchar(3)" is found
, Hi [~dougsedlak], yes that query looks like it compiles/runs without error]
