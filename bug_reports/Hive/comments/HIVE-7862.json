[Here is patch.. 

I added try/catch/finally statement.. and  InputStream, ZipOutputStream object is closed in finally statement  , I wonder why QA run didn't start., Rename the patch HIVE-7862.1.patch, then resubmit it.

* [How To Contribute -- Creating a Patch | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-CreatingaPatch], QA still didn't pick up the patch., Did you cancel the patch (using button on middle-top line) and then resubmit it (changing status back to Patch Available again)?,
