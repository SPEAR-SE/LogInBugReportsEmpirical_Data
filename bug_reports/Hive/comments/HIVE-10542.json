This loop seems wrong. I think you probably want to check all aliases. Right now if you ever hit the else branch you might bail out of the loop not considering the aliases after it., If you do it afterwards you also don't need the "nothingTodDo" flag., Might make sense to add a test case for this too (a outer b inner c outer d - or something like that)., +1, Added to precommit queue (we lost a bunch over the weekend). Assuming this passes, is this patch good to go?, Thanks! Yes. If it passes, it is good to go.,
