I have done following, and is working for me perfectly: 
*  Created a loader table .
{code:java}
create table HIVE_16514_l (col1 decimal(38,20));
{code}

* Inserted a record into it.
 {code:java}
insert into table HIVE_16514_l values (9389587.19800467);
{code}

* Created a Parquet table with decimal column. 
 {code:java}
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE HIVE_16514_PARQ (c2 Decimal (38,20))  STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION 'HIVE_16514_PARQ ';
 {code}

* Insert overwrite parquet table with data inserted in loader.
 {code:java}
insert overwrite table HIVE_16514_PARQ select * from HIVE_16514_l;
 {code}

* Retrieved results from parquet table , amd which appears to be correct.
