[The patch. I'd like to add a test in CliDriver but I ran into HIVE-16039.
[~ashutoshc] can you take a look at the code change, and also, do you know how to gen output for perfclidriver?
When I was testing locally I c/p-ed the entire TPCDS schema and query to regular CliDriver, that worked for me; but when I run PerfCliDriver locally, it OOMs. , 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:

ATTACHMENT ID: 12854638 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, q14 actually already exists and has been failing for a while. Adding the java change that should fix this issue in that query, Can u add some test cases for this?
{code}
drop view v;
create view v as select key as k from src union all select key as k1 from src;
desc formatted v;

drop view v;
create view v as select key as k from src intersect all select key as k1 from src;
desc formatted v;

following masking tests,

set hive.mapred.mode=nonstrict;
set hive.security.authorization.manager=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.plugin.sqlstd.SQLStdHiveAuthorizerFactoryForTest;

create table masking_test as select cast(key as int) as key, value from src;

explain select * from masking_test  union all select * from masking_test ;
select * from masking_test  union all select * from masking_test ;

explain select key as k1, value as v1 from masking_test where key > 0 intersect all select key as k2, value as v2 from masking_test where key > 0;

select key as k1, value as v1 from masking_test where key > 0 intersect all select key as k2, value as v2 from masking_test where key > 0;
{code}

And could u create a RB please as well. Thanks., Added tests,

, [~ashutoshc] see the TODO that this patch removes.
The way Hive structures the unions/etc w/more than 2 sides is an unbalanced binary tree sortof, where the last query of the union is the right child, and all the others are the left branch, and so on recursively.
E.g.
{noformat}
TOK_UNION
  TOK_UNION
      TOK_QUERY
      TOK_QUERY
  TOK_QUERY
{noformat}
  However, that means that the first query of the union, that Hive uses to get column aliases, is not the one that the original patch was looking at - it was looking at the least nested select, which would be the rightmost (the last) query of the union.

So what we do is find the parent of the tree and, if we are not the left-most child, go into the left (first) sub-tree and find select again, then repeat. For a 2-query union, it will find the correct select immediately.
It's a little bit wasteful (because in multi-union we'd always find the wrong select, then backtrack to find the left side, then find the wrong select inside the left side, then backtrack again one level lower, etc. until we get to the level where both children are on the same level) but it should protect against finding selects in unexpected places like subquery expressions, etc., I see. +1,
