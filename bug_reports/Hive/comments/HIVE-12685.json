[This issue is exposed by HIVE-12628, which included hive-common as ql dependency., [~daijy] Can you take a look?, [~wzheng], FYI I think this invalid property was also causing following tests to fail:
TestSessionHooks
TestPlainSaslHelper 
TestSessionGlobalInitFile

I filed HIVE-12670 for this. But after removing the property, these tests still fail with other errors. I haven't investigated yet, but I'd be curious to see if these fail after your patch.  , Patch 2 includes (possibly missing) fix from HIVE-1841 and HIVE-12436.

FYI, [~ashutoshc] [~jdere]

[~mohitsabharwal] Can you try this patch?, I think patch 2 won't work for some cases. We need to somehow fall back to using the hive-site.xml target/tmp/conf directory. This is like an incorrect Maven dependency issue., Currently we have difference versions of hive-site.xml located everywhere
{code}
wzheng /tmp/hive $ find . -name hive-site.xml
./beeline/src/test/resources/hive-site.xml
./common/src/test/resources/hive-site.xml
./conf/hive-site.xml
./data/conf/hive-site.xml

./data/conf/tez/hive-site.xml
./hcatalog/src/test/e2e/templeton/deployers/config/hive/hive-site.xml
{code}
The one causing problem of this JIRA is common/src/test/resources/hive-site.xml

Instead of maintaining multiple pieces, we should get rid of unnecessary hive-site.xml as much as possible. So we should remove common/src/test/resources/hive-site.xml and just use the default one from data/conf (for TestHiveConf)., Patch 3, which removes the unnecessary common/src/test/resources/hive-site.xml, [~ashutoshc] Can you take a look?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12778134 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures are not related, Thanks, [~wzheng]. Couple of comments:
 - Better to reference ConfVars.METASTORE_CONNECTION_DRIVER.varname than use the literal directly.
 - Seems like the patch removes some unit test functionality in TestHiveConf.
{code}
     // Property defined in hive-site.xml only
-    checkHadoopConf("test.property1", null);
-    checkHiveConf("test.property1", "hive-site.xml");
{code}
Should we keep the test & move these properties from common/src/test/resources/hive-site.xml  to data/conf/hive-site.xml ?

Also, looks like patch is no longer testing this scenario
{code}
-    // Test HiveConf property variable substitution in hive-site.xml
{code}
Perhaps instead of using METASTORE_CONNECTION_DRIVER property for testing, we can use a dummy property like HIVETESTMODEDUMMYSTATAGGR, so that it doesn't affect other unit tests?  , [~mohitsabharwal] Thanks for the feedback.

The code below is doing the same thing but serve for different purposes, one to uses the varname, the other uses the literal.
{code}
    // ConfVar overridden in in hive-site.xml
    checkHadoopConf(ConfVars.METASTORE_CONNECTION_DRIVER.varname, null);
    checkConfVar(ConfVars.METASTORE_CONNECTION_DRIVER, "org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver");

    // Property defined in hive-site.xml only
    checkHadoopConf("javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName", null);
    checkHiveConf("javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName", "org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver");
{code}
So basically the second part replaces "test.property1".

I agree with you for the last part being removed, I've added that dummy property to data/conf/hive-site.xml.

Kindly take a look at patch 4., Thanks, [~wzheng]

I think "javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName" cannot be used instead of "test.property1", because that testcase is about using a property only defined in hive-site.xml. But "javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName" is defined in ConfVar, no ?

Looks like there are three testcases: 

1) Override a property defined in ConfVar in data/conf/hive-site.xml:
We can choose a dummy property defined in ConfVar like:
{code}
    // ConfVar overridden in in hive-site.xml
    checkHadoopConf(ConfVars.HIVETESTMODEDUMMYSTATAGGR.varname, null);
    checkConfVar(ConfVars.HIVETESTMODEDUMMYSTATAGGR, "");
    checkHiveConf(ConfVars.HIVETESTMODEDUMMYSTATAGGR.varname, "test");
{code}

And we can override it in data/conf/hive-site.xml:
{code}
+ <property>
+  <name>hive.test.dummystats.aggregator</name>
+  <value>test</value>
+ </property>
{code}

2) Property only defined in hive-site (but not in ConfVar or hadoop conf):

{code}
    // Property defined in hive-site.xml only
    checkHadoopConf("test.property1", null);
    checkHiveConf("test.property1", "hive-site.xml");
{code}

For this, we can move test.property1 from common/src/test/resources/hive-site.xml to data/conf/hive-site.xml 

3) Test HiveConf property variable substitution in hive-site.xml

For this, we can also move test.var.hiveconf.property from common/src/test/resources/hive-site.xml to data/conf/hive-site.xml  as you did in your latest patch.

Let me know if this makes sense or I'm missing something., OK, those are good points. Please take a look at patch 5., Thanks, [~wzheng]! LGTM. +1(non-binding) pending test., +1 LGTM,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12778345 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, There's a new mismatch from the last run of ptest: 
{code}
org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.TestHiveMetaStorePartitionSpecs.testAddPartitions
{code}
But the test passes locally on my laptop., TestHiveMetaStorePartitionSpecs pass for me locally as well.

Pushed to master. Thanks [~wzheng], [~ashutoshc], [~mohitsabharwal], Backported to 2.0]
