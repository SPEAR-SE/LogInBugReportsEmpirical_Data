[set hive.async.log.enabled=false; can resolve this issue. 

It's not a bug., I think this is still a bug. It should work even with async logging. I will keep it open for now. , any update? I need this useful feature., After test, we should add hive.async.log.enabled with false value in hive-site.xml . Rather than set hive.async.log.enabled=false in console.]
