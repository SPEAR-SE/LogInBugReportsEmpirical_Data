[[~stakiar] Shouldn't these keys be present in the core-site.xml too for the Map tasks to succeed?, I never had to do that in the past, but I can try and see if that works., probably comes down to the ordering of the FS creation vs when the first HiveConfiguration is instantiated. It's only after the latter than hive-site.xml is added as a default resource for all configs, hence picked up.

Best to just put it in core-site.xml]
