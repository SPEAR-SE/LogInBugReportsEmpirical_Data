[Support for ALTER TABLE ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION was added in HIVE-1106. However, this patch introduced a time-of-check-to-time-of-use bug since the check to see if the partition already exists is done in a transaction separate from the one in which the partition is actually created. We need to provide support for IF NOT EXISTS at the level of the Metastore Thrift API in order to support this correctly.]
