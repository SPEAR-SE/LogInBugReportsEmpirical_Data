ATTACHMENT ID: 12678641 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sershe] HIVE-8671 committed now. Can you rebase this patch now? Also can you fix Mostafa's change to reducer estimation. It will estimate one reducer less than the previous code. For example: if totalInputFileSize is 140 and bytesPerReducer is 100 then current change will just say 1 reducer. We should either have Math.ceil or Math.max(totalInputFileSize, totalInputFileSize + bytesPerReducer - 1)/bytesPerReducer.. , [~hagleitn] 14? I will address the latest comment, rebased, added ceil, +1, [~sershe] minor nit: Can you remove the getMaxIfOverflow() method? Since we are using safeAdd, safeMultiply methods we don't need that anymore., +1 for .14,
