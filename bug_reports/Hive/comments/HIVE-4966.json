[Hi Harish,

I recently found need for a collect_array UDF that would maintain ordering and duplicates. I actually just changed a few things out of collect_set. Do you think that a collect_array would be generally useful? If so, would it make sense to combine these into one UDAF to minimize code duplication?, For my understanding, are you adding a new function collect_array or are you enhancing collect_set to have a dedup=true/false option. 

The signatures of collect_map and collect_set/array are different. So we have to expose them as separate fns.

But open to sharing a single implementation. Makes sense. What specifically do you have in mind? 
, I have a working collect here

I was going to add it to hive but you can if you would like., Hello Harish, have you already implemented this UDF? Could you please provide patch?, Just attached something I worked on in July.
You will have to at least rebase.
