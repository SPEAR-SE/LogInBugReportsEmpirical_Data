[The patch includes a bunch of changes originally written for HIVE-13974 that rework the handling of schemas and move to using TypeDescription class instead of arrays/lists of the OrcProto.Type class.  It solves the bug in this JIRA.

Code in OrcRawRecordMerger that manipulated the include and column name arrays has been moved to Schema Evolution in an attempt to centralize that logic and it also contributed to the solution, too.

Now, HIVE-13974 will be based on this code + more logic that needs to be added to the ORC split generation logic for handling logical/reader/file schema for inner STRUCT types and Schema Evolution.,

So, backed off on that in patch #2.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12817027 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, For patch #3, the list_bucket_dml_13 failure doesn't involve ORC and therefore seems unrelated.  The other failures are prior ones., [~mmccline] I left a few comments on RB.  Mostly superficial except "clone()/toString()" wrt Reader.Options.
I understand what you are trying to do and generally it makes sense.

One concern I have is that that the fact that orc.RecordReader need to know that it's doing Acid read vs regular read.  Given how things are currently implemented, I'm not sure how to avoid that.  It would be better if higher layer just specified what columns it wants - user cols and acid meta cols and interpret them so that RecordReader doesn't have to.  Perhaps down the road we can make the layout be just 1 struct<operation, originalTransaction, .... currentTransaction, c1, c2 ..., cN>  where "c" are user columns and include some version number in the ORC footer to know where the offset for the user columns start (in case we add more metadata columns).  I think this may have other advantages make acid look more like non-acid equivalent.

I think someone more familiar with the code patch should look at this as well., Eugene: thank you for looking at the changes., Ok, I'm looking at this bug now too, since this seems like the important part of HIVE-13974., Here's the one line fix., +1, I should give more details. The problem was that OrcInputFormat was modifying the passed in Options object and that ACID was reusing the Options object between the deltas. Thus, when some of the delta files had fewer columns, the include array wasn't long enough.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12817518 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, The test case failures weren't related. I just committed this to branch-2.1 and master. Thanks for the review, Prasanth., This still needs to go into branch-1, ported to branch-1 as well]
