ATTACHMENT ID: 12860505 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1, thanks for the fix Jimmy., Thanks Rui for the review. Pushed to the master branch., [~jxiang], the current plan is for master to become release 3.0.0 so this issue's fix version should be 3.0.0 instead of 2.2.0.

* [About next 2.3 release | http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hive-dev/201703.mbox/%3cCAMs4YUe4Wn3ZABeet-aCN6sMHUp0k8ffgeu3W6m4Y9wgJFSPjg@mail.gmail.com%3e]

Please commit to branch-2 if you want this patch in 2.3.0, which is what we thought would be 2.2.0 but now that's going to be a special case:
