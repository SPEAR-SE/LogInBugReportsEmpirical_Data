[[~elserj] fyi, Silencing the class logger. [~ashutoshc] can you take a look? Will these files be sufficient?, [~prasanth_j] will know , I think this should be enough. +1, [~sershe], [~sushanth] had told me about this one and I thought we had addressed it in v0.1.1 of the plugin (I thought Hive is on 0.1.2 by now). HIVE-14394, I think, brought that in.,
