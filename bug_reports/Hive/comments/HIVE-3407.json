[Patch 1 revises 'cli.xml' with current information from the wiki and from Thejas Nair and Sushanth Sowmyan, plus some editorial changes.  Patch 1 also adds a division break in 'site.vsl' to stop indenting the docset's menu., Great to see there is already a patch for this and sorry for duplicating it! 

Does the patch still apply? Is their a Review Board item for it?, I checked and this patch still applies against trunk. I think we'd get some committer attention with a review board item, marking the issue "patch available", and then poking the dev list., Patch 1 revises two files: 

* cli.xml is synced with the wiki doc.
* site.vsl adds a division break that prevents menu indentation., The [Hive CLI wiki|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli] contains the same information as this patch for the CLI xdoc.  And since Hive xdocs aren't in use anymore, there's no need to commit the patch., This was put into the wiki.]
