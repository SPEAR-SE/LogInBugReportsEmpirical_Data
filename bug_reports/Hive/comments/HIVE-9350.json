, Doc note:  This changes the description of *hive.metastore.filter.hook* which was created by HIVE-8612 in 1.1.0 (aka 0.15.0) and documented in the Metastore Administration wikidoc.  So the wiki needs to be updated for 1.2.0.

* [Hive Metastore Administration -- Additional Configuration Parameters | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+MetastoreAdmin#AdminManualMetastoreAdmin-AdditionalConfigurationParameters]

Does this need any other documentation?, SessionState is referred to in the AM, but MetaException isn't included in the hive-exec.jar., Reverted the patch to address classnotfound issue in hive-exec.
, Fix the classnotfound exception at runtime from perflogger.
, Updated review board, but it also shows other changes from trunk as part of the diff. Here is the real change in updated patch - https://github.com/thejasmn/hive/commit/b35795441195825218cc32bda814ea7a9369435f

Thanks for the review [~jdere]!
, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira., [~thejas] What was the reason for adding {{MetaException}} and {{NoSuchObjectException}} to {{MetaStoreFilterHook}} interfaces? Looks like the only implementation isn't throwing any exceptions.

The problem is that the change requires clients to recompile against the new interface. 
, [~akolb] Please see my first comment in the jira.
bq. [~prasadm] FYI, this patch introduces a small change to metastore filterhook api. The signature of the apis allows for MetaException to be thrown, this helps in propagating error messages properly. 

Without that, it would need to throw unchecked exceptions. Having a clear exception in the signature informs users of the api about what to expect/handle.
Since this API is not widely used by end users, and only by advanced users like Sentry, I notified the original author of it. It should be easy to make a change in Sentry when it adds support for this new version of hive (1.2.0).
, [~thejas] Thanks for the clarification. It is a pity RawStore doesn't specify exceptions on method signatures as well.]
