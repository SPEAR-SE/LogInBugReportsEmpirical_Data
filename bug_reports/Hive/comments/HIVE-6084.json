[Patch attached. The patch is based on the tests run over Hadoop 2., cc [~sushanth] and [~ekoifman] for review, 
This test is supposed to have check_job_complete=SUCCESS. This field is a property of the Launcher task which is either ends in SUCCESS(3) or KILLED(5). (short of bugs/unexpected failures). It is not the property of the task being submitted. check_job_exit_value is the exit value for subprocess.
Thus since this test specifies a mapper which returns 1 (i.e. no-zero status), MR fails it. So exit_value=1 and job_complete=SUCCESS is correct., Closing the jira based on [~ekoifman] 's comments.]
