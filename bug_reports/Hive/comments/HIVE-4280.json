[This doesn't fail when run in isolation. Only when full test-suite is run. It fails with {{AlreadyExistsException(message:Database tmpdb already exists)}} Likely cause for this is some previous testcase has created db named tmpdb which that test failed to drop. Fix is to pick some unique name for db like hive2480 which was unlikely created by previous test., Hello [~ashutoshc].

Please assign this issue to me. I will fix this problem as you commented.
This kind of problem can appear again. Do other temporal databases need to be renamed together?, I'm testing my patch. I will submit it when its test is finished., Thanks Teddy for picking this up.
bq. This kind of problem can appear again. Do other temporal databases need to be renamed together?
Possibly, but I havent seen any failures other time, so not sure., I ran unit tests several times, but they failed. It seems like there is a cause of failures on my machine, such as configuration change or a problem in base version.

So I merged the recent trunk and started a new test on other machine. I will report again when it is finished., I thing that the changes on TestRetryingHMSHandler should be tested with the full test, not with query tests. So I tested with {code}ant clean package test{code} command. Then I got the following error message. TestDefaultHiveMetastoreAuthorizationProvider failed.

I Googled this failure, but I couldn't access to a relevant page( https://reviews.facebook.net/D6681?id=22179 ). I read some parts on its preview, "2012. 11. 13. â€“ ... /hive/ql/security/TestDefaultHiveMetastoreAuthorizationProvider.java ..... we should let it fail in default branch and have the exception thrown, ..." I looks like there's some information related.

If anybody knows an appropriate solution, please tell me., I discussed it with [~navis], and he told me that it's not the root cause. He showed me a way to diagnose Hive failures. I'll try it again., The latest test failure was due to that Mac is not case-sensitive. (HIVE-2952)

However, previous ones are on Linux but they failed. I'll see Linux cases again., HIVE-3949 was the cause of my problem. Other tests successfully completed. I'll attach the patch., I uploaded two patches. HIVE-4280-2.patch.txt is [~ashutoshc]'s suggestion. In HIVE-4280-1.patch.txt, other database names are changed, too. Both of them passed tests., +1 for 4280-1.patch.txt will commit if tests pass., Committed to trunk and 0.11 Thanks, Teddy!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2069 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2069/])
