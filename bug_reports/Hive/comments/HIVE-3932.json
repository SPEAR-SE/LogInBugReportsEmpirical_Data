[Removes the includes.postgres property so PostGreSQL metastore scripts are included by default (like mysql, derby and oracle). This is essentially a revert of HIVE-2552.

Testing done:
1. Verified PostGreSQL scripts were infact being included under {{build/dist/scripts/metastore/upgrade}}
2. Verified that the {{vcs.excludes}} property is still being honored., +1 We are actively maintaining postgres scripts, no reason not to include them in release., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Mark!, Integrated in hive-trunk-hadoop1 #65 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/hive-trunk-hadoop1/65/])
