[Johan has a patch for 102, where he is breaking up DDLTask into multiple functions. This is a follow-up and requires that
the tasks be different classes, If you want to ignore my patch and go straight to this one instead I'm fine with that, as long as something is done :)
I just slapped together mine in two minutes with Eclipse, not much serious thought went into it., That's OK - you can merge 102 for now. We can do this cleanup later. I dont think I will be
able to look at it right now., Patch for parameterizing DDLWork on DDLDesc. This helps in getting rid of ton of unnecessary code., Thanks for taking this, Ashutosh.
Can you write a quick 10 line note on what this patch does ?
It will help tremendously in the review., Sure. DDLWork was sort of a container class which held various *Desc object out of which only one was active at a time. DDLTask used to check which desc of DDLWork is non-null, execute it and return. This patch makes all the *Desc in DDLWork extend from DDLDesc so DDLWork can refer to generic DDLDesc. This helps in getting rid of setting and getting of all the different Desc and thus making DDLWork extremely small and lightweight. There is one downside of it though. Instead of specific Explain annotation on get*Desc(), now there can only be a generic annotation on getDesc(). So, in explain of create Table DDL earlier used to appear "Create Table Operator" now appears "DDL Operator"., @Namit,
Does that help?, hobbymanyp requested code review of "HIVE-123 [jira] refactor DDL code (both DDLWork and DDLTask)".

  Make hbase handler compatible with further version of 0.89

  It might be good to break DDLTask into separate tasks. The abstract class DDLWork can have various subclasses:
  showTablesWork, DescribeTableWork etc. and a separate task for each of them. This will make them completely independent.

, -1. Supplied patch has nothing to do with DDL code. Please resubmit against the right JIRA issue., hobbymanyp has commented on the revision "HIVE-123 [jira] refactor DDL code (both DDLWork and DDLTask)".

  I am following up the instruction on https://cwiki.apache.org/Hive/phabricatorcodereview.html  .  If this is not correct, where is the right one? (or instruction?)

  @hobbymanyp: The directions you cited are correct, as far as I know. I suspect that you referenced the wrong JIRA when you initially submitted your request. Can you please confirm that this patch is for HIVE-123x, and not HIVE-123?

  According to the steps, I think i am using HIVE-123.  Should I change it to "arc diff --jira HIVE-123x" (instead of  "arc diff --jira HIVE-123") ?

  From a git checkout (e.g. from git clone git://github.com/apache/hive.git), a typical usage sequence is as follows:

  ant arc-setup
  git checkout -b HIVE-123-dev-branch
  edit some files to implement HIVE-123
  git commit -a -m "initial description of how I have gone about making DDL code suck less"
  arc diff --jira HIVE-123
  optionally, visit diff URL provided by Phabricator to do things like add reviewers and CC's
