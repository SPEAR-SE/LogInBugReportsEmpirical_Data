[Adding comment from [~jdere] in HIVE-8094
I think you're right about your comment about FunctionRegistry.mFunctions and HS2. So all users would be able to see the temp functions that have been created in HS2. I suspect you may not be able to use them however, if the jar has not been added to the session's classloader then the actual MR tasks may not be able to resolve UDF classes.
, I think such case could more likely happen to permanent UDFs instead of temp UDFs. 

One comment is users better to upload their Jar files to HDFS instead of use 'add jar' before creating permanent UDFs., This should be fixed by HIVE-2573]
