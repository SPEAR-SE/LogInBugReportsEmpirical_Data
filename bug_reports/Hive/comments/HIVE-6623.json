[FYI [~szehon], I took a look, unfortunately AWS-EC2 jcloud provider 1.7.0 doesnt seem to support adding name/value to tag, they support adding name only to tag.   

Like (name = 'owner=szehon' , value=null).  That is the way the group tag is right now as well (name = 'group=hive-ptest-slave', value = null).  That might have to do until they support it, +1 thanks for figuring this out, Thank you for the review! I have committed this to trunk.]
