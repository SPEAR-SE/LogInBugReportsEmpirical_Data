[Please find the code review request at https://reviews.apache.org/r/7840/, @Kanna, HIVE-2061 introduced this for backward compatibility reason. Currently, user needs to *add* this jar in their script. So, if we don't create a symlink user needs to update their script every time we upgrade a hive version, which is not ideal. I am not sure what problem you are facing with symlinks on Windows, but if that is not easily solvable one potential workaround would be to check in build.xml that OS is windows and then not create symlink, but instead copy hive-contrib-0.9.0 with name hive-contrib.jar. This will avoid backward incompatibility as well as need to create symlink on Windows. But, before we go down that path perhaps we should investigate more whats the problem with symlinks on Windows.   , Thanks Ashutosh - In Windows, When we specify the class path as “HIVE_DIR\Dist\Lib\*” instead of enumerating individual jars (because of 8k limitation on environment variable), JAVA is trying to load the “hive-contrib.jar” as regular jar and failing. Based on the comments in HIVE-3092, I think it is safe to remove them. If not, I can conditionally skip this on Windows.

, Based on discussion in HIVE-3092 it seems like no one is depending on it. So, I think we are fine removing the symlink. 
+1 will commit if tests pass. , @Ashutosh - Can you please commit these changes if there are no UT failures? Thanks, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Kanna!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1797 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1797/])
