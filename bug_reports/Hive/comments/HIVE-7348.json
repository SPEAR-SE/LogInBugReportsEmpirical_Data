ATTACHMENT ID: 12658869, Thanks Ashish, can we fix the Beeline test?  Also I left some minor comments on rb., Copy of my comment from RB:

I'm not sure about this patch.

Something like this will now be completely garbled:

{code}create table ${D_TBL} (d string);select * from ${D_TBL} where d = ";"; show tables;{code}

Even something like this won't work anymore:

{code}select * from ${D_TBL} where d = ";"{code}

So I'm afraid I'm on -1 on this patch as it breaks existing behavior. The only way to do this properly is to parse the statement fully and split where needed., I didnt find old Hive CLIDriver support that type of query directly, but looking at the code it does have some logic to support escaped semicolons, like:

{noformat}
select * from ${D_TBL} where d = "\;";
{noformat}

Probably worth having a similar thing in Beeline?, [~lars_francke] and [~szehon] thanks for looking into this patch.

Lars brought up a good point. However, hive cli also does not support queries with ";" as part of query with -e.

I do agree that we should have a better way to handle ";" and support multiple queries at the same time with -e. I will try to see if there is something that can be formulated with reasonable effort. Feel free to suggest any solution that you have in mind., I won't argue much on this and leave the final decision up to you but here's my opinion:

I think that splitting on semicolon as well as requiring an escaped semicolon are bad ideas because both need special handling on the client side. I've written quite a few bash jobs that are run as cron or manually and take some input put it in a query and execute it. All these would now need to be changed to special case the semicolon. The help on the other hand says {{query that should be executed}} which is singular.

So what you're really trying to do is to add a new feature. What I've been doing when I need multiple statements is just call beeline multiple times. Maybe another feature to add instead is to support multiple "-e" parameters.

You could obviously use the HiveParser in beeline to parse the statement but then we're tied to a specific Hive version again which we don't want either.

So while Ashish has already put work into this I'm afraid I'm in favor of closing this issue as WONTFIX for the reasons mentioned., bq.  Maybe another feature to add instead is to support multiple "-e" parameters.

That should already work I believe., That's perfect, thanks! Didn't know that., Sounds like we have a consensus here that the current functionality of "-e" is what it should be. I agree that this should be closed as NOTABUG.

Thanks [~szehon] and [~lars_francke] for detailed discussion here., Support for multiple -e options should be documented in the wiki.  (Are multiple -f options also supported?)

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline Command Options | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions], {code:java}
    getOpts().setScriptFile(cl.getOptionValue("f"));
    if (cl.getOptionValues('e') != null) {
      commands = Arrays.asList(cl.getOptionValues('e'));
    }
{code}

It looks like multiple options are only supported for "-e" not "-f". I've added a sentence to the documentation. I'd be happy if you could review., Well done, Lars.  (This time you beat me to it, in record time.  So I reviewed in record time.  Call us the whiz kids.)]
