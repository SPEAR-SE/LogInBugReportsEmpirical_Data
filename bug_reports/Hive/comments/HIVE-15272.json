[And count is same., Just curious: what's the difference? Is that just a matter of ordering? Hive doesn't guarantee ordering w/o order by clause. MR may do that, but that's just a matter of implementation.

If there is a data issue, a complete repro case would be more helpful., I am just calculating count of the records, result (count) does not dependent on ordering.
Result should be same for each execution as in case of MR.

my_table1 (left) is having ~30 million records 
my_table2 (right) is having ~85 million records 
, [~VPareek] would you mind providing a repro case (data, ddl, and query)? Thanks., Query you can find in the issue description itself.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t1.region, t1.amount)
FROM my_db.my_table1 t1
LEFT OUTER
JOIN my_db.my_table2 t2 ON (t1.id = t2.id
                            AND t1.name = t2.name)

For DDL, 
region -> STRING
amount -> DECIMAL
name -> STRING
, cc: [~lirui], OK I'll look into this.
[~VPareek], I think the two tables have same DDL right? Do they contain same data? Could you upload some sample data that can reproduce the issue? Thanks!, As the amount field is a DECIMAL, it is very likely that HIVE-12768 is the root cause.]
