[The code that deals with YYYY is just [SimpleDateFormat|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html]. I think YYYY is not the same as yyyy. It has a special meaning as 'week in year'. 
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15916958/simpledateformat-producing-wrong-date-time-when-parsing-yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm], To be precise, according to the documentation, it's "Week year". "Week in year" is "w". The problem is that whole year "YYYY" was providing correct 2017 year and it changed to 2018 for 12/31/2017 only. There is no real explanation what "Week year" means. I assume, this is a year of last day of a week and as 12/31/2017 is Sunday, which is the first day of the week in USA. Thus "YYYY" returns a year for last day of the week which is 1/6/2018., I tried 
{noformat}
 long unixtime = 1514754599;
 SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("YYYY-MM-dd HH-mm-ss");
 formatter.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Europe/London"));
 Date date = new Date(unixtime * 1000L);
 System.out.println("date = " + formatter.format(date));
{noformat}
which gives output 
{noformat}
date = 2018-12-31 21-09-59
{noformat}
So it seems like the problem may be with SimpleDateFormat itself?
