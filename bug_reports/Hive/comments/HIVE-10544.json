[[~thejas] can you review this please? Looks like I missed this out as part of HIVE-9709 

Thanks
Hari, +1

[~sushanth] This is a critical fix for windows environment. I think we should try and get this in 1.2.0., Approved for 1.2.0 . Added to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+1.2+Release+Status, [~thejas] , [~sushanth] Can both of you please look at the changes in patch #2. Apparently, the changes in patch#1 does not suffice because of some issues with the existing beeline.cmd. I tested with patch#2 on Windows OS and we don't run into the issue mentioned in the jira.

Thanks
Hari, +1 for 2.patch
, [~thejas] Noticed sometime back that bin/beeline.cmd in the repo follows Windows convention for text file (i.e., M^ at the end of each line). So in order to apply the patch, you will need to do :

$ tr -d '\r' < bin/beeline.cmd  > temp; rm bin/beeline.cmd; mv temp bin/beeline.cmd
$ patch -p1 < HIVE-10544.2.patch

Thanks
Hari, Patch committed to 1.2 branch and trunk.
Thanks Hari!
