* [updated comment | https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6586?focusedCommentId=14053403&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14053403], This changes the default value of *hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size* in 0.14.0 so the wiki needs version information ... but first Configuration Properties needs to document the parameter with its original default value (0.13.0, HIVE-5425).

* [Configuration Properties | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties], *hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size* is documented in Configuration Properties with its change of default value in 0.14.0:

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
