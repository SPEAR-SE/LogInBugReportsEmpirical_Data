[Adds hadoop-client to dependencyManagement in parent pom and dependencies in the accumulo-storage pom. Verified that no old hadoop artifacts are in {{mvn dependency:tree}} and dist tarball no longer has old jars included in {{lib}}., [~vikram.dixit], could you please check this patch to see if this is okay? (It seems correct to me, but I also remember something about subcomponents having to depend on the right version of shims, and shims bringing in deps instead - I'm not sure if that changed),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12671310, (bump [~vikram.dixit]), Could you add the optional tag to the jar:

{noformat}
<optional>true</optional>
{noformat}, Do you need the changes in the main pom.xml?, bq. Could you add the optional tag to the jar:

Yeah, I can do that.

bq. Do you need the changes in the main pom.xml?

Declaring the version in dependencyManagement in the project pom is the proper place to do so. While, the way the two hadoop profiles are configured confuses that a little bit, it is the proper way to do so. If anything, I think the extra versions in the accumulo-handler/pom.xml are unnecessary, but I kept them there to follow suit with the other modules., +1. I'll commit it to both trunk and 0.14., v2 patch attached with {{optional}} added to hadoop-client dependency., Thanks, [~vikram.dixit]!, Committed to both trunk and branch 0.14. Thanks [~elserj]!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
