[(I know what the problem is, I don't have cycles to fix it right now :), [~sershe] and [~gopalv], could you please take a look? Thanks., +1. I wonder if the problem if having invalid thrift resulting in retries should also be handled, in this or separate jira

ATTACHMENT ID: 12746384 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sershe], could you please take a look? IMHO, I think the problem of invalid thrift can be handled in future, in a separate JIRA. Thanks., +1, [~sershe], the patch passed QA and I think it is ready to go. Thanks., committed to master and branch-1, Commit c2f5b3c5de4105a2008bf91da378a9581dbd6a89 put this in branch-1.2 so shouldn't the Fix Version/s include 1.2.2 now?, [~pxiong], versions 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 are already released, so any new commits to branch-1.2 will go into a future version 1.2.2.  That's why I think Fix Version/s should say 1.2.2 instead of 1.2.0., Now the Fix Version/s should include 1.0.2 as well (commit f1939cb5ad3e0a10736d986f3ed47b5577da2ef9).]
