[We could call the outputformat that work with old format as csv_deprecated, tsv_deprecated
, On second thoughts, from a user perspective, it would be preferrable to not have the applications consuming data break at all. ie, Keep "tsv" and "csv" as the deprecated formats, call the new format "tsv2" and "csv2" . Also, give a deprecation warning when "tsv" and "csv" are used.
, HIVE-8615.2.patch- Cleanup tests to remove the TEST_NAME param, and use MiniHS2, [~szehon] could you review this one since you reviewed HIVE-7390? Thx!!, +1.   Thanks Ferd for review and Thejas for the change !, [~vikram.dixit] I think this is an important backward compatibility that should be included in 0.14 .

ATTACHMENT ID: 12677510 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch committed to 0.14 branch and trunk.
Thanks for the reviews  [~Ferd] [~szehon] [~vgumashta], Doc note:  --outputformat needs to be revised, with release information, in the Beeline section of the HiveServer2 Clients wikidoc.

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline Command Options | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions], Hi Lefty, I revised that section, in addition added very short insert section to explain in more detail:
[https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Separated-ValueOutputFormats|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Separated-ValueOutputFormats].

The idea is there, but feel free to fix the format, wording if necessary.  Thanks., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, Good doc, [~szehon].  I just tinkered with it a little., [~kuczoram] improved the documentation (for HIVE-14632).
