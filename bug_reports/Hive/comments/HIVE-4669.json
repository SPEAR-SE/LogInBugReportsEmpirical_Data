[Ping :), [~shreepadma] this looks good, but is there a review board item for it?, Whats the motivation for this change? Why do we want to mane username available for semantic analyzer?, My apologies for not responding earlier. We need this for integrating Sentry with Hive.

, Is there anything else needed from my side?,

This message is automatically generated., I believe the test failure is unrelated. This is a trivial patch which doesn't impact any users of Hive so I am fine with committing it. However, I did notice that there is something funky with the patch. The first constructor which doesn't take a username argument sets the instance variable userName to what I presume is itself:

{noformat}
   public Driver(HiveConf conf) {
     this.conf = conf;
+    this.userName = userName;
+  }
{noformat}

Since we are fixing that, this constructor can be redirected through the first constructor. I understand it's nit-picky since it's a good practice and we are going to be modifying the patch again anyways, let's do that.
{noformat}
+  public Driver(HiveConf conf, String userName) {
+    this.conf = conf;
+    this.userName = userName;
   }
{noformat}, Attached a new patch with the changes. Not sure if we'd have had to modify the patch except to remove {noformat} this.userName = userName {noformat} from Driver.java.
, Hi,

Very sorry I wasn't clear, I mean the second constructor should use the first. Example below. This is pretty minor issue though and it certainly wouldn't be the worst offender in hive by any stretch of the imagination! :) So no need to update the patch.

{noformat}
  public Driver(HiveConf conf, String userName) {
     this.conf = conf;
   }
  public Driver(HiveConf conf, String userName) {
    this(conf);
    this.userName = userName;
   }
{noformat}, Whoops that should have been

{noformat}
  public Driver(HiveConf conf) {
     this.conf = conf;
   }
  public Driver(HiveConf conf, String userName) {
    this(conf);
    this.userName = userName;
   }
{noformat}, No worries. Let's make sure the new code is clean. Uploaded a new patch.,
