ATTACHMENT ID: 12657966, I don't think there's much chance that those test failures were caused by the patch because it is so small. Is it normal to have test failures in trunk?, +1

They are flaky...

6000 tests * (1/10 of 1% probability of failing) = 6 tests., Thank you to Matt Martin for the fix and Ryan Blue for the rebase to trunk! I have committed this to trunk., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
