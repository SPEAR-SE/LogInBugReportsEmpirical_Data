[Copying from HIVE-3833.
Can you provide me a complete testcase ? I will take a look., Attached a .q test., Namit, thanks for taking a look at this one. Feels like serdeProperties are not available to serde at initialization time for partitioned tables. This looks like a regression. We should prioritize this., Any update on this? Was it resolved in other JIRA? 
Looks like it will break multiple scenarios.
, Changing status to blocker since this, if not fixed before release, will cause all kinds of havoc with Avro., I've made changes so that deserializers/object inspectors are initialized with the union of the table properties and partition properties, with partition properties overriding table properties. All the "partition_wise_fileformat*.q" tests have passed., cloudera's CDH4.3 which include hive 0.10.0 has the same issue.
Selecting partitioned Avro table data fails., Thanks [~mwagner] for taking a look. Can you create phabricator or RB entry for this, its easier to provide feedback via those., Sure thing. I've created https://reviews.apache.org/r/11632/, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Mark!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2157 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2157/])
