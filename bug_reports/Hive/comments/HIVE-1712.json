[Tracked down the issue to the SERDE_PARAMS table which in the mysql create statement has  `PARAM_VALUE` default NULL.  The values that are saved to the db when hive loads the data are blank, when exported from derby they are blank in the csv, and when imported into mysql are defaulted to NULL. This NULL value when picked up by MetaStoreUtils is not being caught and causes the NullPointerException, bug is is in the jdo.  issue is that schema in meatadatautils is a java properties which extends from a hashtable which doesnt allow null values in map. So when the map from the db is added to the schema with putall() it gets the NullPointerException. This would occur for any item that is a map type in the jdo (serde_params, sd_params, partition_params, table_params), This will replace a null valued key from the parameter map with a empty string when adding it to the schema properties. Fixes the Error in semantic analysis: java.lang.NullPointerException. May also be beneficial to look at adding allow-nulls="false" default-value="" to the jdo map types to prevent this case from occuring on an import from derby., @Paul, can you take a look ?, That there were some updates/cleanup of that section in MetaStoreUtils and the patch no longer applies cleanly. Could you regenerate the patch?, rebase of patch against trunk r1032602, Patch rebased against trunk r1032602, +1 looks good, will test/commit, Committed. Thanks Jake! We'll add you as a contributor so we can assign this issue to you.]
