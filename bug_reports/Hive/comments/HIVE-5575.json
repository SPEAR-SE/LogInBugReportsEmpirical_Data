[chenchun requested code review of "HIVE-5575 [jira] ZooKeeper connection closed when unlock with retry".

Reviewers: JIRA

See the attachment, I have encountered a scenario that hive retries to  unlock all locks, but zookeeper session is closed. If there are hundreds of locks, say dynamic partition, the process will hang up for several days.
