[3.0.0 is already released therefore removed the Fix Version. , The patch looks good to me, although I have limited understanding of this part of the code. Perhaps [~vgarg] or [~ashutoshc] could take a look too? This issue doesn't affect so the patch needs to be committed only in branch-2 and branch-3. Can you please provide a patch for those branches? The patch naming convention should be HIVE-20843.1-branch-3.patch, Thanks [~vihangk1] . Added patch for branch-2. The latest version 3 release doesn't have the bug. , LGTM +1, Lets wait for tests to come back (although given the backlog it may take a while)]
