[Attaching a patch for review that changes the affected column datatypes from int to bigint., +1, One missing piece, we should make these same changes to hive-txn-schema-0.13, for completeness.  I can do that when I check in the patch., I left that out as the composite hive-schema-0.14.0.mssql.sql includes those tables., Patch checked in.  I did not change hive-txn-schema-0.13.  , Thanks [~alangates] for the review and commit!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
