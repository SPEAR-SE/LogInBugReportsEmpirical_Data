[Mapper script can write to stderr to avoid the killing.

Alternatively, you can do the following to achieve the same result:

{code}
set hive.script.auto.progress=true;
{code}
, setting

  set hive.script.auto.progress=true;

seems to have no effect.  Aside from the job succeeding (it doesn't), what effect should I be able to measure (in order to see if this is doing anything)?]
