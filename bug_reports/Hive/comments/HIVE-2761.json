[We're not managing javaewah with Ivy because it's not available from any of the public Maven repos (as far as I know).
, Looking at http://code.google.com/p/javaewah/ it seems its now available via maven., That is correct. We upgraded the version of JavaEWAH to 0.3.1 when we posted it to the Maven central repository. Version 0.3.2 is simply a revision of the documentation (I corrected a few typos in the comments). 

You should be able to call on JavaEWAH as a dependency in the following manner:

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.googlecode.javaewah</groupId>
        <artifactId>JavaEWAH</artifactId>
        <version>0.3.2</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

The upgrade from 0.3.0 to 0.3.2 should be harmless.

  Jar in SVN bad. Jar from maven good.

  After HIVE-2391 it is retrieved from maven repo via ivy, we can get rid of it from our lib/
