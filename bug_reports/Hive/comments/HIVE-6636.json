[Looks good except:

- You're setting the var to "", I think that means that your null check won't catch that the var wasn't set and you really catch it only in the fs.status call. Why not set it to null in the first place?
- You should update the hive-default.xml.template too, 1 - last-minute change, will fix; 2 - will do, 1 actually I'm passing the default explicitly:
+    String hdfsDirPathStr = HiveConf.getVar(conf, HiveConf.ConfVars.HIVE_JAR_DIRECTORY, null);
, Passing the default means that if the conf doesn't have it return null. But you set it explicitely in HiveConf. So that will never trigger. At least that's my understanding., i think it works the other way around, overriding the default default; anyway I can change it, ugh. you're right. it does replace the default value. +1, committed to trunk and 0.13 branch, Documented in the wiki:
