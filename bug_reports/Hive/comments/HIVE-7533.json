ATTACHMENT ID: 12659630, +1, HIVE-7533.3.patch - Updated patch file for newly added tests . , Patch committed to trunk. Thanks for the review Jason!
, This appears to have broken the build. Can you guys please fix or revert?, Looks like this has broken the build. One of the test files committed in a recent patch fails to compile. 
I had run only the auth*.q tests to validate, and had not run the ql/ dir tests.
Will fix in few minutes.
, I had missed doing an 'svn rm' . Thats done now, and build should work.
, Does this need any user documentation?, Thanks for asking Lefty!
Yes, it would be good to document this. I have created HIVE-7759 to track that work. I will work on that., Okay, then I'll put the TODOC14 label on HIVE-7759 instead of here.  Thanks Thejas., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
