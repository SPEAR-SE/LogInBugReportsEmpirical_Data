[The problem is actually not with the space, but with the ":".

In URI, ":" is treated specially, and we won't be able to support ":" without changing hadoop code.
, We can actually still do it, by escaping the key and value before creating the directory name.
, This should apply to both branch-0.4 and trunk.
, HIVE-883.2.patch: the test case drops the table at the end now., we need to support decode (ie. get the partition key values from hdfs path name). check Warehouse.mapeSpecFromName(). This is used while partition pruning and also in 'msck repair' whose patch is pending.

, ignore my comment above. this patch does contain decode() as well.

.bq
// NOTE: This is for generating the internal path name for partitions. Users
// should always use the MetaStore API to get the path name for a partition.
// Users should not directly take partition values and turn it into a path 
// name by themselves, because the logic below may change in the future.

lot of people already do this conversion currently. i suppose this doesn't affect as long as their partitions do not contain these special characters.

let's keep this open for few days to see if any one has concerns., also, can you add describe partition in the test?, Added "describe extended", HIVE-883.4.patch: This one fixes compilation error with hadoop 0.17, and also fixes the unit tests., committed in 0.4, Committed. Thanks Zheng]
