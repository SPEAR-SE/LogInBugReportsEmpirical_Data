ATTACHMENT ID: 12852931 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Hi [~vgumashta],

The better logging is really needed here! Thanks for the patch!
I have taken a cursory look at the patch and have 1 concern only, that by printing out the URL into the logs we might start to print out usernames and passwords too. 
Am I too cautious here?

Thanks,
Peter, [~pvary] Thanks for reviewing. That's a valid concern. We could anonymize the username-password before printing if they're present in connection url. I'll incorporate the change in v2.,
