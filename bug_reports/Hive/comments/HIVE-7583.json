[If using FileSystem.access() to check file access for a user other than the current user, the current user will need to impersonate the user using doAs().  [~thejas] has also pointed out that the file checks done in standard SQL authorization should also have been doing doAs() for the checks it's doing, but currently does not.  Will also address this issue here., initial patch, RB at https://reviews.apache.org/r/24170/, Patch v2 based on review feedback., +1, re-uploading patch to run pre-commit tests.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12659921, Looks like all of these test failures have also shown up in some of the other precommit test runs, I don't think they are related to this patch. Will commit this later., Committed to trunk. Thanks for review Thejas!, This jira adds ACL support for Storage Based Authorization, marking HIVE-7714 as duplicate., When 0.14.0 is released, update this note in HCatalog Authorization:

{quote}
Note: Support for HDFS ACL (introduced in Apache Hadoop 2.4) is not available in the released versions of Hive.  Which means, that it checks only the traditional rwx style permissions to determine if a user can write to the file system. The support for ACL is available in Hive trunk HIVE-7583, which will be available in Hive 0.14.

* [HCatalog Authorization | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+Authorization], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
