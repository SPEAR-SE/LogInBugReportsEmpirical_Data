[I've attached a patch which reproduce the issue. Though there are no test failures, since the code falls back on ORM. But we can see the exception (I've added in the description) in the logs. 

We can apply the patch and run the following command.
{noformat}
mvn clean test -Dtest=TestEmbeddedHiveMetaStore -Phadoop-2
{noformat}

Then check the logs in {{itests/hive-unit/target/tmp/log/hive.log}}, we can see the exception reproduced., Attaching patch with unit test.
The patch makes the DirectSql code consistent with the ORM layer., 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:
