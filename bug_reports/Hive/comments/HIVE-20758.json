Instead of calling each and every time it will be good to add metastore api to return all constraints given a table, bq. This will require calling metastore for all constraints (Default, pk/fk, Check, Not null, Unique).

This is not a particularly performance sensitive operation, so that would still be fine (because "desc formatted" wasn't very slow).
