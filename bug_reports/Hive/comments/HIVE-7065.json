[update based on feedback from @Thejas, +1, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks for the contribution Eugene!
, This looks like it should be documented in the wiki:

* [WebHCat Configuration -- Configuration Variables | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Configure#WebHCatConfigure-ConfigurationVariables]

{quote}
*templeton.hive.properties* -- Properties to set when running Hive. To use it in a cluster with Kerberos security enabled, set hive.metastore.sasl.enabled=false and add hive.metastore.execute.setugi=true. Using localhost in metastore uri does not work with Kerberos security.
{quote}

Revise as "Properties to set when running Hive (during job sumission)" or perhaps that should be "Properties set (during job submission) when running Hive."

Should hive.execution.engine be mentioned for releases prior to 0.14?, Seemed caused fail of org.apache.hive.hcatalog.templeton.tool.TestTempletonUtils.testPropertiesParsing. Why no-precommit-test if it's not tested?, good point, this should have pre-commit tests
, [~leftylev] Is there a way to make this table in the wiki be autogenerated from the webhcat-default.xml?  It would ensure there is a single source of truth. Tez was shipped in 0.13, so yes I think hive.execution.engine can be mentioned for 0.13., java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal escaped string hive.some.fake.path=C:\foo\bar.txt\ unescaped \

  at org.apache.hive.hcatalog.templeton.tool.TestTempletonUtils.testPropertiesParsing(TestTempletonUtils.java:308), What's strange is that that is the test added for this this ticket., [~eugene.koifman], I don't know if there's a way to autogenerate wiki docs from xml files, but it would certainly be useful for Hive configs as well as WebHCat.

Confluence has this documentation with links to various possibilities:  [Importing Content into Confluence -- Importing other non-wiki content | https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Importing+Content+Into+Confluence#ImportingContentIntoConfluence-Importingothernon-wikicontent].

So we can follow those links and see if there's an easy way to autogenerate wikidocs, but I won't have much time for the research until I whittle down my backlog of 0.13 doc tasks.

In the meantime, to get a single source of truth I suggest adding a comparison of webhcat-default.xml vs. wikidoc to the release checklist.  Unlike Hive, WebHCat doesn't have a huge number of parameters so manually fixing the wiki for each release wouldn't be difficult., [~thejas] [~ekoifman] Hi, are we filing a JIRA to fix the broken test TestTempletonUtils?  It is still failing on trunk., I'm looking at it now.  Will make changes in this ticket, HIVE-7065.2.patch is an ADDITIONAL patch to fix  the regression.,
