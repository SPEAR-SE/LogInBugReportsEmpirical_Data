[LATER VIEW doesn't work with UNION ALL too.
query NO.1:
 SELECT
     1 as from_pid,
     1 as to_pid,
     cid as from_path,
     (CASE WHEN pid=0 THEN cid ELSE pid END) as to_path,
     0 as status
FROM
    (SELECT union_map(c_map) AS c_map
     FROM
         (SELECT collect_map(id,parent_id)AS c_map
          FROM
          wl_channels
          GROUP BY id,parent_id
          )tmp
    )tmp2
LATERAL VIEW recursion_concat(c_map) a AS cid, pid

this query returns about 10000 rows ,and there status is 0.

query NO.2:
 select
  a.from_pid as from_pid,
  a.to_pid as to_pid, 
  a.from_path as from_path,
  a.to_path as to_path,
  a.status as status
from wl_dc_channels a
  where a.status <> 0

this query returns about 100 rows ,and there status is 1 or 2.

query NO.3:
select
  from_pid,
  to_pid,
  from_path,
  to_path,
  status
 from
(
 SELECT
     1 as from_pid,
     1 as to_pid,
     cid as from_path,
     (CASE WHEN pid=0 THEN cid ELSE pid END) as to_path,
     0 as status
FROM
    (SELECT union_map(c_map) AS c_map
     FROM
         (SELECT collect_map(id,parent_id)AS c_map
          FROM
          wl_channels
          GROUP BY id,parent_id
          )tmp
    )tmp2
LATERAL VIEW recursion_concat(c_map) a AS cid, pid
union all
 select
  a.from_pid as from_pid,
  a.to_pid as to_pid, 
  a.from_path as from_path,
  a.to_path as to_path,
  a.status as status
from wl_dc_channels a
  where a.status <> 0
) unin_tbl

this query has the same result as query NO.2, [~cyril.liao] can you create a separate JIRA for the above please? , ok]
