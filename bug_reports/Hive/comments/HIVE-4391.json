[whereas following non-windowing functions with CTAS succeeds
create table t3 as select *, if(c1>10,10,0) from t2; 
create table t4 as select *, c1*2 from t2;  , The failure is because the Table defn contains the following FieldSchema:
  FieldSchema(name:(tok_function rank tok_windowspec), type:int, comment:null)

fails in the name validation check: MetastoreUtils::validateName

Investigating why this extra Field is added (there is a FieldSchema for rr), [~rhbutani] Try with patch on HIVE-4392 that improves things and has a same bug irrespective of windowing functions., HIVE-4392 indeed fixes this issue. Marking this as duplicate of that., [~ashutoshc] thanks for resolving this.]
