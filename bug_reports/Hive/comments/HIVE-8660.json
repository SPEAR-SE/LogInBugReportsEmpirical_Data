ATTACHMENT ID: 12678021 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to both., No doc needed, unless we want to call attention to this 0.13.0 bug.

The new description of *hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist* (HIVE-8534) tells users to find the list of default values with "set <param>" so the full list, including *hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode*, can be removed from the wiki.

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
