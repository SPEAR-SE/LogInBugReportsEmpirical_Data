[[~jpullokkaran], this does not seem as simple as I thought...

First problem is that in Calcite the only operator that can prune columns is Project. In contrast, in Hive there are other operators that are capable of pruning columns e.g. Join operator. Thus, we need to cover those operators in the simplified ColumnPruner or we will end up with operators producing more columns than they need.

Another problem is that ColumnPruner is the responsible of removing some Select operators if their columns are not read by follow-up operators. We could not remove those Select operators before, as they are introduced by the Hive plan generation or other optimizations.

Thus, not sure if we will be able to include this in 2.0.0., Is it a big perf gain?, It does not need to be included in 2.0.0. More work needs to be done...]
