[Patch for all DBs except Derby (there's no IF NOT EXISTS syntax in derby and nobody probably uses upgrade with derby anyway), [~ashutoshc] can you review? thanks, For MS-SQL, COLUMN_NAME & TABLE_NAME are in double quotes, whereas rest of column names are not. That looks inconsistent, is it intentional ?, Table definition was c/p-ed from the schema script, cc: [~xiaobingo] who might know more. Any comments for MS-SQL scripts ?, +1 unless [~xiaobingo] has some feedback for MS-SQL script., +1. Just tested mssql script, it works fine. Actually ''identifier_name'' or [identifier_name] both are fine. They deals with those id with empty spaces in the middle, e.g. ''identifier name'' or [identifier name].,
