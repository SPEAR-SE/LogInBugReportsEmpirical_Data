I didn't see a way to expressly check the runtime environment in a way that would reflect this change. Any suggestions? , {quote}

The only connection to HCatalog code I can find in the failed tests is itests' {{WarehouseInstance}} makes use of:

{code}
import org.apache.hive.hcatalog.api.repl.ReplicationV1CompatRule;
import org.apache.hive.hcatalog.listener.DbNotificationListener;
{code}

looking at those classes I have a hard time guessing how HBase classpath changes could reasonably impact them.

Is there an existing automated tool to get a rerun of just the failed tests? Or perhaps just batchId 240, since it seems like that one failed due to {{TestReplicationScenariosAcidTables}} hanging?, [~busbey] can you re-attach the patch with a new name, e.g. {{HIVE-20077.1.patch}}? Hive QA has been very flaky recently so the test failures are probably not related to your patch, however, it would be best to get a clean run of Hive QA before merging this., -v1
