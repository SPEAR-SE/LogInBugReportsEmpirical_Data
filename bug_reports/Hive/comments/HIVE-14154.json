[This is a usability bug - the VectorizedOrcInputFormat is not a complete general purpose input format.

Possible fix would be to disallow creating tables with that as a the input format. 

Creating tables "STORED AS ORC" should never do that, however the planner will inject this if the query can be vectorized., Any hint about which classes I should look into?]
