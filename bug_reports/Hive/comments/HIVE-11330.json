ATTACHMENT ID: 12746390 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The recursion protection works well with an AND expr, but it doesn't work against 

(OR a=1 (OR a=2 (OR a=3 (OR ...)

since the for the rows will never be reduced during recursion due to the nature of the OR. 

We need to execute a short-circuit to satisfy the OR properly - no case which matches a=1 qualifies for the rest of the filters.

Recursion should pass in the numRows - branch1Rows for the branch-2., [~prasanth_j]: To narrow the filter clause for OR, you need to narrow the cardinality for the deep branch

(OR A (OR B C))

needs to do 

set(U, =A) OR set(U – A, =B) OR set(U – (A + B), =C), Patch committed to master, branch-1. Thanks [~prasanth_j]]
