[Most probably the fix should validate a query and prevent executing query having filter predicate in "join on", Actually the result below is correct - all tt1 filters in "join on" should be ignored
hive> select * from tt1 left outer join tt2 on (tt1.c1 = tt2.c1 and tt1.c1 <= 2);
1	1
2	2
3	NULL
4	NULL]
