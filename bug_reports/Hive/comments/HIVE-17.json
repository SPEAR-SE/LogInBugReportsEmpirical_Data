[I'm still not sure if the multiple entries are intentional, but this patch removes the hive.metastore.uris property with the "thift://" value., +1

This is clearly incorrect though it would not cause major problems as most deployments would overwrite this in hive-site.xml.

Can you run the tests with these changes

ant -lib testlibs clean-test test

and submit the output.

Also please do a submit on the patch and we will pick it up.

Thanks., submitted patch., I just committed this. Thanks Jeff!]
