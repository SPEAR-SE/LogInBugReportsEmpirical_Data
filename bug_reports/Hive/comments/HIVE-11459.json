[[~jcamachorodriguez] I wonder this will no longer be an issue given HIVE-14022, Indeed, it seems the same kind of issue. I will double-check and update the JIRA case., In fact, query should fail now because _c1_ and _c0_ belong to the right table. To clarify, from the documentation:

{quote}
The restrictions of using LEFT SEMI JOIN is that the right-hand-side table should only be referenced in the join condition (ON-clause), but not in WHERE- or SELECT-clauses etc.

The following query should compile:

{code:sql}
select * from tmp2 left semi join tmp1 on c1 = id and c0 = q
{code}, Thanks Jesus for verifying.]
