[[~prasanth_j] [~owen.omalley] fyi, Looks like vectorization issue
{code}
Unsuported vector output type: StringGroup
{code}

[~mmccline] fyi.., There is HIVE-8886 "Some Vectorized String CONCAT expressions result in runtime error Vectorization: Unsuported vector output type: StringGroup" that was fixed in trunk (at least).  Could be the same issue., The error is occurring in ~ql.exec.vector.VectorColumnSetInfo.addKey which uses VectorizationContext.isStringFamily which was fixed to use string_family and the rest of the code fixed to use "string_family" and not "StringGroup"., Commit date into trunk is December 9th, 2014.  Tagged as in release-1.1.0 branch, too.  Please ask Hortonworks about where the fix is available via its supported releases.  Thanks.]
