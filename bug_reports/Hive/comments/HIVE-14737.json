[I have looked into this and the problem is the following code in the situation of hive.server2.webui.use.spenego being set to false in a secure cluster. 

[Code Link|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/common/src/java/org/apache/hive/http/AdminAuthorizedServlet.java#L39] 

{code}
  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
    // Do the authorization
    if (HttpServer.hasAdministratorAccess(getServletContext(), request,
        response)) {
      // Authorization is done. Just call super.
      super.doGet(request, response);
{code}

In a secure cluster HttpServer.hasAdministratorAccess will always evaluate false because of HADOOP_SECURITY_AUTHORIZATION. The code can be seen below. 

[Code Link|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/common/src/java/org/apache/hive/http/HttpServer.java#L259]

{code}
  static boolean hasAdministratorAccess(
      ServletContext servletContext, HttpServletRequest request,
      HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
    Configuration conf =
        (Configuration) servletContext.getAttribute(CONF_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE);
    // If there is no authorization, anybody has administrator access.
    if (!conf.getBoolean(
        CommonConfigurationKeys.HADOOP_SECURITY_AUTHORIZATION, false)) {
      return true;
    }
{code}

I am fairly certain if HttpServer.hasAdministratorAccess is changed to HttpServer. isInstrumentationAccessAllowed this would work without issue. I am looking into the implications of making this change. ]
