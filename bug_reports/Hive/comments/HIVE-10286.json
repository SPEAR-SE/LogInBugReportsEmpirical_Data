[Here are some of the corner cases I noticed with the raw types.

For instance a Decimal column with values (min : 9.0, max : 99.0) when searched with "11" (as string) should not do min.toString(), max.toString() for any comparisons (particularly for -ve numbers).

The missing type conversions for any predicate literal can cause hash misses in the bloom filter.

While evaluating <double-col> IN (1, 2.2), you cannot use the Long hashCode for the first predicate when checking the bloom filter.

When evaluating Date and Timestamp columns, while they might be stored as Long inside the stats implementation, they hold vastly different semantic data - days since 1970 & milliseconds since 1970.

Those are a few of the corner cases to test/confirm.

The good part about all these is that we can return YES_NO_NULL for all cases where we can't produce any reduction., This patch builds upon [~gopalv]'s initial patch. Added some more type conversions based on PrimitiveObjectInspectorUtils., Attaching RB,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12728505 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Added changes for HIVE-10504 along with this patch as PPD is broken already for date case. , I will go over the test cases again to make sure the changes are correct., Added comments in the RB for all the test case changes to make the review easy :)

[~gopalv] FYI.., Added more tests to cover all branches in predicate evaluation. ,
