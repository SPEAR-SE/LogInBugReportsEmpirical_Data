[Patch for the conf file., So even though these settings didn't have an effect, it didn't matter because those values are the defaults.

Also, about datanucleus.cache.level2 - I don't see this option in http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/persistence_properties.html
Maybe we can remove it?, Right, looks like it has been replaced by setting

datanucleus.cache.level2.type=none
, Canceling patch since it needs another change per Paul's comments., Paul, can you take over on this one and update the description field on level2.type to include NONE?, Actually datanucleus.cache.level2 option was removed in 1.1.4. Hive is currently packaged with datanucleus-core-1.1.2 so we should keep that option.

I changed the default to false as there are cases where we change the metadata outside of hive metastore. Plus, changing it to false keeps it at the same configuration as before. , Committed. Thanks Paul and John!]
