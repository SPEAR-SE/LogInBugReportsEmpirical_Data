[ACCUMULO-2815 in Accumulo-1.7.0 added some support for client authentication with Kerberos-enabled in Accumulo. As such, some assumptions like sending a PasswordToken to authenticate with Accumulo isn't valid anymore.

Need to try to add enough options to make this work while trying to maintain backwards compatibility with Accumulo-1.6.x which lacks the feature., Fixes the AccumuloStorageHandler to work with Kerberos. Lots of reflection to make sure that older versions of Accumulo continue to work with the storage handler as the Kerberos support is only in the most recent version.

Some basic unit testing, lots of testing on a secured cluster.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12736390 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Doesn't appear to me that the test failures are related., Running some more tests and I found some bugs with the current patch. Will work through them and attach a new patch soon., v2. Forgot that configureJobConf might get called multiple times and that the Accumulo mapred libs don't it when things are configured twice. Added a catch like is already present in InputFormat and OutputFormat.,

I don't know enough about Accumulo to "know" that the patch does fix the issue, but the code makes sense, if it works the way it reads, and I see that this does not negatively impact the backward compatible case, and does not negatively impact hive. Also, the relevant .q and unit tests all succeed., Committed to master and branch-1.2.

Thanks, Josh!, Thanks so much for the review [~sushanth]! I know these changes are a little obtuse for Hive -- I greatly appreciate the effort., (Also committed to branch-1, forgot earlier)]
