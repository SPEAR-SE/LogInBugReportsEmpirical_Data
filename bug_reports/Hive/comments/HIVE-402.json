[1. Can you remove   LOG.warn("here please"); from evaluate 
2. Do you want to make the last parameter extractIndex optional ?

Otherwise, it looks good. 
Do we need to backport it in branch 3 also ?, - removed warn message
- made third argument optional
- it would be good to backport to 0.3 since i need to use this method, but its not critical, +1

looks good - will run tests and commit if tests pass, Committed. Thanks Raghu]
