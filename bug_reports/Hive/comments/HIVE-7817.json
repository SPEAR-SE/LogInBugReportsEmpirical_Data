[[~ekoifman] This seems like a major outage or is this a new feature request? Has this worked in an earlier version of hive say 0.13? If so can you please mark this as a blocker for 0.14.

Thanks
Vikram., I don't know if this ever worked.  I ran into this by accident while trying to test something else in 0.14., by the way, i do not think hive-3108 is ever solved., I just verified this with both Hive 0.13 and Hive 0.14 (1.0) and the behaviour is the same, i.e. SELECT DISTINCT partitionColumn FROM table does not work.]
