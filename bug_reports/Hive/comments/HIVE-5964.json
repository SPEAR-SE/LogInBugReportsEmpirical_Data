[Thanks for reporting this issue. "" t2.name='c' " missing is certainly a bug. I verified that this happens with hive 0.12 as well . 
 "t3.id='a' " happening before the join looks fine, that can be pushed since this is an inner join.
, I didn't checked exactly, but HIVE-4293 is seemingly fixing this issue.
