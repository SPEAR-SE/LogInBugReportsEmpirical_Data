[Patch is based off trunk, r1479992, Updating patch filename to match the submitter guidelines in the wiki, Can I get a code review, please? Thanks!, We should also update the corresponding java.sql.Types mapping in service/src/java/org/apache/hive/service/cli/Type.java. I think following makes sense:
* ARRAY => java.sql.Types.ARRAY
* MAP => java.sql.Types.JAVA_OBJECT
* STRUCT => java.sql.Types.STRUCT
* UNION => java.sql.Types.OTHER
* USER_DEFINED_TYPES => java.sql.Types.OTHER, Addressed comments. [~ashutoshc], could you check this?, Implemented HIVE-3015 also in this., +1 Looks like Hive QA didn't trigger., 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass
