The Apache Accumulo project has written a nice doc on git use
recommendations for their project based on experiences in Accumulo and
a similar Kafka document -
http://accumulo.apache.org/git.html. It describes the options for
committing feature branches as well. I propose using that as the
current hive git usage recommendation for now (until we feel a need to
do things differently).

I think we should update
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute page
to include this link. Any volunteers ?
