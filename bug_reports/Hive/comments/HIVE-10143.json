ATTACHMENT ID: 12708211 - PreCommit-HIVE-SPARK-Build, I took a quick look at the test logs and they don't seem related to the code being changed (as in, the spark driver is connecting fine to HS2)., That's correct. These failures are known, captured in HIVE-10134. Please ignore for now., Committed to spark branch.  Thanks Marcelo, Closing jiras fixed in 1.2.0 release . 
Please open new jira if you find any related issue.
