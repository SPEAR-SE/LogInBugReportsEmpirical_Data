ATTACHMENT ID: 12802547 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, The tests that failed look to be unrelated. All the tests that failed had also failed in the Jenkins build before this one, see [http://ec2-54-177-240-2.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/job/PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build/205/console]. To double check, I rerun the failed unit tests to verify this patch did not introduce failures. I noticed some of them are now fixed on latest-pulled master with my patch applied to it. Note the change itself is isolated to change implementations of JavaDataModel#get making it thread safe, it should not change behavior as the added unit tests show.
, [~ashutoshc], would have a moment to take a look at this patch? It is fixing another thread safety for parallel compilation. Thank you!, Please use slf4j Logger instead of apache-commons Log. Otherwise, patch looks good. 
Have you seen issues because of this static method in parallel compilation? If so, how it manifested or is it just a preemptive patch., Yeah, I should be using SLF4J. I will correct and post an updated patch. This is a preemptive patch found by doing static analysis on the code path for Driver#compile., Attached updated patch with fix to use SLF4J logger., +1, Pushed to master.]
