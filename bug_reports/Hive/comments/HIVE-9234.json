[cc [~thejas] Patch based on trunk. Will attach one for 14.1 as well. [~vikram.dixit] Can we include this in 14.1? Without fs caching, there is significant performance loss.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12692020 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failure unrelated. Patch committed to trunk and 14.1. Thanks for reviewing [~thejas] and [~brocknoland]., Hey guys, I don't actually see the leak fix unless acquire throws some kind of exception? Can you elaborate on:

bq. call closeAllForUGI at the right place.

?, The leak was in FileSystem.CACHE, it would keep growing. The Key in the CACHE includes UGI object. To clear the entries in CACHE corresponding to the UGI object, closeAllForUGI should be called once the UGI is no longer going to be used. 
The fix is in changing the sequence - to do ShimLoader.getHadoopShims().closeAllForUGI(sessionUgi) as the final step of HiveSessionImplwithUGI.close, after super.close().  super.close() was indirectly adding another entry into the CACHE.
, Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
