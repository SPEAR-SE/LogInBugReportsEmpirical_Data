ATTACHMENT ID: 12619170, Today the hive-var is broken because of the following:

1. Beeline constructs jdbc url fragment of hive-var with '&' delimiter
2. JDBC uses ';' delimiter to parse this hive-var fragment.

Original patch had changed JDBC parsing regex (part 2) to expect '&'.  But some test cases were manually constructing JDBC url's with ';' as delimiter and checking the parsing works on that.  One option is the change the test, which should be fine for JDBC URL backward-compatibility as this is new feature for 0.13.

But still I decided to minimize the impact and choose an alternate fix (part 1), so that beeline constructs URL fragment with ';' delimiter.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12619206, [~szehon], I believe this (with '&' as separator) used to work fine. Do you know what change broke this?

TestBeelineWithArgs used to pass also. I think it makes sense to fix it and include it in the test suite?, In addition, please add a test case if it's not already in TestBeelineWithArgs., I don't see any immediate changes.  Do you remember if the parsing used to expect '&' character?   I believe that would be the only way it would have worked, but I guess there was never a unit test for this case.

I will take a look at effort to move the test to /itests/hive-unit , there are a few tests about null as empty string that seem broken when I ran it, I will have to take a look., V3 of the patch has the additional change.

Moved the TestBeeLineWithArgs under /itests where it is run.  Added a unit test "testBeelineMultiHiveVariable" for the case of multiple hivevars.,
