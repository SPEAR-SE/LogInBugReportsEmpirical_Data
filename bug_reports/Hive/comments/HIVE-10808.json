[NullStructSerDeObjectInspector extends StructObjectInspector yet the Category for this inspector is set to PRIMITIVE, it should be STRUCT instead. This causes the ClassCastException because ObjectInspectorUtils blindly casts it to PrimitiveObjectInspector if the Category is PRIMITIVE., [~ngangam] We would probably need to have some tests attached to this patch as well.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12734978 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~swarnim] Agreed. However, we received this stack trace from a customer that can no longer reproduce the issue( their infra underwent some changes/upgrades). We have not been able to reproduce this using a test dataset. If I am able to reproduce this more consistently, I can create a unit test for this. Fair?, Sounds great. Easier to review patches with tests on it which guarantee that the patch actually works ;), This issue can be reproduced very consistently in Hive 0.13 (Havent tried hive 0.14) using the following reproducer.
{code}
create table test_part (a int) partitioned by (num int, part2 int);
alter table test_part add partition (num=201501, part2=0);
alter table test_part add partition (num=201501, part2=1);
alter table test_part add partition (num=201501, part2=2);
select num from test_part a inner join (select max (num) as dt from test_part where num<201501) b on a.num=b.dt;
{code}
Its important that the table/partition has no data in it.

The stacktrace appears in the hive.log. I have verfied that the fix in the proposed patch resolves the issue. In Hive 1.1+, I cannot reproduce this issue. Some other fix is either masking the issue or bypassing it. 
Inspecting the code, I think the issue is a bit obvious. Would this be enough to have this committed? Thanks, +1, Pushed to master. Thanks, Naveen!, Thank you [~ashutoshc] .. appreciate it.]
