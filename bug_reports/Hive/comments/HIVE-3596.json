It's also worth pointing out that previously we created a single copy of hive-default that was used by all HiveConf instances, but with this patch in place we create a new hive-default file for each HiveConf instance. Roughly speaking this means that we end up creating at least one new hive-default file for each statement that is executed., Good catch Carl -- I believe when I tested my rm of the data files required confirmation and perhaps I did not say "yes." 

Deeper digging the issue, will update when I have a clear option. , @Chris: Turns out that Kevin has been working on this same problem in HIVE-3709. He was able to get a little bit farther, but his solution seems to have some concurrency issues. If you have time it may be worth looking at his solution and seeing if you can spot threading problem., Resolving this is a duplicate of HIVE-3709., This issue is fixed and released as part of 0.10.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
