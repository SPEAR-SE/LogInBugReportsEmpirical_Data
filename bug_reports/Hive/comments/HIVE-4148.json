[A pure-red diff! Nothing better than removing code. Thanks Gunther for doing this. Apart from refactoring this will help in some speedup in compilation as well. 
+1 Running tests. Will commit if tests pass. , Committed to trunk. Thanks, Gunther!, Nice! Nothing like a patch that is entire deletes :), Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2013 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2013/])

, This patch is causing the build to fail on my machine.
I created HIVE-4187 to track this problem and assigned
it to Gunther.

I am able to fix the failure by adding antlr and antlr-runtime
back to ql/ivy.xml.

I think we should consider reverting this patch for the following
reasons:

* It makes maintenance harder since it converts explicit dependencies into transitive ones. For example, hive-exec has a direct compile-time dependency on the antlr parser generator, but it now relies on a transitive dependency via hive-metastore in order to satisfy this. This is also brittle since it means that hive-exec will break if the antlr dependency is removed from metastore/ivy.xml.
* I don't see any performance improvement with this change in place. I tried doing a fresh build several times with and without HIVE-4148, and the version without HIVE-4148 often finishes a couple seconds faster. This is pretty much what you would expect since Ivy should be using its local cache to resolve most of these dependencies.
