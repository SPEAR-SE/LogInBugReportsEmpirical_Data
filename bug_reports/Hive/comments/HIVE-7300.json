[Hi [~sourabhpotnis],

The LOCATION keyword specifies to Hive where the database you're creating will reside. In the example you wrote, you are specifying the location as /addh0010/hive/addh0011/warehouse, so all tables will be stored in that location.

If you want to create a different location for the database, then you will need to run this:
# hdfs dfs -mkdir /addh0010/hive/addh0011/warehouse/test_loc.db

On Hive:
# CREATE DATABASE test_loc LOCATION '/addh0010/hive/addh0011/warehouse/test_loc.db';]
