ATTACHMENT ID: 12621210, With a series of standardizing path in Hive such as via HIVE6048, HIVE-6121, etc, URI decoding might become unnecessary. At least, it's worth reproducing the problem with the latest trunk and fix it accordingly if the problem remains., Hi [~xuefuz], thanks for the advice. I run the unit test with the latest trunk and the problem still exist, so I think we still need the fix. Also I have validated that the failed tests in HIVE QA is not related to the patch., +1 . Looks good. There is a typo in the error message ""Invalid UIR" , but I can take care of that while committing.
, Thanks [~thejas]. Also attached a new patch with the fix for the typo is you need., [~shuainie] If you don't mind, could you quickly test a case where the file name contains '+' sign? I am a little concerned that URI.decode() might screw it up, but I'm not sure. It would be perfect if this also works., Hi [~xuefuz]. I modified my unit test and verified that it will work when the path contains '+' sign with my fix., Sorry, just ignore my former comment. The test environment is messed up. I am validating the scenario., Seems the decode function will change character "+" to space. Need to find another solution for the problem. [~xuefuz] does the fix you made in HIVE-6048 apply to this scenario?, The fix for HIVE-6048 was not to use URI.decode(). I think this problem is not about the way that table location is stored, but about the way when table location is used when the table is accessed. Storing the value of uri.toString() as the table metadata is fine. When the value is used, the right way should be to deserialize the value back to a URI instance, make a Path instance out of the URI instance using Path(URI uri), and then use the Path instance to access the file. This is just my speculation as I didn't check the code, but I suppose it should fix the problem (plus other encoding/decoding problems as we saw in other JIRAs).,

I also modified the unit test to cover both cases., Could you please create a review board entry for your code changes? Thanks., Create review board for this JIRA here: https://reviews.apache.org/r/16727/, [~shuainie] Change looks good. I have a couple comments on the review board., Update the patch #5 based on [~xuefuz]'s comment in review board, Thanks for the update. Some minor comments on the review boards., Submit the patch to run the test.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12622272, The failure above seems transient and unrelated. Patch committed to trunk. Thanks to Shuaishuai for the contribution., Thanks [~xuefuz]!, Hey, is the commit for this fix missing file data/files/ext_test_space/folder+with space/data.txt? I don't see it on git.  I would have thought that any of the pre commit tests run after this commit would have failed on this test since the required data file is missing., Hi [~xuefuz], seems like the test file is missing. Can you help commit? Thanks, Guys,

Please help me understand. If the data file is missing, then I would expect that the tests relying on it would fail. Let's fix this once for all. [~shuainie] Could you please check why the new tests didn't fail? If we can confirm that the data file is only the problem, I can commit it., Hi [~xuefuz], I tested it on my local machine and the unit test "external_table_with_space_in_location_path.q" failed. After I added the missing file, the test pass. I checked HIVE QA test report here: http://bigtop01.cloudera.org:8080/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/.  From the TestMinimrCliDriver test result you can see lots of minimr tests are missing if you compare with the list of <minimr.query.files> in the pom.xml in itests/qtest. If this is the problem, I think we need to open a JIRA for this. Thanks, Thanks [~shuainie] for the update. I have committed the data file and created HIVE-6293 to track the ptest issue.]
