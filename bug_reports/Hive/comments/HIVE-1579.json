[Same issue running Hive 0.6 against CDH3B2...  I encountered it after trying to re-run a failed query (GC out of memory orig error which I increased memory on 2nd run).  I have tried re-running multiple times with same error and restarting tasktracker on node that keeps giving error (as well as restarting mapred on cluster.  The behavior is the query hangs for multiple hours without making progress then fails with this error (same node listed both times in error log)., I may have found root cause on this error - when increasing the memory for my failed runs, I left off the dash as follows:
set mapred.child.java.opts=Xmx1100M;
When correcting with:
set mapred.child.java.opts=-Xmx1100M;
It ran without errors...]
