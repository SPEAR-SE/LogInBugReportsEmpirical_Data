ATTACHMENT ID: 12769808 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Rebase patch to latest master, [~wzheng] I'm not sure it's a good idea to initialize HiveTxnManager in the ShutdownHook from Driver().
It may not even be set there yet.  It is first set in Driver.compile() with "SessionState.get().initTxnMgr(conf);"
So I think the manager should be passed to the hook there (or even from SessionState.initTxnMgr())

, Makes sense. But based on my experiments, the transaction manager was there in Driver constructor. Maybe we get it from the previous query in the same session? Is transaction manager corresponding to a session or to a query?, Session, currently, though that may change in the future.
, Made changes based on [~ekoifman]'s comment,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12769906 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures irrelevant. [~ekoifman] Can you take another look?, +1, committed to master: https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/595fa9988fcb3e67b60845b44e1df4cc49ce38b2
patch doesn't apply on branch-1, Added branch-1 patch, committed to branch-1 https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/87e5b4ef2f3a05f1c902b85588d1d96f8fe560b9, Adding 2.0.0 as fix version as it was committed to master as well.
, [~wzheng], To my understand, this JIRA could only address the issue for CLI, but not for beeline. Since the shutdown hook could only be invoked when JVM running the Driver is shutdown, in beeline case, the beeline is running in a different JVM from HS2. Is that correct? ]
