ATTACHMENT ID: 12744588 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Looks fine to me. +1
[~szehon], [~xuefuz], could you review and commit the fix?
, Yea, +1, Committed to 2.0.0 and 1.3.0. Thank [~Yibing] for the patch and [~szehon] for review., Don't we need a unit test for this? I tried creating one but I am not sure how to add the Null value in the map. Can someone please help?

{code}
create table tab10(id int, dud map<string,string>)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ',';

insert overwrite table tab10
select 1,map(NULL) from src limit 1;

select id, map_keys(dud) from tab10;
{code}

Doesn't work. When I tried creating the map as 

{code}
insert overwrite table tab10
select 1,map() from src limit 1;

select id, map_keys(dud) from tab10;
{code}

I did not see any failure without this patch. Any pointers here? Do I just try a load table?]
