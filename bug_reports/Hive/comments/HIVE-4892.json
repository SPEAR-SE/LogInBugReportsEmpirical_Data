Here is how I plan to handle clearing the library cache for a build. Basically if you needed the library cache cleaned for a particular build, in the JIRA description (so you can edit it later) you'd say:

Test Properties:
CLEAR LIBRARY CACHE

which would then enable deleting the library cache for that build. Does that sound good?, That will do. Thanks for the effort. I will put that in HIVE-3632 to see how it goes., https://reviews.apache.org/r/12790/, Friendly ping :) When we commit this I can move the build infra to the official source tree., Removed and renamed the TEST-*.xml files we use for testing parsing of output files. This was causing issues with the build. These changed make the patch look much larger than it actually is., There are few new files in there which looks like test logs. Are those needed ?, Hi,

PTest2 parses the TEST-\*.xml logs and the patch does include "sample" TEST outputs for uniting testing purposes. Unfortunately in the current version they are named TEST..xml in the source tree which is causing ptest2 issues when it finds these outputs. This patch renames them to remove the TEST prefix. There is also a few very small other ouptuts such as hive.log for the same purpose. These already exist in the source tree but are being renamed.

When we get this committed I can submit a performance improvement patch that should increase throughput of the pre-commit tests by 2x., +1, Ping :), committing., Looks like this has been committed. Thank you!!, Hey,

This patch contain some deletes and therefore left some empty files when it was applied. We should execute an addendum commit:

, This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.,
