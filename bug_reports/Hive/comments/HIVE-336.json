[As part of HIVE-337, we changed the SerDe to LazySimpleSerDe, for the value part in the key-value pair between map and reduce.
, We had an example query which sends 4 string columns from mapper to reducer.

The map output data was 220MB using DynamicSerDe with TCTLSeparatedProtocol. It is about 140MB using LazySimpleSerDe right now. The net saving of space is around 1/3.
