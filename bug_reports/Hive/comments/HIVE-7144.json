[Benchmark insert of TPC-H 1Tb scale data

|| Table || Before || After || Diff ||
| part | 46.497 | 45.508 | 0.989 |
| partsupp | 145.031 | 144.841 | 0.19 |
| customer | 55.315 | 55.745 | -0.430 |
| orders | 246.692 | 217.834 | 28.858 |
| lineitem | 959.995 | 875.659 | 84.336 |

This makes negligible difference to the smaller tables, but gives a ~10% boost for orders (50.8Gb ORC) and lineitem (224.5Gb ORC).

The optimization does not benefit the sorted string columns, because for every row read there's a data-copy to populate either the minimum or maximum in the column statistics section (Strings are immutable, Text is Writable)., Previous comment, all table items are in seconds.,
