[OP is not belong to a session. I also think it's strange but it seemed to be a by-design. , 
Also works for trunk., [~vaidya] Can you please upload this patch (or an updated patch) to reviewboard (https://reviews.apache.org) or phabricator ?
Review comments -
- operationToSession in OperationManager seems to be unnecessary. Operation.getParentSession() can be used to find the HiveSession associated with the operator.
- I also think it would be better to store the list of Operations to be closed in the HiveSession itself (as a HashSet), instead of doing that in the OperationManager . , 
Created review request: <https://reviews.apache.org/r/10757/>, 
Same as in the review board., 
I think there's one big caveat with the new implementation -- we shouldn't have anyone call OperationManager.closeOperation() directly; they should always go through a HiveSession object., I left some comments on RB., 
New patch, addressing the comments, is up at <https://reviews.apache.org/r/10757/>., +1 (non binding)
, [~vaidya] Can you please make the state of the jira 'patch available' using the 'submit patch' button ? That will make it more clear that it is ready for review and commit.
, I left some more comments on RB. Thanks., 
Addresses latest comments., Thanks. +1
, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Ashish!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2082 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2082/])
