[[~Huang Xiaomeng] discussed this with me offline and we think the possible reason is sparkcluster cannot resolve the logical URI of the hive table.
I'm not sure if this is specific to HoS. Xiaomeng, how did you submit the spark job to sparkcluster? Can you try the same thing with HoMR?, Hi [~ruili] 
It can't work, too. I think I should set both hivecluster and sparkcluster in hdfs-site.xml of sparkcluster.]
