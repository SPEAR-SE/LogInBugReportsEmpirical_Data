[If the system property "test_prop" is defined, then
* Any qfile that contains INCLUDE_IF_SYS_PROP_DEFINED(test_prop) will be executed IFF test_prop is defined.
* Any qfile that contains EXCLUDE_IF_SYS_PROP_DEFINED(test_prop) will be executed IFF test_prop is not defined.
* These macros are mutually exclusive, i.e. any qfile that contains both macros will trigger an UnSupportedOperationException.
