[Actually, upon considering the code and the scenarios for tests, I don't think we should do it.
For MM table exports it would be safe but for ACID tables the result of a load would not be valid.
When ACID ExIM works, it should handle this case (i.e. to load an exported ACID table, import should be used).
Import being available, Export+Load doesn't make sense, we are going to say it's not a supported scenario. For flat tables, it's often possible to treat them as a directory, so it works by coincidence, as an unsupported case]
