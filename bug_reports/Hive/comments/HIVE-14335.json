[[~szehon] Can you please take a look. The change is just renaming of a variable. One test case has been modified. The test case modifications only succeed along with the code changes. 

, Taking patch from reviewboard and attaching, +1 fine with me.  why does renaming it allow it to get deserialized?, Not sure. Some internal working of Jackson I'm sure. But this change happened to be my first guess for rectifying the problem and when it worked, I went ahead with posting patch.
