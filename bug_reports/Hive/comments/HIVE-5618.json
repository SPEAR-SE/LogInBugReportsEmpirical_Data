[One [not so clean] workaround is to set the config parameter before launching the query

set hive.server2.enable.doAs=false;

This works because in ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/mr/MapredLocalTask.java,  delegation token is not requested again if hive.server2.enable.doAs is set to false, I have updated reviewboard with a comment.

I think we can take the discussion about delegation token being needed without doAs being enabled in a different jira, if that is the case, it looks like a hadoop bug to me. Getting additional token in this case should not cause any noticeable problems.

, Patch committed to trunk. 
Thanks for the contribution Prasad!
, created HIVE-5869 to track the issue of delegation token having to be obtained even when doas is disabled.
