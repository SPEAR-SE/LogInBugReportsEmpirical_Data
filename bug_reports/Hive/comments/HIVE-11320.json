ATTACHMENT ID: 12746244 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~alangates], could you review please, +1, Committed to branch-1 and master.  Thanks [~alangates] for the reivew, I wonder if it would also apply to stripe elimination during split generation..., I'm not sure I follow, can you explain, ORC split generation tries to eliminate stripes from splits entirely using stripe statistics (if this is enabled).
Right now, if it seems deltas it doesn't do that because deltas can change values, so the elimination of a particular stripe will no longer be valid.
If insert-only deltas are used, I guess you can still eliminate?]
