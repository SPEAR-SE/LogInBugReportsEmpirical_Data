[Looking at the test failures from here https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build/240/#showFailuresLink I initially thought the golden files are not updated for jdk8. But it looks like the test ran with jdk7 https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build/240/injectedEnvVars/

I thought we moved our tests entirely to jdk8.

[~ashutoshc]/[~spena] Any idea why the test environment still using jdk7?, This bug is invalid if we have already moved test infra to jdk8., Hey [~prasanth_j].

The ptest environment is running with JDK8. Search for {{java1.8.0_25}} here:
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build/240/consoleText

What you saw on the Jenkins environment variables is the version used to build PTest client only. Ptest should not affect the execution of tests. The configuration for the JDK used for tests are in the PTest server properties file:
{noformat}
$ cat trunk-mr2.properties
...
javaHome = /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_25
javaHomeForTests = /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_25
...
{noformat}, I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release.]
