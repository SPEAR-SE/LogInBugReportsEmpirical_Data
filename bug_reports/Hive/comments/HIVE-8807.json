{code}, These values still need to be fixed, as well as the values for templeton.hive.home and templeton.hcat.home ("0.14.0-SNAPSHOT" in 0.14.0 and 1.0 RC0).

[~ekoifman], can you take care of this or suggest someone else for it?, usually these are updated once the branch is cut.  In practice it makes little difference since these properties are relative to other properties (e.g. templeton.hive.archive) that indicate where the tar file is located in HDFS which does not have a meaningful default for.  , bq.  usually these are updated once the branch is cut.

But the values for templeton.pig.path and templeton.hive.path have not been updated in the released branches for 0.14.0, 0.13.1, 0.13.0, and 0.12.0.  And the values for templeton.hive.home and templeton.hcat.home say "SNAPSHOT" in the released branch for 0.14.0.  That doesn't seem right.

Are they unused?  If so, I suggest changing them to dummy values instead of specific release numbers., bq.  these properties are relative to other properties ... that indicate where the tar file is located in HDFS

Okay, on third reading I halfway understand.  But I still think "0.11.0" and "SNAPSHOT" should be changed., If I end up rolling out a new release and we have a patch for this by then, I will include this in the next roll-out.

Thanks
Vikram., +1, Committed to branch 1.0, Thanks [~ekoifman] and [~thejas] and [~vikram.dixit].

What can be done to make sure webhcat-default.xml gets updated in future releases?  Is there a release checklist for things like this?, This also needs to be done for release 1.1.0, but I don't think we should have a new Jira for each release.  Would it make sense to reopen this issue for each release?  Or is there a better way to make sure webhcat-default.xml gets updated?, We can add instructions to update this as part of release instructions - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToRelease
, Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
, Good idea.  And could we have dummy values in webhcat-default.xml so the file doesn't look obsolete?]
