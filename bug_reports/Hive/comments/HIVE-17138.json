[OrcRecordUpdater also has some inconsistent logic as to when it creates an empty file.  For "legacy" - always - for "default" - never.

Should add a switch just like FileSinkOperator that checks engine type (and some other prop), HIVE-13403 (Streaming) doesn't seem to check engine type - this may be an issue for MR, See also TestTxnNoBuckets.testUnionRemove()

    int[][] values = {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6},{7,8},{9,10}};
    runStatementOnDriver("insert into " + TxnCommandsBaseForTests.Table.ACIDTBL + makeValuesClause(values));//this creates 1 delta_0000013_0000013_0000/bucket_00001

but before "move" in Hive I see 2 buckets - so we drop then empty 0 bucket during move somewhere..., in acid1 arguably only the base/ has to have a full compliment of bucket files
in acid2 all insert deltas should as well
*In particular Compactor should make sure to produce empty buckets which it doesn't currently*
for example, delete events filtered out everything from a given bucket...., check usages of AcidUtils.getAcidState() specifically when ignoreEmptyFiles=true]
