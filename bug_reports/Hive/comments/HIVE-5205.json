[That's do the trick., +1, Doesn't look to apply any more., looks like it has been been fixed in the trunk as a part of 
  0129f3642660e8696646ac3d4aa414ef062e2118
Hence, the patch is only good for Hive 0.11, [~cos] [~brocknoland] Should we close this?, Shall we target it for 0.11.1 instead of simply closing it?, I could be wrong, but my understanding is that, if there is patch that addresses the issue for the trunk, the patch may be backported to other branches for future releases.

For this particular case, this issue was under HIVE-4583, which is for 0.12. So to say the least, the issue needs to be decoupled from the parent JIRA., I'd argue that grouping of issues is only loosely coupled with the versions of a product. Grouping is logical; where's versioning is functional. In this particular case, parent issue is about JDK7 support. This ticket is exactly about it. But I really don't care one way or another how they are going to be connected to each other, until they are linked in some way., In that case, I made the issue standalone and marked as "related to" HIVE-4583.]
