[cleaned up the whole function. now it is a lot less code.
, one small thing - in the previous code - we used to fill in the namenode automatically in case scheme was specified and the authority was not:

        if(fromScheme.equals("hdfs")) { 
              URI defaultURI = FileSystem.get(conf).getUri();
	       fromAuthority = StringUtils.isEmpty(fromURI.getAuthority()) ?  fromScheme = defaultURI.getScheme();
              fs.getUri().getAuthority() : fromURI.getAuthority();

we can restore this .., i am not sure why would users want to specify scheme but not authority but I added it anyways.
I don't think one can specify authority without the scheme though so I am not handling that case., +1, hey - can u also add a more informative message regarding source and destination file systems when they don't match up. pretty sick of answering emails about this and this should help people figure out things somewhat (perhaps also a help message - 'check locations using describe extended and fs.default.name'., modified error messages to be more descriptive., +1, Running tests right now. Will commit once they are done., committed. Thanks Prasad!!]
