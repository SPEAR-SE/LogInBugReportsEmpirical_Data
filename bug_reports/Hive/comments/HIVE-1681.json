[The query ran successfully with this patch. Thanks Carl. Appreciate if this can be committed quickly., @venkatesh, could you reproduce the error without the patch? If so could you share your query so that Carl could include that in a unit test?, Somewhat related - can you make a change to add_partitions_core() to use the return value of commitTransaction() as a part of this patch? Also, is it possible to make a test case for this issue?, @Ning/Paul: We need to add concurrent metastore tests in order to catch problems like this.
I filed this task as a separate ticket: HIVE-1710.
, Looks good to me. I'll start testing.

Paul can you also take a look?

, Marking this for 0.6 since Carl posted a backport., Uploading a new version of the backport patch which is a verbatim backport of the patch for trunk. I accidentally included additional changes in the original backport patch which are not present in the trunk patch., Committed the patch for trunk. Will test the new 0.6 patch.
, Committed to both trunk and branch 0.6. Thanks Carl!]
