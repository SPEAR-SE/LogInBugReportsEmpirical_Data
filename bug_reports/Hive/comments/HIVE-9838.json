[Might as well fix the links to Markmail at the same time -- they all point to the incubator:

* http://markmail.org/search/+list:org.apache.incubator.hive-user
* http://markmail.org/search/+list:org.apache.incubator.hive-dev
* http://markmail.org/search/+list:org.apache.incubator.hive-commits, Adding search instructions would also be helpful.

Here's a preliminary draft from user@hive "how to search the archive" on December 6, 2015:

* The Apache archives linked from Hive's mailing lists page don't seem to be searchable.
* Links to searchable MarkMail archives are broken on the mailing lists page.
* Find the MarkMail archives here:  http://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=hive.
** Clicking on a list puts it in the upper-right search field.
** Add your search string in quotes.
** Example:  http://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=hive+list%3Aorg.apache.hadoop.hive-user+%22search+the+archive%22.
** The ? button gives more search functions.
