[Attached a patch - running unit tests right now.

This removes the change for http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1200,
since this is needed as a hot fix.

, can we switch 

part = getPartitionDescFromPath(pathToPartitionInfo, ipaths[i]
                .getParent());

 with  
part = getPartitionDescFromPath(pathToPartitionInfo, ipaths[i]);


I think this will also work for hive-1200, Talked with Namit offline. HIVE-1200 needs a small fix that will be included together by Namit.
, Added more comments based on a offline discussion with Ning, A follow-up jira has been filed.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-1597

Once that is fixed, the current patch is not needed, +1 will commit if tests pass. , Is there any change in hive.1242.3.patch compared to hive.1242.2.patch?, added some comments, Namit, branch 0.5 failed on combine1.q and input2.q. Can you take a look? i'll run test trunk also., It is working for me - can you mail/upload the diff/log, Ning, found the problem - it was dumping when being used with a older hadoop version.
please take a look at the new patches (both for trunk and 0.5), Committed to 0.5 and trunk. Thanks Namit!, The comment in the code include the followings:
// Since there is no easy way of knowing whether MAPREDUCE-1597 is present in the tree or not,
      // we use a configuration variable for the same

This is clearly misunderstanding. MAPREDUCE-1597 is a bug that was fixed for new  api (mapreduce package), while CombineHiveInputFormat is using old API (deprecated mapred package). CombineHiveInputFormat  does not properly works with any non-splittable compressed file, if that files is written over multiple hdfs partitions (same as CombineFileInputFormat from mapred package, while CombineFileInputFormat from new mapreduce package works beautifully).
Not sure why this issue is marked as closed.]
