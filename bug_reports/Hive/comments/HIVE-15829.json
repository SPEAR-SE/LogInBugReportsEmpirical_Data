ATTACHMENT ID: 12860773 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~owen.omalley] if ORC project dependency and text cache are both part of 2.2, this needs to go in 2.2 too, Looks like orc is still a module in 2.2, so not needed for 2.2.
[~owen.omalley] please correct me if it's going to change..., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
