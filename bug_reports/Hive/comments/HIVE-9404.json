ATTACHMENT ID: 12692930 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, these test failures are not related - they've been happening in other runs, +1, the changes look fine.  

As a side note, I'm wondering if in isRetryable the line {{if("08S01".equalsIgnoreCase(sqlException.getSQLState()))}} shouldn't include a check whether dbProduct is MySQL (I know I should have said this in the review of HIVE-9390 instead)., I actually saw this state on Azure which uses MsSQL.  More importantly, we often get this when checking out a connection from the pool, i.e. isRetryable() has to handle not having a Connection.... I can add the check but I think it will be of limited use at least for this type of error, Ok, that's fine.  +1 for the patch then., Thanks [~alangates] for the review, [~ekoifman] Does this need to ported to branch 1.0?, [~vikram.dixit] yes but only if you are also including HIVE-9390 , Committed to 0.14 and 1.0, Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
