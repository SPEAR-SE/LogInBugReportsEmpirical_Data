ATTACHMENT ID: 12702003 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~vikram.dixit] [~brocknoland] Ok for 1.0.0 and 1.1.0?, Committed to trunk. Thanks for reviewing [~thejas]. Will wait for RMs to see if I can get it into the other branches., +1 for 1.0.0., Committed to 1.0.0. Thanks [~vikram.dixit]., +1 for 1.1.0, Committed to 1.1.0. Thanks [~brocknoland]. , Some nit-picking from me - the correct term in above comments is branch-1.0 and branch-1.1 (not 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 since those are released versions and not branch names). 
Also updated fix versions.
