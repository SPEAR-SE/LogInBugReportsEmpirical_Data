[Dug a little bit into. I think the idea makes good sense, but the description about MR is not correct. At least I wasn't able to make MR not use a single reducer for the query cited. You can rewrite the query though using a subquery to get the result you want.

There are two more flags to consider (when rewriting):

a) set hive.optimize.reducededuplication.min.reducer:

If this is set to 1 you will have a single reducer regardless of rewrite.

b) hive.fetch.task.aggr

If this one is true the final count will happen on the client. This is more important in MR than Tez (because it would start a new job in MR, in tez it's just another stage in the DAG).]
