[This patch adds to the list of illegal file path characters that may cause globStatus to break.
These include:
* ASCII characters 01-1F
* '[' open brace
Also included is a test for dynamic partitions with all standard ASCII characters (0-127)., Added comments, additions to test file, @Franklin, in your test case, can you also drop the partition ds=1 and show partitions again to make sure those partitions can be safely dropped?, Added DROP PARTITION to test, You need to show partition after dropping partition to make sure dropping partition succeeded., show partitions after dropping, fix uploaded binary files, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #764 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/764/])
    HIVE-2186. Escaping More Characters When Generating HDFS Path Name From Table Columns (Franklin Hu via Siying Dong)

sdong : http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1132778
Files : 
* /hive/trunk/data/files/escapetest.txt
* /hive/trunk/ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/escape1.q.out
* /hive/trunk/ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive/escape1.q
* /hive/trunk/common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/common/FileUtils.java
, Seems '^' also needs to be escaped.

If add:

SELECT count(*) from escape_raw;
SELECT count(*) from escape1;

into escape1.q

escape1 only get 127 rows, while, escape_raw get 128 rows(note that escapetest.txt has 128 rows).

one row missing in escape1, which is the '^'.

This is to be fixed in HIVE-2856. Comments are appreciated.

Thanks,
Zhenxiao, 
Whoops, seems escape1.q.out is loaded as data, not ascii files. It is difficult to check diffs for new patches.]
