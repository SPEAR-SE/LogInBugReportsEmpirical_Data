[I tracked and debugged into .LoadSemanticAnalyzer.applyConstraints where execption's thrown. Here's the comment, 
 // only in 'local' mode do we copy stuff from one place to another.
 // reject different scheme/authority in other cases.

I am wondering this is part of design or sth else? 
Anyone could comment on this? Thanks!, I believe that check is there to ensure that the "hdfs mv" would work. I don't think it works across file systems.
, Marked it as won't fix due to reason mentioned above.]
