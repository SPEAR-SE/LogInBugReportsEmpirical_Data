[Actually here is a proposal on how this should work once the next release of Parquet is out:
https://github.com/julienledem/incubator-parquet-mr/commit/ccdd08c7030d9d4579b6beef2b93981e327637c5
I added a deprecated constructor in the meantime for compatibility., Thanks [~julienledem]! Once Parquet has released the new constructor we can update Hive to use the new constructor. After that Parquet is free to remove the only once from Hive's perspective.]
