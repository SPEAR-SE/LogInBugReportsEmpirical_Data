I think we just return null in those methods., Yes, its related to that change, but in that patch the call was being made only after checking "if(ShimLoader.getHadoopShims().isSecurityEnabled()" - In this change, the call was made without the check - https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/adfc51b807953e69164c49a6bfd470b423d67cb0
I will add the check in the new place as well .

, Good find! Sorry about that., +1, Thanks for the prompt review Brock!

I hope we can make an exception to the 24 hr embargo for this one, as this is the last piece needed for new RC. It is also a minor change.
I am planning to wait for a few hours for the unit tests to finish.
, Yes I think we can. I won't be around when the unit tests finish so feel free to commit in my absence., 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass
