[Hadoop 2.4.1 has refactored the sasl related classes, moving sasl properties related code including sasl QOP setting from method SaslRpcServer.init to a new class named SaslPropertiesResolver. However, the HadoopThriftAuthBridge20S.getHadoopSaslProperties method still replies on the old implementation, which will not work for newer versions of Hadoop., Is this the same as HIVE-7620?, Thanks for pointing this out, Jason. Yes this is a duplicate of HIVE-7620 and HIVE-6741. After applying those patches, the error is gone., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
