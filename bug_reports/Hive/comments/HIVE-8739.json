[Simple patch. Mostly logging for now, plus fixes one unlikely problem with the query for Derby.
[~ashutoshc] can you please review? thanks, Sorry, log level should be WARN, otherwise the same thing,

Do we really need to worry about Derby? Trouble is if we want to make this change, we need to test this on all DBs, since its on common path., Unit tests run on Derby by default... so yes. It seems like they can fail on some configurations.
I'd add "DerbyIsBeingStupidException", but maybe it's easy to fix, [~ashutoshc] ping?, 1. Have you tested it on all DBs? 
2. Hive QA runs with Derby and all tests pass on it., not in all environments... I don't think specific testing is needed on all dbs (to which I don't even have access), it's a simple query change, My 2nd question is still answered : ) let me reword it:
1) Why this doesnt fail on Hive QA runs?
2) What is a bug anyway?
3) How does this purported fix fixes it?, 1) No idea. It fails in CentOS internal runs.
2) Not known. It looks like the old Derby bug where filter with cast is pushed before join, so it casts values before join eliminates the non-integral ones. As a workaround, case was added around it. Unfortunately, one column joined on is missing in the case, which MAY be the cause of the issue. From the table structure it doesn't seem like it should, but I cannot confirm either way.
3) It may fix it as described, or not, in which case new logging will shed more light on it, hopefully, Btw Yahoo is doing a similar change in their patch for an unrelated issue... partition id is also missing from case.
I think I'll keep their changes there (I'm taking the patch forward cause it seems to have stalled in Apache), then remove this workaround in this JIRA by default, and detect Derby exception + re-apply it only for Derby so other DBs are not impeded. , My suggestion would be to keep this change here, because you may want to backport HIVE-8295 to 0.14 branch. We can commit patch posted here as it is on trunk, so that it gets more testing before it gets to users. Make sense ?, +1 for trunk, I'd like to commit it after HIVE-8295, and anyway to handle with differently so this CASE doesn't execute for other backends. Let me update both later today..., Patch including HIVE-8295 for now, before that is committed. Also added the same workaround for Oracle cause Derby is apparently in good company..., https://reviews.apache.org/r/27900/diff/#
Note that patch has changed a lot,

Thanks, [~sershe], [~hagleitn] ok for 0.14.1?, Didn't read through all of it, but since this is a fix for Derby which is used only for dev/test - why do we need this in 0.14.1?, It also affects Oracle, Committed to 0.14, Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
