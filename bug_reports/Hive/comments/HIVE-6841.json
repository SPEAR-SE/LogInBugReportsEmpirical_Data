ATTACHMENT ID: 12638899, [~rhbutani] This is a critical issue in hive-0.13 and fails many queries on partitioned tables in vectorized execution. It should be fixed in branch-0.13 as well., +1 for 0.13, The failed tests are not related to the patch and passed when run locally.

Committed to trunk and branch-0.13.]
