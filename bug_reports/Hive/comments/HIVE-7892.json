[Attaching patch that resolves the issue.

The approach taken here is to essentially map thrift Set type to hive Array type (thrift List type already maps to hive Array). Since both List and Set are essentially collections, we can simply leverage the existing Array type, instead of exposing a new complex type at hive level., Review: https://reviews.apache.org/r/25473/,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12667390, Code changes look fine. Can you update the test output for convert_enum_to_string.q and upload the patch?, Attaching updated patch. The test convert_enum_to_string.q works with existing MegaStruct thrift table, which contains set columns with older description. Fixed the description., Attaching patch again to trigger build.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12667976, I just committed this. Thanks Satish !, Should this be documented in the wiki?

We don't have a wikidoc for the Thrift SerDe (but probably should).  Here are some places it is mentioned:

* [Developer Guide -- Hive SerDe | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DeveloperGuide#DeveloperGuide-HiveSerDe]
* [SerDe -- Built-in SerDes | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SerDe#SerDe-Built-inSerDes]

Hive complex types are documented here:

* [Hive Data Types -- Complex Types | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-ComplexTypes], [~leftylev] The following wiki briefly mentions various available Hive Serdes:

* [Developer Guide -- Hive SerDe | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DeveloperGuide#DeveloperGuide-HiveSerDe ]

We can probably mention against ThriftSerde that Thrift complex types get mapped to Hive complex types (List->Array, Map->, Struct -> Struct respectively). With HIVE-7892, Thrift Set type gets mapped to Hive Array type. User can setup a Thrift based table using ThriftDeserializer class and query various Thrift fields through Hive query., Agreed, thanks [~satish.mittal]., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
