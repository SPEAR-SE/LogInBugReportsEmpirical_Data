[Here's a patch which extends the testcase added in HIVE-7653 to illustrate the issue.

The problem here is that the generated TypeInfo for these data sets replaces the recursive fields with void, so any serializer will faithfully serialize nulls instead of any relevant data. However, making the TypeInfo properly recursive is likely to not work with other components of Hive. At the very least, the 'describe' statement will cause an infinite loop. I believe these issues could be fixed, but it would require making cyclical/recursive datasets a first class citizen in Hive's data model. , Here's a patch which ensures that ensures the Avro Serde isn't used with recursive schemas.,
