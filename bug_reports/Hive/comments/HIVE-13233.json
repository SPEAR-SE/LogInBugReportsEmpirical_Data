[This is only taking into account >=  , >  What about other arithmetic expressions like <= , < . 
Also, we need recursive implementation for nested expressions., [~ashutoshc], thanks for checking.

1) <= and < are also taken into account (line 747 in StatsRulesProcFactory, thus _else_ block in {{evaluateComparator}} refers to them).

2) Checking nested expressions is already taken care of by {{evaluateChildExpr}}. In fact, we call {{evaluateComparator}} only when we have found an expression a _CMP_ b, where _CMP_ is >=, >, <=, or <. Previously, we were just returning 1/3 of the rows for these cases.,
