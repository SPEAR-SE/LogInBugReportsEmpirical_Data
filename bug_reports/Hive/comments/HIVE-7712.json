[You can apply the patch on HIVE-7240 and recompile Hive to get past this issue., I think that providing a proper build from the hive team would eleviate the hive users from the hassle plus prevent people from chasing the same bug as I did.

Is it possible for you to provide such a build ? Upstream would benefit from this as well I presume., For that you have to wait for next release either 0.13.2 or 0.14, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
