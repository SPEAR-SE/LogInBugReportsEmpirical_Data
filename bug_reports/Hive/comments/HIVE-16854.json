ATTACHMENT ID: 12872191 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Thanks [~xuefuz] for providing the patch. I think RpcServer is already thread safe so the methods don't have to be synchronized. I added a UT to cover it. A side note is we currently set SO_BACKLOG=1 in server, which may cause problems when we have multiple concurrent client connections. I removed it so that we'll use the default value (50 I guess).,
