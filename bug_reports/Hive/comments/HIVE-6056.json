[This bug is fixed as a part of hive 0.12 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3953), Thought this was fixed in hive-0.12. However when I tried that, it failed with the error: 
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.objectinspector.primitive.PrimitiveObjectInspectorFactory.getPrimitiveJavaObjectInspector(Lorg/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/typeinfo/PrimitiveTypeSpec;)Lorg/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/objectinspector/primitive/AbstractPrimitiveJavaObjectInspector;

, Is there any priority on this issue? This seems like a greatly debilitating bug., I am not blocked on it. I found a workaround through pig. Wonder if its fixed though., The issue was not reproducible. Attaching patch containing test case that tries to reproduce the issue. [~rushilgupta] let me know if your use case is different from the one in attached qtest.,
