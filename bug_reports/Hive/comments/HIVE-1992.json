[Added commons-configuration to /lib (readme updated in separate patch)., Updated readme to indicate source of library., Applied patch (to update README indicating source of jar).
Added jar to lib directory.
However, I did NOT update the ivy/librarties.properties as it seems that no Hive code itself has direct dependency on commons-configuration as of 0.6.

Unchanged ivy/libraries.properties:
{code}
#These are the versions of our dependencies (in alphabetical order)
apacheant.version=1.7.1
ant-task.version=2.0.10
checkstyle.version=5.0
commons-cli.version=2.0
commons-codec.version=1.3
commons-collections.version=3.2.1
commons-lang.version=2.4
commons-logging.version=1.0.4
commons-logging-api.version=1.0.4
jdom.version=1.1
ivy.version=2.1.0
log4j.version=1.2.15
{code}

Not sure what other people's take on this is (having a library in lib directory without entry in ivy file)., I think this can be closed because we don't support Hadoop 0.20 anymore and the build system has changed in the meantime.]
