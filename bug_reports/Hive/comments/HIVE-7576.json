[Here's the fix. This won't apply till HIVE-7223 is resolved. , [~alangates], thanks for checking in HIVE-7223. Looks like the (decidedly less gargantuan) patch here doesn't need modification/rebase. Seems to work on trunk. I've raised a review here: 
https://reviews.apache.org/r/25397/, [~sushanth], [~alangates], could I please bother either of you for a review? This should complete support for Partition-specs in HCatalog., Bumping severity for visibility. This is patch-available.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12663174 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 on this.

Could I bug you for one more change on this, though, before we roll out for 0.14? I'd like to tag the new classes and new methods with Stability Evolving and Audience Limited-Private ( https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/InterfaceClassification.html ) so that if we decide we need to change the signatures of these new methods after we develop this a bit more, we still can, and are not locked in on this iteration of it.

If you're okay with it, I can even make that change myself before committing, since it's just Java annotations and carries no additional risk., After verbal confirmation from Mithun that he's okay with me adding InterfaceAudience.LimitedPrivate(Hive) and InterfaceStability.Evolving on all the new methods using PartitionSpec, I updated his patch with them., (Submitted to pre-commit queue manually - http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/1601 will test it.), Thanks for adding the Interface annotations. That's a good idea.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12678734 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 for hive .14, Committed to trunk and .14. Thanks [~mithun] and [~sushanth]!, [~leftylev] : Documentation for this is eventually needed, since it will eventually be developer-facing but we've marked all the changes here @LimitedPrivate and @Evolving because we do not want them to be public interface yet, since they are still evolving. So, for now, no doc required here., Got it, thanks [~sushanth]., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
