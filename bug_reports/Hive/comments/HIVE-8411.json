ATTACHMENT ID: 12673819, [~vikram.dixit] I'd like to see this one make it to 0.14 as well, as this makes the migration issue addressed in HIVE-7971 much easier for users with partitioned tables., Some comments on rb. Otherwise +1, uploading patch v2 - changes based on review feedback,

 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Failures do not appear related - most should be fixed by HIVE-8465, Committed to trunk and branch-0.14, Doc note:  This needs to be documented in the wiki, with version information and a link back to this jira.

A release note listing the ALTER PARTITION statements that support partial partition specs would also be helpful.  For a checklist here are the ALTER PARTITION statements that the wiki covers, in order of appearance:

* [LanguageManual DDL -- Alter Partition | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-AlterPartition]
** add partition(s) 
** rename partition
** exchange partition
** recover partitions (EMR only)
** drop partition(s)
** archive/unarchive partition
* [LanguageManual DDL -- Alter Table or Partition | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-AlterEitherTableorPartition]
** set fileformat
** set location
** touch
** enable/disable no_drop
** enable/disable offline
** compact
** concatenate, Updated https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-AlterPartitionWithPartialPartitionSpecification
and 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-UpgradingPre-Hive0.13.0DecimalColumns, Thanks [~jdere].  For the record, here's the list of ALTER PARTITION commands that can use partial partition specs (from the DDL doc):

* Change column
* Add column
* Replace column
* File Format
* Serde Properties

Currently the DDL doc doesn't include the PARTITION option for ALTER TABLE SET SERDE WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (or SET SERDEPROPERTIES), but presumably it's supported at least for SET SERDEPROPERTIES and perhaps for both variants.  Would someone please confirm that, so the wiki can be updated?

* [DDL -- Add SerDe Properties | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27362034#LanguageManualDDL-AddSerDeProperties], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
