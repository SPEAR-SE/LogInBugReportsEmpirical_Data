[Added (temporary) integrity checks., Added to my build for the night, thanks [~mmccline]., This is failing somewhere in the subtract() inner loop, which I suspect is due to the lack of the deep-copy of the arrays when generating the OR + XOR divisions, [~mmccline]: I found that under some conditions - subtract() args are mixed up. The assert that you need to trigger is that none of the inputs overlap each other.

Preconditions.check((all != remove) || (remove != difference) || (difference != all));

Under some conditions, I found that remove == difference, which was triggering most of the errors which  start with.

, Looks like this is a side-effect of returning a vector batch which refers the transient local variable, for a single op & then returning back to the vector reader with that value tied to the VRB., Original op did swap the selected array which is questionable.  New patch will not swap selected array.  Added Precondition.  Thanks for Gopal for debugging the problem.  Sorry for the trouble.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12748620 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~mmccline] looks like there are a couple of plan changes now. Are those real issues or just need golden update? (cc [~gopalv]), Tested against latest from HIVE-11398, LGTM - +1., Committed to branch-1 and master. Thank you [~t3rmin4t0r] and [~mmccline]., Fix version should include 1.3.0.

(In general, should I make such changes myself or just add comments?), I reverted this patch on branch-1 as it is breaking the build. [~mmccline] Can you apply the patch to branch-1 and fix the build?, Ok, fixed branch-1.  Thanks [~prasanth_j]., Thanks [~mmccline]!]
