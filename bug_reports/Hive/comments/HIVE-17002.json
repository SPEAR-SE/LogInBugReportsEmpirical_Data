[[~arturt] Could you try the patch that I just attached to HIVE-15883 to see if it resolves this issue? Thanks, I don't have time right now, but I looked at your patch and it's almost exactly the same I ended up doing for our installation.
Only difference is in LazyDioHiveDecimal::init I did data field initialization like this:

{code}
data = new HiveDecimalWritable(HiveDecimal.create(Bytes.toBigDecimal(bytes.getData(), start, length)));
{code}, [~arturt] Thanks for confirming. In that case, I will close this jira as duplicate of HIVE-15883 as I just committed the fix to master. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
