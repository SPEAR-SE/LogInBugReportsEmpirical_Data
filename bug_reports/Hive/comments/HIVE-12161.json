[[~vikram.dixit] [~sseth] fyi.
I tried to do some analysis on builds 5618 (before), 5629 (after) and 5626 (AM reuse patch). 
Then I realized we have 5596 build results which is AM reuse before merge and it also took 2 hours and correlation is 0.98 in runtimes. So I think this is entirely attributable to session setup.
The test time differences between 5618 and 5629 don't have any discernible pattern (e.g. a few tests even got faster testCliDriver_create_merge_compressed	41	36	17 (before-after-after+AM reuse)  , some tests got many minutes slower, testCliDriver_auto_sortmerge_join_12	23	299	5.3, or testCliDriver_load_dyn_part1	27	321	3.5).
Average benefit from session reuse "before" is 24sec, 8sec. deviation, average benefit "after" is 155sec., with 118sec. deviation.
Should we investigate why session setup is so slow and random? Could it be due to some Tez changes in new version? Will it affect real clusters? 
, I am looking at local repro..., Actually, nm, it looks like time difference locally is actually in the test..., Fixed via session reuse. No longer necessary.]
