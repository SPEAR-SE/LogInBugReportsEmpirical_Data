[I think the cause here may be the same as in HIVE-1872; calling System.exit causes ant to freak out., This doesn't fix anything, it just introduces a mechanism to mark a test as disabled (by renaming it to .q.disabled) and also marks dyn_part_empty as disabled. Taking a closer look at the test, it seems like the failure is only indicative of a test failure, not an actual bug., Review request: https://reviews.apache.org/r/492/
, +1. Will commit if tests pass.
, To provide some more context: Driver.execute() launches multiple tasks in parallel and ends up calling Driver.taskCleanup() if any of them fails *and* there are still running tasks. Driver.taskCleanup() calls System.exit(9). 

In this particular test, one of the tasks is meant to fail, and if it happens to finish while there are other tasks still running, System.exit(9) is being called and the test fails., Committed to trunk and branch-0.7. Thanks Marcel!]
