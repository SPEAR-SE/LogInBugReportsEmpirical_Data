[Handled the following scenarios 

Create table 
Create table like
Alter table fileformat

Based on the Inputformat if its type is secquenceFileFormat , then compression flag is set to true and vice versa., If a table's fileformat is seqfile, it does not mean the data is compressed. 
I guess a better way to populate this information is from the MoveTask. eg a 'insert overwrite ...' normally has 2 taks, one is the mapreduce task, which use the compression configuration, and the other is the load task which is a data load task. And i think they share the same conf.

But not sure about how compression info for queries like "load data local inpath ''".

We can focus on correcting the "insert overwrite " in this task., If we don't really make use of the IS_COMPRESSED attribute of a table, should we just get rid of it (or at least not print it in the {{describe extended/formatted}} output, which causes great confusion as it is always certainly {{No}})?, +1
This is really confusing!, +1 This is still a great confusion. (on Hive version 1.2.1.2.4)]
