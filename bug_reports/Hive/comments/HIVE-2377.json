[@Marcin what version of Hive are you running against?  On 7, use as the initial command works fine for me:
{noformat}hive> [jhoman@gw ~]$ hive
Hive history file=/hive_query_logs/jhoman/hive_job_log_jhoman_201108152322_635559337.txt
hive> use u_jhoman;
OK
Time taken: 1.968 seconds
hive> show tables;
OK
foo
Time taken: 0.297 seconds{noformat}, On some snapshot of 0.8 version, I believe it's revision 1155573. Maybe the problem appeared after 0.7, or it has something to do with local configuration., Problem appeared when changing between databases with different parameters. This made Hive.get function construct new Hive object with currentDatabase unbound.

Patch adds setting currentDatabase to value from previous instance., Duplicate of HIVE-2501.]
