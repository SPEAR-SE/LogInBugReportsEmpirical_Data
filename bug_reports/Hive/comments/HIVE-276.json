[To test, try: ant -Dhadoop.version=0.17.0 -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=input3_limit.q test, The query is: "INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE T2 SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM T1 DISTRIBUTE BY key SORT BY key, value) T ;"

Maybe we should propagate the SORT ORDER to the second map-reduce job that LIMIT imposes.
, Modified the query to do another SORT at the end.

I also thought about propagating the sort order to the reduce sink operator of limit, but that does not seem very easy to do.
, sorry. I thought you were not working on this.
, I think it is easier to just put a sort by in the final select.

SELECT * FROM T2 SORT BY T2.key, T2.value;


instead of

SELECT * FROM T2;
