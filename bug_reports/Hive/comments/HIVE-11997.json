ATTACHMENT ID: 12764492 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to branch-1 and master.  Thanks [~jdere] for the review, Doc note:  This adds configuration parameter *hive.compactor.job.queue* which needs to be documented in two places in the wiki.

* [Hive Transactions -- New Configuration Parameters for Transactions | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions#HiveTransactions-NewConfigurationParametersforTransactions]
* [Configuration Properties -- Transactions and Compactor | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-TransactionsandCompactor], Oops, forgot that Eugene already did the Transactions documentation.  So it just needs to be added to Configuration Properties (and that will fix the link from the table in Transactions).]
