[Perhaps because we now have multiple sub queries running in hive for the same overall query we can have concurrent use of this map?
We could simply fix this by using the ConcurrentHashMap


  private Map<String, ContentSummary> pathToCS = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, ContentSummary>();
, No tests are added. It would be difficult to time a test to reproduce this and then it would show a normal HashMap isn't thread safe which we already know., Message from: "Bennie Schut" <bennie@schut.cc>

, Are your using HiveServer ?

>> we having 2 threads running at 100%

What do you mean by the above ? Are you setting hive.exec.parallel to true, in which case, I can see the problem happening ?, Sorry I was a bit short on the description. I'm running the HiveServer with hive.exec.parallel set to true. I'm running many jobs each day for about a week after startup. Then I notice 2 threads are stuck at 100% cpu for about 3days. I used jstack to look at both threads and they showed the same stacktrace., OK, I can now see the problem.

, Committed. Thanks Bennie]
