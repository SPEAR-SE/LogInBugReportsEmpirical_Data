[performance.improvement.after.set.spark.yarn.archive.PNG shows the detail performance impovement after setting spark.yarn.archive in small queries.,  I'd like to update Hive WIKI about configuring spark.yarn.jars configuration for better performance for queries at small data scale. [~xuefuz] [~lirui], any suggestions about this?, Seems these two configs are useful in several ways :) I'm also looking at them in HIVE-15302.
My plan is to identify the minimum set of needed jars (good for performance the avoid conflicts) and update the wiki.
We can also make code change to automatically set it if user hasn't., +1 from me as well. Let's first flush out everything around spark dependency and then provide wiki documentation., [~lirui], any progress or plan about HIVE-15302? I think we can resolve this ticket firstly since HIVE-15302 doesn't block HIVE-15313? Any suggestions? [~xuefuz] [~lirui], [~Ferd], yeah I'm OK to update the wiki for performance first. I'll update again once the minimum set is determined., Updated the (Configuring Hive section  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+on+Spark%3A+Getting+Started#HiveonSpark:GettingStarted-ConfiguringHive). Thanks [~kellyzly] [~xuefuz] and [~lirui] for the review and contribution.]
