[[~alangates], you might be interested in this issue., Yeah, I hit this too. What is the fix, [~alangates]?, I was facing the same issue. If you do not want this error then create an empty database in mysql for hive and set up following property in hive-site.xml:
<property>
        <name>javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL</name>
        <value>jdbc:mysql://192.168.1.15:3306/hive_metastore</value>
</property>

Do not add "?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true"

Run following command from hive bin to create hive schema in "hive_metastore" db :
bin/schematool -dbType mysql -initSchema -verbose

then start metastore and hiveserver2 services

, This patch makes it so that the worker and cleaner don't go into a tight loop throwing errors.  With this patch, if the transaction tables aren't in the database the logs are around 200K.

[~owen.omalley] suggested that we should make it so that the metastore died if the proper tables weren't in place.  We could still do that, but I felt that was separate from this patch because what this patch really fixed was making sure any error that occurred inside the compactor threads didn't result in a tight loop. , [~ekoifman] review request

[~sushanth], I'd like to put this on branch-1.2.  I'm happy to wait until after you've rolled your RC to avoid slowing that process., Approved for 1.2. Adding it to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+1.2+Release+Status, +1,
