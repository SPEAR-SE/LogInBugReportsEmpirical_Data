[Bumped the ORC write version number to 0.12.1. [~owen.omalley]  Can you please review this change?, Do we need to discard "0.12" version completely? "0.12" version is not valid anymore. But config option still allows users to specify "0.12" version. In which case, should can we forcefully bump version to "0.12.1"?, You can't use [0,121] for the version because it compares them for numeric order. I'd suggest changing the string for [0,12] to "*INVALID* 0.12" and add a patch level to Version so that you can add [0,12,1]., Gotcha! Fixed that. I did not update ReaderImpl.checkOrcVersion() to reflect the comparison of patch version. If my understanding I correct change in patch versions are compatible with each other as long as major and minor version remains the same (0 and 12 resp. in this case). Please correct me if I am wrong., Making it as patch available.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12619929, These test failures are unrelated and are fixed in trunk now. I ran the same tests in trunk and all tests passed., Rather than introduce a new version, let's add some metadata. add a key name ORC.FIXED.JIRA and make a comma separated list of the fixed jiras. So in this case, HIVE-5994.]
