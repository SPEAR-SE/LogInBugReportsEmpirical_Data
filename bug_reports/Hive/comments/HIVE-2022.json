[+1 Will commit once tests pass., Will this be included in the 0.7 release?, Committed. Thanks Ning!, @Mac - sounds like a good idea. I'll backport to 0.7., Thanks Paul!, This patch broke TestEmbeddedHiveMetaStore and TestRemoteHiveMetaStore: https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hive-trunk-h0.20/590/

@Paul: Please don't backport this to 0.7.0
, Apologies for the build break - Ning and I are looking into fixing some issues with my build environment.]
