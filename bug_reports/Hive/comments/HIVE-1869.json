[Can it be related to the JDO change ?
I saw similar problems with JDO 3.0, Reusing this jira to fix TestMTQueries., Looks like this is because HIVE-9119 made {{conf}} static in QTestUtil and Driver instances are stored by {{HiveConf}} in {{CommandProcessorFactory}}., I don't see why it's static in that change. Let's see what happens when we change that.,
