[Mark it as resolved, patch's available.
Can anyone help to review this jira? Thanks!, [~xiaobingo] "Closed" means the patch is applied to trunk, which is not. Just use "Submit Patch" button below the summary. And for the patch, I think we should accept encoding type for the script file from user or hive-site.xml, not enforcing to use UTF-8., This can be resolved by applying java options, like -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8. Setting it as env variable(_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8) or passing as java start argument both work fine.]
