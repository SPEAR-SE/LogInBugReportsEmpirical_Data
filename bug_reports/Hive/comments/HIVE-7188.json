[The current implementation of ColAndCol is buggy. I am modifying the evaluate() of ColAndCol. Will add test cases in the next patch and upload for review.

Thanks

ATTACHMENT ID: 12649762, I have a minor comment on the review board.
The patch looks good. +1.

I think similar issues may exist in ColOrCol as well, please file a jira for that too.
, [~jnp] Looked at ColOrCol and it seems to cover all the corner cases with sufficient unit tests. 

Thanks
Hari, Sounds good. +1,
