[This is by design if the FS is case sensitive iirc. Metastore won't be able to find this partition later., But through DDL CREATE EXTERNAL statement when we have case sensitive partition names, everything is being treated as lowercase(verified from SHOW CREATE TABLE) right? so shouldn't the case sensitive partition names when adding to metastore be also be converted to lowercase and repaired?, [~sershe] Hey, since this is due to FS case sensitivity , am planning to move this ticket as an improvement where I am thinking of adding the partitions that are not in Metastore as follows :

For all the partitions that are not in Metastore from MSCK:
  - check if the partition name matches with the name stored in the Metastore ignoring the case 
     - if matches add to a temporary list else ignore that path

Finally bulk add all the partitions from the temporary list to Metastore with the case-sensitive path corresponding to that parition as location

Kindly, give me your suggestion.
