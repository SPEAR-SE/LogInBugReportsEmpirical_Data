ATTACHMENT ID: 12633569, Hi [~xuefuz] can we commit this when you get a chance?  If possible it would be good to get it in for 0.13.  Thanks., [~szehon] I just notice that there is no test case for this. A test case would be good to prevent future breakage. I can commit this, but could you please create and work on a followup JIRA adding the missing test case?, OK I created it, will work on that one next., Patch committed to trunk. Thanks goes to Szehon for the contribution., committed to 0.13.0 branch]
