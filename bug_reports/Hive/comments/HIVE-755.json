[Talked with Eric offline. We should fix the problem in HiveServer - if the last command is not for Driver, getResult() should return empty result directlry.
, As per discussion with Zheng, fixed the issue from the Hive Server side rather than in the driver.

All tests pass., The changes look good - will merge if the tests pass, Committed in trunk and 0.4 - thanks Eric]
