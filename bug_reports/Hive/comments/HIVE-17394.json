[I've found this problem with Hive-1.1 . Didn't look too closely at Hive-2.x / trunk. But from a high level by looking at the code it seems the problem will also exist there., Attached patch. RB: https://reviews.apache.org/r/62247/, Nice catch!

+1. Will commit if tests pass., The patch looks good to me Anthony., 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:
