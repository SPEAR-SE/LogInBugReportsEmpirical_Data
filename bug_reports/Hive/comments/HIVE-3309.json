[Which version of Hive are you using. This is supposedly fixed via HIVE-3076 Can you try with trunk?, bq. Which version of Hive are you using.?
I am using brahcn-0.9.1. HIVE-3076 is merged to this branch.

, If the query contains partition column of type only string , then non-equality operator throw exception.
Example : 
1. create table ptestfilter (a string, b int) partitioned by (c string, d int);
2. alter table ptestfilter add partition (c='1', d=1);
3. alter table ptestfilter drop partition (c<'2');

In above example, line-3 throws exception. But expected is query should drop partition columns which are less then 2., I am submitting patch with initial thoughts.Please review the patch.
I will submit actual patch with test if current idea is accepted., Patch is not ready for review. Pls submit patch when it is ready for review.]
