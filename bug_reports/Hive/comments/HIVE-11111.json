[Try to set following property:
{code}
set hive.mapred.supports.subdirectories=true;
{code}, [~eyushin] Thanks This fixed my issue.
What are the sides effects of _hive.mapred.supports.subdirectories_ ? Is it safe to set it to _true_ all the time?
Why the default value is not _true_ ?, Use it with caution, cause it allows Hive to walk in subdirs of your table location to find data. Also, it could eliminate partition pruning in case of partitioned tables., Did you manage to fetch data from skewed table? 
I get empty result with select * from testskew., I also have this problem where select data from the skew table.Can you offer me some advice?]
