[Single slash character in source is displayed as double slash in HIVE.

Oracle USS DEALER_DIM.DEALER_NM_TXT = BOB RICHARD TOY\N AUGUSTA
Hive USS_DEALER_DIM.DEALER_NM_TXT = BOB RICHARD TOY\\N AUGUSTA

Below are some findings after analysis:

1. The HDFS file is showing correct data with single slash.
2. Imapala shows correct data.
3. Parquet file created through Hive or Impala,  when viewed through Impala shows correct data while with Hive shows double slash.
4. If we do the substr of this data, both in Hive and Impala only single slash is displayed., Hive is behaving weirdly for this issue. In some cases \ is considered by the length function and in some cases not.And when the data is of maximum length defined due to extra slash last character of the data is being truncated ( as shown in second case below)

Source Data1: BOB RICHARD TOY\N AUGUSTA [Dealer_Dim table]
Length:      25
Hive Data1:  BOB RICHARD TOY"\\"N AUGUSTA
Length: 25

Source Data2: VEH- ALLSTATE-POLICY #-01485550011\08 CLAIM# 2071985861 NOT HAVE CUST HAS NO MED [DST_CASE table]
Length:      80
Hive Data2: VEH- ALLSTATE-POLICY #-01485550011\\08 CLAIM# 2071985861 NOT HAVE CUST HAS NO ME
Length: 80, We are also having a similar issue in our project where the data is HDFS is having a single backslash but when queried with hive, double backslash is displayed. As this field is a varchar(60) and having 60 length, the last character is getting truncated. Hive is considering the escape backslash internally added by the hive program as one character and ignoring the last character in the actual data.

HDFS: 
Org_!@#\ab%^()_test1tt2t928dbb73-e4e4-4c7c-a948-0391ba34f8cf

Hive: 
Org_!@#\\ab%^()_test1tt2t928dbb73-e4e4-4c7c-a948-0391ba34f8c

Clients are missing the 'f' at the end when viewing the data with hive. 

when the data is selected and written to a file, it's displaying correctly. As a work around we are casting the column to String. 

Please let me know if there is any permanent solution for it.
