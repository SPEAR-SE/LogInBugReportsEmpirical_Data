ATTACHMENT ID: 12653750, [~navis] thanks for reviewing the fix.

The test errors do not look related to the fix., [~singhashish] I've tried this patch and found that just not showing closed connection is a little confusional. How about showing it's closed something like,
{code}
0: jdbc:hive2://abclocalhost:10000 (closed)>
{code}
And DatabaseConnection.isClosed() could be implemented by checking connection != null, not adding another state in the class., [~navis] Just to make sure we are on the same page, I am stating my understandings below.

1. Unable to establish connection:
beeline>!connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000
if the connection succeeds:
  0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000>
else
  **beeline throws an error message telling the connection failed**
  beeline>

2. Closing an active connection:
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> Closing: org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveConnection
beeline>

Are you suggesting in case 1, i.e., Unable to establish connection, we should have something like this:
beeline>!connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000
if the connection succeeds:
  0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000>
else
  **beeline throws an error message telling the connection failed**
  0: jdbc:hive2://abclocalhost:10000 (closed)>, Yes, even the connection is not established, metadata for the connection is registered in beeline. User may close it or try reconnect it., [~navis] addressed your comment., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Ashish Kumar Singh., Thanks [~navis]., bq.  ... metadata for the connection is registered in beeline. User may close it or try reconnect it.

Should this be documented in the wiki?, [~leftylev] Seemed not. User can decide action by just seeing the current state in prompt., Thanks [~navis], that's good to know., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
