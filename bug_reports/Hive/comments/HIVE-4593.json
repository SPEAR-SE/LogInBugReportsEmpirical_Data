HIVE-4593 ErrorMsg has several messages that reuse the same error code

All of these errorCode values are associated with more than one message.
10043
10227
10228
10229
10230
10231

This is not right.

This affects ErrorMsg.getErrorMsg(int errorCode) as well as Templeton logic.

Should probably add a JUnit test to check this.
