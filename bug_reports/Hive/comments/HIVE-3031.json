  build fixes to make docs target work

  Running ant docs does not work for two reasons:

  a) ant, when called from the docs target, doesn't know what to do with ivy, presumably because the ivy-init-antlib target hasn't been called.
  b) The velocity jar is not pulled in by ivy, since there's no dependency added to it in ivy.

TEST PLAN
  running 'ant docs' works

INLINE COMMENTS
  build.xml:187 It will be less invasive if we make docs target to depend on ivy-init-antlib, instead of modifying ivy-init-settings target.
