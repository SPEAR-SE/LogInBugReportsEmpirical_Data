[I will be out on vacation from March 26 to March 29, and will return to the office on April 1. During that time please contact Marina Sapozhnikova at (x4937) for MS SQL QA issues, Nataliya Martynovich at (x3662) for general QA inqueries, or Maria Trofimova at (x3771) if you need urgent help with a customer case.
