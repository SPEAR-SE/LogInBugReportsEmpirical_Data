[Zheng, the ant unless attribute just checks to see whether the named property "offline" has been defined; not whether it evaluates to true vs false.  Since your patch defined this property by giving it a default value (false), the unless will cause the ivy:retrieve task to always be skipped.
, Good point, John. I just corrected this.

As long as user do "-Doffline=true" then we don't download anything.
I cannot pass a conditional property to subant, so I have to convert from offline:defined/undefined to is-offline:true/false in build.xml, and then convert it back to offline:defined/undefined in build-common.xml.

This follows the same definition as "offline" in build.xml in hadoop-common. Basically users just need to define it but we don't care about the value of it.
, New patch looks fine to me.
, +1. Will commit if tests pass. , Committed. Thanks Zheng!]
