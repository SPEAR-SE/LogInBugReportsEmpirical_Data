[Looks good - just one minor comment.

Can you add the error message in ErrorMsg.java and then use it, Thanks, Namit. 
You mean the error message ""column alias " + name + " already exists."  We need a parameter 'name' in the error message, so it may not fit in ErrorMsg., There are existing error messages which are used with parameters: look at TABLE_ALREADY_EXISTS.
Cant you follow the same approach ? The only restriction is that the column name will appear at the end,
which might be acceptable., Integrated Namit's suggestions. Thanks, Namit!, Committed. Thanks Yongqiang]
