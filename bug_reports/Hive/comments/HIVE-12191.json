[FYI [~lskuff], [~xuefuz], and [~szehon]. These are the bugs I found while investigating timestamp behavior., Thanks for reporting the problems, [~blue@cloudera.com]. It seems time to realign Hive's timestamp implementations. , Indeed, the timestamp is ripe!, Can we integrate timezone with timestamp, or just use string instead?, Timestamp with time zone is a separate type that stores both the timestamp in UTC and the time zone offset to recover the original local time. I think there is not a great argument for adding it to Hive since timestamp without zone aligns with how applications normally store timestamps, as a long UTC offset independent of the zone. Is there a use case you're thinking of that requires Hive to support it?, Thanks [~rdblue] for the explanations. I was investigating HIVE-14305. When the local timezone has DST, it seems we can't get the correct result with Timestamp.]
