[There is an upgrade script naming error introduced by HIVE-16316. Will wait for that to be fixed before adding this index., [~ekoifman] Can you review the patches? Thanks., Hello, I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release.
, [~ekoifman] Do we want to ship this to both 2.3 and 3.0?, The master patch contains upgrade-2.1.0-to-2.2.0.....sql files but there is no branch-2.2 patch.
Shouldn't it match?

otherwise LGTM

[~wzheng] yes, I think if it's still possible to add it to 2.3 it would be good

, At this moment I'm confused by Hive's release plan. Seems we're going to have a 2.3 release before 2.2. I'm not sure how the upgrade scripts should be., Re-attach patches for branch-2.3, branch-2 and master. At this moment we don't make any change to branch-2.2 as the details for that release is still on the fly.

[~ekoifman] Can you take another look?, what exactly did you change?, I reverted the changes to upgrade scripts 2.1.0-to-2.2.0, and put the changes in upgrade scripts 2.2.0-to-2.3.0. Also reverted changes to schema-2.2 scripts, and put the changes to schema-2.3 scripts.

Basically branch-2.2 is irrelevant to this change. It will only be effective from branch-2.3 and above., since you delete the old files I can't diff the patches any more ..., Yeah I shouldn't have done that. But here're the deleted attachments I found from history:
