[I did a grep on these removed variables, it seems TestJdbcWithMiniHS2 is the only left out place. cc-ing [~thejas].

Thanks
Hari, FYI, hive-default.xml.template is generated from HiveConf.java (since 0.14.0 with HIVE-6037) so the removal of hive.server2.thrift.http.max.worker.threads from HiveConf.java got propagated to hive-default.xml.template at its next regeneration.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12724749 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Linking it to the jira that caused this test failure., org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestSSL.testSSLFetchHttp is a related failure. [~hsubramaniyan] this might need some investigation., Should we revert fix for HIVE-10271 until this is resolved? This is causing the pre-commits to fail. Thanks, Just looked at the test logs. TestSSL.testSSLFetchHttp doesnt look like its related to this patch, but might need separate investigation.

+1 for this. , Since this is causing precommit to fail, i'll commit the fix right away (& fix is trivial)., Committed to trunk. Thanks [~hsubramaniyan]., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
