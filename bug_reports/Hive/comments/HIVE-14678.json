[Making the engine setting case sensitive - other checks around the codebase assume it's lowercase., [~ashutoshc] does this make sense?, LGTM +1, [~sershe], how about noting in the description of *hive.execution.engine* that the value must be lowercase?  Also, replacing "MR" with "MapReduce" would help avoid misunderstanding:

{quote}
Chooses execution engine. Options are: mr (Map reduce, default), tez, spark. While MR remains the default engine for historical reasons, it is itself a historical engine and is deprecated in Hive 2 line. It may be removed without further warning.
{quote}

Just as a nit, "Map reduce" could be changed to "MapReduce" too.,
