  HIVE-2913: Running BlockMergeTask through its main() interface should honor jobconf properties

  BlockMergeTask has a main() and when used directly (instead of say partition concatenate feature), the -jobconf arguments are not honored. This is not something most people directly use.

  Usage:
  BlockMergeTask -input <colon seperated input paths>  -outputDir outputDir [-jobconf k1=v1 [-jobconf k2=v2] ...]

  To reproduce:
  Run BlockMergeTask with say -jobconf mapred.job.name=test and launched job will have a different name.
