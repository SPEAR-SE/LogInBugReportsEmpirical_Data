[The problem is that this union all query is parsed as (query) union all (query + order by/limit) instead of (query union all query) order by /limit. This has been there since we introduced top level unions and the workaround is to use a subquery to express the union. I don't think this should hold up .14.

Here's the ast for 

{noformat}
select * from store union all select * from store order by s_store_sk
{noformat}

{noformat}, [~pxiong] i think you fixed this already, correct? , Yes. Order by should be applied to the whole union. [~mmokhtar], could you please try with the latest trunk? Thanks., Has already been fixed.]
