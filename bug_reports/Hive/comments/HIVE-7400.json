{code}, ~Gopal V which version of hive are you using? With my own hive environment, I can only get the wrong result
By the way, What's Tez?, [~darranl]: I am using hive-14 which is the only branch in development at the moment.

And Tez is the new faster execution engine for Hive on Hadoop-2 clusters - http://www.slideshare.net/t3rmin4t0r/hivetez-a-performance-deep-dive/3, ~gopalv : Thank you. Now I see some. 
But I'm using hive-11 and it's not easy for me to upgrade hive-11 to hive-14 for a variety of reasons. Did you know whether there's a kind of patch based on hive-11 could solve this bug?]
