 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, TestSchemaTool is not related to this and missing_overwrite just needs an update of golden file. But *dynamic_partition_pruning tests are showing a bug in trunk, not recognizing alias of join source. ,

 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Fails seemed not related to this. [~cwsteinbach] Could you review this?, Changes in *dynamic_part_pruning tests are interesting. 
{code}
EXPLAIN select count(*) from srcpart left join srcpart_date on (srcpart.ds = srcpart_date.ds)
{code}

After this change left is now considered as alias for srcpart, whereas user intended it to indicate left outer join. Queries as modified in patch results in inner join with left as alias for table. This is not the intention of that use case, which is wanting to test left outer joins. Can you test instead following queries work 
{code}
EXPLAIN select count(*) from srcpart left outer join srcpart_date on (srcpart.ds = srcpart_date.ds)
{code}
If this does work, than we need to document that outer keyword is no longer optional while trying to do left or right outer joins. If this doesnt work or if we want to support original query that means user necessarily need to have alias while using left or outer joins. Is that what we want? It will be good to see what other dbs (like mysql / postgres etc) do in these cases., [~ashutoshc] My bad that I've missed those. I've tested on mysql and confirmed that reserved keywords are not allowed as alias. I think some(most) of keywords are safe to be used as alias but it will introduce more confusion. [~cwsteinbach], What do you think about that?, Keep current behavior to minimize confusion. Feel free to open this issue whenever it's needed to be.]
