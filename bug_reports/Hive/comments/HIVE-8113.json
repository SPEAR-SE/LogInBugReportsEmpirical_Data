[cc-ing [~sushanth] for review, +1, Looks good to me., Actually, I was thinking about this further, and as I was getting ready to commit this patch, I saw this comment in metastore/pom.xml:

{noformat}
<!-- XXX we probably shouldn't be shipping this but the tests depend on it -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.derby</groupId>
  <artifactId>derby</artifactId>
  <version>${derby.version}</version>
</dependency>
{noformat}

and that made me wonder why we use that dependency in that pom.xml without specifying scope as test, and that made me think again about including derbynet also as a core dependency, which I don't think we should. I think the way to proceed ahead with this would be to do the following:

a) Create a new profile (maybe called "windows" ?). There already seems to be a profile called windows-test (maybe combine with that?)
b) Add the derbynet dependency in as a dependency only if that profile is active, and add it in a packaging scope, not in compile or test. Adding it in the compile scope will guarantee that it's available in lib/, but the problem with that is that we'll pass on those additional dependencies to any other modules that want to include this even as a compile-time dependency.
c) Additionally, we should probably change that derby dependency to be limited to test scope as well.
