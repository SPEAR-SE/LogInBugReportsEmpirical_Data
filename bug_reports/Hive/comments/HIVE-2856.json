[In testcase escape1.q:


Seems '^' also needs to be escaped.

If add:

SELECT count from escape_raw;
SELECT count from escape1;

into escape1.q

escape1 only get 127 rows, while, escape_raw get 128 rows(note that escapetest.txt has 128 rows).

one row missing in escape1, which is the '^'.
, 1. '^' should be escaped
2. the previous escape1.q.out is incorrect, the '^' row is always missing in table escape1. table escape1 has one less row than escape_raw.
3. #1 and #2 together leads to testcase escape1 always passing
4. for some reason, escape1.q.out is loaded as binary file, not ascii file. git diff could not get diffs for binary file
5. This patch only includes code changes and escape1.q change. escape1.q.out not included(could not get via git diff), 1. '^' should be escaped
