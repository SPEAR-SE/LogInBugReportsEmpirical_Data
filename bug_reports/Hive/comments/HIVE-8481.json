[[~prasadm] Could you check this? I think this should be fixed also in hive-0.14.0., I don't see SUCCESS_WITH_INFO_STATUS used anywhere in server side. So the use of verifySuccessWithInfo does not make sense. Looks like we should clean it up and replace the calls to it with verifySuccess .
But I don't understand how/if the change in HIVE-8186 is causing the test failure.
