[Hmm they didn't fail here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9264?focusedCommentId=14281959&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14281959

I guess we'll have to keep tracking this., Yeah, I think monitoring makes sense. I don't know if anything has changed but since build 2015 everything seems fine. Before that we've had the 2+ hours build, presumably because of hanging tests. Please let me know if you see it again. , Haven't seen this happen recently.]
