[I was looking into perf driver problems when I've noticed this...
[~alangates] does this small upgrade script is missing? ...or its covered ; but I've missed it how :)
, You are correct that this was missed in the metastore/scripts/upgrade/derby upgrade files.Â  However, now that HIVE-18775 is in, this shouldn't matter as schematool should now be properly pulling the install and upgrade scripts from standalone-metastore/src/main/sql/derby instead., thank you [~alangates]! then I'll just close this :)]
