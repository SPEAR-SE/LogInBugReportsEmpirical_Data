[Attaching a patch for review with the following changes:
- kinit with relevant user between individual tests
- rolled hcat-authorization and jobstatus tests into test-multi-users target in build.xml, can "test-multi-users" target be run in non-secure cluster and still have it test something meaningful?
If so, then the changes look good.  If not, I'm concerned that moving tests from "test" will make them be run less often during normal dev cycle...
, Thanks [~ekoifman] for the review! Yes, the test can be run on non-secure clusters as well and does provide value in testing multi-user scenarios for validating user/group permissions., +1, Patch committed to trunk.]
