[At least returning {{-1}} in the interim would be good, no?, According to java.sql.Statement docs getUpdateCount retrieves the current result as an update count if there are multiple results returned from the query, or returns -1 if there is only one or no more results available. Current implementation of getUpdateCount in HiveStatement always returns 0, which may cause a failure of respective software expecting it to return -1 in most cases, as more often there is just one resultset available. It seems full implementation of getUpdateCount will also require at least getMoreResults and overall support of multiple resultsets per query., Returning -1 as suggested above would at least give a correct indication to the client software about the expectations of this implementation., This has been changed in the meantime to always return -1 but it'd be great if Hive could return the correct number when it knows it.]
