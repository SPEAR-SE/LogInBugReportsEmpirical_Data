thanks for making this work on Mac., I found the patch stopped working the trunk now. I'm uploading a new patch based on Carl's previous patch. This patches solves the following compilation errors:
 1) assert.h should be included in hiveclienthelper.cpp
 2) if boost is included other than the /usr/include or the C compiler's default include directory, compilation error since boost/include cannot be found. I modified the odbc/build.xml and odbc/Makefile to add a variable boost.home so that you can pointing it to the boost's the install directory. Say if you install boost and thrift in /opt/local, you can compile the ODBC client by 

{code}
  $ ant compile-cpp -Dthrift.home=/opt/local -Dboost.home=/opt/local -Dword.size=32
{code}
, +1 works for me!, Committed to branch-0.4, 0,5 and trunk. Thanks Carl and Ning!
