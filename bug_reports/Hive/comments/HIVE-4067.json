, I started getting following errors while compiling after HIVE-701 This patch doesn't address these.
{noformat}
[java] error(111): /home/ashutosh/hive/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/HiveParser.g:303:10: reference to attribute outside of a rule: KEY
     [java] error(111): /home/ashutosh/hive/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/HiveParser.g:303:10: reference to attribute outside of a rule: VALUE
     [java] error(111): /home/ashutosh/hive/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/HiveParser.g:303:10: reference to attribute outside of a rule: ELEM
     [java] error(146): /home/ashutosh/hive/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/HiveParser.g:303:10: invalid StringTemplate % shorthand syntax: '%")'
{noformat}

I also suspect its because of this, we later get 
{noformat}
     [java] Java Result: 1

at the conclusion of grammar compilation. The way we compile grammar is by calling out to java process from within ant which runs org.antlr.Tool to compile grammar. This java process used to return with return code = 0 before HIVE-701 but now returns with return code = 1 which implies some error condition. My suspicion its the error which I have pointed out is causing this. We should fix both these problems. , This is referring to the Java code in the @members section. The section is still being properly inserted into the generated HiveParser.java file, which then compiles fine, so I don't know why ANTLR is complaining. I'll look into it., Can you expand a bit on what was the motivation for HIVE-701. SQL standard 2003 http://developer.mimer.se/validator/sql-reserved-words.tml lists many keywords as reserved, which we don't consider reserved anymore. We should strive to be standard compliant., The primary motivation was that it was tricky to add new keywords, which are almost always reserved words by default in Hive, because doing so could easily break existing queries. The changes for HIVE-701 make it easy to add non-reserved keywords in the future. HIVE-701 also removes the reserved status of most keywords, to prevent recently introduced keywords from breaking queries.

I can undo the changes for the Hive keywords which are reserved in SQL 2003, but would there be any reason to do so besides to adhere to the standard, given that the grammar can support leaving them non-reserved?, sxyuan updated the revision "HIVE-4067 [jira] Followup to HIVE-701: reduce ambiguity in grammar".

  Fix for error messages in grammar compilation.
