[Good catch, Jason, thanks for the update. +1.

It looks like I'd missed these when I worked on HIVE-8485. That said, I now wonder how we could proactively find other cases where we might have a similar problem that we've not yet realized exist(I verified now that master has only 3 .putToParameters calls, all of which you've changed) - it's also possible for new code being introduced to not use this without realizing the impact, and since our test framework runs mainly on Derby and sometimes MySQL, it's quite possible for us to miss it and have to patch it later., re-uploading patch to kick off unit tests, 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:
