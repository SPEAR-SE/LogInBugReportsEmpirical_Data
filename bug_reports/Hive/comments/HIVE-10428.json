ATTACHMENT ID: 12727013 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, [~sushanth] another one I'd like to get in for 1.2, +1 for inclusion to 1.2.

Added to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+1.2+Release+Status, [~jdere] Actually bug is in o.a.hive.hcatalog.mapreduce.InternalUtil::getSerdeProperties() where it is not setting comments in properties object it is passing to serde in initializeDeserializer() of same class. Its better to fix bug there so that we dont have to make change of current patch in all possible serdes.
 , Attaching patch v2, which makes the fix in InternalUtil.getSerdeProperties(), +1,
