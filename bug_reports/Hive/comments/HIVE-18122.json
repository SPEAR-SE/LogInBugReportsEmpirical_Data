[Until non-native tables officially support being created with "PARTITIONED BY", changing the InitializeInput line:

{noformat}
if (table.getPartitionKeys().size() != 0) {
{noformat}

to:

{noformat}
if (!table.isNonNative() && table.getPartitionKeys().size() != 0) {
{noformat}

seems like a reasonable solution. The data selection filter could then presumably be supplied to the storage handler and everything would work as expected.]
