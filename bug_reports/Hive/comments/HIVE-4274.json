[This bug manifests as a failure when one tries to ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION or DROP TABLE.

I'll post a fix for this shortly., I've fixed this as part of HIVE-7341. {{HCatTable.owner(String)}} allows the owner-string to be set manually. Also, {{HCatTable}} instances constructed from existing tables in the metastore set the owner correctly, as seen from {{HCatTable::HCatTable(Table)}}. Available in trunk, branch-0.14., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
