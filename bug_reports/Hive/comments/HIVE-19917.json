[[~jdere] could you review please?  this only adds a test - don't think we even to take up a build queue spot, Does the "create database foo" have to happen before "drop table if exists " + tblName?, since drop has a "if exists" it doesn't matter - at least when I run both tests I don't see any issues

 , Ok, +1, committed to branch-3, master

thanks Jason for the review, This is released in Hive 3.1.0.]
