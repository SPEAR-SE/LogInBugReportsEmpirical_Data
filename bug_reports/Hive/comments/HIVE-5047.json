, [~ashutoshc] Ping?, ashutoshc has requested changes to the revision "HIVE-5047 [jira] Hive client filters partitions incorrectly via pushdown in certain cases involving "or"".

  Wondering whether we should go into the function only in cases when its AND ?

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ppr/PartitionPruner.java:270 Isn't the better fix following:
  -  if (udf instanceof GenericUDFOPAnd ||  udf instanceof GenericUDFOPOr )
  + if (udf instanceof GenericUDFOPAnd )

, What do you mean? It can be an arbitrarily complex combo. Right now it's bottom up so children become null if they cannot be sent, and "eliminate" the parents, so we don't know the result before we call it in children.
Also if both sides of "or" are available then it is valid to sent it up.
, +1 seems like automated tests didnt kick in. If you have run all the tests, can you post the result of your run?, I didn't press submit patch. Pressing now..., 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass
