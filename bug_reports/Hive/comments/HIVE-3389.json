@Ashutosh, there is still some problem:
When I was trying to run:
ant test -Dhadoop.mr.rev=23 -Dtest.print.classpath=true -Dhadoop.version=2.0.0-alpha -Dhadoop.security.version=2.0.0-alpha -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=tst.q
where tst.q had the line:
â€“ INCLUDE_HADOOP_MAJOR_VERSIONS(0.23)
I expected that test to go through, but that test was skipped.
[junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver
[junit] Begin query: tst.q
[junit] QTestUtil: tst.q INCLUDE list does not contain Hadoop Version 0.20S. Skipping...
[junit] Cleaning up TestCliDriver
[junit] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 11.442 sec
Can you take a look ?

@Sushanth, I haven't debugged this. The test classpath for 1l seems to be correct.
It is containing the jars from build/ivy/lib/hadoop0.23.shim., I think you need HIVE-3029, Namit, I hit a similar issue a while back and Ashutosh pointed me to the patch in HIVE-3029 - I tested with tst.q as you mentioned, and if I apply HIVE-3029, it isn't skipped., duplicate of HIVE-3029]
