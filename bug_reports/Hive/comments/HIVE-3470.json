, Comments on phabrictor, The correct/simpler fix would be to add the table as an input.
I dont think that should break anything.

The might be an issue with concurrency, since we would acquire read locks on the table. Cant think of anything obvious that would go wrong., One of the problems with adding Table as an input is that all DDL operations on the table would block.
For eg:

alter table set tblProperties etc.

would block while someone is selecting from any partition., This JIRA is no longer needed. We will implement a patch internally. ]
