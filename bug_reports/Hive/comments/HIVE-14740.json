[There seem to be 3 things... node set from which dead nodes should be removed but aren't. Active instance set, that was only used in specific-node scheduling, but not in random scheduling, until recently. And then there's isAlive.
I wonder if so many ways to find if node is alive are needed., isAlive is required since nodes can be temporarily disabled outside of ZK state. May be possible to remove the map after looking at what it's used for., [~sseth], will this go into 2.3.0? Thanks., I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker.]
