, This issue is closed now. It was released with the fix in 0.9.0. If there is a problem, please open a new jira and link this one with that., Hi guys,

There is a use case I have attached: ppd-dropped-filter.q. The last 2 insert queries in the file contain following 'in' predicates:
where t3.crit5 in ('a' , 'b' ) and where t3.crit5 in ('c' , 'd' , 'e' )

The explain output doesn't contain Filter Operators for these 'in' predicates. This results in execution of incorrect query (without in clauses). 

The workaround is set hive.ppd.remove.duplicatefilters=false;

Is this use case related to this patch?, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #54 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/54/])
