[Tricky to have a test for this one, A unit test is just about impossible, so I was only able to run a manual test:

1. With a running DFS, I issued a create table command that would create a FileSystem object.
2. The DFS was shut down, and a create table command was issued again. This threw an IOException which would have cleared the cache.
3. The DFS was restarted, and I verified that a new create table command succeeded. 

Given that this is a straightforward change, the above should be sufficient to demonstrate that this doesn't break anything. 
, +1, Committed. Thanks Paul]
