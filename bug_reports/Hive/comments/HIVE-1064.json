[* Fixes NPE by updating signature of ExecDriver.initialize().
* Add @Override annotation initialize() methods.
* Remove unnecessary initialize() methods.
, Carl, there are a lot of conflicts when applying this patch to the latest trunk. It may be because of the two large patches committed recently. There should not be further large patches in recently, can you  resolve the conflicts and resubmit a new patch? I'll start reviewing right away from there., Also can you add a unit test?, * Updated the patch against trunk.
* Will open another JIRA to track adding a distributed mode testcase.
, +1. The code changes looks good. Will commit once the  tests pass. 

One questions though: what are the situation you see this NPE? I cannot reproduce it from trunk., @Ning: I'm running Hive on top of an 0.18.3 pseudo-distributed mode cluster.
Any query requiring an MR phase produces an NPE in ExecDriver.execute() 
because the ExecDriver.initialize() method is not getting called. , Thanks Carl. 

The parallel test failed on hadoop 0.17.2.1. I'll rerun tests in sequential., Carl, please remember to open a JIRA for adding a unit test if possible. That's the best way to prevent this happening in the future. , @Ning: See HIVE-1080
