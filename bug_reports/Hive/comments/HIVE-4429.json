, hi, Mihir Kulkarni 
i run the first sql of your cases, but in my hive-0.9, it produces correct result.it is the following.
30.0    1.0
20.0    1.0
10.0    1.0
30.0    2.0
20.0    2.0
10.0    2.0
30.0    3.0
20.0    3.0
10.0    3.0
60.0    4.0
50.0    4.0
40.0    4.0
60.0    5.0
50.0    5.0
40.0    5.0
60.0    6.0
50.0    6.0
40.0    6.0

so can you tell which version you used.

Isn't the output you mentioned above wrong? Because my first sql says

*ORDER BY d0 ASC, d1 DESC*

And the output you get is *d1 ASC d0 DESC*, It should make two MR not one MR, and hive on trunk seemed fixed by HIVE-2340. Disable rs-dedup for a walkaround (hive.optimize.reducededuplication=false), Mihir Kulkarni
sorry, my mistakes.

yes, there are some bugs in reducededuplication, i donot confirm that it is fixed.but i think the inner order by can be removed in this case.]
