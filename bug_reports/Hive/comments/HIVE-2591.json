[> java.lang.VerifyError: Expecting a stackmap frame at branch target 76 in method 

Means you are using JDK1.7 and the DataNucleus enhancer uses ASM3.x (JDK1.6 java bytecode). You can use the tip at the end of this post
http://www.datanucleus.org/servlet/forum/viewthread_thread,6799_lastpage,yes#lastpost
to use JDK1.7 with current DataNucleus, you should use jdk 1.6 
because jdk1.7 jdbc interface has some change.
