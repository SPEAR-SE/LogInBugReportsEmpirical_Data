[create table nzhang_ctas5 row format delimited fields terminated by ',' lines terminated by '.' stored as textfile as select key, value from src sort by key, value limit 10;

select * from nzhang_ctas5;


Modified ctas.q to add the following:

Got only 1 row as the output.
, This is not fixable currently because the line terminator is determined by LineRecordReader.LineReader which is in the Hadoop land.
However we do support writing to such tables.

In order to avoid confusion, I will just drop this from the syntax.
, talked with Zheng offline - it might be easier to specify a semantic error instead for compatiblity, +1. Looks good. Will commit if tests pass., oh, sorry, ignore my previous comment., This one keeps the old syntax but will throw out an error in case anything breaks.
, ctas.q has a CTAS with line delimiter specified - that also breaks, the tests need to be modified, Fixed ctas.q and also tested all test cases., +1

looks good - will commit if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Zheng]
