[This is more serious than it first appears.  If you join two tables, and they both have a column with the same name, then there is no way to specify the order by clause in a query that also has group by.  Even with no alias of the table name, just preceding the column name with the table name causes an error.

For example:

SELECT threaded_flight.flight_id, min(threaded_track.altitude) 
FROM threaded_flight JOIN threaded_track ON (threaded_flight.flight_id = threaded_track.flight_id)  
GROUP BY  threaded_flight.flight_id   
ORDER BY  threaded_flight.flight_id

gives the error:

"Error in semantic analysis: line 1:219 Invalid Table Alias or Column Reference threaded_flight"

The query works without the ORDER BY.  , I have slightly different symptoms but they seem to be related:


select  dist Group1 , count(*) x from cars_tab order by dist;
FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: Line 1:43 Invalid table alias or column reference dist

However, if I use the column alias (Group1), it passes:
select  dist Group1 , count(*) x from cars_tab order by Group1;]
