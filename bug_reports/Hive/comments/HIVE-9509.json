ATTACHMENT ID: 12695340 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sershe] - Generally more validation is better than less. However which cases does this validate? I was unsure about that so I decided we should revert the whole thing., Validation of values was added by [~vikram.dixit] iirc in some other JIRA.
