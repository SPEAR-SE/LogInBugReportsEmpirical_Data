[Mikhail,
A recent fix went into trunk in this area via HIVE-3537, so you may want to test your scenario on latest trunk. , mbautin requested code review of "[jira] [HIVE-3913] Fix possible deadlock in ZK lock manager".
Reviewers: ashutoshc, njain, kevinwilfong, JIRA

  ZK Hive lock manager can get into a state when the connection is closed, but no reconnection is attempted.

, [~ashutoshc]: thanks for pointing this out. I took a look at HIVE-3537, and I think this is a much simpler fix for a situation that I observed when the client attempts to acquire a lock, but the ZK connection is closed for some reason and no reconnection is attempted., mbautin has commented on the revision "[jira] [HIVE-3913] Fix possible deadlock in ZK lock manager".

  This patch also logs some exceptions that were previously ignored for easier debugging.

, Mikhail,
Change looks alright. But can you explain how you got in this situation, where connection was closed after it was already opened. Any easy way to reproduce the scenario?, ashutoshc has accepted the revision "[jira] [HIVE-3913] Fix possible deadlock in ZK lock manager".
