[This is not an attempt to pass the buck.

We do not officially support any particular RDBMS. However we defacto support Derby and MySQL. 
http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/rdbms/support.html 
Datanucleus claims to support ms-sql2005 so maybe the issue should be taken up there. We have at least proved we are doing something correct by working with two of their other supported databases., Hi, did anyone have much resolving this issue?

I’m also experiencing this issue with SQL server 2005. I’ve enabled DEBUG logging for DataNucleus & JPOX in hive-log4j.properies and can see that the table COLUMNS (and other tables) create statement is never executed. Is this a DataNucleus problem or is this because Hive is not issuing the create table statement? I thought if this was a DataNucleus problem then the logs would show a create table COLUMNS  exception but I can not see the statement even being executed?

Any thoughts much appreciated.

Many thanks,

Andy.
, One thing i did notice in the logs ....

2011-03-24 10:06:58,561 DEBUG Datastore.Schema (Log4JLogger.java:debug(58)) - Check of existence of COLUMNS returned table type of VIEW

... so hive (or data nucleus?) does not try to create the table. I can confim that SQL server has a default COLUMNS view on our database. Any ideas how to work around this with Hive if this is a DataNucleus issue?

Thanks, Andy. , From what I understand SQLServer has the notion of a "default schema" (usually dbo) which is used to resolve identifiers that are not defined in a user's current schema. I think you need to either undefine the default schema for your metastore user account, or else make it point to the metastore schema.
