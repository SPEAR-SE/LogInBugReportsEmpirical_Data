[Attaching tests to show what I'm talking about. Note that this is not a solution patch, just some unit tests., I think at least part of this is a bug in Avro. If you follow the flow of canDeserializeNullableEnums (in the attached patch of tests), inside of the first call to verifyNullableType GenericData properly validates the record. Despite this, the call to GenericDatumWriter.write inside of AvroGenericRecordWritable explodes because it's unable to resolve a String against a [null, ENUM]. Especially when the same sequence of validate followed by write works in the non-union case for canDeserializeEnums, that looks like a problem in Avro.

I'll follow up there, depending on the fix this issue might be obviated., Good catch.  Let me take a look., This looks like a manifestation of [AVRO-997|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-997]. I'll reopen the discussion on that ticket., Subsumed by HIVE-3528]
