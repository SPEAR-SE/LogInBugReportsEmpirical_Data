[Attached the patch-1: seems we are trying to resolve the column info from the parent OP to child OP by alias. But alias should be visible to the children and the internalName is visible to the parents., Attached patch-2: for the cases when the column has both name and alias, we will use NamedColumnInfo which will match against column name during comparison rather than alias since alias is not visible yet for such cases.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12793853 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~aihuaxu] Can you create a RB for this ?, [~ashutoshc] I haven't had a final solution yet. Seems my solutions would fix the issue but also break valid constant propagation. I think it's on the right direction: for select operators, an alias and internal name are not enough. We should have another columnName if it's mapped to table column (e.g., select col1 as alias). The parent ops would only see col1 but child ops would only see alias. Right now, we ignore col1 but use alias always.

I'm working on it but seems to need bigger changes. Will create RB when it's ready.  , Attached patch-4: for non-cbo case, we will keep track of the select column's original expression and use that rather than using the alias to match against another column info. We will not do that for cbo case since cbo has optimized AST tree and may not have the original expression. , [~pxiong] Is this same as HIVE-13602 ? , [~ashutoshc], i just checked the problem that [~aihuaxu] mentioned in this jira. It seems that it is quite related to HIVE-13602. I also test the problem in this jira and it disappears with the patch in HIVE-13602., Thanks [~pxiong] for testing this out. So, it seems we only need one patch to solve these 2 problems. I haven't looked at either patch yet but seems like we can commit either of these. [~aihuaxu] What do you think?, [~ashutoshc], thanks for your comments. I totally agree with you. I just briefly reviewed [~aihuaxu]'s patch and i think the main difference is that his patch is improving the tableAlias/colAlias matching and my patch is completely dropping the tableAlias/colAlias matching method., That's great news. I will take a look at HIVE-13602 to see the implementation. It's possible that HIVE-13602 is a better approach since I'm not familiar with CBO and had bypassed CBO to just get noncbo to work. Let me take a look. Thanks for the info., I checked the patch HIVE-13602 and verified multiple scenarios for cbo and non-cbo. All worked.  HIVE-13602 seems to be a better fix. I will dup this to HIVE-13602.

I didn't verify for other affected operators like union though., HIVE-13602 seems is a better way to fix this issue.]
