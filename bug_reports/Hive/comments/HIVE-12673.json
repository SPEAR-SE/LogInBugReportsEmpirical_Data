[[~prasanth_j] - Please review when you find time, The problem is JSONObject is in incomplete state. I think we should fix that. 

1) If the files list is empty or null return at the beginning of the function
2) line:208. Add else condition and do writer.endObject() to finish the object as 'done'
, Exiting early from printJsonMetaData when files are not present., +1, Reuploading for Precommit run, rebasing the patch., Not sure why this patch was not picked by Precommit QA. Retrying again.,
