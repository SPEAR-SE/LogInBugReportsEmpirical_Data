[Could you post the queries that failed? Thx., Thx for your response. It's just a normal query. I generate this query from a protobuf file. I stored my protobuf messages using parquet format in hive. And the protobuf has nested fields. There's no problem in create table and create view when my nest is struct -> array -> struct. but create view failed when struct -> array -> struct -> array -> struct.]
