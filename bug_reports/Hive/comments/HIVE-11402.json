[Comment from earlier discussion with [~vgumashta] and  [~jdere] - In Hive SessionState since there are several fields that are associated with the currently executing query, such as commandType, lastCommand. Also SessionState has a Conf object and this also gets set with query-specific information., From [~ekoifman] - Each SessionState has 1 instance of HiveTxnManager which can only handle 1 txn at a time. 
While JDBC spec doesn't make concurrency guarantees explicit, most info on the web says it's a bad idea to allow this.
For example, suppose you setAutoCommit(false) and then run to statements concurrently on this Connection, would you expect 1 transaction for each statement or 1 txn for both.
, HIVE-4239 only allows parallel compilation between sessions, [~sershe] Thanks for clarifying, I had forgotten about the SessionState.get().getCompileLock()  that you added. I will update the description.
Looks like we can still have issues outside of compilation, during parallel query execution within session., bq. Note that running queries in parallel for single session is not straightforward with jdbc, you need to spawn another thread as the Statement.execute calls are blocking. I believe ODBC has non blocking query execution API ...

I made a couple mistakes when I designed the HS2 API (the use of Thrift Enums and Unions comes to mind), but by far the biggest mistake was allowing a 1:many relationship between Sessions and Operations. At the time I thought there was a chance that the ODBC spec required this, but now think this is something best handled on the client side. Providing support for the 1:many Session:Operation mapping results in a lot of additional complexity on the server-side, only to yield a feature with a very high potential for misuse.

Rather than temporarily serializing operations against a given session, I propose instead that we enforce a 1:1 mapping between HS2 sessions and active operations. This is a backward incompatible change, but one which I think will yield far better results in the long term., Simple patch that adds a semaphore to acquire/release methods, configurable and on by default (parallel operations are off, rather). [~thejas] can you take a look? Esp. wrt what is an operation and what isn't, e.g. should fetching results be allowed to run in parallel with other things?

I will post an RB shortly, HiveSessionImpl is starting to look a lot like SessionState. I suppose that was inevitable :(,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12815513 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~sershe] Do you still observe parallel operation issues in the single session? I have separated QueryState out of SessionState in HIVE-13424. From previous comments, seems it's also common to share operations in the same session like in HUE. Should we continue to fix parallel issue if we have any rather than disallowing parallel execution?, This patch has been changed to allow it by default. This is just a safety flag if someone sees issues.
Last time I checked, the runtime parallel operations in the same session work purely by magic (I think I left a comment somewhere).
I.e. I believe they may work but there's no good reason why they do, because non-thread-safe objects appear to be used without synchronization; there may be some bugs.

cc [~thejas], hmm. Yeah. Saw your comments in HiveSessionImpl and we do have issues  that some variables in SessionState are not protected for multiple threads.

Seems to make sense to have such option and continue fixing the thread-safe issue. Just wondering if the option is set to false, what kind of effect to the new operation in the same session? will it just get blocked to get the previous one finished?  

, Yeah, there's a single-entry semaphore that controls the execution of most operations (not e.g. fetchresults, or cancel operation :)), [~aihuaxu] do you have more input on the patch? , Just worried how useful that configuration will be since mostly the users will use mixed HUE, beeline, etc, I guess. So we may have to keep the default. But seems this is safe to add.

+1., Sorry about the delay in reviewing.
This will however not disallow query execution in parallel when the query execution is done asynchronously (the default mode with our jdbc driver).
, Maybe pass the lock object to operation async execution and have it release it when its done ?
ie, send it all way to SQLOperation.runInternal .., The handling for async ops, as well as some refactoring. Thanks for the pointer!,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12817230 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, +1 Changes look good. Please verify the UT failures are not related.
, [~sershe] Can you also add a simple test to ensure that the queries get serialized ? (So we know this feature works :p )

Something like - 
HiveStatement stmt1 = (HiveStatement)  con.createStatement();
HiveStatement stmt2 = (HiveStatement) con.createStatement();
stmt1.executeAsync(create table t(i int));
stmt1.executeAsync(insert into t select sleepUDF(1))
stmt2.executeAsync(select * from t ) 
verify above statement returned 1 row



, See TestJdbcDriver2 for example. We would ofcourse need the config to be set to prevent parallel query in the test suite.
, Added the test as suggested. I am not familiar with the setup of this test so I wouldn't vouch for its relevance ;), Also rebased the patch., Test case looks good. (though i would have preferred the use of a sleepUDF to guarantee how long the first query would take).
Just some minor comments about comments in reviewboard.
+1 with the review comments addressed.
, Changed the test to use sleep UDF, and sleep for half a second, Will commit after HiveQA,
