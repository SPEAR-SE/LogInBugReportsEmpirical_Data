[According to [~jpullokkaran]'s comments, add the following things to do

1. When a fully qualified identifier (db.tablename) is specified in the from clause we seems to resolve it against CTE aliases. This is wrong if table doesn't exist in catalog then we should fail.
2. If fully qualified name is not used in the from clause then 
a) we should first resolve the identifier against CTE aliases 
b) if identifier is not found in the CTE list then try to resolve against catalog.
3) Views: in unparsetranslator we treat CTE name as catalog table; this is a bug., We will address this in this patch, i.e., when there is an alias in CTE and catalog, we prefer CTE., first patch, may need to update q files.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12733058 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~jpullokkaran], the failed tests are unrelated. It seems that the patch passes all the CTE tests in cte_1.q, cte_2.q, cbo_views.q and also two negative tests. Could you recommend some more tests? Thanks., [~ashutoshc], could you please review it? Thanks., +1, Pushed to master. Thanks, Pengcheng!]
