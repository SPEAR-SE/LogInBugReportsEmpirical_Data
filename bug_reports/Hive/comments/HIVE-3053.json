[Here is only the place to get support for apache release versions of hive. IF you are running a patched hive it is better to contact the vendor (Cloudera) because they likely have errata on the issue. If you are getting an error like hive-log4j.properties not found you likely have a classpath issue and your install is not finding your conf directory., Hi Edward,

Thanks for the response. The problem was actually that the patch took longer than normal to update on all the nodes of the cluster and hence was not working fine. It works now though it still shows "hive-log4j.properties not found".

Thanks,
Vikas]
