[e.g., {{upgrade-0.14.0-to-1.1.0.mssql.sql}} fails with {{'005-HIVE-9296.mssql.sql;': Invalid filename}}, +1, [~hhuang2014], i think we need to update upgrade-1.2.0-to-1.3.0.mssql.sql，upgrade-1.2.0-to-2.0.0.mssql.sql，upgrade-2.0.0-to-2.1.0.mssql.sql as well?, combined both of the patches and then pushed to master. Thanks Huan for the patch!
