ATTACHMENT ID: 12749598 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, In general looks good.  We should avoid the System.exit call and use return instead.  We keep the System.exits out in case we're called by another tool.  I can just change that in the patch when I commit it., Thank you for your comment. I attach a patch file which changed System.exit to return., +1, Patch committed to master and branch-1.  Thanks Shinichi.]
