[Also, unit tests which request multiple reducers aren't actually getting them since local mode always uses a single reducer.  We need to enable miniMR for better coverage.  I recently enabled it specifically for one HBase test in HIVE-1295, but we need to do the same for some of the ql tests.
, Need followup on HIVE-1470 here too.
