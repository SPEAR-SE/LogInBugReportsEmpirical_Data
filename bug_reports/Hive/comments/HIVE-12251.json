[This config was added as a part feature in 1.2.0 which will not be backported to 0.14.0. Hence not an issue for 0.14.0, [~prasanth_j] Is this an issue in 1.2.0 that is being tracked in another jira ?
, HIVE-10114 added hive.exec.orc.split.strategy in 1.2.0 and it's documented in the wiki even though the description says "This is not a user level config."
