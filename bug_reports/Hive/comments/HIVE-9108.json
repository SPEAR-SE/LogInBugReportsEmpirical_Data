[I am reverting my hashing fix. 
It seems that storage layer that has the limitation is the correct place to address the limitation, but stats code appears to have one on client layer instead... so I am reverting to the old behavior in case if client doesn't provide the correct key (except before it was failing with a SQL exception of some sort, now it's explicit).

Additionally, I'm changing column size to 4000 from 255, because there's no reason not to.

[~jdere] [~prasanth_j] can you guys take a look?,
