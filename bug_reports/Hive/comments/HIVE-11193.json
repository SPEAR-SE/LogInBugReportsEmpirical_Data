[Attach patch 1., [~ashutoshc] Can you take a look?, I wonder if {{opToDelete}} list contains these operators from first phase. If so, than we can just do {{cppCtx.getOpToDelete().clear()}} at end of ConstantPropagate::transform()  If that indeed is the case, then it will be preferable to do that since in that case we dont have to worry about hashcode() implementation of different operators., Attach patch 2.

[~ashutoshc] I've added the clear() call for opToDelete set. And also added a test q file., +1,
