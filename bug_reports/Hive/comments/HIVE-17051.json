[Second call should be from cache. Were there multiple tables in the same query?., This is a simple query
{noformat}
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM src;
{noformat}
If multiple tables are present (eg. JOIN) each table metadata is requested twice.
, I believe {{CalcitePlanner::genOPTree --> init}} might be resetting the cache, which is forcing the table lookup again during compilation phase.]
