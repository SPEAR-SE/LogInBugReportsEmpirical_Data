[The offending test is heavily using the HDFS ACL API, which is hadoop-2 only, so it won't be easy to fix.

All I can think of is to create a new itests sub-proj that gets compiled and run only in hadoop-2 profile.  It might be useful, as there could be more hadoop-2 features we want to test in the future.  [~hagleitn], [~brocknoland] [~ashutoshc], any thoughts on that?, Submitting a fix, based on that., +1 ,
