[What's Spark version and Hive version you're using? Can you also attach node manager related log as well? Thank you!, I have added version info to environment and attached node manager log., Thank you for attaching the log. Looks like container is exiting with error. Can you also attach application log as well? Thank you!, Maybe RemoteDriver's log is more useful. For yarn-client, you should find it in hive.log on the node which runs the query. For yarn-cluster, it's in the AM log - usually the 1st container of the application., I have attached hive.log.
Although I have confirmed this issue again, container has exited with error not RUNNING state, but the hive process on client server has still remained forever.
I'm sorry that the subject and description were not correct., I have attached a patch that set timeout to future.get().
Applying this patch, hive process has not been stuck and has come to exit.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12837090 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, This patch does not cause these test errors because these errors have existed in the previous PreCommit-HIVE-Build.
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/1991/#showFailuresLink, Thank you for the contribution. LGTM +1. [~lirui], do you have any further comments? , The comments state that RPC server will take care of timeout. If it's not working as expected, I think we'd better find out why., I have encountered the same issue on a testing environment without UNHEALTHY nodes (all of the nodes had been active).
I found that spark-submit.sh had failed due to resource shortage (spark.driver.memory > yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb).
The server-side timeout seems to not work in case of failures on spark-submit.sh and the patch introducing client-side timeout would make it safer.
, Hi [~tzenmyo], thanks for your input. I'll try your scenario and see what I can find.

We already take care of timeout in the Rpc code. Adding another timeout as in the patch may be no harm, but we should at least figure out why the existing logic doesn't work as expected.,
