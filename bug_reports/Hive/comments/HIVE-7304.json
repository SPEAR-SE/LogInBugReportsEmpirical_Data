ATTACHMENT ID: 12652901, [~navis] can you please review this patch, LGTM. +1, Is not null check should be added only if there is no other filter predicate already being present. eg, we are now getting filter predicates as follows where {{is not null}} is redundant.
{code}
((key < 100) and key is not null)
{code}
Perhaps, could be taken up in a follow-up., [~rhbutani] Shall we commit this one and address above concern in a follow-up jira or do you want to take that up in this one only. I am fine either ways., [~ashutoshc] yes i would prefer committing this one. 
Also  [~gopalv] pointed out that in the above e.g. 'key is not null' is useful(performance wise) because the Storage Handler predicate evaluation of  'key < 100' doesn't filter out null valued columns. , I see. In those cases, storage handler should be able to make that kind of inference itself. Storage handler need not to be told from planner that it can extend filters (as evident in this example) itself.

Anyways, committed this one to trunk. Thanks, Harish!, [~ashutoshc]: I agree that the SARGs and filters shouldn't have anything to do with each other, except that one is derived from the other.

SARGS currently use YES, NO, YES_NULL, NO_NULL & NULL as potential evaluation return types.

While filters are limited to YES & NO (or TRUE/FALSE)., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
