[I tried to reproduce but TestEncryptedHDFSCliDriver seems it got stuck in a loop or something. It does not have an end.
Have you had this problem with the current master branch?, [~spena], yes, i can still reproduce that on the current master. You can just save the commands in a q file. If you run that with TestCliDriver, you will have
{code}
STAGE DEPENDENCIES:
  Stage-0 is a root stage

STAGE PLANS:
  Stage: Stage-0
    Fetch Operator
      limit: -1
      Processor Tree:
        TableScan
          alias: unencryptedtable
          Statistics: Num rows: 2 Data size: 22 Basic stats: COMPLETE Column stats: NONE
          Select Operator
            expressions: key (type: string), value (type: string)
            outputColumnNames: _col0, _col1
            Statistics: Num rows: 2 Data size: 22 Basic stats: COMPLETE Column stats: NONE
            ListSink
{code}
This is correct.
However, if you run that with TestEncryptedHDFSCliDriver, you will have
{code}

This is not correct. If you look into more details, you will find that analyze table statement never works. Thanks., [~spena], more information: I actually deployed an encrypted real environment myself over the weekend. In the real environment, the analyze table statement works. Thus, the problem is related with the TestEncryptedHDFSCliDriver framework. Thanks.]
