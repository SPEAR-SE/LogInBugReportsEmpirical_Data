[Hi [~nemon],

org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.mr.HadoopJobExecHelper.runningJobs holds running jobs, if any abrupt shutdown happens shutdown hook uses this running jobs to kill. But in a normal flow after executing the running job it should kill and remove from the list.

In normal flow i suspect before removing from the list, if some exception was thrown (while doing rj.killJob())  it won't remove from the list. I have uploaded a patch to fix this..
Please check this if it helps, Thanks for providing this patch. :)
I think this patch will help. And it will take time to proven it on the cluster.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12734392 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I think " Utilities.clearWork(job); " should also  be put into try block in ExecDriver.java., " Utilities.clearWork(job); "  this won't throw any exception. Exceptions are handled in method itself., Test failure looks not related to this patch., +1, Pushed to master. Thanks, Chinna!]
