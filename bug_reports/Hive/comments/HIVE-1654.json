[select distinct *

also chokes.
, Arvind, this one is a good one to work on together with HIVE-1459 if you're up for it.

I think we should rewrite the tree when we see * and regex, replacing them with the actual column reference list, so that downstream code like DISTINCT doesn't have to special-case it.
, [~jvs], w.r.t. the JIRA HIVE-9194, shall we close this issue? Thanks.]
