[Actually we should just create a tmp directory under build and use that as our scratch directory. , submitting patch..

the patch moves all the tmp files to build/ql/tmp

also it does some cleanups so that ql/mapred is not created in the source directory., +1

looks good, I just committed this. Thanks Ashish!]
