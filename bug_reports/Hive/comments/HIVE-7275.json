[1. most of these are UDFs: 
coalesce 
floor 
sign 
abs 
ltrim 
substring 
to_char
nvl 
cast 
decode 

nothing to be done for these.

2. ranking fns already support streaming.

3. We need streaming for count, row_num, mean, stddev. Also HIVE-7062 didn't add streaming for fVal, lVal.
, Opened HIVE-7344 to handle FirstVal, LastVal streaming.]
