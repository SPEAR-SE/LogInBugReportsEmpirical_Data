[[~argasi] could you provide an example, like actual query? It will be helpful., Have to redefine issue., [~argasi] can the 
{code}
custom_fields map<string,uniontype<bigint,double,string,boolean,int,array<uniontype<bigint,double,string,boolean,int>>,map<string,uniontype<bigint,double,string,boolean,int>>>> 
{code}
be reduced to 
{code}
custom_fields  map<string, union<double, string, int>>
{code}
 to repro the issue? Based on the problem statement it should be feasible. Could you confirm., Please add extra collection type to the union like: 

{code}
custom_fields  map<string, union<double, string, array<union<bigint,double,string,boolean,int>>>>
{code}]
