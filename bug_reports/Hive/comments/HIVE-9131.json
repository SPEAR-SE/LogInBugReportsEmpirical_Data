[[~vikram.dixit] [~hagleitn] do you have any info on this? thanks, [~vikram.dixit] Seems like HIVE-9055 caused this? Can you take a look, if there is a quick for it than we can wait for fix, else it might make sense to revert HIVE-9055 for now., This test had failed otherwise as well when I ran it without HIVE-9055. But this stack trace missed my attention. This will be fixed as part of HIVE-9141. Sorry for the trouble.]
