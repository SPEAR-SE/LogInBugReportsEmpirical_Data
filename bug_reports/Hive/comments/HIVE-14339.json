[Per discussion with [~pxiong] the reason why we get different explain content for data estimates is due to file system difference. Since that specific test is was just to make sure the query won't fail, I will remove the explain statement to avoid future mismatches. Btw, I couldn't reproduce the mismatch locally on my Mac laptop., [~pxiong] Can you please review?, LGTM +!. [~wzheng], for test, you can directly commit., Also removed desc table statement, Committed to master, branch-2.1 and branch-1. Thanks [~pxiong] for review!]
