[This patch propagates the exception., Can you add a test case where the IOException is thrown only with this patch?, This one adds a test case (and also changed the code a bit to return the correct error code).
, Note: It's possible that our testing infrastructure is not supporting this new test case - we are leaving a temp table in the metastore which may cause "show tables '*';" to have different results.
In that case, we can first commit all the changes except the new test case. We can add the test case back when the new test infrastructure is out.
, Modified QTestUtils.java to remove the temp table.
Remove the line from the new .q file that drops the table. (It never gets executed because of the failure before it), looks good. will commit if tests pass., The patch was missing the input seq file. I pulled it from your source directory and checked it in., Thanks Raghu!]
