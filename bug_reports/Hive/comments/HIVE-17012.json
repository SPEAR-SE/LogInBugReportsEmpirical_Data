[{{ReducerTraits}} would be {{FIXED}} for ACID tables with buckets. https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/GenTezUtils.java#L102 prevents from computing reducer tasks for Reducer 3., Not sure if this is related but AbstractCorrelationProcCtx sets
hive.optimize.reducededuplication.min.reduce=1 for acid, {{SemanticAnalyzer.genFileSinkPlan --> genBucketingSortingDest --> genReduceSinkPlan}} is setting to 2 reducers.

Looking at this code path, it does not look like this is specific to ACID.
