ATTACHMENT ID: 12734987 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The above unit test failures seem not relevant to this patch. 

Uploaded a new patch. Add verification in TestHCatStorer to verify the scratch directories are removed. 



, [~selinazh] Minor feedback:

1. Instead of throwing so many exceptions in the throws, could simply add in a throws Exception to make the test simpler.
2. To make the test stronger, any way we can test that the directories actually existed before the query ran?

ATTACHMENT ID: 12735409 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks, [~swarnim]!

I have added a new patch to address the concern 1. For the concern 2, because we always do a "drop table" at the beginning of each test case, I think it may not be necessary to verify the table directory existed. 

I also modified the test testMultiPartColsInData() to make sure the multiple level partition keys case works. , Thanks, [~swarnim]!
