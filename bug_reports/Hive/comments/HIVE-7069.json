[We are having the same issue with hive2 jdbc connection on CDH 5.3 which comes with 0.13.1. If we keep hive concurrency on then simple select statement create a zookeeper connection that is never closed. We open the hive2 jdbc connection then run a number of select queries that in turn create a zookeeper connection for each of them. We never explicitly call zookeeper in our code. So, is there a way to force close zookeeper connection in this case? Any help would be appreciated. 
  , HIVE-9119 should have addressed the problem and thus I'm closing this one for now. Please feel free to reopen this issue if otherwise., Fixed via HIVE-9119.]
