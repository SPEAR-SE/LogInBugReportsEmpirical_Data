[It seems that {{HashTable}} from {{GlobalWorkMapFactory}} is not thread-local. {{GlobalWorkMapFactory}} returns always same {{BaseWork}} corresponding to the given path if path is the same. 

{code}
  public Map<Path, BaseWork> get(Configuration conf) {
    if (LlapIoProxy.isDaemon()
      // For LLAP
    }

    if (gWorkMap == null) {
      gWorkMap = new HashMap<Path, BaseWork>();
    }
    // This is global object shared among multiple {{ExecDriver}}s. 
    return gWorkMap;
  }
{code}

{{MapWork}} or its HashTable should be {{synchronized}} for the case of multiple root tasks (which cause multiple ExecDrivers).

, This problem is related to the {{TableDesc#equals}} method. equals method cannot be simply {{synchronized}} because of the [consistency problem|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1636399/correctly-synchronizing-equals-in-java]. How can we solve it?, GitHub user Lewuathe opened a pull request:

fails anyway. It seems to be necessary to fix this test on the other JIRA.

{{TestSSL}} succeeded when I run on local machine. What is the version of SSL in Jenkins environment?, Could someone review this? Thank you., [~lewuathe]
Thank you for the contribution. Our HiveServer2 got deadlock recently, and I think this bug is the cause of that.

Hi [~sershe], [~gopalv]
Could you check this jira? It does not seem to be resolved in the latest master branch., [~tasanuma0829] Thank you for pinging. 
We fixed the dead lock problem with the latest patch that was updated. ([HIVE-11749.02.patch|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12787053/HIVE-11749.01.patch]).

[~sershe] [~gopalv] Could you review this?, Hmm, I'm not very familiar with this code. This multi-root situation is MR-only, right? The patch makes sense (I wonder if all partition objects actually have different tabledesc objects - if not, reference equality would be enough and the problem would go away; otherwise, I wonder if comparing db + table names is enough). [~hagleitn] any input? git blame points at you ;) Otherwise +1,
