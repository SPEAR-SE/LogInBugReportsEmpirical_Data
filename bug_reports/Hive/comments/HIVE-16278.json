[[~gopalv] can you take a look?
metadata cache mistakengly calls reserve with no-wait flag (which is only there for unit tests...), and then doesn't check the result. So, if the first eviction fails, reserve will fail, but the cache will ignore it and put the object in the map anyway; then if there's a collision in the map, it will release the memory that has never been reserved. 
Unfortunately I'm not sure that's non-exotic enough to cause the issue in your cluster. Full LLAP log would be helpful, to examine error callstacks. Elevator threads are never interrupted, and only check stop between the calls to read one split; in addition location of reserve/release calls in relation to allocate/deallocate should make such a situation (memory manager thinks we have memory left and doesn't evict, but actually we are fully allocated, also with plenty to evict) close to impossible; even if processing is interrupted somehow and we lose a buffer, it should be consistently wrong with no mismatch between manager and allocator. It would be interesting to look at errors/interrupts to see what could have been wrong, in case there's another issue beside what this patch fixes.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12859838 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~prasanth_j] can you take a look?, can we make sure the reserveMemory() never returns a false in wait + evict mode? It is better to evict something than to fail with assertionerror. , Changed the method signature to expose the test method only to tests.
Also added another small improvement to avoid logging too much on these errors. 
, nit: Can you add the thread interrupted state (assuming this happens in same thread) to the exception message (to identify interruption vs no evictor)?

+1 otherwise,
