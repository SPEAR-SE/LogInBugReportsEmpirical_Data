[With this patch, RawStore object is passed when we call saslServer.startDelegationTokenSecretManager(). 

, I wonder if it would be possible to add a test for this similar to https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/itests/hive-minikdc/src/test/java/org/apache/hive/minikdc/TestHs2HooksWithMiniKdc.java?, Didn't know that. I will try to follow the example to add one.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12698186 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thank you Aihua! I have committed this to trunk!, [~brocknoland] Is there a current workaround for this issue?, I don't think so. I believe that DBTokenStore cannot be used for *HS2* without this patch. It should work with HMS though., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira., Adding patch for branch-1.0, Adding fix to branch-1.0]
