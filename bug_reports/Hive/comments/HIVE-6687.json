[[~jpullokkaran] Can you upload the patch to review board - makes an easier read?

Quickly went through and noticed that some tests are added to TestJdbcDriver. Actually that class is used to tests the JDBC-1 driver compatible with HiveServer1. I don't think there's much development there. TestJdbcDriver2 supersedes it. Thanks!, Review is at https://reviews.apache.org/r/19503/, Apparently view schema also uses same result set schema.
Modified patch to:
1. Separate out View Schema vs Result Set Schema.
2. View Schema won't use qualified table names. View schema would also ensure that column names are unique.
3. ResultSet schema by default would use table aliases if provided (select *, or user provided qualified projections select r1.x..)
4. To get old behavior for result set schema, introduced a config param "hive.resultset.use.unique.column.names"; this is set to true by default. User will have to set this to false for old behavior., Vaibhav, I modified the test cases that seems like could get affected. If we are not using JDBC1 then its a no-op., [~jpullokkaran] Can you also update RB with latest patch?, The documentation of *hive.resultset.use.unique.column.names* looks good to me.  When the time comes I'll add it to the wiki., Review Board: https://reviews.apache.org/r/19551/, +1 LGTM, +1

ATTACHMENT ID: 12636089, Seems like checked-in .q.out file is incorrect, what we are getting now seems more appropriate., Modified unit test "print_header.q" log file., Committed to trunk & 0.13, Added the new configuration parameter to the wiki here:

* [Configuration Properties:  hive.resultset.use.unique.column.names |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.resultset.use.unique.column.names]

After HIVE-6037 gets committed, this parameter will have to be added to HiveConf.java again -- see HIVE-6586:

* [comment for hive.resultset.use.unique.column.names |https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6586?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=13946274#comment-13946274]]
