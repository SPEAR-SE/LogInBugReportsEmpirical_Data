ATTACHMENT ID: 12794030 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failure is unrelated. Added a `describe formatted space` test. pushed to master. Thanks [~ashutoshc] for the review., Doc note:  This bug fix should be documented for release 2.0.1 in these wikidocs:

* [Create Table | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-CreateTable]
* [Alter Column -- Rules for Column Names | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-AlterColumn]
* [Select Syntax | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Select#LanguageManualSelect-SelectSyntax], [~pxiong], should this be TODOC2.1 instead of TODOC2.0?  I don't see the commit in branch-2.0 yet, although Fix Version/s says both 2.1.0 and 2.0.1., [~leftylev], thanks for your attention. I think we do not need to change nay TODOC. This is a bug rather than a new feature. And for 2.1.0 and 2.0.1, shall I commit this single patch or shall we cherry-pick all of them in a batch? Thanks., Agreed it's just a bug fix and we don't usually document those, but occasionally we do when the bug affects HiveQL behavior.  Examples:

* [Create/Drop/Alter Index | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-Create/Drop/AlterIndex]
* [Describe Table/View/Column (two info boxes at end of section) | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-DescribeTable/View/Column]

So I thought this might be helpful information for users, but I'll defer to your judgment.

As for the commits, I have no opinion.  I just wanted to be sure Fix Version/s is correct.]
