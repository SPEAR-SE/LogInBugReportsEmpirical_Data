[this was fixed sometime back via one of the mass commits. the documentation needs to be updated though. in the meantime:

- add file <file-path>

will add the file to the distributed cache. the filename (without the full pathname) can then be used in a map/reduce script.

- list file(s) 

will show the list of current added files

- delete file <file-path>

will remove a particular file from the file cache.]
