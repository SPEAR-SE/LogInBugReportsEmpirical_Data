[Just want to get a bit of clarification on this issue, since it goes against the "required is forever" guideline described in https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#simple.

If I understand correctly, the issue is when an older client receives newer Type value, containing a Kind enum that didn't exist at the time the older client was built. In this situation the Kind value is set as NULL.  Is the point of setting Kind as optional field of Type so that you would have the ability to call hasKind() on the Type and do appropriate error handling? Looking at OrcProto.java it appears that there is such a Type.hasKind() method already, so this use case is already covered. Or is there another use case that you are thinking of here?]
