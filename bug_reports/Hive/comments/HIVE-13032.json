[[~sershe] Can you please take a look?, +1. Can you see that no other services have this line explicitly? Will this cause problems for CLI due to both inits?, Verified that it's not included in other services. Beeline uses different properties file and sets log4j.configurationFile again. Also double initialization is not a problem as logger factory is initialized in a static block which will be initialized automatically by the class loader. Using Configurator to initialize again will return the same instance. Committing this patch shortly., Committed to branch-2.0 and master, Can I know how do I apply/install this patch into my Hive in Ubuntu 12.04? Thank you.
