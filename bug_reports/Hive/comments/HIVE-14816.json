[[~vrathor-hw] looks like https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Commands   has the "compile" command which seems to use the jars above. , Thejas M Nair looks like additionally in the hive-common module we could move to using maven plugins via mojos instead of custom ant task, the problem arises from the fact that org.apache.hadoop.hive.ant.GenHiveTemplate is used during build to generate templates with a custom ant task which needs ant to be in "compile" scope., Thanks for the analysis [~anagarwal]. So we do need it to support the 'groovy compile' functionality out of the box.

I think we can close this as 'Won't Fix'
, Jars are needed for the groovy compile capability from hive, hence cant remove them.]
