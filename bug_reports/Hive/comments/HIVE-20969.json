[My current theory is that HIVE-19008 changed sparkSessionId generation which affected scratchDir creation.

[~stakiar]: Could you help out me here? What was the original intention here? I would assume that it would be good to connect the spark session to the hive session in every log message so it would be good if the sparkSessionId would contain the hive session id too. Otherwise when we have multiple HoS queries running on the same HS2 instance then we will have hard time differentiating between the multiple spark sessions with id="1".

[~ngangam]: Any thoughts on this?

 , The intention of HIVE-19008 was so simplify the session id logic in HoS. Before HIVE-19008, the HoS session id was a UUID that was completely independent of the session id. After HIVE-19008, the HoS session id is a counter that is incremented for each each new Spark session created for a given Hive session.

Adding the hive session id into the spark session id sounds like a reasonable idea to me. Logically, that is what HIVE-19008 already does. After HIVE-19008, any spark session id is globally identifiable by the Hive session id + Spark session id. Again, prior to HIVE-19008 the sparkSessionId was a UUID that was independent of the hive session id., [~stakiar]: Thanks! Exactly my thoughts. I arrived to similar conclusion after some code digging. See the attached proposed patch.
