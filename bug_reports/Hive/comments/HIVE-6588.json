[Just wanted to share my experience, a lot of these are caused by MAPREDUCE-434 which is in hadoop 2.3.0, hive MR jobs in test env had been running only one reducer in local mode, now suddenly there are more.  

I think the majority of these can be fixed by adding a group-by, or having a different version of the test for hadoop1,2 versions for others, like those asserting number of buckets.  Will try to fix some if I get some cycles., Typo:  "fixed by adding a order by after group by", Yeah I've noticed a bunch of the following:
1. fix by adding a order by after group by as [~szehon] mentions
2. A bunch of tests only run in hadoop-2 and the diffs have gone stale because we only test with hadoop-1.

Was going to use this Jira as an umbrella task for the various fixes.]
