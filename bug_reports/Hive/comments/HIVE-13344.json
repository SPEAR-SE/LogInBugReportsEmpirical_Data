[[~wzheng] could you review, HIVe-13344.patch is a branch-1 patch running here
http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-BRANCH_1-Build/27/console, 1. buildQueryWithINClause can be removed from TxnHandler since TxnUtils has it now.
2. Missed changes for TestDbTxnManager2.testDummyTxnManagerOnAcidTable (HIVE-10632 committed slightly different for master and branch-1 due to the absence of TxnStore in branch-1 at that time. Now with this ticket, they should be consistent.), createValidReadTxnList can also be removed from TxnHandler, In TestTxnHandler.testBuildQueryWithINClause() and TxnHandler.timeOutLocks(), TxnHandler.buildQueryWithINClause should be replaced with TxnUtils.buildQueryWithINClause, Doc note: This adds *hive.metastore.txn.store.impl* to HiveConf.java, so it needs to be documented in the wiki for release 1.3.0 (TODOC1.3 label).

HIVE-12902 added it for 2.1.0 -- see the doc note there for other places this should be documented:

* [doc note on HIVE-12902 | https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12902?focusedCommentId=15124607&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15124607], we don't need to doc this for 1.x line.  It's only expected to have 1 (default) value in 1.x., > we don't need to doc this for 1.x line. It's only expected to have 1 (default) value in 1.x.

Okay, thanks [~ekoifman].  I'll reference your no-doc note on HIVE-12902 but I'm keeping the TODOC1.3 label here just so the entry in Configuration Properties will show both 1.3.0 and 2.1.0 for *hive.metastore.txn.store.impl*.]
