{noformat}, This may be related to HIVE-6835., The identifier such as column name is stored in lowercase in metastore backend tables. Hive usually converts these identifiers to lowercase before calling HMS APIs, but it might not be always true. Other HMS clients like Impala might also not do that. So we need convert the identifiers in HMS request to lowercase in HiveMetaStore.java before querying backend tables.,
