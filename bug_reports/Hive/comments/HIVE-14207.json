[Patch attached, still has one trivial FIXME to remove after clarification, but should be enough to let tests run., [~jxiang], I just wanted to do a quick check with you as to whether there is any particular reason other than speed of test runs that you added the check to HiveServer2 to disable the webui when running with HIVE_IN_TEST. I intend to re-enable it for tests as well, so we can run tests on the webui as well., Other than the test speed, it is also to avoid port conflicts in case multiple tests run in parallel., Thanks!

I'll change the logic around a little, so that if it is running in test mode, then only if the port is not the default port, it will enable the webui. That should make it so that tests are able to use it as long as they use the same mechanism to find a free port that other metastore tests use.


, Updated patch., On 2.patch - I like the idea of using custom port to enable HS2 web UI instead of having to turn off the in.test config. However, the MetaStoreUtils.findFreePort() call has a non zero probability to return default port as the available one. Can you also skip the default port if thats what is returned ?
, Sounds good., Updated patch. .3.patch now introduces new method to find a free port that is guaranteed to not be a port number that we specify., +1 pending tests
