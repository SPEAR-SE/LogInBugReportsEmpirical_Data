[[~busyjay], this is current limitation of Hive. Hive parser does NOT support 2 or more levels of "dot". For example, 
{code}
select default.src.key from src;
{code}
will fail. This has nothing to do with reserved keywords. If you are willing to work on the new feature to support 2 or more levels of dot, I would be happy to review it. Thanks., I don't get it.

I have been using 2 or more levels of "dot" in my daily queries, how come it has NOT supportted that yet? If this issue has nothing to do with reserved keywords, then why it will work if I change the reserved keyword `end` to normal literal?

hive> create table testreserved (data struct<end_key:string, id: string>);
OK
Time taken: 0.556 seconds
hive> create view testreservedview as select data.end_key as data_end, data.id as data_id from testreserved;
OK
Time taken: 0.678 seconds
hive> select data.end_key from testreserved;
OK
Time taken: 0.743 seconds
hive> select data_id from testreservedview;
OK
Time taken: 0.477 seconds
hive> select data_end from testreservedview;
OK
Time taken: 0.404 seconds

And the query example you suggested actually works:

hive> create table src (default struct<src:struct<key:string>, id: string>);
OK
Time taken: 0.27 seconds
hive> select default.src.key from src;
OK
Time taken: 0.274 seconds, [~busyjay], sorry, I misunderstood your problem. I will submit a patch soon and you can apply and test if it works. Thanks., [~jpullokkaran], could you take a look? Thanks.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12766674 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I looked at the patch.
As we discussed:
1. fieldDescMap generation can be moved inside the first loop
2. If we maintain ordered list of fields then we can avoid the while loop.,

Note that ExprNodeColumnListDesc is used to represent * (ALL_COL_REF). In views these are inlined (i.e col names are listed explicitly). Hence we need not handle them explicitly here., pushed to master. Thanks [~jpullokkaran] for the review., Glade to see this issue was resolved. Which version of Hive will get this patch applied?, [~busyjay], it would be 2.0. Thanks for your attention and efforts to help discover this bug! :), Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug., this was a mistake. must have misclicked. can't undo
