  Other then those two comments, patch looks good.

INLINE COMMENTS
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/parser/ExpressionTree.java:178 Can you also include Operator.NOTEQUALS2 in this expression so that it works for listTableNamesByFilter() api as well.
  metastore/src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/TestHiveMetaStore.java:1839 Can you also add a test for table filtering within a database. testTableFilter() method will be best suited for it.

INLINE COMMENTS
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/parser/ExpressionTree.java:170 Comment needs to update to say only support "=" , "<>" and "!="
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/parser/ExpressionTree.java:187 Instead of forming List<String> for printing correctly, I think its better to add following method in Operator

  public String toString() {
    return o.op;
  }

  and then you can use original set in error message, which will print its content correctly since Set extends from AbstractCollection.

  Sorry for nitpicking !
