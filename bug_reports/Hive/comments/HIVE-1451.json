[I am out of office on a business trip for next couple of days. I will
be slower than usual in responding to emails. If this is urgent then
please call my cell phone (or send an SMS), otherwise I will reply to
your email when I get back.

Thanks for your patience,

, +1 for the issue. 
This is one of those features which many assume exists by default, but doesn't. 

I too have run into this and resolved it by changing the DB_LOCATION_URI column and LOCATION in the tables DBS and SDS respectively to point to the latest namenode URI. {My metastore was on MySql}.

This issue will help us from manually changing namenode URI in db should the address of the namenode change.
, Resolving this as WONTFIX for the following reasons:

# We want the Hive Metastore to be capable of handling tables stored on different HDFS instances. Supporting this use case requires that the Metastore store the complete address of the NN.
# HIVE-1514 added the ALTER TABLE <table> [<partition_spec>] SET LOCATION statement which allows you to modify the storage location of a table/partition in the metastore. This is an effective workaround for the issue described in this ticket.
