[[~szehon] Do you have any idea? , The replay attack is caused because we are trying to authenticate twice within a short amount of time.
It only happens when we request the context root, and authenticate ourselves in the AuthenticationFilter, then the request is forwarded to the welcome page (index.html in this case), but then the request goes through the same AuthenticationFilter and it is authenticated again.

As described in [HADOOP-8830|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8830] a second call to the AuthenticationFilter will cause a replay attack as the authentication cookie is only set on the response.

I would suggest to do an URL rewriting instead of a forwarding to prevent the second call chain causing the second authentication request.

*As a side effect we would be serving the same page to requests for both the context root and hiveserver2.jsp.* , Attaching patch file., +1.
