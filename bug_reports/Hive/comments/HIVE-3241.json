["Mode mode" does not have any access modified. So, it is not protected, it's "default" from the day it was added.
https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/f376e632ce4796e4ffb740434b3cfcdae590a1ec#diff-fa86fb58b7827b5e9569d609e8a0eac0

Because mode field is used by Subclasses it should be protected (not "default")
GenericUDAFEvaluator subclasses can access mode field because they are located in the same package as GenericUDAFEvaluator.

But protected modifier is better because it clearly says that the field can be accessed by child classes
