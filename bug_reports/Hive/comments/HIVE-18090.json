ATTACHMENT ID: 12898154 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, you have 
{noformat}
tblproperties('transactional'='tur');
{noformat}
I assume this is just a typo?

Also, _above will only work if the insert overwrite query takes longer than hive.txn.timeout / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2seconds_ - I assume "work" means "reproduce"?

The thread pool for heartbeating DbTxnManager.heartbeatExecutorService is static so if you are able to create 2 sessions with different users, the pool should have the tread alive with User1 when User2 issues a request, I think.

otherwise the patch LGTM
+1, HIVE-12366 is where shared thread pool for heartbeat was introduced, Thanks for the review [~ekoifman], Fixed the typos in "Description", Going to do a quick look at tests failures once before i commit, cant access the apache logs., Patch committed to master !, This jira is resolved and released with Hive 3.0 If you find an issue with it, please create a new jira.]
