ATTACHMENT ID: 12702109 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Failed test seems to be a float precision mismatch - 20428.07287599999 vs 20428.072876?, [~gopalv] The patch mostly looks good.
1) Branch for batchSize > 1 and batchSize == 1 can be combined together into else condition and initializing repeating variable based on the batch size.
2) nit: multiple checks in for() makes it go beyond 100 chars column width.
