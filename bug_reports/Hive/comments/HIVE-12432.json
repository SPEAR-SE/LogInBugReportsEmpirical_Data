[Spark log shows that the counters for output has been ignored :
{code}
counter[HIVE, RECORDS_OUT_1_default.test] has not initialized before. | org.apache.hive.spark.counter.SparkCounters.increment(SparkCounters.java:81)
{code}, [~nemon], Thanks for reporting this. I'm wondering if you plan to work on this. This also seems similar or related to HIVE-12466, which has some diagnosis info.
, HIVE-12466 is the same issue.I don't have a clear solution yet.So let hive on spark experts work on HIVE-12466 and i will watch it.]
