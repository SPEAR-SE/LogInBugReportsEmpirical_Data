[https://reviews.apache.org/r/14651/, Comments on rb., Comments on rb., .2 is rebased against tip of the branch., Another things: We need to either exclude these tests from TestCliDriver or run all the mini tez tests with hive.optimize.tez=true by default. The latter is probably better, because it let's us share tests between the two., Updated to address review comments., Committed to branch. Thanks Vikram!]
