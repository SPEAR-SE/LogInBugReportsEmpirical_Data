ATTACHMENT ID: 12666866, Test failures needs to be looked at., It seems we clear too much state, in cases where several analyzers are getting used (e.g. Explain+ColumnStats, noscan so far seems the one to blame). I'll investigate the code further, the tests failed because ColumnStatsSA initializes stuff in ctor and then we reset it. Trying to change it to init in initialize; let's see if it breaks anything (it fixes some of the above tests), forgot to submit patch,
