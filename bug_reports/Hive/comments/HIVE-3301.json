[The problem is:

In hadoop23, TaskLogServlet.java is using a new utility HtmlQuoting.java to print Task Log.

In TaskLogServlet.java, printTaskLog() function:

result = taskLogReader.read(b);
        if (result > 0) {
          if (plainText) {
            out.write(b, 0, result);
          } else {
            HtmlQuoting.quoteHtmlChars(out, b, 0, result);
          }
        } else {
          break;
        }


While, in hadoop20,  TaskLogServlet.java is using its own utility(there is no such HtmlQuoting.java at all) to print Task Log:

In TaskLogServlet.java, printTaskLog fucntion:

result = taskLogReader.read(b);
        if (result > 0) {
          if (plainText) {
            out.write(b, 0, result);
          } else {
            quotedWrite(out, b, 0, result);
          }
        } else {
          break;
        }


And in Hive, TaskLogProcessor.java is generating stack trace by reading the raw taskAttemptLog.

In ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/errors/TaskLogProcessor.java, getStackTraces() fuction:


List<String> stackTrace = null;

        // Patterns that match the middle/end of stack traces
        Pattern stackTracePattern = Pattern.compile("^\tat .*", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
        Pattern endStackTracePattern =
            Pattern.compile("^\t... [0-9]+ more.*", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);

        while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {

          if (stackTracePattern.matcher(inputLine).matches() ||
              endStackTracePattern.matcher(inputLine).matches()) {


To have Hive working for both hadoop20 and hadoop23, we should use different mechanisms when hive TaskLogProcessor is parsing TaskAttemptLog.

My plan is creating a shim, which have different implementations for hadoop20 and hadoop23.

In hadoop23, HtmlQuoting.unquoteHtmlChars() is used to parse the TaskAttemptLog., You know these hadoop 23 jiras are like death of a thousand paper cuts, if I had known we were going to face so many issues i would have proposed making a larger shim layer. Can we come up with a definitive list of all the 23 problems?, review request submitted at:
https://reviews.facebook.net/D4353, @Edward: oh yes. As I know, HIVE-3301, HIVE-3275, HIVE-3273, HIVE-3242, HIVE-3240, HIVE-3257, HIVE-3249 and HIVE-2804 are all hadoop 23 bugs. I am fixing these one by one. Thanks for your advice. I will try to put them into a larger shim layer.

I just found an Error Code retrieval inconsistency between hadoop20 and hadoop23. Will file another one soon.

Thanks,
Zhenxiao, I am not saying we need to shim layer all the fixes, but having a reasonably exhaustive list of the problems linked together in jira would make me more confident that we are taking the right plan of action. , Zhenxiao I left comments on Phabricator., Link with hadoop23 integration related bugs, @Edward: related HIVE tickets are linked. I will add more whenever any new bugs filed. Do we need a separate upper level JIRA to trace all the hadoop23 integration bugs?, @ashutosh: Thanks a lot for the comments.

I made updates and resubmitted review request at:
https://reviews.facebook.net/D4353, patch has prefix in it, updated patch without prefix
could apply cleanly, +1 Running tests., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Zhenxiao!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1570 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1570/])
