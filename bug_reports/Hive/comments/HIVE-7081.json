[I think that HIVE-5799 would help here?, I don't think HIVE-5799 will help to free up this thread. HIVE-6679 (or the upgrade to thrift 0.9.2) would be needed., We upgraded to 0.9.2 already: https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/pom.xml#L141, Yes, to be more specific - trunk has a fix, 0.14 release does not have the fix.
