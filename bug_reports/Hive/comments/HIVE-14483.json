, please ignore this comment, please ignore this comment, [~owen.omalley] [~prasanth_j]

Could you please review  pull request?, [~sershe]

Do you know who is responsible for Hive ORC module?

, Patch looks good to me... attaching the same patch for HiveQA (with the expected name pattern). Is similar fix needed in other places for other complex readers?, After upgrading into Hive 2.1.0, we only found exception for StringDirectTreeReader. 

But, I think, that you should ask [~owen.omalley]- he is responsible for user story https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12159 and 

he keeps silent......,

Should we ignore these test failures?, +1, these 2 tests are unstable, it appears, [~sershe]

.....patch looks good and no test failures.....

Who has responsibility to push into master? , Committed to branches., [~sershe]

Thank you very much]
