[I added catch statement and RuntimeException statment, so if exception is happened throw error message.. , [~skrho], I don't follow the reason for your change. The point of the try/finally is to ensure that the {{ZipFile}} is closed before the method returns. The code also does not handle the IOException that can be thrown and lets the caller deal with that exception ({{throws IOException}}. A try block does not always require a catch statement. This method looks fine to me as-is.]
