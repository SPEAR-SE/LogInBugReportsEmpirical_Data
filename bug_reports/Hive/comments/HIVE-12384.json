ATTACHMENT ID: 12772451 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I think better fix is to always insert a select operator (whenever there is a need for casting) regardless of execution engine type. We should get rid of Union operator at runtime altogether (since its not doing any useful computation). 

Planning needs to be as independent of run time execution engine as much as possible.
, The counter argument is this:
We already have an operator that handles type casting in MR.
So why penalize MR?, Which penalty you are thinking about ? Fix I am envisioning is one in which we get rid of Union operator altogether. Casting (if any needed) is done by Select Operator. , Penalty is the cost of additional select (which in case of MR) is not required.
Not to harp on this, this cost shouldn't be that significant.
, Filed HIVE-12423 to remove union operator.
Decoupling it from current patch.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12772568 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Ok.. We can get this one in for now, as incorrect results are bad.  +1
We should get to HIVE-12423 sooner than later., Committed to Master, Does this need to be committed to branch-1 too?, yes this needs to be back ported to branch-1., Added a modified patch (.4) to include missed test config changes.]
