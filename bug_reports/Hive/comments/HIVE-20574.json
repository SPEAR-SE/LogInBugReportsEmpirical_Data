[Hive exposes this setting- [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.stats.ndv.error]
 which determines the error tolerance for "distinct_count". Error tolerance provides a tradeoff between accuracy vs compute cost.

In order to get the correct count, suggest setting {color:#FF0000}hive.stats.ndv.error = 0{color}
 I have tested this on EMR cluster and it indeed improves the accuracy to 100%

Another interesting property, if you are using partitions, is to consider tuning hive.metastore.stats.ndv.tuner to be closer to 1. The default is 0., The config properties pointed by Mr. Jadhav did the trick, so not a problem]
