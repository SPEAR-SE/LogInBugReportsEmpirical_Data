[FWIW all tests reported on that link fails even on trunk if you run them sequentially (ie ant test). I am not sure why they pass on PTest2 Hive QA (assuming they get run on it)., Yes they get run (below). I don't know about the thrift tests but I saw the metastore one fail once and [~prasadm] said he had an idea.
