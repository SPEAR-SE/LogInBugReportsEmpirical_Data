[if i create a table named "tmp_tbl" as 
SELECT
1 as from_pid,
1 as to_pid,
cid as from_path,
(CASE WHEN pid=0 THEN cid ELSE pid END) as to_path,
0 as status
FROM
(SELECT union_map(c_map) AS c_map
FROM
(SELECT collect_map(id,parent_id)AS c_map
FROM
wl_channels
GROUP BY id,parent_id
)tmp
)tmp2
LATERAL VIEW recursion_concat(c_map) a AS cid, pid

and use the table "tmp_tbl" to select ,the result goes right.

at the same time ,i do the same works under hive 0.7.1 , the result goes right too.
, This seems reproducible with Hive 1.2.1.
Is anyone looking into this Jira?
Or supposed to be fixed?]
