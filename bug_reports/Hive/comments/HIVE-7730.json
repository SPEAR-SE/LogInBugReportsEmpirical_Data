[This is the patch and this feature blocks SENTRY-392., If all you want is list of columns accessed in query, that is possible today with existing interface. Look at: itests/util/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/hooks/CheckColumnAccessHook.java, Thanks [~ashutoshc] for the valuable comment!
I have seen CheckColumnAccessHook implements ExecuteWithHookContext, and it occurs in execute
But authorization should occurs in compile before execute.
So I am afraid this approach can not meet my requirement., Hi [~ashutoshc]
Currently Hive has a new interface for external authorization plugin and semantic hook may be replaced in the future. So I will try to put accessed columns to ReadEntity instread of enhancing semantic hook.This way will be available to hooks as well as authorization interfaces. I have updated the description, and wait for you feedback. Thanks!, This is the patch of extending ReadEntity with accessed columns list., I think its reasonable.  Xiaomeng, can you put up a review request at : [https://reviews.apache.org/dashboard/|https://reviews.apache.org/dashboard/] for some comments?, Thanks [~szehon] I have linked to review board., Thanks Xiaomeng, patch looks good overall, I put some minor comments on rb., Fixed something from [~szehon],

ATTACHMENT ID: 12664542, Committed to trunk.  Thanks Xiaomeng for the contribution!  [~brocknoland], [~ashutoshc] can one of you please add Xiaomeng to list of contributors to accredit the patch?  Thanks., Thanks [~szehon]!, Hi [~szehon]
There is a null pointer issue in latest patch.
entity.getAccessedColumns().addAll(tableToColumnAccessMap.get(entity.getTable().getCompleteName()));
if tableToColumnAccessMap.get(entity.getTable().getCompleteName()) is null, addAll(null) will throw null pointer exception.
I attached a patch to fix it, could you help to review it? Thanks!, Hi Xiaomeng, in Hive we have one JIRA per commit, so we should open a new JIRA for this.  Thanks., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
