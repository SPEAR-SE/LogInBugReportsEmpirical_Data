[I'm able to repro locally. I will take a look., We should check if the number of target table columns match the selected #columns before going through the column to type conversion. 

At the mean time, you should provide matched number of columns in the select subquery.
, I know i am missing a column. But exception doesn't help. IIRC there used to be a check for number of columns which seems to be missing. , That's right. We should never see such exception. I'm working on it. Will provide patch soon. , The patch will check the input and output column # first for regular query rather than later. ,
