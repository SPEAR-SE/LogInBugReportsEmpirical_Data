ATTACHMENT ID: 12654941, [~ekoifman] Goal of HIVE-538 is to allow hive users to use hive jar without worrying about its dependencies including transitive. If we add this minimizeJar directive, do user need to figure out transitive deps themselves, or is there some maven magic which will come to their rescue?, my understanding is that by default uber jar will pull in whole-jar dependencies even if only some of the classes in the jar are needed.  this option makes it only include classes from any given jar that are necessary (transitively) by classes in module, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Navis & Eugene!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
