ATTACHMENT ID: 12835265 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, failed tests are not related to this patch. could anyone give me reviews for this patch?
created a review request([#53524|https://reviews.apache.org/r/53524/]) for this patch., Patch looks good to me. I am not sure why pushDownProjections call was initially postponed with a boolean setting. [~prasanth_j] do you remember?
If there's no reason, I'll +1 and commit tomorrow., [~prasanth_j] Do you remember anything about [~sershe]'s comments?
Could you please review when you get a chance?, HIVE-7052 have more context to it. Appending values to config object is very CPU intensive and increases split computation time., [~prasanth_j] should this be committed? I can commit if you think that is ok, I think this will again introduce the perf issue that [~rajesh.balamohan]'s patch fixed in HIVE-7052. Since we can't catch perf regression easily I think we should be cautious that this doesn't introduce the perf issue again. ]
