[This happens even when constant propagation and cbo is disabled., Looks like this is happening because of  https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/TypeCheckProcFactory.java#L1036

The TypeCheckProcFactory thinks the type of double doesnt match with Column type int, hence this predicate = false.
Incase of -10.0, we have a intermediate GenericUDFOPNegative node between the equals node and the value node. This prevents us from even entering the above code path all together.

One possible fix might be to cast the value in case the columnType does not correspond to the the value type using the correct object inspector converter.

Thanks
Hari, [~hsubramaniyan], thanks a lot for your comments. Actually we do not need to cast the value, it is already there. We just need to change 
{code}
if (triedDouble ||
{code}
to
{code}
if (triedDouble &&
{code}, The change looks fine. +1 pending tests., nit : you could actually change the comment below to reflect what you are actually doing.

{code}
              // however, if we already tried this, or the column is NUMBER type and
              // the operator is EQUAL, return false due to the type mismatch
{code}

ATTACHMENT ID: 12749659 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 for patch 2., [~pxiong] looks like the patch#2 is no longer applying cleanly on the master. Can you upload new one.

Thanks

ATTACHMENT ID: 12750201 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~pxiong] Is this an issue with older versions as well?, Yes., This was backported to branch 1.0 (for 1.0.2), so the Fix Version/s should be updated.  See commit d687bfb817b5785e8bc871e89b1832f4540174e2.

Will it also go into branch-1, branch-1.2, and branch-1.1 (for 1.3.0, 1.2.2, and 1.1.2 respectively)?, Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug., Yes  this should be back ported., Cherry-pick has conflicts, can you make a backport?]
