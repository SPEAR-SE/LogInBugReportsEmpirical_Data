[Regenerated golden file for dynamic_partition_skip_default.q file., Test failed even after the patch., I just tested locally on Mac OSX. It seems to run fine after this patch. [~ashutoshc] is it failing on Mac or other OS?, First of all; I am really sorry, I missed your .10.patch
But with this patch I get a diff too. I tested on Mac OSX., Refreshed the trunk again and regenerated the golden file., marking it as patch available for HIVE QA to run tests., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Prasanth!]
