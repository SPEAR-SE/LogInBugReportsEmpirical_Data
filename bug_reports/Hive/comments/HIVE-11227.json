[error log, [~akamai], it's helpful to provide the queries that leads to the error. Thanks., Queries and error logs., Hi Xuefu

Thank for the response, 

Please find the attached queries and error logs., From the log it seems that Kryo is serializing PerfLogger.starttimes field originated from MapJoinOperator. While I don't know why it complains that the type (HashMap) is not registered, there is no reason to serialize PerfLogger itself. This is certainly be done, but the repro case is too complicated to verify the fix. Could you try to one of the two things?

1. use latest Hive with your query to see if you can reproduce. If so, I can provide a patch to see if it addresses the problem.
2. provide a simpler repro case where I can try and verify the fix.

Thanks.]
