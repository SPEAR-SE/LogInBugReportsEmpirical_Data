ATTACHMENT ID: 12633453, +1, The single test failure seems unrelated to my change.

Ashutosh, can you commit my change for me?, yeah, failure is unrelated. I will commit this shortly., WE should make a release note if someone has  $ in there file hive might now try to interpret it., If I am reading the patch correctly, it does that interpretation only for {{source}} statement, not for anything else., Added a Release Note explaining the changes in this patch., [~appodictic] Let us know if you have any more feedback., Ping, I am waiting to hear from [~appodictic] seems like he had some concerns., What concerns does [~appodictic] have?, No major concern the release note is enough information. Sorry I was not paying attention to this thread. Please proceed., Thanks.  Could one of you guys commit the patch for me please?, Do the bug & fix need to be mentioned in the wiki?  A version note could be added in the CLI doc and/or Variable Substitution:

* [CLI:  Hive Interactive Shell Commands |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli#LanguageManualCli-HiveInteractiveShellCommands]
* [Variable Substitution |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+VariableSubstitution], It would probably be nice to add an example to the Variable Substitution page that uses variable substitution with the source command.

On a side note, how does one get edit privileges for the wiki?, "AboutThisWiki" gives these instructions:
