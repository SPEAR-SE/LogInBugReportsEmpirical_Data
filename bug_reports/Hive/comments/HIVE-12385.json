[Please configure mysql to use innodb_file_format = BARRACUDA and global innodb_large_prefix = ON to work around this, Script does need to be modified, This modifies the name down to 767 characters which is a MySQL limit. Luckily we have not shipped this yet..., [~ashutoshc] can you take a look? We could instead add ROW_FORMAT and refer to the above mysql settings, but it won't work for existing tables, so to reduce confusion I've set it to 767.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12771871 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures are unrelated. [~ashutoshc] [~thejas] [~sushanth] can you review?, {{TYPE_NAME}} is still varchar(4000) wont that suffer from same issue?, It's not part of the unique key, Right. +1, Committed to master. The original patch was not committed to branch-1, so this is not needed either., Does BARRACUDA support varchar(4000) as Primary Key either?]
