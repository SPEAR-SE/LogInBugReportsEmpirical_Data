[Consider moving LauncherDelegator#registerJob() into TempletonControllerJob which will ensure that "job" dir will be created by doAs user.  Still need to handle clean up process which runs as 'hcat'.
Each job/ contains "user" file so it in principle could do doAs("user"), Lowering priority as this isn't commonly used in production and HIVE-4601 has improved HDFSStorage error logging so that this condition is at least visible in the logs.]
