ATTACHMENT ID: 12637573, To add more context: Important part of patch is removal of interrupting of main thread for SignalHandler. In hadop-1 java io with sockets were used to communicate between client and server. So, interrupting main thread wasn't an issue. However,  Hadoop-2 uses java nio based interruptible channels, which throws up if current thread is interrupted. , +1, Committed to trunk & 0.13]
