ATTACHMENT ID: 12706904 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~jpullokkaran], now that we have upgraded to Calcite-1.1.0, the patch can go in trunk. Thanks, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Jesus!, [~jcamachorodriguez] I think this should be back ported to Apache Hive 14.
I am not sure if we have a Hive 0.14 Maint branch., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
