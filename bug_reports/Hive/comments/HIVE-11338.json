[HiveConnection doesn't support transactions; and having autoCommit=true is for communicating this; i've checked setAutoCommit()...and it already contains a great exception to advertise this.

{code}
  @Override
  public void setAutoCommit(boolean autoCommit) throws SQLException {
    // Per JDBC spec, if the connection is closed a SQLException should be thrown.
    if(isClosed) {
      throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    // The auto-commit mode is always enabled for this connection. Per JDBC spec,
    // if setAutoCommit is called and the auto-commit mode is not changed, the call is a no-op.
    if (!autoCommit) {
      LOG.warn("Request to set autoCommit to false; Hive does not support autoCommit=false.");
      SQLWarning warning = new SQLWarning("Hive does not support autoCommit=false");
      if (warningChain == null) warningChain = warning;
      else warningChain.setNextWarning(warning);
    }
  }
{code}, i would like to recommend to close this issue as INVALID, why so complicated?
it is transacted => true
it's not is transacted =>false... 

All others make it like this..

Or close it.. same for me.
