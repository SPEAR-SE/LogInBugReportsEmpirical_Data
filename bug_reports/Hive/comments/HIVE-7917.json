Thanks [~vikram.dixit] and [~hagleitn]!, Doc note:  This has a TODOC14 label which will be dealt with when HIVE-7158 is documented, because the patch restores default values for *hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer* and *hive.exec.reducers.max* to the settings given in HIVE-7158., Doc done, TODOC14 label removed:

* [hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer]
* [hive.exec.reducers.max | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.exec.reducers.max]]
