[Looks like you have the hive default authorization in the configuration.
You might want to use SQL Standards based authorization instead - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+based+hive+authorization and storage based authorization for hive cli -  (set hive.security.authorization.manager=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.StorageBasedAuthorizationProvider)

This is a configuration issue and not a product bug. So jira is not the best place for this. Closing this jira as invalid.
Hive mailing lists and other forums are better place for this.
