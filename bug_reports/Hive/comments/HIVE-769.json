[@HIVE-769.1.patch: This should fix the problem.
Tests are not updated yet., For the change in SemanticAnalyzer.initialize, I should have done it in the way as in HIVE-769.1.patch.

However, HIVE-769.1.patch makes the "SELECT *" query a map-reduce job, so I have to do it as in the HIVE-769.2.patch.
, The same patch for branch-0.4.

Two minor differences: 1. exprNodeDesc.getChildren() return type change (it's already in trunk); 2. "import ...HiveConf;" conflict in ASTPartitionPruner.java.
, HIVE-769.3.trunk.patch: Included test case changes. Also changed a few places to make sure the error message looks nice., HIVE-769.3.branch-0.4.patch: fix for branch-0.4., committed in trunk

running tests for 0.4, Committed. Thanks Zheng, HIVE-769.3-1.trunk.branch-0.4.patch: Please commit to both branch-0.4 and trunk.
, NullPointerException in some cases., Committed the new patch. Thanks Zheng ]
