[How sure are you that you are looking at a JDBC issue?  On 0.13.1 HiveServer1 was still around and I'm seeing slower query performance for the select columns than select * without JDBC being (as far as I know, and I'm a novice here - so I might be wrong) involved.  The slow down (as far as I can tell) is associated with the time to start the Hadoop job... that is, select columns triggers a hadoop job but select * does not., No, I'm not sure that it's just a JDBC issue.  That's just the entry point we were using.  So then the followup questions are:

Is this expected behavior?
And is there a way to mitigate the slowdown?  For example is it better to just issue "select *" when possible and perform column projection at the client side?  Or will we hit this for a broad class of queries?
