[This is a problem only for the Hadoop23Shims DistCp callers, not for Hadoop20Shims, because branch-1's distcp2 in hadoop does not have such a state-setting function inside {{run()}}: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-1/src/tools/org/apache/hadoop/tools/distcp2/DistCp.java#L96-L114, If its because of HADOOP-10459 then bug shouldn't manifest in hadoop-2.5+ Is that correct?, [~ashutoshc] - The opposite. HADOOP-10459 added the new method call in {{run()}}, so any Hadoop releases with that fix in will no longer execute DistCp correctly in Hive, because Hive has skipped calling {{run()}}., [~ashutoshc] Could you review this small patch? I just start using run() again. 

I run a test with the old code and the issue was happening as stated in this patch. When I changed to run(), then the problem got away.

Btw, I reproduced the issue using:
{{LOAD PATH INPATH '/tmp/dummytext.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE dummytext;}}

dummytext was in an encryption zone, and when I run it with the execute() method, then the final destination for the file was: {{/user/hive/warehouse/dummytext/dummytext.txt/dummytext.txt}}. It was creating a new subdirectory inside the table location., +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12817250 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, The tests are not related. 
Most of the tests are failing on previous jobs, except for TestSessionManagerMetrics.testThreadPoolMetrics, but the output nor the test look related to the distcp change.
I will commit this patch., Thanks [~ashutoshc] for the review.

There seems to be a leak of job object if we call run instead of execute. The issue is in the run method of distcp which does not close the job created. As per this issue, the problem with calling execute is that , setTargetPathExists is not done in execute. Can we do that and other settings done in run method  in hive and call distcp.execute instead of distcp.run ?
