[[~vikram.dixit] Can you take a look?, +1. Nit: The comment should say something of the order that: Reset grace hashjoin context so that there is no state maintained when operator/work is retrieved from cache., Thanks for the review. Updated code comment in patch 2., closeOp() is a dangerous place to put things in, since it can be called during a failure condition.

This particular reset op should happen in initializeOp()., patch 3, moving reset logic from closeOp to initializeOp as Gopal suggested.,
