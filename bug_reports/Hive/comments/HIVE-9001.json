ATTACHMENT ID: 12684492 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Looks good to me except for one minor fix - in the change to data/conf/hive-log4j.properties, you seem to have a comment section that is space-aligned to go to the next line rather than having newlines, which makes it one long comment line in the patch. I can fix this myself before committing if that's okay with you.

, [~sushanth] Made the space adjustments and overwrote the previous patch since this is a very minor change.

Thanks
Hari,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12685179 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, committing to trunk., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Hari!, Does this need any documentation, or is it just a bug fix?, I think this does need documentation in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs - it adds an optional mode of logging. [~hsubramaniyan], could you please add info to that wiki?, Added the documentation in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs

Thanks
Hari, [~leftylev] : Just checking about procedure - is the process that we remove the TODOC15 flag now that Hari has added info for this on the wiki?, Yes, you can remove TODOC15 as soon as it's documented.  We don't use a DOC-DONE label, but comments show that the documentation was done.

When I do the doc, sometimes I leave TODOC## pending review (unless I'm sure of the information).  But there's no need for developers to wait for review once the information is in the doc., Thanks for the clarification! :), [~sushanth] can you please review HIVE-9407?]
