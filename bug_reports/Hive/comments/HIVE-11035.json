[This is a regression introduced by HIVE-7052. As a result of this regression, the first column id is not pushed down properly but the column name exists. For the example in the description, the value for hive.io.file.readcolumn.ids in conf is empty and the value for hive.io.file.readcolumn.names is ",x" (comma is prepended). Making the CSV joiner more reliable fixes the issue and pushes the column ids properly which is then used by SARG for populating filterColumns array.,
