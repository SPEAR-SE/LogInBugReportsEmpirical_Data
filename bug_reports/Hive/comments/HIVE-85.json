[two new options are provided:  hive.exec.compress.output and hive.exec.compress.intermediate. documentation is included in conf/hive-default.xml

patch includes some testing related changes as well (which i found necessary for this stuff):
- update to QTestUtil to only overwrite files on -Doverwrite=true iff the files actually differ
- update to SemanticAnalyzer to display boolean fields in explain plan. this is causing some additional items to show up in explain plan outputs that were not previously., When I try to apply  the patch I get the following error

patch: **** malformed patch at line 93: \ No newline at end of fil

I think this is because there is some binary data in the patch. Can you upload those separately?

Thanks, this should go in data/files/lt100.txt.deflate, attached new version of the last patch that does not have the entry for the binary file. , yet another one after resolving stuff from Namit's changes to genmapredtasks. can we please review/commit this today?, +1
