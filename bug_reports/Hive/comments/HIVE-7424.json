[Possibly related bug, Yes, thanks Gopal, it does sound very related.  Jitendra added a comment for HIVE-7422 that query should not have been vectorized also.  A theme is developing here., Jitendra's comment from HIVE-7421 fixes this problem, too:

StringConcatColScalar is not making a recursive call to evaluate its children. I think that is causing the columns to show up with nulls. StringConcatColScalar#evaluate should have following code at the beginning.

{code}
    if (childExpressions != null) {
      super.evaluateChildren(batch);
    }
{code},

ATTACHMENT ID: 12656824, I was wondering whether we should really print the stacktrace when the date string doesn't parse correctly. It is possible that there are lots of bad input records and it might cause millions of stacktaces or log lines. 

The patch looks good otherwise. +1, LOG.info("VectorUDFDateString string passed to Date.valueOf = '" + s.toString() + "'");
Instead of this we can actually check if debug mode is enabled and then print this. Otherwise, +1.

Thanks
Hari, Updated code to print bad date only in DEBUG logging.  And, got rid of stack trace print out.,
