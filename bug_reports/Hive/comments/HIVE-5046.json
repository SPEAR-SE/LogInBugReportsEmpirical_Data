[+1, If this line is wrong, shouldn't the same construct 12 lines up be changed as well?, Eugene, thanks for posting. I don't think so. The intent of the snippet you mentioned is to do something with the variable ({{HIVE_IN_PATH}}) if it is defined. That something is to make use to {{HIVE_IN_PATH}} to popualate {{HIVE_DIR}}.

On the other hand, the intent of the snippet 12 lines later (that this JIRA addresses) is to do something if the variable is not defined. That something is to set HIVE_HOME to some default value. This snippet however, checks if the variable is not null instead of checking if the variable is null., Yes, you are right.  Sorry., 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass
