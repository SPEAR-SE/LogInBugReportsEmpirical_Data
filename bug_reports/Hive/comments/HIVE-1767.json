[Can you elaborate the bug in the description? , When there is a dynamic partition, the merge task never gets launched. I was trying to figure out what's happening there.

It turns out a bug in ConditionalResolverMergeFiles that leads to the size information counted is not correct for dp queries.

Attached a patch for it., load data local inpath '/Users/heyongqiang/Documents/workspace/Hive-Index/data/files/srcbucket20.txt' INTO TABLE srcpart_merge_dp partition(ds='2008-04-08', hr=11);
load data local inpath '/Users/heyongqiang/Documents/workspace/Hive-Index/data/files/srcbucket21.txt' INTO TABLE srcpart_merge_dp partition(ds='2008-04-08', hr=11);
load data local inpath '/Users/heyongqiang/Documents/workspace/Hive-Index/data/files/srcbucket22.txt' INTO TABLE srcpart_merge_dp partition(ds='2008-04-08', hr=11);
load data local inpath '/Users/heyongqiang/Documents/workspace/Hive-Index/data/files/srcbucket23.txt' INTO TABLE srcpart_merge_dp partition(ds='2008-04-08', hr=11);


The test needs to be updated, +1

running tests, Committed. Thanks Yongqiang]
