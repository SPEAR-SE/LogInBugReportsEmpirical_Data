[[~jcamachorodriguez] Could you please help with this? Please let me know if you need more details on this., [~jcamachorodriguez] I think moving onto Calcite JoinPushTransitivePredicatesRule and RelMdPredicates to infer the predicates should be considered for HIve CBO.
I assume there is no such issue for Calcite instances., [~vitalii], HIVE-19433 may fix the issue. I agree there is no reason to not use the Calcite original methods, we need to check what are the differences between the Hive and Calcite version: if there are contributions that have been made to Hive but not ported to Calcite, we should push them to Calcite and remove the methods from the Hive side when we upgrade to new version. If there are no differences, it does not make sense to have the same code in two different places., [~vitalii] Did you get a chance to verify if HIVE-19433 fixes this issue?, Verified that HIVE-19433 fixes this issue.
