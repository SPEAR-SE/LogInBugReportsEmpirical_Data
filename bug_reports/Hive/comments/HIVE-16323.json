ATTACHMENT ID: 12870134 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Unit tests pass., [~daijy]
Should it also call syncMetaStoreClient.close(); in Hive.close() ?
, This seems to be unrelated. Do you mean to piggyback it in my patch?, This leak and also usage of syncMetaStoreClient seems to be from HIVE-14204 . Thats why I suggested it here.
We could track the syncMetaStoreClient.close() change in a separate jira as well, if you prefer that.
, metaStoreClient is causing NPE in a test. We should use getMSC() instead. , This exposes HIVE-16825, should be fixed before commit.
, Also; Hive client is used via a threadlocal. Is sharing metastore client between threads safe? That exception seems to imply someone closes metastore client while the pool threads are still running. I am guessing other code doesn't hit that because it calls getMSC, but the whole thing where some threads close and null it out and other threads reopen it, seems fragile.
, Switch metaStoreClient to getMSC, also close syncMetaStoreClient as Thejas commented.

I think this Hive client is only shared with load-dynamic-partitions threads, and within the threads, write operations are synchronized via SynchronizedMetaStoreClient. cc [~rajesh.balamohan].,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12871284 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, SynchronizedMetaStoreClient is used only in load-dynamic-partition threads. 

Should {{ObjectStore.shutdodown()}} set {{pm}} to null as this can be invoked lots of times?. Also getPartition() called via loadPartition() should be using "getSychronizedMSC()::getPartitionWithAuthInfo()" to be on safer side.
, Good point to set pm to null. However, getPartition seems involve a big block and synchronize it needs nontrivial code refactory, I don't want to touch it for now.,
