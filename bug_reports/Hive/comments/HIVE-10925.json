ATTACHMENT ID: 12737489 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures are unrelated., cc [~ekoifman] [~alangates] 

I'm making the transaction handler a static threadlocal in this patch. Can you review that change?, Changes making the transaction handler thread local static look good., +1 on the HiveConf and AuthorizationPreEventListener change, that was made threadlocal from the Metastore's perspective because a single HMSHandler object was being used by multiple threads. Having it be static-threadlocal should not negatively impact things., Being more explicit, I'm +1 on the whole patch given that we have Alan's okay on the txnhandler section. :), Committed to branches. Thanks [~sushanth] [~alangates] [~thejas]]
