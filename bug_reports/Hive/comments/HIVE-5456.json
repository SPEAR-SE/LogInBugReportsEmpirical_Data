[The problem seems to be with the logic for creating dummy "empty" files for empty partitions in case of avro tables., The current patch for HIVE-5302 fixes this same error., Thanks Sean! I will go ahead and close this as duplicate., This problem is still existing in trunk Hive-0.14.0 as of today (7/17/2014). The  cause is that the properties used in createDummyFileForEmptyPartition only contain those from a partition, thus missing the Avro schema url/literal which might only exist as a table property. ,
