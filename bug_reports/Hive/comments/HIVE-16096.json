[Such optimization is very important. Such queries will return all the data set as oppose to some rows when the filter is pushed.
, [~bslim], is this one related to HIVE-16025/CALCITE-1655, or is there some specific logic involved because it is a filter on the time dimension?, [~jcamachorodriguez] it is not, the time dimension will need more logic within the bound or we can do it as part of the interval.
, OK, then it can be tackled in a different Calcite issue; I did not mean to assign it to you, I just thought you had already fixed it.]
