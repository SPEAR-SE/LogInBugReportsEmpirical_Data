[Is this related to HIVE-8386 or HIVE-8870 (also HIVE-6198)?, It's the same stack trace as HIVE-8870, but not the other two.  (I couldn't find it when I searched for preexisting issues, and I see that it's been fixed for 0.14.)  Thanks!
, Feel free open this issue if it happens again in hive-0.14.0]
