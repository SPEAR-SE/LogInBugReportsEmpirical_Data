The change individually looks good.
However, it exposes a bigger issue that the tests have side-affects.
Ideally, QTestUtil should make sure that the tests do not have any side-affects, and initialize the
parameters everytime. Can you file a new jira to track that, and give this usecase., Committed. Thanks Ivan, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1709 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1709/])
