[thejas ,   If you are not working, I would like to assign this bug to myself. Can anyone add me into the contributors list so that I can assign it myself., [~analog.sony] I am not working on this. Please go ahead with this. , I have updated the description, this is happening only when principal is specified (ie for secure mode).
[~analog.sony] If you don't have a secure cluster, then you can replace ";principal=<>" with any similar string. For example, you should be able to reproduce it using  "jdbc:hive2://<host>:<port>;key1=val1."

Do let me know if you have any questions. I am happy to help you with this.

, thanks [~thejas].

I will let you know if I need more info., attached patch for this bug., https://reviews.apache.org/r/10859/
, Please review the changes.

https://reviews.apache.org/r/10859/, updated the patch with test case., +1, [~analog.sony] Sorry about the delay in reviewing this.
This patch does not consider "hive2://abcd.com:10000;principal=hive/HiveServer2Host@YOUR-REALM.COM" as an invalid path.
I think the better check is to check that the authority portion is not empty and host portion is null .

To illustrate how the parsing happens for above jdbc uri -
{code}
      String ustr 
      = "hive2://abcd.com:10000;principal=hive/HiveServer2Host@YOUR-REALM.COM";
      URI uri = URI.create(ustr);
      System.out.println("uri " + uri);
      System.out.println("auth " + uri.getAuthority());
      System.out.println("uinfo " + uri.getUserInfo());
      System.out.println("host " + uri.getHost());
      System.out.println("path " + uri.getPath());
{code}
has the following output - 
{code}
uri hive2://abcd.com:10000;principal=hive/HiveServer2Host@YOUR-REALM.COM
auth abcd.com:10000;principal=hive
uinfo null
host null
path /HiveServer2Host@YOUR-REALM.COM
{code}, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Anandha!, Aah.. sorry [~thejas] Missed your comment. I already committed it. Will you like to create a followup jira for this?, Ok, I will create a follow up jira for this., Created follow up jira - HIVE-4802
