[[~sershe], [~hagleitn] [~sseth] can one of you guys please take a look at the earliest and remove this file: itests/thirdparty/spark-1.2.0-bin-hadoop2-without-hive.tgz?  It's blocking the svn sync to Hive Git mirror., removed file, Thank you Gunther, I pushed current llap branch to git server. But this problem does not seem to be resolved. {{spark-1.2.0-bin-hadoop2-without-hive.tgz}} is not included in repository, so we cannot remove this any more. 
Does anyone see the same problem? 

{code}
$ git push my-origin lap

Thank you., [~hagleitn] [~gopalv] [~vikram.dixit] [~sseth] [~prasanth_j] maybe now is the good time to destroy the history of the llap branch? :)
We can rebase to exclude the large file from history, and also rename all the commits that are not attached to JIRAs. , At master branch the history might be rewritten. So it's okay to push master branch to GitHub server.
Yes, I'll be happy with that. And of course if there is something I can help you, I'll do that. Thank you.]
