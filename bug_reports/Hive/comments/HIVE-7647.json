[~ashutoshc] This was part of the original HS2 functionality. Do you remember why it was done this way, seemingly intentional? Thanks, Most initial Beeline code was copy-pasted from sqline project. So, I am not sure this specific functionality was intended and subsequently tested. If it doesnt work, than unless someone fixes its better to remove it., Gotcha .. Thanks for the clarification.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12660466, [~ngangam] The change seems simple and reasonable. but could you please check code history to find out how that few lines got in for the first place. I just wanted to make sure that we do introduce regressions on this., [~xuefuz] I checked the history & it was part of the checkin for HS2 functionality. Based on the note above from [~ashutoshc] this code may have been copied from SQLLine. So it may have been un-intentional. Thanks, Would someone be able to review this? Thanks in advance, +1, [~ngangam], it looks like your patch needs to be rebased., [~xuefuz] I will attach a new patch today., [~xuefuz] Patch has been rebased to the latest trunk. Thank you ,

I have added a Release Note to this JIRA. However, I do not appear to be privileged enough to edit the wiki page mentioned above. Is that limited to committers only? Thanks, Wiki edit permission just requires a Confluence account and a request:

* [About This Wiki -- How to get permission to edit | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AboutThisWiki#AboutThisWiki-Howtogetpermissiontoedit], [~leftylev] Thank you for granting me Wiki-write permissions. I have added a link to this JIRA on the Beeline Command Options wiki page. Thanks, Nicely done, [~ngangam].  Why didn't you mention the fix for --color too?, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
