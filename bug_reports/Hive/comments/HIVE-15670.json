[[~prasanth_j] [~pxiong] fyi, May I ask what's the purpose of storing this JSON in the tableproperties? Seems pretty expensive to me. If you want to keep track of the accuracy of column stats, why not populate a "last updated" timestamp in the appropriate column statistic?, Beats me... the current implementation is as such., Thanks for the response. From the perspective of a client issuing an RPC to alter column stats, it seems like a rather questionable side-effect to also alter the table metadata with a pretty big payload. Instead of "fixing" this issue by changing the database schema, could we instead remove the JSON string altogether?

I'm definitely not familiar with the implementation details, just trying to provide a perspective from a Metastore client that is not Hive., Yeah I suggested having bitmask as one of the possible solutions. Let me modify the description :)]
