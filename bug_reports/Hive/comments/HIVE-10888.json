[I'm seeing a similar issue, in Hive 0.14. I have a two-level partition -- partitioned by (date string, bucket string) and it seems that most queries do not include the default partition (for bucket) when run. While I can run  create temp table as select *, and get a fully functioning table, I can not simply run select * where, and get useable results from the default partition, when I have a where query.

This may be a regression introduced in HIVE-4878. I'll check through some support channels to see what I can find. ]
