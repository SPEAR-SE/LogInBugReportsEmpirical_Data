[+1 from the hcat side (non-binding on the hive metastore side).  It definitely is better to get the same defaults that Hive has for the table rather than having different defaults depending on the route you come in., didn't fix the HCatCreateTableDesc in hive.hcatalog.api, One more change is required on the HCat side - there's a new StorageDescriptor and a new SerDeInfo object being generated further down that clobber this. Also, org.apache.hcatalog.* is considered deprecated-frozen and are not supposed to be updated (to retain behaviour equivalence with 0.11).

I'll regenerate this patch with these changes., Attached updated patch, also includes a test to check that properties are identical-ish to an empty table created by the metadata table., 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass
