[HIVE-4497.1.patch - adds beeline to iterate.hive.tests in build.properties
, This is a duplicate of HIVE-4357 (which I never got around to testing), but that patch positions beeline after ql, and it makes more sense to run it after jdbc as is done here.

+1 (someone else needs to test and commit since I don't have a build farm)., Patch available at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4357
, Committed to trunk. Thanks Thejas., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2089 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2089/])
