[SELECT p_day,
       count(*) 
       from
    (SELECT p_day  ,uid,poid
     FROM t_app_bd_stat
     WHERE p_day >=20130910
         AND p_day<=20130917
         AND newuser =1
     GROUP BY p_day,uid,poid) tmp
GROUP BY p_day
ORDER BY p_day ASC

the result get a lot of lines with a same p_day value., HIVE-5149 has supposedly fixed this. If you can still reproduce this on trunk or branch 0.12, feel free to reopen.]
