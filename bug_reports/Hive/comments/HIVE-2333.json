[Seems related to HIVE-2303. I propose we should escape the delimiters always, irrespective of whether it is configured or not., Interesting. I am not sure what the semantics should be. Protobuf for example does not support null arrays and null arrays are empty. What serde' support what complex types is an interesting question I do not know the answerto. It would be great to have a table of Lazy, thrift, avro, ocr, rcfile and determine exactly what is supported by each., The key difference to protobuf is that the serdes should satisfy the Hive contract.  I'm not sure what the best way to express the contract is but certainly if a serde does not support a certain condition, at the very least, a warning needs to be shown.

I agree. We also need to be clear what the contract is and draw a matrix of what the current serde's do.

The lazy simple is the standard serde and it has been around for a long time. Unless it has broken recently we might be best making a new serde and letting that be the default for new tables. I suggest this because someone is likely dependent on the current behaviour.

So if you escape the delimiter does it abide by the contract?, Fair enough.  I'd argue putting together a deprecation plan for lazy simple though since IMO the default serde should just work.]
