[The problem is that the ZooKeeper client is used before it is connected (may or may not occur depending on environment). I could reproduce this yesterday on my Mac but not this morning.

Attached patch will add a wait for SyncConnected with timeout to address this. Can you please try the patch?
, Updated patch to increase timeout for slow test environments., I was able to reproduce failures before the patch. With the latest patch, failures went away and tests pass. Patch looks good to me. Those who were seeing failures earlier can try with this patch and report back., Thanks, Thomas for taking this up. Very much appreciated!, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Thomas!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1358 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1358/])
