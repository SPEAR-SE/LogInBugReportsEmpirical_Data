[Minimum query to reproduce the issue:
{noformat}
select unionsrc.key FROM (select 'tst1' as key, count(1) as value from src s1) unionsrc;
{noformat} - returns 500 rows of tst1 whereas it should return just 1.
If you add value to select list -
{noformat}
select unionsrc.key,unionsrc.value FROM (select 'tst1' as key, count(1) as value from src s1) unionsrc;
{noformat} the problem disappears.

ASTs for both queries, both before and after CBO differ only in addition of the last select expression; however, as is obvious from the below, in CBO the absence of said expression causes the count to be completely gone.

Note where count is... in key-only query, where this SELEXPR is gone, there's no count, so result changes., Appears to be caused by an aggregate in Optiq plan that has neither aggregate functions nor group by expressions; needs to be fixed, it was suggested that via Optiq rule would be the best., I added the aggregation to plan before AST transformation (the rule-based addition doesn't work because the type of the node is different when you add:
{noformat}
Cannot add expression of different type to set:
set type is RecordType() NOT NULL
expression type is RecordType(BIGINT NOT NULL $f0) NOT NULL
set is rel#50:HiveAggregateRel.HIVE.[](child=HepRelVertex#49,group={})
{noformat}

That doesn't appear to do anything (presumably because there's no select expression in projection rel to put the aggregate into).
Probably the aggregate needs to be added back to inner of the AST, or another intermediate projection needs to be added. I will continue looking tomorrow., Here's partial fix in process... first I tried using Optiq rules but that doesn't work due to some problems with transform (described in the patch).
I added a fix to post-CBO plan processing (before AST conversion), which fixes the issue for one small query that originally had the problem (see q file), but not for the original query. I'd need to take a look at that (probably the fix needs to be in a better place, or some check mismatches), for now attaching the in-progress patch since I will be on vacation soon, [~ashutoshc] fyi, small update. judging by debug logging the fixup is simply never called even though aggregates that are lost are of the same pattern, probably need to do it separately in ASTConverter after derived table stuff, I just put it there by accident because i had some debug logging there , I will still look at this today, patch that actually works for the original complex query, but parts may still be hacky.
Also includes the Optiq rule that doesn't work. Perhaps optiq rule can be changed to match proj-agg, and replaced it with proj-intermediate proj-new agg, that way the transform call will not crap out hopefully. Maybe I'll try this tomorrow.

, After we discussed, we choose to create a derived table with new proj and aggr to address it based on [~sershe]'s code, review link: https://reviews.apache.org/r/26209/,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12673134, [~ashutoshc] could you please kindly commit? This will also solve union5 and union7 problem. , Btw, can you try the original simple query
{noformat}
select unionsrc.key FROM (select 'tst1' as key, count(1) as value from src s1) unionsrc;
{noformat}
Just checking. I thought derived projection we need has to be different (one should include the dummy count() for it to be accounted for and work, and one should exclude it because the query doesn't have it); I wonder if this will work with simple query?, Also some feedback in RB, mostly nits, [~sershe], I have just tried select unionsrc.key FROM (select 'tst1' as key, count(1) as value from src s1) unionsrc;
the output is "tst1" as we expect., address Sergey's comments, address John's comments,
