[Pasted from http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-734 as Ning corrrectly found out.

The issue is not null vs. null comparison - the join happens at the reducer where the keys are not even taken into consideration.
NULL hashes to the same value, which explains this behavior.

The correct fix would be to filter the rows with NULL keys at the mapper itself.

However, we need to figure out the following:

1. Expected semantics when join key consists of a null and a non-null column. If that is also same (4, NULL) does not join with (4, NULL), then we can safely
    filter all rows even if one key is NULL.
2. Expected behavior of outer joins.
