[[~prasanth_j] [~sershe] Any idea how to fix this? Does this mean we can build Hive only using Oracle jdk?, [~vihangk1] Is that warning or error? open-jdk should have sun.misc.cleaner, It errors out for me. I was playing around using dockers containers and tried to build hive code and it errors out., [~vihangk1] Are you sure it was OpenJdk8 and not 9? Other projects are having to make changes for jdk9, e.g.  HADOOP-12760, I am sure its jdk-8. Let me see if I can provide repro steps., Hmm... I think this warning is separate from the error, I think I saw it before in successful builds. Are there any other errors?, I think you are right [~sershe] It was OOM error caused due to insufficient memory for maven. Incidentally, this error was the one reported right after and it looked like the build failed due to this error. Will close this as not an issue.]
