[Couldn't find anything in standard so I checked on few other DBs. Surprisingly, mysql and oracle has same behavior as Hive for {{c1.i + c2.i}} However they throw exception for {{c1.i + ' ' + c2.i}} Postgres throws for both. Sql server does string concat in both cases. Personally, I liked sql server behavior and expected that behavior. However, since standard doesnt say anything on this topic (maybe it did but I couldnt find it) and few other DBs do exhibit same behavior, I think there is no need to change anything for Hive. For second case, throwing exception is an option but historically Hive has chosen to return null instead of exception in such ambiguous cases. 
So, I will say this is "working as designed"., Eh]
