[For getColumns, the issue is with the columnNamePattern.  Specifying "%" in both methods produces the expected results, but specifying null returns a result set with 0 records.  The specification says that if null is used, the parameter will not be used in the search (which should be the equivalent of "%"), which is what most other JDBC drivers do.

Squirrel does not show the catalog and I assume it is due to this., Seems to be an Impala bug, and not actually a JDBC bug. This is now being tracked here: https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-925]
