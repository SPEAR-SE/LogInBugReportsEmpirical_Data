ATTACHMENT ID: 12795697 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Removing 2.0.1 target. Please feel free to commit to branch-2 anyway and fix for 2.0.1 if this happens before the release., The test failure above shows us that not all issues relating to this are resolved - null-valued dyn partitioning with a custom location still has an issue. Need to look into it further. Removing it from 2.0.1 for now seems appropriate., Removing 2.1.0 target. Please feel free to commit to branch-2.1 anyway and fix for 2.1.0 if this happens before the release., [~sushanth] Removing target 1.2.2. Feel free to commit to branch 1.2 if you need this., [~sushanth], i could not find this in master. will this go into 2.2.0? Thanks., Yes, this is not committed. There is no reason leave it idle. I triggered a precommit test #4​32​5, will commit once test pass., [~daijy], is it ready to be committed? Thanks.]
