[[~sseth] I attached a patch to related jira. You can take it and secure shuffle :), [~sseth] Removed myself for now.. looking at it, but it may be faster for you to take a look, Was looking at this. Realized I hadn't actually removed. The security works similar to MR and Tez and an app specific token (owned by the user) is required to access data from shuffle. Closing this. Will create a separate jira for SSL.]
