[[~stakiar] [~vihangk1] Would you like take a look at this?, [~infinitymittal] can you provide some examples of when this is happening? Do you have an easy way to re-produce this?, [~stakiar] This was noticed in my setup every time a MERGE INTO query is used. I am not aware whether other cases would cause the same to happen in some specific scenario., Is this just when {{MERGE INTO}} queries are run? This might be specific to Hive-ACID then., It definitely happens with {{MERGE INTO}} queries. I tried some simple non merge queries and did not see the behavior. You are right, it might be specific to ACID but I cannot say for sure., CC: [~ashutoshc]]
