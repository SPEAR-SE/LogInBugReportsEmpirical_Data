[In addition to this file, I assume we also need to revert changes introduced in HIVE-5511 [~ekoifman] would you like to attach a patch for this?, [~ekoifman] Can you respond on Ashutosh's comment ? 

Looks like most of the changes in HIVE-5511 are not specific to the issue, but were general cleanup.  And the attached patch reverts changes that were specific to the log handling.
, [~thejas],[~hashutosh] the attached patch reverts all changes that were part of HIVE-5511 needed to handle the 'special' override-container-log4j, just like the bug description says.  HIVE-5511 also included some refactoring, which should not be reverted., +1
, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks for the contribution Eugene!
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
