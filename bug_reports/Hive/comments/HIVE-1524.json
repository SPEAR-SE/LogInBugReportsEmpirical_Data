[Using UUID to get a unique job ID for each MapRedTask and keep it in the JobConf. , tests are still running now. , looks good to me.

one comment: getJobID is a very confusing name (sounds like we are getting the hadoop jobid or something like that). it would be nice to make it more explicit (getHiveJobID perhaps?)., changed getJobID() to getHiveJobID()., will commit once tests pass., committed - thanks Ning., HIVE-1524 backporting to HIVE 0.6 branch, Thanks for back porting to 0.6 yourchanges. The code changes look good. Can you include the other 2 files (parallel.q and parallel.q.out) in the patch as well? 
, I have re-upload this patch including parallel.q and parallel.q.out, Reopening for backport to 0.6, Currently branch 0.6 is broken. It may be caused by HIVE-675 patch. I'll run test after that one is resolved. , I have done the load test in our company using branch 0.6 with HIVE-1524 patch, it seems ok. 
And another interesting thing is the HIVE-1019 problem will be sloved by HIVE-1524 as same time, if HIVE-1524 works well with branch 0.6]
