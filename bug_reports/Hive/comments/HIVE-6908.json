[Attaching a fix., Doesn't this mean test is poorly written if it is relying on timing of operations ? May be test can be rewritten in a different way so it doesnt rely on timeouts., We can eliminate the polling timeout, but I guess the author was thinking that timeout is better than hang for unit-test purpose, if the status is not updated successfully.  Or did you have some other thoughts?,
