[There are basically 2 lines of change. Mostly are overwrite of test files., +1, This patch changes the default value of hive.security.authorization.createtable.owner.grants
from "All" to null, which means that by default users will not have the ability to access tables
that they have created, right?

If that's the case then I think you should really fix the underlying problem in HiveConf instead
of working around it by creating a default setting that virtually everyone will end up having
to reset in hive-site.xml
, @Carl, agree. If we can find a way to avoid setting them to null in default, that will be great.
But the problem seems come from hadoop's Configuration or Java's Properties., This problem is related to HADOOP-1347.

And it sounds like an immediate workaround is to reset the property value
using " " instead of "". The root of the problem is allowing property values
to be null-valued in the first place, and then using a serialization mechanism
(XML) that can't differentiate between null and empty-string. 

Since we already allow the user to specify "All", maybe the real solution to this
problem (given the limitations of o.a.h.conf.Configuration and XML) is to also
allow the user to to specify "None".
