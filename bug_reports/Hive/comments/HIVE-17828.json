[cc [~harishjp] looks like some small typos/sizes in the schema, The attached patch worked for me for upgrade and new 3.0.0 install. Tested this only in mysql. Not sure if other DBs are also broken, [~sershe] can you please take a look?
, [~prasanth_j] can you also change string lengths to 767? That is the limit on some mysql versions/configurations. Search for "767" in the error message above., I did not see the issue in mysql 5.7.10. But when I downgraded to 5.6.38 I saw the 767 limit for key column. Fixed it in the new path. I don't see other issues that [~gopalv] mentioned even with 5.6 version., +1 pending tests, Patch picked up by precommit but did not run any tests. Will retry,
