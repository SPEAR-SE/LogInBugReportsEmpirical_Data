[[~sseth] any thoughts/objections?, Nope. Half the work is already done in terms of defining the protobuf structures. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-305?

Also the protobuf rpc engine?, 1) That JIRA has no activity. 
2) Cannot we use the same RPC engine as other endpoints?
3) Would that actually require changes to Tez rather than Hive? From cursory look at heartbeats in Umbilical... in Hive I thought it's possible to just do in LLAP task communicator from AM side. We could create a regular endpoint there., The endpoint is in the LLAP AM plugin. However, that extends an upstream tez plugin - so some translation will likely be required. That's an unnecessary step. Other than time to work on this, another thing to watch out for is the cost of serializing protobuf, and memory overhead of copying buffers with protobuf rpc engine.
At the moment, some parts of the system use the ProtobufRpcEngine from Hadoop, other parts use the WritableRpcEngine (specifically the task to AM communication).

When I say part of he work is done - it's the representation of various pieces of information in protobuf.]
