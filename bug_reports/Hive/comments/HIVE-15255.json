[[~sseth] [~prasanth_j] fyi, [~sershe] - this is multiple attempts of the same task being re-scheduled. The delay can be controlled via "hive.llap.task.scheduler.node.reenable.min.timeout.ms" if I'm not mistaken. NodeBlacklistConf in LlapTaskScheduler, Note that this doesn't actually work. The pause is minimal or non-existent and there's no incremental fallback, Looking at the disable/enable code, this should have worked. However, I wonder if scheduling takes into account disabled nodes correctly? I cannot find special processing for service busy., A node gets marked bad irrespective of the reason for a task completion (except success).
Not sure what would have caused this - same node, and same task (different attempts). If the nodes were different - that is understandable., Will reopen if I see it again]
