[Bhushan, I am not sure I understand.
2 things:
1. If you wanted to disable sorting, can't you just set {{hive.enforce.sorting}} to false before your queries.
2. If you disable sorting, the metadata of the table would still reflect that the table is sorted but the actual data would not be sorted. I can't think of a scenario where that would be desirable.

Thoughts?, For #1, I was referring to queries that populate the table.]
