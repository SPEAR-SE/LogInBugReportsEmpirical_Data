One small issue, it looks like the static method getUserGroupInformation is no longer used.  Unless you object I'll remove it before I check the code in., Patch checked in.  Thanks Roshan., Doc question:  Does this belong in the Streaming Data Ingest wiki?

* [Streaming Data Ingest | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Streaming+Data+Ingest], [~leftylev]. Yes Thanks for bringing it up. I will work with [~alangates] on updating that., [~leftylev] or [~ashutoshc] can you grant me write permission on that wiki ?, Sorry [~roshan_naik], I can't grant write permission on the wiki but Ashutosh can.  Just so you know (and so everyone else knows), the usual procedure is to send the request to user@hive.apache.org as explained in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AboutThisWiki.

Do you have a Confluence account?  If not:  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/signup.action., [~leftylev] FYI... I have updated the wiki , Thanks Roshan, looks good.  I made a few trivial edits.

* [Streaming Data Ingest | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Streaming+Data+Ingest], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
