[changing ivy to use 2.2.0 fixes this (tho build runs a lot slower). I remember we had a problem we ivy 2.2.0 and downloading tarballs, though we no longer depend on tgz so things should be ok?, I hit this too with a different jar. Here is the IVY issue that talks about this problem (in ivy 2.1.0) https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY-1194, I got similar thing yesterday afternoon. And it went back to work this morning.

Possibly, there is something wrong with the SHA-1 in the repository?, No, the SHA-1 is correct. The problem is that (apparently) the server hosting the jar has turned on gzip encoding but IVY (pre 2.2.0) does not decode it after receiving the content and what you get is a GZIpped version of jar whose sha-1 will of course differ from the original jar.

Funny that a wget on the same URL behaved in the same way (i.e. GZipped jar)., Download is working again, repo must've fixed the issue on their end. Closing this ticket.]
