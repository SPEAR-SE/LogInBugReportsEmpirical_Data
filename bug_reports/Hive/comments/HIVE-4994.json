[Added a section to the Hive wiki's home page for HCatalog & WebHCat documentation.  Created a wikidoc for the WebHCat manual which currently contains links to WebHCat chapters in the HCatalog 0.5.0 docs: 

* [Hive Home|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home]
* [WebHCat (Templeton) manual|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat], The WebHCat docs are all converted to wikidocs:

* WebHCat home page:  [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat]

Next step:  linking the WebHCat wikidocs to corresponding Hive and HCatalog docs, starting with the configuration docs., Lefty, Which docs still need to be linked ? (trying to understand what pages you are referring to in above comment)., These topics have already been linked:  overviews, install, configure, CLI, DDL, data types, authorization, and web (HWI & WebHCat, a tenuous connection).

These topics still need to be linked: 

* _dynamic partitions_ 
** HCatalog's [Dynamic Partitioning|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+DynamicPartitions]
** Hive Tutorial's [Dynamic-Partition Insert|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Tutorial#Tutorial-DynamicPartitionInsert]
** Hive DML's [Dynamic Partition Inserts|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DML#LanguageManualDML-DynamicPartitionInserts]
** Hive design doc [Dynamic Partitions|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DynamicPartitions]

* _error logs_
** Getting Started [Error Logs|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs]
** HCatalog install's "Logging" -- nope, it's gone now
** WebHCat [Log Files|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+UsingWebHCat#WebHCatUsingWebHCat-LogFiles]
** also [HIVE-5528|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5528]: hive log file name in local is ".log"

* _storage formats_ 
** HCatalog [Storage Formats|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+StorageFormats]
*** already linked to Hive [SerDe|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SerDe]
*** needs a link to Hive Language Manual's [ORC Files|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+ORC]
*** if we ever get docs for other file formats, add links to them 
** Hive docs
*** link DDL's [Row Format, Storage Format, and SerDe|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-RowFormat%2CStorageFormat%2CandSerDe] to HCatalog doc, and vice versa
*** [SerDe|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SerDe] needs links from other Hive docs 
*** Getting Started and Tutorial could have links to DDL doc's "Row Format, Storage Format, and SerDe"
*** design doc [Hive Storage Handlers|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/StorageHandlers] should be included somehow in the Language Manual's "File Formats" section, or linked from there

*Background:*  In a hive-dev discussion last May, [~cwsteinbach] said he preferred integrating the HCatalog & WebHCat docs with the Hive docs, rather than keeping them in separate lumps.  I found that approach intractable, so these links are an attempt to integrate all the docs with cross-references.  See "Re: Moving HCatalog docs to wiki" here: 

* Carl's preference:  [16 May 22:16 GMT|http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hive-dev/201305.mbox/%3cCACf6RrwjsoWyQZPRZJWB_+NSDfwSvxxfG+nduXyWb6E+1m0ggQ@mail.gmail.com%3e] 
* earlier messages:  [16 May 04:09 GMT|http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hive-dev/201305.mbox/%3cCAATF2qgzikuS=j_hVHAyFWNvX77P0AcWhs49=zWSc0AvmLojNQ@mail.gmail.com%3e] -- note unfinished tasks:  move the old HCat wiki into Hive (where?), remove HCat tabs, update Hive description to include HCat -- oh, you just did that, thanks Thejas.

But it's easy to move things around now that all the docs are in wiki format.  The HCatalog & WebHCat overview pages could point to docs in other locations.  Navigation links at the bottom of each wikidoc would keep the original order available for anyone who wants to access the docs that way.  So I welcome alternative organization ideas.
, All done now.  Dynamic partitions, error logs, and storage formats are linked to the Hive docs, and various Hive docs are linked to each other and to the HCatalog/WebHCat docs.

Any further changes can be considered improvements.  The doc conversion is finished.  Whew., Marking it as resolved. Thanks for the contribution Lefty!
