[exprNodeFuncDesc's constructor now takes the function name as an argument and uses it to look up the correct display name and all the other stuff.

Some tests had wrong display names, so I overwrote them., +1

Your changes look good

However, it will conflict with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-673 which Zheng is testing right now.
Please regenerate the patch after that has been committed., running tests - will commit if they pass, Committed. Thanks Emil, We might want to do the same change to GenericUDF. Basically, "getDisplayString" should take one additional parameter "functionName" which can be passed in to construct the display string.
, Emil, can you file a new JIRA for the above]
