[One of the checks is mentioned in HIVE-5623. I figure these checks are trivial enough that they can all be fixed at the same time., This issue has been fixed as part of HIVE-9111 by [~prasanth_j], correct me if am wrong., HIVE-9111 only fixed the NPEs. It did not fix the IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown when getListElement(Object, int) receives an index out of range., HIVE-5623 is committed to master and branch-1 which should fix the IndexOutOfBoundsException mentioned above., Looks resolved to me. Should I Resolve the ticket since there's no Assignee?, Resolved by HIVE-5623 and HIVE-9111, [~freastro] Thanks for verifying. I just resolved the issue.]
