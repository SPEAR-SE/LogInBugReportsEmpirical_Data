ATTACHMENT ID: 12776651 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Those tests are not related., [~szehon] Can you help review the patch?, Chatted with Aihua on patch, seems simple.

Small comment for consideration, does it make sense to init timestamp variable to 0, and then do the loop from 0 to result.rawCells().length?  For cleaner code.

And you may know more than me, does this qualify for backward-incompatibility?  +1 other than those.

, 1. Timestamp variable can be negative. One way is to init it to LONG.MIN_VALUE, but I thought the current way is kind of the same. Somehow trying to avoid init to MIN_VALUE. :) Let me know if you want me to make that change.

2. Yeah. You are right. It will be backward-imcompatibility. I will mark that., Whoops you are right, ignore that suggestion then :), Submitted to master. Thanks Szehon for reviewing.]
