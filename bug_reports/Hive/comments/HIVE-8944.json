http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/logs/HIVE-TRUNK-HADOOP-1-48/, FYI [~alangates], Note, this patch will conflict with HIVE-8828, so it should wait and go behind it.  Once that's in I'll need to regenerate the patch.  But I'm posting this now so people can review it and the tests can run., +1,
