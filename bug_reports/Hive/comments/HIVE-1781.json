[In the patch, I remove the incomplete entries before the post execution hooks, so that
post-execute hooks don't have to change., For a query like "select key, value from src where key < 10", the outputs used to be a temp file, now the outputs are empty. Is this good.
Will the outputs be null if do a "insert overwrite [local] directory select key, value from src"?, The outputs are not empty.
This was a bug I fixed, but I think I forgot to update some of the log files.

When you run the tests, can you update them ?, +1 running tests., Committed! Thanks Namit!]
