[It's possible that the job finished and then get removed from the JobTracker within 1 second. But I think our cluster is configured to avoid that to happen.

, The JobTracker log shows the job is completed about 8 minutes earlier, and retired 3 minutes earlier.

, Unfortunately Hive's progress information (the "report" String from the code above) does not include timestamps, so there is no way to know what happened during those 2 minutes.

We should include the timestamp into the "report" String.
, This patch adds the time stamp to the log in the following format:

{noformat}
2009-06-06 11:56:13,872 map = 100%,  reduce =100%
{noformat}, +1

will merge if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Zheng, This patch makes sure we don't output one line per second. The behavior is that we will output at least one line per minute if no status change is detected.
, The current behavior is showing one log line per second. This may not be good in case the job runs a long time., Committed. Thanks Zheng , Committed. Thanks Zheng]
