[[~branky] Thanks for pointing this out. I'm curious if this solves any particular problem. If so, putting the problem in the description would be very helpful. I asked the question because I thought this might solve HIVE-4703. I tried but it seemed not helping that. Thanks., Xuefu Zhang thanks for following up. I got few problems when I work on Cascading and Hive/HCatalog integration(https://github.com/branky/cascading.hive). They can be fixed along with HIVE-6163 (was also reported by me) and HIVE-5728. I did patch on my own fork of Hive(https://github.com/branky/hive/commit/20c62b3ec73a55d84eeffca6eab4af066e04e22a) to make the integration work. 

Regarding this issue, I found the fix may not be that simple. OrcSerde is included in ql module which depend on serde module actually. Then it will cause cyclic dependency. I would cancel this issue and try to find other workaround.  , Thanks, Branky. Regretfully, I still cannot figure out the integration problem that you were facing. However, HIVE-5278 is already fixed. It would be great if you can submit a patch for HIVE-6163. I'd be happy to review it., Since the issue was not so intuitive, it's not easy to elaborate. Anyway, as mentioned in HIVE-4703, "gets the information from StorageDescriptor" would be a longer fix, then I think we can resolve this issue.  , Xuefu Zhang, I'd love to submit a patch for HIVE-6163. Thanks!]
