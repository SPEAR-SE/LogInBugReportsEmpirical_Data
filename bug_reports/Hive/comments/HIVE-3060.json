[This exception is thrown when Hive-0.9.0 is deployed with Hadoop-X.0.0 where X > 0. 

Reason for above exception,
    Hive loads 0.20,0.20S and 0.23 version of hadoopshims. We get hadoop version from classpath "VersionInfo.getVersion()" is 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT. But returning 0.20S if X > 0. 

Correct me If I am wrong,
As hadoop-0.23 name is same as hadoop-2.0.0, hive should support for hadoop-2.0.0. i.e we need to add haddop shims for hadoop-2.0.0., Dupe of HIVE-3029 ? Can you try the patch attached there and if it works, can you close this one ?, I verified with patch. It is working fine. Please duplicate this issue. Thanks :-)]
