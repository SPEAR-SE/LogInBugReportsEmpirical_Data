[Isn't this expected? Insert into will just create those copy files you see, with the same bucket id as seen above. This is not expected to affect any functionality and hive takes care of those copies correctly. Others can confirm.

Do you seen any functionality broken due to this?, Yeah it is expected and hive will be managing... But it is increasing number of small files.. Which in turn increases number of mappers.. So more # of resources unnecessarily.  
Please correct me if wrong, I think number of mappers can be controlled via other means like split size configurations, using CombineHiveInputFormat etc. Is this a Tez usecase? Tez does split grouping as well which should lead to lesser mappers.]
