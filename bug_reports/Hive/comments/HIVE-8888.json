ATTACHMENT ID: 12682247 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Don't think the test failures are related.

[~prasanth_j] thoughts? I'm +1 on the last patch., [~hagleitn] Even I don't think the test failure is related. The code changes should not affect TestCliDriver tests. I ran the test locally and it ran successfully.

Also can we have this for 0.14.1?
, [~hagleitn]/[~ashutoshc] Should this go into 0.14.1?, Committed to trunk, This is causing incorrect query results. Should go into 0.14.1.
, Committed to branch., The original patch doesn't actually work. The problem is that we still collect the mj during visiting the nodes. We need to clear that before bailing out of work generation.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12684137 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, failures are unrelated., [~hagleitn] due to HIVE-8964 the latest ptest run won't actually test {{lvj_mapjoin.q}} if you've verified it works locally, I will enable that test after the latest patch is committed., [~brocknoland] I have verified that lvj_mapjoin works locally. Thanks., Last patch looks good to me. +1, Committed this patch to trunk. lvj_mapjoin.q ran successfully locally for me too. [~brocknoland] Can you reenable lvj_mapjoin.q test to see if it runs successfully now?, HIVE-8707 fixed ordering issues in hashmap between JDK8 vs older version. The test diff changes in .5 patch is not required for the branch. Attaching patch for the branch 0.14.1 which is same as Gunther's .5 patch but without test diff changes., Committed patch with [~hagleitn]'s fix  to branch-0.14, [~brocknoland] I have committed this patch to trunk and branch-0.14.1. Please reopen this issue if lvj_mapjoin.q hangs again in test run., I have just enabled the test. I will keep an eye on the tests., Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
