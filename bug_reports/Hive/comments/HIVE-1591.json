[Once https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1590 is fixed, this will automatically enable locking., I applied this patch and tried the following scenario.

Client 1:  insert overwrite table pokes2 select * from pokes;

Client 2:  show locks;

Client 2 is getting an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:  1.

Without the patch, show locks works fine.

Besides addressing this issue, two other items:

* the cause of the exception is getting swallowed, so it never makes it to hive.log, due to the code below in DDLTask.showLocks.  It should be passing e along as the cause argument to the 2-arg HiveException constructor so that there will be a "Caused By" in the stack dump.

   } catch (Exception e) {
      throw new HiveException(e.toString());
    }

* we really need tests for actual concurrency
