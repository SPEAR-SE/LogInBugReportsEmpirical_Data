[The 4th query has different results for row- vs vector-mode output.
{noformat}
-- Wrong format. Should all be NULL.
SELECT
  to_unix_timestamp(stimestamp1) AS c1,
  year(stimestamp1),
  month(stimestamp1),
  day(stimestamp1),
  dayofmonth(stimestamp1),
  weekofyear(stimestamp1),
  hour(stimestamp1),
  minute(stimestamp1),
  second(stimestamp1)
FROM alltypesorc_wrong
ORDER BY c1;
{noformat}

So, it appears as if in the case row-mode might be wrong., This was fixed along the way.]
