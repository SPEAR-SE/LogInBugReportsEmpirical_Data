[HIVE-2963.1.patch - This is a trivial patch - it adds hive.metastore.token.signature to HiveConf.metaVars. I can't think of any non-trivial way to add an unit test for this.
, This patch fails compilation of test target. You can reproduce it with {{ant clean package test}}, HIVE-2963.2.patch - fixes test compile problem, +1, Same root cause as in HIVE-2918. No longer a problem after that went in., This issue is fixed and released as part of 0.10.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
