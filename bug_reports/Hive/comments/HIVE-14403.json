[Patch to fix this, along with additional log messages and unit tests.

The core change in the patch is the following... 
{code}
-        val = new MutableInt(1);
+        val = new MutableInt(0);
{code}


[~hagleitn], [~prasanth_j] - please review., +1, Minor update to fix an import and re-introduce a break statement which was accidentally deleted (exited out of a loop early, and functionally harmless to skip it),
