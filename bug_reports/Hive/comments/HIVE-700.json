[usage: 
drop function function_name, I dont think we should allow DROP FUNCTION - we should only support
DROP TEMPORARY FUNCTION - this cannot drop the functions that were not added temporarily.
If not already there, FunctionRegistry needs to be enhanced to store the fact whether a function is temporary or not.

Also, 

1. Can you add a negative test which tries to drop a permanent function and fails.
2. Can you change the existing tests with a 'create temporary function' to have a 'drop temporary function' at the end ?
