looks good - will commit if the tests pass

As a followup, can you also add another test case later on.
Number of buckets =4 and we are selecting 1 out of 2., Hi Namit,
Let's do it in this jira. I will add this testcase in a new patch. thanks, OK, I will wait for the new patch then.
Also, I got 2 diffs in TestParse - please fix the logs there also., new patch. Thanks Namit., Also it seems sampling an empty bucketed table will get a compile error (by empty, i mean table is bucketed but no data in that table). 
If this is a problem, we may need to open another jira for this.
