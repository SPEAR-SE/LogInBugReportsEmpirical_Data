BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 4 minutes 15 seconds

{code}, This is due to

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-13

load_fs.q references '/tmp/load2_*'.

Namit, look in your /tmp directory and you'll find files with names like 

somehost.facebook.com:9000

One fix is to just delete those files, but something within FB environment creates them there occasionally, so we may want to come up with a better fix.
, Thanks John, that was the problem]
