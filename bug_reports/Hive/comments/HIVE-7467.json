[The workaround mentioned in HBASE-10877 can solve the problem.
Not sure if there's anything to be done on Hive or Spark side., Assign to Jimmy as he has the expertise on HBase., This relates to HBASE-10304. It's decided that we just document the work-arounds in HBase, instead of any code change.

This is the list of suggested work-arounds:

{noformat}
$ HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/path/to/hbase-protocol.jar:/etc/hbase/conf hadoop jar MyApp-job.jar ...
$ HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(hbase mapredcp):/etc/hbase/conf hadoop jar MyApp-job.jar ...
$ HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(hbase classpath) hadoop jar MyApp-job.jar ...
$ HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(hbase mapredcp):/etc/hbase/conf hadoop jar MyApp.jar MyJobMainClass -libjars $(hbase mapredcp | tr ':' ',') ...
{noformat}

Basically, the idea is to make sure hbase-protocol.jar is in the hadoop classpath., [~lirui], does this help? This should be a generic problem that applies to other branches too., [~jxiang] - thanks for the update!
I know there's workarounds to this issue. The JIRA here is mainly to make sure if there's anything else we should do. If you think we're good with the workarounds, please feel free to resolve this issue :-), I see. Thanks for bringing up this issue. There is not much we can do in Hive side as I know for now. Thanks.]
