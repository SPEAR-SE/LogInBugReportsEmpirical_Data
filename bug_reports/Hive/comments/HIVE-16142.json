ATTACHMENT ID: 12856690 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, pushed to master. Thanks [~ashutoshc] for the review., I believe the same fix needs to apply to the changes that were done in DynamicPartitionPruningOptimization:

{code}
    // for explain purpose
    if (parseContext.getContext().getExplainConfig() != null
        && parseContext.getContext().getExplainConfig().isFormatted()) {
      List<String> outputOperators = new ArrayList<>();
      outputOperators.add(ts.getOperatorId());
      rsOpFinal.getConf().setOutputOperators(outputOperators);
    }
{code}, [~jdere], i am sorry that I do not get it. This is the write path of RS's output operator. And there is another one in Optimizer. We just need to prevent the NPE in the read path, which is in the patch.]
