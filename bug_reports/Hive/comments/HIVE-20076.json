[[~mmccline], [~sershe], could you review this issue? Thanks., What does this do? :)
Is it possible to add a regression test?, Would a ROW__ID print in a .q show the issue?, I have some test data, but I was not sure whether it's allowed to share. So I will find other data set which already is in Hive. It will make the difference more clear. Thanks for feedback, [~sershe]., I guess that it's alllowed to. I will make the patch with the test data set I have., Explanation: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.RecordReaderImpl.nextBatch needs to update rowInBatch value even if it uses the fast path. However, I still need to check whether it makes side effects or not., The second patch includes test data and better fix for RecordReaderImpl.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12930244 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~teddy.choi] the patch didn't apply.

Also, how long does it take to run these tests?  The q tests include multiple queries producing 30K rows each all of which is recored in the .q.out file.  , The order by in the queries make it very hard to tell if the bug is happening or not, because this is about sequential numbering.

{code}
+{"writeid":### Masked writeid ###,"bucketid":536870912,"rowid":513}	jessica garcia	59	3.52	20110926
+{"writeid":### Masked writeid ###,"bucketid":536870912,"rowid":6633}	jessica garcia	59	3.69	20110925
{code}

I think the fix to getRowNumber() is necessary, which is 

{code}
     if (rowInBatch >= batch.size) {
+      baseRow = super.getRowNumber();
+      rowInBatch = 0;
       return super.nextBatch(theirBatch);
     }
{code}

This has a side-effect of reading batch.size again the next time around (if batch.size !=0, then the first batch will be repeated between every fast-path batch).

Ideally, at that point it should reset the batch, if the batch.size is > 0 (the invariant is that it has already been consumed by rowInBatch)., [~teddy.choi]: Added a test to TestVectorizedORCReader to check that the row-numbering is sequential and continuous (with a loop) to replace the qtest version.

And reset the batch within the fast-path batch., +1, | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
