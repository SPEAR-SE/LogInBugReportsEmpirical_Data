[[~janulatha], [~langcaiye] I am not able to reproduce this using a 2.1.1 install I have.  I would be grateful if you can send me a complete test case and confirm the version you are using., [~janulatha]
Below are all the command I used to produce this issue. I've split them into 3 parts with comments.

Please feel free to let me know if I could provide anything else. Many thanks for looking into this issue.
