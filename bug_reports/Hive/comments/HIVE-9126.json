[[~thejas] Patch for 14., +1 
Is this a separate jira because the patch in HIVE-8827 does not apply to 0.14 branch. If it applies, we could use the same jira and update the fix version there.
, As suggested by [~thejas], committed HIVE-8827 to branch 14 instead., Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
