[[~thejas] Could you please comment on this?
, Lets say user A has permission on dir /tmp/, but not on the dir /tmp/dir1 (lets assume only HS2 user has permissions for it). If we allow - "create table .. partitioned by (p  string) .. location '/tmp' " . A select query on that table would then read all files under that dir. That was the intention of checking everything under that dir.

I agree we should handle this case where the given directory does not exist differently. If we go check for parent permissions, I think we should stop doing this check for all files under that, and just resort to checking that particular dir.
, So, If I understand this correctly, for the case where the /tmp/dir does not exist, we should just check the permission on /tmp/ in case it exists?
, That's right.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12706995 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Hi [~thejas] , Can you please comment on the failures. These tests  pass on my local machine. Only testNegativeCliDriver_authorization_uri_import fails but that fails even without the patch on my local machine.
, authorization_uri_import does not fail in other test runs in precommit - http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/ . Maybe  you need  a clean build after removing the patch ?
Can you also please upload the patch to reviewboard ?, Cancelling patch as the patch currently uploaded does not apply to the newer versions of hive. I'll rebase it and upload a new version., Assigning to myself temporarily since I'm not able to upload the updated patch without it., Attaching patch., (reassigning back to Pankit after attaching updated patch), What if a query like load data inpath which the path is a regex:
{code}
LOAD DATA INPATH '/tmp/data/*.txt' INTO TABLE foo;
{code}

'/tmp/data/*.txt' does not exists, but maybe we should check /tmp/data/ recursive., [~niklaus.xiao], the problem is we don't know what else may exist under /tmp/data besides *.txt, so recursive check doesn't make much sense. In such case, I think we should list all the files and check them one by one., [~niklaus.xiao] That's an interesting case I hadn't thought about. Do regex work with LOAD DATA ? 
As [~lirui] mentioned, we should expand the regex for this as first step and then check on the regex match for existence and/or permission.
, Regex works with LOAD DATA.

Expand the regex and check on the regex match might be a good solution.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12818052 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~sushanth], could you please verify if the patch works with the case [~niklaus.xiao] mentioned? Thanks., Yup, those are valid concerns, I'm trying to test them out., Attached update to address regex concerns., Regarding 4.patch -

The handling of regexes is not right. It is effectively doing a *union* of permissions of the files that match the regex. So its possible that there are files on which the user doesn't have permissions.

Also, to verify that the parent dir contents are not being checked, can you add a file for which the user won't have permissions in parent dir ?
ql/src/test/queries/clientnegative/authorization_uri_import.q has example .
, Fixed union vs intersection issue. Uploading patch without updated testcases, in case the ptest framework picks up the prior patch to run against in the meanwhile, and so that it can be reviewed again.

I'll try to add in a couple of negative test cases as well to illustrate the following two cases:

a) When a parent dir does not have privileges.
b) When one of the files matched by the regex do not have privileges., +1, Updated patch with additional test, and with some optimizations., +1, One minor update to slf4j usage style (did not cause an error, but this is more correct),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12819683 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, From the above test failures, there are 3 relevant failures:

 * org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestNegativeCliDriver.testNegativeCliDriver_authorization_disallow_transform
 * org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestNegativeCliDriver.testNegativeCliDriver_authorization_uri_insert
 * org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestNegativeCliDriver.testNegativeCliDriver_authorization_uri_insert_local

Of these, the first one, that of authorization_disallow_transform.q, is a good failure to have had, since it also demonstrates the base bug - the .q.out previously generated had a URI disallow error because it kept looked for a blank parent, and then recursed down that, rather than failing because transforms were disallowed. Thus, the fix for the first one is to regenerate the .q.out file.

The remaining two issues are valid bugs in our current patch, where the parent-determination logic is incorrect in our current impl. The way we do this now is by looking for the filestatus of a dir, or a filestatus of the first parent that exists. Then, we compare that against the provided dir, and decide that if they're not identical, then we must be in the parent case. This is faulty logic, and we shouldn't be doing string compares if possible, especially since we already have FileUtils.getFileStatusOrNull that solves the same issue. I've cleaned up that logic to do a better job of determining if we're going down the parent case. The new logic is as follows:

 * get the fileStatus corresponding to this path from FileUtils.getFileStatusOrNull
 * If we got back null, then this does not exist, and thus, we're going down the parent-picking line. Otherwise, we can use it as-is.
 * Also, since our parent-picking utility function is via FileUtils.getPathOrParentThatExists , passing the direct filePath to it directly is a bit of a waste since we've already determined that it does not exist. So, I added in one tiny bit of optimization to prevent double-calling the first time, by calling FileUtils.getPathOrParentThatExists(fs, filePath.getParent()) rather than FileUtils.getPathOrParentThatExists(fs, filePath) , both of which will return an identical result in this case.

See https://gist.github.com/khorgath/9eeec30b0035dfdc70ae24dab2dd9923 for a diff between the two patch states (b/w .7.patch and .8.patch), Latest .8.patch attached, +1 changes look good. 
There seems to be some spaces missing at couple of places, after "," in some places, before "==" in (fileStatus== null) . Can you please take care of that before commit ?

, Updated .9.patch, Difference between .8.patch and .9.patch is over at : https://gist.github.com/khorgath/52530044d4e046dca2f27acaf9def443,
