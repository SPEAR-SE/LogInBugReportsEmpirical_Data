[[~mohit.sharmamca09] I don't understand, you're talking about a bug in Impala thrift API?
As you said in github :
bq. It does not depend on the HiveServer2.
Why are you creating a bug bug in HIVE JIRA?

Plus, it seems that your bug is more like "using HiveQL syntax in Impala" than a bug in HIVE itself.]
