[Hi [~dlade]

There is no option to add a partition column to an existing table because the table might have data that is already partitioned, and altering an existing table would require to re-partition the data, and create/move files between partition directories.

One way you can do it is by using dynamic partitions. Just create a table with the partition scheme, then insert data to the partitioned table from the table with no partitions. It will take a while because it is reading/writing data from one table to another (not moving), but it is a way if you need to partition your table.

Here's an example:
{noformat}
CREATE TABLE no_partitions (key string, value string);
.... // here you load data to your no_partitions table

-- This will add all rows with 'val_1' to a partition
CREATE TABLE with_partitions (key string) PARTITIONED BY (value string);
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE with_partitions PARTITION (value = 'val_1') SELECT key FROM no_partitions WHERE value like 'val_1';

-- Here you can add multiple partitions at once
FROM no_partitions
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE with_partitions PARTITION (value = 'val_1') SELECT key WHERE value like 'val_1'
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE with_partitions PARTITION (value = 'val_2') SELECT key WHERE value like 'val_2';
{noformat},

ATTACHMENT ID: 12695368 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I see our argumentation. In my case the table was created with:
{code}
CREATE TABLE xxx LIKE yyy;
{code}
The idea was to clone a table and add a partition then based on a given column. 

Maybe I should add a feature wish, to add partitioning at the "CREATE TABLE LIKE" query.

Thx for removing the NPE.
, Yea to reply to the first question, the table has to be declared as partitioned before you can add partitions to it.

As for the patch, i just had a question, does it throw an exception now or what is the behavior?  Thanks., hi [~szehon]

This patch only handles the NPE. 
However, a better message is thrown later in the code when a null value is detected. This is already implemented and works well., +1, sorry for the late response, Committed to trunk, thanks Sergio!, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
