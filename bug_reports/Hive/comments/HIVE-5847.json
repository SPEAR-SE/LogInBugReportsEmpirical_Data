[patch v1:

- getColumns(): column_size, decimal_digits, num_prec_radix should use the proper type info for char/varchar/decimal
- getColumns(): column_size set to 29 for timestamp, to match JDBC ResultSetMetadata
- getColumns() and ResultSetMetadata should return same scale for timestamp (9).
- Changed radix to 10 for all numeric types; was previously set to 2 for float/double, https://reviews.apache.org/r/15666/,
