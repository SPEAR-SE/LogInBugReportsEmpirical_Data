[Patch forthcoming., [~prasadm] Can you take a look?
Also, it seems version # on 0.13 branch is wrong for mysql script, so I guess we need to patch 0.13 for mysql as well. See, 1-line diff in  metastore/scripts/upgrade/mysql/hive-schema-0.13.0.mysql.sql
Once you confirm, I can generate patch for 0.13 branch for that., https://reviews.apache.org/r/18818/, +1

[~ashutoshc] added the same comment when looking at the review. Didn't realize you had already called it. 
yes, the mysql script change should be backported to 0.13 release. Are you planning to create a new jira or use the same one ?
[~rhbutani] requesting approval for backporting the 0.13 specific change.

Also I see the schema script for transaction support feature is executed after the version is inserted into version table. Ideally marking the schema version should be the last step in the script. Otherwise we might have an inconsistent metastore with valid version information. That could be a problem in troubleshooting.

I will create a new ticket to track that., +1 for 0.13
nice catch, will add this to Release management steps., [~prasadm] including branch 13 fix in this jira only. Will commit both patches once tests comes back. 
Thanks, Harish for taking a look., [~prasadm] I filed HIVE-6559 for the issue you brought up., Same patch. Reupload for Hive QA to pick up.,
