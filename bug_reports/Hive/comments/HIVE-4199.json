[sxyuan requested code review of "HIVE-4199 [jira] ORC writer doesn't handle non-UTF8 encoded Text properly".

Reviewers: kevinwilfong

StringTreeWriter currently converts fields stored as Text objects into Strings. This can lose information (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replacement_character#Replacement_character), and is also unnecessary since the dictionary stores Text objects.

Instead, we can check whether Text or String is preferred and simply use the preferred class, converting only to String for the index stats.

TEST PLAN
  Run unit tests, including new query. The join in the test query originally produces no results because of the bug.

  Phabricator is converting the non-UTF8 data file to UTF8, defeating the purpose of the test. Trying a raw diff.

  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/orc/StringRedBlackTree.java:44 Let's just remove the current add method and move exclusively to Text for the StringRedBlackTree. I should have known better than using String internally.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/orc/WriterImpl.java:717 We're going to have the same problem here with the statistics. If we need to support non-utf8, we need to update the statistics to use Text also.

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/orc/StringRedBlackTree.java:44 The reason why I kept the add(String) method is that it can avoid doing two copies when the original data is actually a String. If the dictionary only takes Text objects, the writer will have to convert the String to a new Text object, and then set(Text) will copy the bytes over to the dictionary's internal Text object.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/orc/WriterImpl.java:717 I've looked into adding statistics for non-UTF8 strings, but I discovered that the stats are serialized to Protobuf objects which require strings to be UTF8 encoded. Do you have any suggestions?
