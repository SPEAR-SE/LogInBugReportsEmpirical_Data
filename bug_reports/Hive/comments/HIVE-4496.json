[Attached trunk patch., Phabricator ticket: https://reviews.facebook.net/D10647, Ported the HIVE-3384 patch to the HS2 JDBC code., I can confirm that applying this patch makes the jdbc part of the build work., I think the code base has changed such that applying this patch doesn't compiler any more. There is a javadoc warning failing the build. The patch might need an update. Thanks.

BUILD FAILED
/home/xzhang/apache/hive-nochange/build.xml:520: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/home/xzhang/apache/hive-nochange/hcatalog/build.xml:246: Javadoc comments contain warnings.
, [~xuefuz] I don't think the problem is with the patch.

RevisionManagerFactory.java:81 generates the javadoc warning.
This file is not part of this patch, it was imported as part of HIVE-4264.

BTW, I just finished patching trunk and running ant tar, which completed successfully., [~cdrome] I guess it's right: the warning has nothing to do with your patch. I did "ant tar", but it also stopped due to the warning. Not sure why.

Anyway, is there a plan to check this patch in?
, It's not applied to trunk cleanly. Could you update this?, Rebased trunk patch., Restored the SQLException signature to include the original Exception in openSession., [~navis]: Please try the latest patch. Thanks for your help on this patch., I think some methods can be implemented but would be better to do in following issue. Committed to trunk. Thanks Chris!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #257 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/257/])

{noformat}, Right, I'm looking at the vectorization branch. Will post a patch to merge trunk into the branch. Thanks., This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one., If it affects 0.11 (compilation for jdk 7), are there any plans/possibilities to port it back to 0.11? It seems 0.11 doesn't compile under jdk7 now.]
