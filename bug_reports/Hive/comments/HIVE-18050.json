, This method is called for multiple sources; the other one is a config value which I think is still comma-separated... perhaps the character should be an argument to the call., That's right, should call addAuxJarsToSet with different delimiters., +1, Committed to master as a diff because the pull request is against a mirror of the main Apache git repo.
