[I had a similar issue using

    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE [mySchema].[myTable] PARTITION([myPartition]) SELECT ...

It works the first time, and then fails the second time, presumably because in the latter case it has to alter the existing partition.

But as a workaround, do 

    USE [mySchema]; 

before the overwrite, and then it works.

It is similar to the fact that you can't do 

    ALTER TABLE [mySchema].[myTable] ...

but instead must do

    USE [mySchema]; ALTER TABLE [myTable] ..., I can't run USE [mySchema]; ALTER TABLE [myTable] ... 
with Hive JDBC so there is no way of doing alter tables on tables within databases.]
