ATTACHMENT ID: 12746227 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch committed to master, branch-1. Thanks to [~mmccline] for the review!, [~hsubramaniyan]
Is this getting back ported?, Yes, will be a good candidate for backporting to 1.2.1. [~sushanth] what do you think.

Thanks
Hari, Incorrect results makes it a good candidate for a backport to branch-1.2.

Pedantic note : 1.2.1 has already shipped. This would go in 1.2.2, please set fix version appropriately after committing., [~hsubramaniyan] Has this been committed to branch-1.2 ? If yes, we need to update the fix version.
, [~thejas] Thanks for the reminder. Just committed the change to branch-1.2 and updated the fix version.]
