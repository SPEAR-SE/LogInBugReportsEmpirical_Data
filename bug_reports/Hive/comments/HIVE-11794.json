[here's the patch. Change itself is small; I expanded the vectorized reduce test.
The vectorized reduce changes order of the rows in the result so I added order by and removed limit... other than that if reduce vectorization is disabled in tez tests, results don't change, only explain plan, [~mmccline] can you take a look?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12756107 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~mmccline] can you take a look? It adds special handling for "complete" GBY which basically just reuses unordered-streaming. Technically, the streaming is ordered but it doesn't matter. It seems to work for existing test cases and some more cases., +1, Committed to master.]
