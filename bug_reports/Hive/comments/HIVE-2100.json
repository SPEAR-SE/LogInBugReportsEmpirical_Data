[This patch contains the fix for the issue as well as the tests for it.

The problem was that the object inspector was initialized and added to the opCtxMap before the check was done for which table this operation belongs to.

For the object with virtual columns, fixing up the inspector for virtual columns happens after this check. So we were left with an inspector in the ctxMap that didn't account for the virtual columns and errored out during the initialization.

With this change, the extra inspector wouldn't get unnecessarily created., will take a look., running tests, and also put this into PA queue,

Summary
-------

Instead of excluding the operator from the opCtxMap entirely, I added an additional check to the operator initialization to make sure that at least one file path for the operator was valid before initialization.

Changes
-------

since database.q failed in the testcase suite, I can't see any reason not to just call setInspectorInput() on every input that gets added to the OpCtxMap which solves both this and the original problem.
