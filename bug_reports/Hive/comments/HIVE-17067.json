ATTACHMENT ID: 12876380 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1. Looks good. Does anything specific need to be looked at in terms of security?, Some configs already throw Permission Denied for non-root users. This exposes what non-root user can read via sysctl -a although no check 
for root access is done. Also we don't support POST/update to configs via endpoint. [~gopalv] any thoughts for security here?
, I don't have a specific security concern for the information in sysctl (maybe kernel version).

My concern is the fork + exec operation that happens here (with YARN memory monitoring) - each web hit to the end point triggering a fork + exec, is somewhat of a noisy operation.

Most of this does not change every second (unlike say SNMP counters)., I will cache the results from sysctl and add an option to force read (refresh) in case if required., Avoided running sysctl on every invocation. Requires /system?refresh=true to re-run sysctl command. Minor fixes for Mac sysctl output. ,
