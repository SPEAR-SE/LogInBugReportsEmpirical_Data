[[~jasperknulst] If I understand this request right, you are proposing that we represent columns which do not have values as empty jsons? Personally I think that is ok but wouldn't that make it harder to differentiate between columns which do not have any values vs those which have actual empty values? For instance, today you can run a IS NULL query and quickly figure out the columns which do not have any values. Wouldn't figuring things like this become harder with the pattern that you are proposing?, A concern that I have is that currently in order to perform an update in a hive table, one uses NULLs as place holders.  Those NULLs are ignored if it is a preexisting record.

CREATE TABLE hbase_table_emp(id int, name string, role string)
STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("hbase.columns.mapping" = ":key,cf1:name,cf1:role")
TBLPROPERTIES ("hbase.table.name" = "emp");
insert into hbase_table_emp select 1,'bob', 'admin';
insert into hbase_table_emp select 2,'bobby', 'user';
select * from  hbase_table_emp;
insert into hbase_table_emp select 1,null, 'superadmin';

See "bob" remains as "bob"...
