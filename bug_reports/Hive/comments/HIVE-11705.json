ATTACHMENT ID: 12753440 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Add an alternative method that can be used by metastore via standard API. Basically encode column info into SARG to separate  Hive crap from ORC crap

[~prasanth_j] can you review new methods and tell me is there's any problem you see with the approach. 

I also added bunch of comments everywhere, Left minor comments on RB. 

Otherwise +1(NB),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12754759 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sershe] I am assuming this is a patch for trunk, if so can you please remove the unused methods and put them under a separate jira in hbase-metastore branch. Apart from the unused future methods, the patch looks good to me +1., removed the methods from this patch,
