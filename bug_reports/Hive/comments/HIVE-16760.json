IMO, you don't have to create a jira to track updates to errata.txt for a missing jira number.
(It doesn't hurt, but not really needed), Oh OK, first time doing this ;) I was referring to an example here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11876, [~thejas], shouldn't all changes to the code be tracked in JIRA?  I agree that updating errata.txt is a minor change and doesn't need any review, but I'm uneasy about doing it without a JIRA ticket.

Since I tend to catch many of these errors, I'd like to give good advice on how to do the updates.

Should we have a discussion on the dev@hive mailing list?  Or else we could open a JIRA ticket to document errata.txt in the wiki and we could have the discussion in the comments., Yes, it makes sense to track all code changes via jira.
My point was, in this case, comment in the original jira is sufficient for any errata.txt updates related to it. Opening a new jira to just update it seems unnecessary overhead.
So errata.txt change be committed with a comment like "Update errata.txt for HIVE-16743".

Yes, updating document errata.txt process after discussion in a JIRA sounds like a good idea. (Yes, I don't think we need to have a DISCUSSION/VOTE thread for this one)
, bq.  comment in the original jira is sufficient for any errata.txt updates

Ah, good point.

Okay, I've opened HIVE-16822 to document errata.txt.  Thanks [~thejas].
