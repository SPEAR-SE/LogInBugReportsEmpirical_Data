[Uploaded patch [^HIVE-11228.1.patch] that creates semi-shared locks on tables that are being written to. This has required a small change to the API which I'm hoping is ok as it's not released. I can make this a backward-compatible change if required but my thinking is that no one is using this at this time.,
