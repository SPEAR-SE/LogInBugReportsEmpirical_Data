[JsonSerDe seems to only support map values of type string. Attaching patch and test cases.
[~sushanth], can you take a look? There do not seem to many tests for JsonSerDe and I want to make sure I'm not breaking any behavior here., Looks like the same problem reported in HCATALOG-630, Thanks for the report, Jason. Sure, I can look further into this. I had looked at HCATALOG-630 a long time back but I seem to remember that I could not reproduce that at the time. If we have a more recent reproduction, it definitely is worth investigating.

Tests for JsonSerDe are mostly in TestJsonSerDe, instead of in .q files, since it descends from HCatalog - that seems to test map<short,string> and map<string,struct<i:int>> as the basic cases, which work.

I'll try to reproduce and dig further.,
