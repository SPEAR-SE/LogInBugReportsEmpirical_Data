[i guess it's like HIVE-14804.
hi [~cartershanklin] , do you try the latest master version?, Correct syntax to insert from a subquery is

{code}
insert into remote select * from hivetable;
{code}

VALUES clause is only used to insert specified column values., Currently INSERT AS SELECT works within a single database as atom statement, so it is not separate select from one database and insert into another. To get the required functionality use COPY statement. http://hplsql.org/copy

{code}
copy (select * from hivetable) to remote at mydbconn;
{code}, By the way, there is no NPE anymore on 3.0.0 master. ]
