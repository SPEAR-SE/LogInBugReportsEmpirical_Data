[Here is the new message: java.io.IOException: History file for application application_1399496111138_0011 is not found. 

Attach patch to change the message captured., [~daijy] I think it would be good to capture the 'is not found' part as well to return a 400 error. Ie check for 'History file .* is not found.'

, Attach new patch., +1, Patch committed to both master and branch-1. Thanks Thejas for review!]
