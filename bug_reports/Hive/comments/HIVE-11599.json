[+1 to intent, this would be most useful., [~ekoifman] Would writing the hiveconfig to logs on metastore startup meet the needs ?
, That would be a good start but maybe not enough.  Most of the time logs are rolled and archived and what you get from customers is logs from "today", not when Metastore was launched.  So having this "on-demand" is better., I agree with [~ekoifman]  logging at startup is bare minimum we can do, but really useful will be to have a command like {{bin/hive --metastore --printConf}} to print configuration of running metastore on console., HIVE-14038 made some progress in this direction]
