[Currently, there are many cvs processor external libraries like superCVS, Apache Commons CSV and etc. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSV_application_support). And there are several kinds of formats for CSV including DEFAULT, EXCEL, MYSQL, RFC4180 and TDF(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). And RFC is mostly acceptable format. So I am trying to use SuperCSV to utilize the previous outputformater., review board entry created in https://reviews.apache.org/r/23722/, fix this bug by using super CSV which is an external csv library under Apache License 2,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12656828, This one seems to be a dupe of HIVE-7390., [~xuefuz] Yes, that's a duplicated issue for HIVE-7390. Incidentally my patch is using the RFC mode and let the superCSV to handle the escaping matters. For some failed test cases,, For some failed test cases, reattach patch with the changed test cases.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12657040, I left some minor comments on the RB, though its in discarded state?

This patch looks reasonable to me at high level, [~xuefuz] do you have any opinion?  I was thinking if we need to add a flag to control the behavior for backward compatibility, though I'd try to avoid it as there's already quite enough flags as is.
, [~szehon] Thanks for your comments, Considering the backward compatibility, I add one option for the enclose mode and patch is available in HIVE-7390. Also I am working on the HIVE-7390 since it is open before this JIRA., Thanks, let's close this JIRA as duplicate and I'll look on that one then, otherwise this looks like its open for review :)]
