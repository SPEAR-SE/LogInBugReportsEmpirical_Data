[Simplify the query and generate the following SemanticException :
hive (default)> select CAST(`d` AS STRING) from dual limit 1;
FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10004]: Line 1:12 Invalid table alias or column reference '`d`': (possible column names are: dummy)

I don't think this's a BUG.We'd better follow the Grammar rules., Sorry for the late reply, but what you tried has nothing to do with my issues. My columns do exist. See the 'working script'. For some reason, if there's a cast, then it fails., I cannot sure of what it was, but it seemed fixed in trunk. Anyone may reopen this issue when it happens again., This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one., I guess its the same issue that is addressed by HIVE-4547, FYI, I upgraded to Hive 0.12, and it is indeed fixed, at least for my use case.]
