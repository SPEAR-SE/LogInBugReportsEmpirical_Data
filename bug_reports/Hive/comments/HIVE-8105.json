[Changes to SemanticAnalyzer to handle boolean and nulls properly, and changes to tests to confirm the fix., why do both NULL and FALSE unparse to the same thing... How would the parser know to whether it should produce NULL or FALSE?, insert into table T values ... works by first writing the values to a file, casting a temp table over that file, and then rewriting the query to insert into table T select * from temp_table.  As all of the values coming in are strings, the default Hive casting mechanisms kick in.  The Hive rule for casting from boolean to string is that any string that has length > 0 is true, while a zero length string is false.  (See UDFToBoolean.evaluate(Text)).

The ideal solution here is we need an input format that can handle these sorts of things as well as simple expressions.  For example, in the current implementation we cannot handle casts or arithmetic like insert into T values (3 + 4);  So yes, this is a stop gap.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12668812, Forgot to regenerate results for tez qfile test., New patch with new tez qfile expected results., I'm wondering if it's not better to disallow NULL until we create the input format as you suggest.  As it is, this works for numeric types, but for boolean/string types this will take NULL from user input and insert an FALSE/empty string.  This doesn't seem right.
Is it possible to check the target type and throw if it's not numeric?, I thought it was just boolean that wouldn't handle null properly here.  But you're right, string doesn't either.  So I agree we should disable the null handling for now.  I'll rework this patch to just fix the true/false issue and file a separate JIRA to fix the null issue later., I think Timestamp (and perhaps Date) may be an issue as well, Turns out the right thing to do for null in text format is \N, not "" (thanks to [~owen.omalley] for pointing this out).

A new patch that properly encodes the nulls., It would be useful to add some comments in unparseExprForValuesClause() about NULL and FALSE handling.  I don't think it would be clear why this works.
Otherwise
+1 pending tests
