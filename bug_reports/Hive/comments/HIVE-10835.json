[[~xuefuz], [~szehon] & [~thejas], could you review the patch to see if it make sense. Thanks, Patch has been posted to RB https://reviews.apache.org/r/34727/ requesting for a review., Thanks for looking into this issue [~ctang.ma]!
There were some locks added as part of HIVE-6472 by [~vgumashta]. Looks like covered only some specific use cases.
I feel we are likely to miss this when we add new code.
How about taking an alternative approach of using a proxy class around the thrift client that does the locking ? That would be a smaller change and new code is less likely to have this bug. Something like SynchronizedHandler in HiveMetastoreClient class (though that does not seem to be used anywhere!)


, Thanks [~thejas] for comments. I will look into what you suggested., Thanks [~ctang.ma]. If you go down that path, can you also please look into removing the locks added in HIVE-6472, as they would no longer be needed.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12735658 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Wrap the client in a thread-safe proxy to serialize all its RPC call. [~thejas] Could you review it? Thanks., Wrap CLIService client in a proxy to serialize all it RPC calls. [~thejas], could you review it? Thanks, Updated the patch:
1. Add a unit test TestJdbcWithMiniHS2#testConcurrentStatements (300 tasks using 100 threads, take around 1.5 -2 min in my local machine)
2. use the client object itself as the lock

ATTACHMENT ID: 12735879 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Note that races also potentially exist during execution surrounding SessionState, as per recent comments in HIVE-4239, Thanks [~sershe] for the information and noticed that you are already working on HIVE-4239. 
This JIRA mainly addresses the concurrency issue at client site (JDBC driver) while HIVE-4239 may focus on server site as I understand, so I think they could be considered as separate issues.  We are working together to address the races in the system but from different areas. Could you take a look at the patch and comment, thanks., I think resolving this JIRA might be helpful since it can be used as one of test cases to HIVE-4239.  [~thejas], [~xuefuz], [~szehon] and [~sershe], could you review the patch? Thanks, [~ctang.ma] Thanks for the patch. I'm reviewing it right now., [~ctang.ma] Patch looks good. Minor comments on rb., [~vgumashta] Thanks for the review and I updated the new patch here and rb., +1,
