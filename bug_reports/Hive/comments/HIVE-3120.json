[Why do you need to go through a patch/git/svn for this ?
Cant you copy the local checkout into the shared destination, and then proceed ?
I was running into a problem with patch -p0 ...., https://reviews.facebook.net/D3585

I test it and it could start the test. I didn't wait for it to finish though, Can you create a new arc diff entry ?, and remember to do 'submit patch' when you submit a arc entry ready for review
