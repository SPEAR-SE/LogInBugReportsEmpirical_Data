ATTACHMENT ID: 12627529, Mithun, is the stack trace you posted above correct? 
From bug description I would have expected NPE from LazyBinaryColSerde on read side, but stack trace suggests some exception while writing data and that too from LazySimpleSerde. 
Also, looking at code in LazyBinaryMapOI, it doesn't look like that key is dereferenced in a manner which can throw NPE. So, not sure how your null catching of key will fix problem you described.
I think I am struggling to understand both problem as well as fix. If you can add the testcase in your patch, that will help a lot., Hey, Ashutosh. As a matter of fact, this stack trace is the result of running "select mymap[ 'xyz' ] from mytable", if mytable has null values for mymap. Although the bug is in the LazyBinaryObjectInspector for Maps, it doesn't manifest at the time of read.
The reason you're seeing a fail in LazySimpleSerde is because the results of the query are being serialized into String (i.e. to console).

The LazyBinaryMapOI returns -1 for NULL maps. WHen the LazySimpleSerde attempts to convert this Integer into Text, we get this bad-cast exception. The OI should have been returning nulls for null objects, like the ColumnarSerDe does.

The way I tested this is:
1. create table mytable_text( mymap map<string, string> ) stored as textfile;
2. echo "\N\n\N\n\N" > /tmp/mytable.txt && hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal /tmp/mytable.txt /user/hive/warehouse/mytable_text
3. create table mytable_rcfile( mymap map<string, string> ) stored as rcfile; -- LazyBinaryColumnarSerDe
4. insert overwrite table mytable_rcfile select mymap from mytable_text;
5. select mymap['blah'] from mytable_rcfile;

Steps 1-4 is simply to insert a null-map into an RCFile-based table.
Step 5 causes the null-map to be returned by LazyBinaryMapOI as '-1', etc.

This patch brings LazyBinaryMapOI's behaviour in line with LazyMapOI. (This is likely just a copy-paste error, from getMapSize().

, I see.  Thanks for explanation. Makes sense now.
Problem is map itself is null, I thought you are dealing with a case of null-key in a map and fixing it by if ( .. || key == null) check. Although key == null check is not required, because null will be correctly returned in that case (also evident in LazyMapOI). Fix is to return null instead of -1 for data == null case. Anyhow, fix looks good. 
+1 can you re-upload the patch to get Hive QA to re-run., Pulling patch. Will capitalize and resubmit., Renamed.,
