ATTACHMENT ID: 12749200 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed. Thanks [~prongs], Doc note:  This removes *hive.hadoop.supports.splittable.combineinputformat* from HiveConf.java, so the wikidoc needs a bullet "Removed In: 2.0.0 with HIVE-11376" for the parameter.

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.hadoop.supports.splittable.combineinputformat | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.hadoop.supports.splittable.combineinputformat], Seems : hive.hadoop.supports.splittable.combineinputformat has not been marked as removed in Hive 2.0.0 configuration properties: [Configuration Properties â€“ hive.hadoop.supports.splittable.combineinputformat|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.hadoop.supports.splittable.combineinputformat], Thanks for the nudge, [~njonkers].  I updated the doc, so now I'll remove the TODOC2.0 label.]
