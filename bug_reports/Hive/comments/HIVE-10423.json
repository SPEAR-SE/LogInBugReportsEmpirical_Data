[@Eugene please review the patch that includes small fix to prevent the issue with rerun, [~asreekumar], did someone commit this patch?, No, it is not committed yet., I think i marked it resolved mistakenly, is there a reason the downloaded artifacts need to be under the source tree?
Could they be placed in testdist/?, testdist is getting created only during test run, so i think we need the new directory for test setup., +1, committed to master
thanks [~asreekumar] for the contribution]
