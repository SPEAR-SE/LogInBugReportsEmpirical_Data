[+1, Thank you [~navis] for reviewing the patch. I realized that each branch needs a different patch, so that I uploaded separate patch files.

Thanks & Regards,
Na, Thanks for taking care of this. Just for my understanding, why the conf object would be null in this case? Does the problem happens all the time or just for a special case? Thanks., Hi [~xuefuz], this NullPointerException does not happen all the time. It happens when there are some other issues which cause the start HiveServer2 fails, then in the startHiveServer2 API, it will try starting HiveServer2 again. Before the second try, it calls server.stop() to stop the current HiveServer2 instance. The NullPointerException happens in the server.stop() call. 

In my case, the Derby db lock causes the failure of starting HiveServer2, then this NullPointerException happens. This NullPointerException is misleading and covered the real cause of the HiveServer2 start failure. 

Thanks,
Na, Thanks for the clarification, [~nyang]., Renamed patch to trigger the test run.,
