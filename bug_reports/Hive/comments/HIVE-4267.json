[HIVE-4267.1.patch is based on HIVE-4269, and that needs to be applied first.
, reviewboard link - https://reviews.apache.org/r/10212/, This looks a bit odd to me. java.sql.Timestamp which is meant to be jdbc compliant preserves '.0' in toString() If it indeed is compliant than it seems like jdbc driver is currently doing the right thing and cli (TimestampWritable.toString()) is the one which needs to be fixed. It will be good to check if standard says something about resultset.getNext().toString() method when resultset.getNext() is timestamp. If not, than may be a quick test against mysql/postgres jdbc driver will be good to verify., The jdbc spec doesn't clearly say what representation should be returned by getString() on a timestamp column. But I think what is more natural/less-surprising is to have the value of java.sql.Timestamp.toString() being returned. 

Hive cli code has extra logic to remove the trailing ".0". There might have been some motivations behind that. 
I think it is OK to have this difference in behavior with cli.
Marking as 'Won't Fix' .
