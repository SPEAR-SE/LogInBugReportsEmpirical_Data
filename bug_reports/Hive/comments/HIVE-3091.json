[I have 2 approached to handle this problem.

1. Maitain differnt eclipse template for different version of hadoop.

2. Make current eclipse template as generic such a way that all the tokens in the template is replaced with value.

I suggest for first approach because different hadoop version require differnt version of dependent jar.
For example hadooop-0.20 require common-codec-1.3.jar where hadoop-0.23.0 require common-codec-1.4.jar., :(
I do not think we want to version them unless we really have to. 

As it stands now the eclipse templates are already confusing so they can not get much worse. ]
