[I think for hive 13 it'd be safer to just do what MR does and set the perms to 777 on the root folder. We should open a ticket for the next release though to do the proper fix (since it involves changing config vars we might have to keep 2 ways for a release or so). Thoughts?, Address Gunther's comments. Going with the simpler approach.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12638827, Fix the case where a tez session is launched without a query., +1 to the update as well.
, Needed rebase after HIVE-6739., This adds *hive.localize.resource.wait.interval* and *hive.localize.resource.num.wait.attempts* to HiveConf.java.

They need descriptions in hive-default.xml.template or in a release note (since hive-default.xml.template will be generated from the new HiveConf.java after HIVE-6037 gets committed). When the time comes, I'll add them to the post-HIVE-6037 list (in HIVE-6586) and put them in the Configuration Properties wikidoc., Address Lefty's comment.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12639155, Committed to both trunk and branch-0.13, *hive.localize.resource.wait.interval* & *hive.localize.resource.num.wait.attempts* are documented in the wiki here:

* [Configuration Properties -- Tez -- hive.localize.resource.wait.interval | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.localize.resource.wait.interval]
* [Configuration Properties -- Tez -- hive.localize.resource.num.wait.attempts | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.localize.resource.num.wait.attempts]

I also added a comment to HIVE-6586 so they won't get lost in the shuffle when HIVE-6037 changes HiveConf.java., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
