[[~kgyrtkirk] can you add details please?, [~ekoifman] sure, I'm sorry for making it brief..broken testpairs are happening again and again with different tests...

so the problem is:

* running these two tests separately: both passes
* running them together: the second fails

see here: https://travis-ci.org/kgyrtkirk/hive/builds/341375171#L598

it usually turns out that the first tests alters the system's global state somehow but it can be that a cache lookup is done on an underconstraint key...

, this isn't happening anymore :)]
