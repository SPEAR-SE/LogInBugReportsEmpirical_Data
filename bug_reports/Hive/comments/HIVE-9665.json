There are two issues that we need to fix before MoveTask can be used in parallel.
 # A thread local Hive object should be used. Adding a "db = Hive.get(conf);" in MoveTask.execute will fix that
 # SessionState is examined by acid code in MoveTask, if it is in a different thread that thread will not have the SessionState object available. ,
