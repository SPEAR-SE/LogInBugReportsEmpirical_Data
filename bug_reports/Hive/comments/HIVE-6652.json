{code}, It also doesn't make sense to me, that its treating all un-recognized argument as db-property file and connecting one after another.  Looks like a good usability change to me, if not being used now.

One minor thought, as the property file does seem useful, we can consider supporting property file with another -propertyfile argument if needed,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12634505, The above test failure is unrelated. The patch is ready for review., RB: https://reviews.apache.org/r/19251/, +1, Committted to trunk. Thanks, Xuefu!, {quote}
this is a residual from SQLLine from which Beeline is derived, which allows user to specify a property file based on which SQLLine can make a DB connection.  . . .  I'd suggest we disable this option. If it's desirable to have this option, then we need at least corresponding documentation plus better error message.

Should the wiki mention this change from SQLLine behavior (with a version 0.14 note)?

* [Beeline – New Command Line Shell |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Beeline–NewCommandLineShell], I don't think we need to document this, as it's never documented or officially supported. , This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
