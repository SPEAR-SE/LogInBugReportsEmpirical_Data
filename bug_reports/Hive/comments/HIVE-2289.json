[The column names in your step 3 need to be backticked, not quoted. Look at https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive/index_auto.q for an example query that runs properly., Closing as invalid for reason Syed mentioned.  Also, try out the new automatic index usage support if you get a chance!, @Syed and John, Thanks for helping, it is resolved now. Can you guys point me to a link, with documentation related to hive indexing? I want to understand, on how the index works, as now the query without index takes around 12 seconds, and with index takes 11 seconds. I want to try out with various possibilities to speed up the response time. Like, I want to check, how is the performance if index is made on a table created with clustered command using buckets.. Do you guys recommend a good documentation for indexing in hive?

Thanks,
Siddharth, @Siddarth:  the only doc available is here:

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/IndexDev

It hasn't been updated since the initial work, so it doesn't include the topics you're after.  For that, you're best off digging into the code plus related JIRA issues.
, Thanks John for your really quick replies. I Just have one final question - from the Hive page, I understand that, there are a lot of overheads while running the queries and in turn these affect the performance (response time of queries), Can we configure hive to an extent that, the response time for a query is less than say 5 seconds for querying over a million rows (just to give examples, I am giving these numbers) I understand that this question is too subjective (depends on the cluster, the configuration of machines used etc) but I am quite confused about the performance of hive over huge data..

Thanks,
Siddharth, (This JIRA issue is not the right place for these discussions; mailing list user@hive.apache.org is.)]
