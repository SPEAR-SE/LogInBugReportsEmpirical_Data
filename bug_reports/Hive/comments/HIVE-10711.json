ATTACHMENT ID: 12732965 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Jason, do you think it's better to add new tez configuration parameter for 0.5?
{code}
noConditionalTaskThreshold = (long) (processMaxMemory * 0.5);
{code}, Not sure if I want to add yet another config param, especially for a last-ditch fallback which shouldn't happen if the settings are properly done .. 
We could use HIVEHASHTABLEFOLLOWBYGBYMAXMEMORYUSAGE, which is the more conservative memory usage setting for mapjoins (compared to HIVEHASHTABLEMAXMEMORYUSAGE). Thoughts?, 1. Lets say noConditionalTaskThreshold is 3990MB and processMaxMemory = 4000MB
In this case noConditionalTaskThreshold adjustment will be skipped.

But if we slightly increase noConditionalTaskThreshold to lets say 4010 MB then your code will work and will change noConditionalTaskThreshold to 2000 MB

20 MB change in noConditionalTaskThreshold makes significant change in final value - 3990 MB vs 2000 MB  (which is a big difference)

I think that noConditionalTaskThreshold adjustment should adjust noConditionalTaskThreshold to smth which is close to 3990 MB

This is why I think using HIVEHASHTABLEMAXMEMORYUSAGE=0.9 instead of 0.5 makes sense.

2. To improve the algo even more we can check if noConditionalTaskThreshold is bigger than 90% of processMaxMemory and adjust it
{code}
if (noConditionalTaskThreshold / processMaxMemory > HIVEHASHTABLEMAXMEMORYUSAGE) {
  noConditionalTaskThreshold = processMaxMemory * HIVEHASHTABLEMAXMEMORYUSAGE
}
{code}
What you think?, In your scenario, the user basically has bad settings - the user has told Hive to use more memory than it has available.
Since the point of this fix is to prevent the user from hitting out of memory, I think HIVEHASHTABLEFOLLOWBYGBYMAXMEMORYUSAGE is safer. Ideally this isn't a behavior we want to be relying on for performance. If the user is unhappy with the fact that Hive didn't use enough memory for hash tables, they can check their logs/settings and realize their settings were bad., Ok the goal is to prevent OOM
What is the probability of OOM if noConditionalTaskThreshold = 4000MB and processMaxMemory = 4000MB?
Pretty high.

This is why I think we need to reduce OOM probability if we see that noConditionalTaskThreshold is very close or even more than processMaxMemory.
, That might make sense - anyone else with mapjoin/mem usage want to comment here?, [~sushanth] Would like to include in 1.2 branch, Updated patch based on feedback., 1. should we put the following code inside "if" block where hashtableMemoryUsage is actually used
{code}
+    float hashtableMemoryUsage = HiveConf.getFloatVar(
+        hconf, HiveConf.ConfVars.HIVEHASHTABLEFOLLOWBYGBYMAXMEMORYUSAGE);
{code}
, Addressing feedback comments.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12734743 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures are unrelated., [~apivovarov]
do you have anymore feedback?, +1, [~sushanth] FYI 

[~apivovarov]
Can you please commit the change to 1.2.1?, Mostafa, lets wait 24 hours before commit. Just to clarify. Do you want me to commit it to master and then do hotfix (cherry-pick) from master to branch-1.2?, Yes, please.

, Yes, please.

, Committed to master and branch-1.2. Thank you Jason and Mostafa!]
