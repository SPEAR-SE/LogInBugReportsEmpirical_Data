ATTACHMENT ID: 12753083 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, LGTM, +1. The test failure seems to be unrelated., [~prasanth_j] can this be merged? Or do the tests need to be run again, now that the master has moved?, *ping*, Pushed to master. Thanks, Sudheesh!, Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug.]
