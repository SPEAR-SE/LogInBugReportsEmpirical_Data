[Separate shim classes for 20S an 23. Also fixed some dependency issues (yarn-server-tests etc), Had to add shim for MiniMRCluster as well. Ran tests on 1 line, 2 line and .20. All seem to check out fine., * Was there a reason to add this flag  -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled ?
* Can you briefly spell out the reason for shimming DFS and MiniMR cluster. Specifically, how these two are different in 20S and 23 ?
* There are some println statements which are commented. It will be good to change them to LOG.info
* After HIVE-4148 ivy.xmls are cleaned up, do we still need new deps of this patch?, - Was there a reason to add this flag -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled

When running the unit tests against the hadoop 2 minidfs/minimr stuff, you run out of PermGen space. This setting (as well as the one to increase the PermGen space for junit fixes the issue.

- Shim for DFS: There's a change in MiniDFS that changes the return type to a sub type of one of the public methods (getFilesystem). API compatible, but not binary compatible. By creating the shim, each version will be compiled against the right version of hadoop.

- Shim for MiniMRCluster: There was some really ugly code in QTestUtil, that used exceptions to distinguish between hadoop 1/2 and initialized the MiniMRcluster accordingly. By creating shims for these you can just init that stuff differently for each hadoop version (the apis are the same, but the behavior and configs have changed)

- Yes, these dependencies are needed. The build system won't pick them up otherwise., +1, Patch doesn't apply cleanly anymore. This also will have an overlap with HIVE-4200 I believe. Would you like to get HIVE-4200 in first and then update this patch?, Rebased. No changes from .3 other than resolved conflict in build-common.xml., I think this is ready to go in and can go first., ok. running tests, Committed to trunk.
