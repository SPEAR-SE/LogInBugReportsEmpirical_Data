[What is the purpose of the empty files? Could we simply skip adding anything if the input partition directory is missing? Or alternatively raise an error to the user., The problem is that downstream map-reduce jobs can run into problems.

For eg:

consider the query:


select .... from
(query 1  union all query 2);

It will result in 3 map-reduce jobs: query 1, query 2 and outer query depending on query 1 and query2.

If query2 had empty partitions, and we disallow it.
outer query will fail because the output for query 2 has not been created.

That's why we create a dummy file

The correct fix would be to create a file based on the table descriptor instead of some hard-coded value. Then, the custom input format can be attached to the table descriptor and will work fine.
I am already in the process of implementing that as part of map-join, and will merge it in soon., The fix should be in:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-195
, Namit, is it convenient to split the patch for this one? That map-side join is a big patch but this one seems a really small fix.
, maybe we should get rid of the assumption that the subqueries need to produce output directories?, Seems HIVE-195 didn't fix this issue? I just ran into it again with the latest trunk checkout]
