[Simpler:

tr -d '\r' , Works for me. Thanks Brock, updated patch., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Daniel!, Hi Daniel
It seems that we need to file a separate JIRA to complete this fix. There have been issues when there are other escape sequences as well like '\o' '\n' ..etc. Simplest way would be to convert every occurence of "\" with a space so that build works in atleast most of the cases. In the long run, there should be a python/OS independent version of saveVersion.sh to fix this issue., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2330 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2330/])
