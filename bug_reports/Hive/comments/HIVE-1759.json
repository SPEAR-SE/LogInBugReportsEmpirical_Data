[I committed a fix for the change log links (per Carl's suggestion, just use JIRA release notes alone and omit CHANGES.txt).

I also changed the nav bar trail to be Apache > Hive instead of Apache > Hadoop > Hive, but kept the Hadoop logo.

I'll leave the resolution of the documentation links to Ed since that's still under discussion.  Once we fix that, we can do another push of the site.
, Ed, any update?, The issue was the content of the site MUST be all checked into svn and copied into /www/hive.apache.org, I built and committed the API docs for all older releases. Site should have no broken links 3.0 docs will propagate in the next hour or so.]
