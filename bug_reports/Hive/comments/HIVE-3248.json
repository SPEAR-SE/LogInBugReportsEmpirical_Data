[In above case, hive sets 'hive.check.par' as '1\n\nselect count(1) from src', which is a totally valid command.

HIVE-2848 can help detecting some of these cases but generally, seemed not to be resolved, IMHO., If the parameter hive.check.par in the above example is an integer, HIVE-2848 should catch this.
Isn't that right ?, Yes, so I've noticed it while testing HIVE-2848. But what if the type is string or the key is not registered conf?, I took this issue over. Even thought multi-line sets will rarely be used we probably do not want to remove it just to add it back later. I am suggesting we have SetProcessor warn on multi-line comments.  , * warn on multi-line set statements., {noformat}
