[Patch attached.

1. LoadSemanticAnalyzer adds the table/partition to the outputs

2. QTestUtil.cleanup() used to call setup.tearDown, resulting in the commands run during createSources being run without a zookeeper server instance. So I have moved setup.tearDown to QTestUtil.shutdown().

3. EnforceReadOnlyTables also needs to allow outputs during initialization loads/creates. So a session boolean indicates initialization phase.

4. TestParse.vm and TestParseNegative.vm needed to be fixed too. Setup create a QTestUtil instance each time but tearDown seems to consider qt as a reusable instance. Changed tearDown to shutdown QTestUtil every time.

5. Test results regenerated., 6. Loading a partitioned table without specifying partitions was being validated only if OVERWRITE was specified. This is not right IMO, so fixed this as well., One results file was diffed as binary so patch regenerated with --text, Can you regenerate the patch ?
I was having trouble applying it ?

Also, can you create a review-board request ?, Regenerated the patch., Added to review board: https://reviews.apache.org/r/518/
, For #4 above, I have taken now the same approach as in TestCliDriver/TestNegativeCliDriver, reusing the QTestUtil instance. Needed to clear out inputs/outputs for this to work., Please review asap as there are lots of changes to q.out files and any delay may cause another conflict/resolution cycle., I will take a look right away,    Instead of adding a new configuration parameter which is being checked in
   EnforceReadOnlyTables, it might be easier to remove EnforceReadOnlyTables
   from the hive.exec.pre.hooks at creation time. But, this can be done in a
   follow-up also (if other things look good).

Will commit if tests pass, please file a follow-up jira for the cleanup mentioned
above., Committed. Thanks Krishna]
