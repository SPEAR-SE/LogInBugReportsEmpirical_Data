[[~ashutoshc] Can you review please?, [~wzheng], is there a test to repro the issue? Could you explain what is the problem before the fix is applied? I would assume that if out is null, we still need to call {{output.set(j, out);}}? Thanks, +1, I was checking the code, and the change makes sense, although we should still call {{output.set(j, out);}} in every case, as stated above.

We make a similar conversion to NULL value in two other places; it seems like it was forgotten to do it in the {{next()}} method too., Thanks [~jcamachorodriguez] for the review. Patch 2 takes {{output.set(j, out);}} out from the if block,
