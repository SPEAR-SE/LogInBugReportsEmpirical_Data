, Also increased the frequency of checks for metastore startup from every 10 sec to every sec. 1 sec pause should be more than enough to not consume too much of cpu resources on the machine, and it will help shave off a few seconds from the test runtime.

Can someone please review this change ? It should help nail down the problem with metastore startup in large number of tests. 
This change impacts only the tests.

We have 30+ patches in the queue, and many runs are taking 3+hrs to finish. Putting this in asap could help in reducing the number of failures in those tests and might also give more clues on why the runs are taking so long.
, Thanks +1, I was also thinking the other day that maybe the machines are getting loaded or somewhat slow, hence HMS cannot start up in time.  But this will tell us for certain.

I will also take a look at that if I get a chance., I thinking to restart PTest server, which should trigger auto-generation of new test slaves fresh from the image, does anyone mind me doing that?, [~szehon] Yes, I agree, a restart is worth trying out.
Meanwhile, I will go ahead and commit this.
, Patch committed to branch-1 and master.
Thanks for the review [~szehon]!
