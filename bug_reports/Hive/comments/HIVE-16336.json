ATTACHMENT ID: 12861291 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1, thanks Chao for the rename., Please force new lines with \n in the parameter description.  Also, you don't need to indent the description.  And the "+" usually goes at the end of the line.

In other words, don't follow the example of hive.spark.use.op.stats in HiveConf.java, but look at hive.llap.hs2.coordinator.enabled a few parameters higher up in the file., Thanks [~leftylev] for reminding me this. I've fixed both {{hive.spark.use.ts.stats.for.mapjoin}} and {{hive.spark.use.op.stats}}. Can you take another look?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12861467 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1 for the parameter descriptions.

Thanks for the formatting fix, [~csun]., Pushed to master. Thanks [~lirui] and [~leftylev] for reviewing., [~csun], this jira has the wrong fix version.  You committed it to master for release 3.0.0, not to branch-2.3 for release 2.3.0.  So please change the fix version to 3.0.0.

I verified that the patch changes aren't in branch-2.2, branch-2.3, or branch-2.4., Changed. Thanks [~leftylev]., Doc note:  This adds *hive.spark.use.ts.stats.for.mapjoin* to HiveConf.java, replacing and removing *hive.spark.use.file.size.for.mapjoin* which was added in release 2.3.0 by HIVE-15489.

** [hive.spark.use.file.size.for.mapjoin | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.spark.use.file.size.for.mapjoin]

I won't add a TODOC label because I just took care of the documentation., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
