[Fixed this by changing transaction connection to use the same JDBC connection string as the rest of the metastore., [~alangates] Can you create a RB entry for this?, https://reviews.apache.org/r/19149/, Left some comments on RB., New version of the patch with changes based on Ashutosh's comments., [~rhbutani] This patch should go into the 0.13 branch as well., +1, Resubmitting patch to kick off tests., Ran this locally and all tests passed except for union_top_level.q which seems to have a different ordering on my machine then the build machine., Committed to trunk & 0.13. Thanks, Alan!, For the record, this removes *hive.txn.driver* and *hive.txn.connection.string* which were introduced in HIVE-5843.]
