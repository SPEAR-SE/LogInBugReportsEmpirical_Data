[Good catch. We need regression tests for this too. I have a feeling this might be a regression due to recent decimal work., We discussed w/[~jnp]; the cause appears to be GenericUDFOPDivide::deriveResultExactTypeInfo, which is always decimal, from HIVE-5356. So, ints are exact types, and this goes to decimal. Didn't discuss solutions yet. 
Ideally, we should have vectorization support for decimal., This is by design right now. Exact type division has to produce exact type according to SQL standard. Double as it previously did would break that... making it int is probably not what users expect (given that it was previously double). Optionally we could do a hack that converts to-from double, but that is ugly and would change query results from vectorization when conversion is lossy.

For proper fix, decimal support would need to be added. That is tracked in HIVE-5937]
