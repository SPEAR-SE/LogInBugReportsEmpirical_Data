[incorporated ashish's comments, As part of this, changed nullgroup3.q to drop the tables at the end - it was leading to some intermittent problems for other tests, Looks good to me.

+1

Will run the tests and check in if they succeed.
, I am not able to apply this patch in 0.3 branch. Can you generate another one for 0.3? Will also try on my end., A bunch of classes that are needed in addInputPath are not there in 0.3, so I think we will have to generate a new patch for 0.3 or agree to not fix this in 0.3. I do feel that this is important enough that we should get a fix for this issue in 0.3.

Thoughts?
, I dont think we need it in 0.3 - it is a pretty esoteric case.
Did you already merge it in trunk ?, I already merged it into trunk. Will mark this as fixed.
, committed. Thanks Namit!!]
