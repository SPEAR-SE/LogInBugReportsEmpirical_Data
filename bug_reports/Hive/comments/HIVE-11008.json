[Patch from [~cwelch]
, there are 2 places where StatusDelegator.run() is called Server.showJobList() and Server.showJobId().
Don't we need the same logic in both places?

Can the setting of the 2 properties be moved into StatusDelegator.run() just before
ShimLoader.getHadoopShims().getWebHCatShim()?, As mentioned in description, this issue happens because of difference between the jobs retained by RM and job history server, and that is applicable only to showJobList. That problem is applicable only to showJobList() call, when showDetails gets set to true.
 This is not an ideal solution, but since the jobclient is not able to distinguish between real failures that it needs to retry on (eg transient fs errors) and failures due to job not existing, we don't have any good alternative.
For showJobId(), it is better to still retry.

If we move this to StatusDelegator.run(), we will have to pass some boolean to it, so that this is set only in case of showJobList() call. Please let me know if you think that is better.
, suppose the call http://www.myserver.com/templeton/v1/jobs/job123 is made and and job123 doesn't exist.  Why would the same retry logic not kick in?, 
[~jianhe] would have more background on the fix from [~cwelch].
 What is the behavior in above case mentioned by [~ekoifman] ? I understand that in above case as well we can have the RM having the job information, but History server not having it.
Would you recommend having retries in that case ? Can that result in timeouts ?

, whether you start with Server.showJobId() or Server.showJobList() you end up in StatusDelegator.run(), i.e. the calls to Hadoop daemons are exactly the same so this has to behave the same way..., [~thejas] is this still relevant?]
