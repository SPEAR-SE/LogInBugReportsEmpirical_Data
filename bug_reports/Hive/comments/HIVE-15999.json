ATTACHMENT ID: 12853815 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, I cannot find a good answer. As we discussed, this might be a derby bug.

One thing I noticed that is different for TestDbTxnManager2 from other tests is that, all other tests call "TxnDbUtil.setConfValues(conf);" before calling "TxnDbUtil.prepDb();", but TestDbTxnManager2 only calls "TxnDbUtil.setConfValues(conf);" once in a @BeforeClass method. By changing the @BeforeClass method into constructor, it's guaranteed to be run for every UT, which is consistent to all other tests.

I ran the ptest several times, and didn't see such failure anymore with the fix., +1, Committed to master. Thanks Eugene for the review!]
