[Using the INSTR fuction to find the posistion of a substring for a UTF-8 returns zero

select INSTR (‘НАСТРОЕние’, ‘P’) from foo-bar 
, Hi, I was going to look at this , but when I tried it looks like that your first P is a Cyrillic P (d0,a0), while the second is a English P (50).  Can you verify?  If you make the second a Cyrlilic P, than it works., Sorry, copy/paste got me. They _look_ the same. And sorry about the curly quotes, I don't know where they came from. 

The real issue is that for UTF-8 INSTR returns the position in bytes instead of characters. So this reutrns a 9 where by my count it should be a 5. Thank you for your support. 

select INSTR ('НАСТРОЕние', 'Р') from .... , This seems to work, lets see what folks think.

Original code was trying to avoid encoding the bytes and just doing byte-counting, but not sure if that is possible when doing unicode char calculations.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12639052, Should this also work for unicode characters which require more than one Java character? If you add these checks to TestGenericUDFUtils, the 2nd check fails:
{code}
    Assert.assertEquals(3, GenericUDFUtils.findText(new Text("123\uD801\uDC00456"), new Text("\uD801\uDC00"), 0));
    Assert.assertEquals(4, GenericUDFUtils.findText(new Text("123\uD801\uDC00456"), new Text("4"), 0));
{code}

This would require using String.codePointCount() on the indexOf() result., Thanks for the review.  As I understand, you are passing in a string literal to Text constructor, so it is not interpreting \uD801 as one char, so there is actually 5 chars there: '\', 'u', 'D', '8', '0', '1'.

I tried the following test and it seemed to work:

    char[] chararray = new char[] {'1', '2', '3', '\uD801', '\uDC00', '4', '5', '6'};
    String str = new String(chararray);
    Assert.assertEquals(5, GenericUDFUtils.findText(new Text(str), new Text("4"), 0));

I guess the second check was supposed to be 5, not 4., The string literal does interpret "\uD801" as a single character, and "\uD801\uDC00" as a single code point (got the example character from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/supplementary-142654.html):

{noformat}
    String str1 = "123\uD801\uDC00456";
    System.out.println("str1 length=" + str1.length() + ", codePointCount=" + str1.codePointCount(0, str1.length()));

str1 length=8, codePointCount=7
{noformat}

So if we count things by unicode code points, the "4" would be at index 4 (for 0-based index).
, From that link, "\uD801\uDC00" would be the representation for U+10400, Sorry Jason I missed that.  Made the fix to handle supplementary characters (surrogate pairs), and updated the review board., I think it looks good, +1,
