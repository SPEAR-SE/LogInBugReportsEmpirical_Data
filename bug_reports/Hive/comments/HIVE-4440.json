[I really like the title of the jira.

Changing the parameter name is backward incompatible.
Can you support both the current parameter and the proposed parameter for now ?
Document it clearly, and say that the current parameter hive.mapjoin.bucket.cache.size will not be supported
for this from 0.13 or something like that., Thanks :-)

Patch .2 honors the old parameter unless it's at the default in which case it uses the new one. I also put documentation around it. 

You bring up a good point, but are you sure it's necessary to support both in this case though? It's just slightly ugly in the code and requires us to move in again to remove later. My thinking is this: If you use the old parameter, it's probably because you needed to up it to get better performance - in this case the new default should most likely be ok for you. Do you think there's going to be cases where this falls flat?, Patch.2 looks good. I agree with Namit that supporting the old config makes sense. Can you run tests on it. We might consider warning in Hive 0.13 and removing in Hive 0.14. *smile*, [~owen.omalley]: Ran all tests - no failures., I just committed this.

, This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one., Hive 0.13.0 did not remove *hive.mapjoin.bucket.cache.size*.  Also, the comment that says it should be removed has a typo in the name of the new parameter -- it should be *hive.smbjoin.cache.rows*, not hive.smbjoin.cache.row:

{quote}
+    // hive.mapjoin.bucket.cache.size has been replaced by hive.smbjoin.cache.row,
+    // need to remove by hive .13. Also, do not change default (see SMB operator)
{quote}

Instead of creating a new jira for this, I'll add a comment on HIVE-6586 (for HIVE-6037)., Here's the comment I added to HIVE-6586:
