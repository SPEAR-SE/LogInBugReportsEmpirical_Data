the patch:HIVE-5499-Table-Comment.patch is for table's column chinese comment.
you should patch the two patches both
These two patches are not required to patch in order,The only thing you need to ensure that: the two patches should be patched both at the same time., [~lvxin_1986] Just curious. The JIRA is marked as "fixed", so the patches here are committed already?, Doesn't look like patch is in trunk.]
