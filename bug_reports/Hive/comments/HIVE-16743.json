ATTACHMENT ID: 12869541 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, My understanding is this newly added BitSet currently has no client which is using it - it's only used by isTxnAborted() and isTxnRangeAborted(). Although readFromString() and writeToString() also use it, but the fact that it was constructed incorrectly doesn't impact the serialization/deserialization.

p.s. my unit test in other ticket already verified isTxnAborted()/isTxnRangeAborted() is working with this fix :), [~ekoifman] Can you review it please?, I think the issue is that the bad code is in TxnUtils.createValidCompactTxnList() but all tests use ValidTxnList directly - so it's never getting tested.  Same for TxnUtils.createValidReadTxnList() - both of which are a problem since they include vital logic.
Could you add a follow up ticket to address this please?

+1 this fix

, HIVE-16753 created as a follow-up to add tests for those methods, Committed to master. Thanks Eugene for the review., [~wzheng], the commits to master and branch hive-14535 omitted the JIRA number.  Please update errata.txt for commit 1c3039333ba71665e8b954fbee88188757bb4050.  Thanks.

Example of updating errata.txt:  HIVE-11876. , Woops.. Will do that. Thanks for finding it out!, Thanks for updating errata.txt with HIVE-16760, [~wzheng]., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
