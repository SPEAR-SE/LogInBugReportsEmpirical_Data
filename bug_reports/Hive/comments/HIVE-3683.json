[I met this when run a full set unit test with option -Dtest.continue.on.failure=false, like
ant -Dtest.continue.on.failure=false test, We don't support running ant from subproject directories. It's possible restrict tests to specific submodules by modifying the list of submodules contained in the 'iterate-test' macro defined in the top-level build.xml file.]
