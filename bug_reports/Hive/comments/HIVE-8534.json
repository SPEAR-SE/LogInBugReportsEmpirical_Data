[To make it easier to manage the whitelist, the patch now supports whitelist. The change is backward compatible for this config param use.
Also adds support for an extra parameter, that lets users add additional parameters to whitelist, instead of having to customize the entire list.
Also updates the config with restrictions only if authorization is enabled.
, My eagle eye spots an extra space between two words:

{code}
+            + "regexes can be modified by user  when sql std auth is enabled. Default value is "
{code}

And would you please spell out sql std auth?

Also, most parameter descriptions in HiveConf.java put the + for concatenating strings at the end of a line, not at the beginning of the next line.  And newlines would be good for long descriptions.

And while I'm quibbling, how about capitalizing java here:

{code}
+        "List of comma separated java regexes, to be appended to list set in "
{code},

ATTACHMENT ID: 12676143 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, HIVE-8534.3.patch - addressing some of the comments. Unit tests need to be updated.
, HIVE-8534.4.patch - removing the use of isWhiteListRestrictionEnabled boolean var, +1 (just for parameter descriptions), [~hagleitn] I have moved setting of the regex param value to HiveConf, but I am still using the ConfVar list to generate the regex instead of putting a hardcoded flattened string there, as I feel using the ConfVar list is less error prone.  Let me know what you think.
, Updated the review. Some smaller things. Have you considered adding a q file test (end-to-end) for the whitelist, in addition to the junit test?

I still think the flat regex list would be simpler and more beneficial. In that case, we'd create a hive-site file from it, which gives users a better idea of what's happening - also they'd have a template for modifying it. You're hiding the settings hard coded in the class file. That list or regex would also be the single source of truth, without transformations or merging of lists.

On the other hand we can probably switch that at any time w/o much compatibility overhead, so I think either way is better than what we have now.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12676443 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch committed to trunk and 0.14 branch.
, Thanks for the reviews [~leftylev] [~hagleitn]
, Doc note:  This adds *hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist.append* and changes the description of *hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist* in HiveConf.java, so they need to be documented in the wiki.

* [Configuration Properties -- SQL Standard Based Authorization | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-SQLStandardBasedAuthorization]
* [SQL Standard Based Hive Authorization -- Restrictions on Hive Commands and Statements | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization#SQLStandardBasedHiveAuthorization-RestrictionsonHiveCommandsandStatements]
* and optionally [SQL Standard Based Hive Authorization -- Configuration | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization#SQLStandardBasedHiveAuthorization-Configuration], Glitch in the description of *hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist*:  angle brackets don't convert well for the template file, so 'set <param>' comes out as 'set & lt;param& gt;' (spaces added to workaround jira formatting).  Not a show stopper., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, how can this be matched by regex if hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist is a COMMA separated list of java regex ? I am not sure whether this is a issue, so i comment here., [~stone_xy] Thanks for pointing that out. Looks like I changed the patch addressing review comments, but forgot to update the description. Created HIVE-8937 to fix that.
, Partially documented:

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist], Doc update:  *hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist.append* still needs to be documented.  See HIVE-8937 for new description., [~ajisakaa] finished the documentation and updated the descriptions (HIVE-8937), so I removed the TODOC14 label.

* [hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist]
* [hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist.append | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist.append]
