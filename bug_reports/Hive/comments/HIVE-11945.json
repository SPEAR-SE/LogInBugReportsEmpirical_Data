branch after the removed seek in RecordReaderUtils is not changed. Does it depend on this seek?

Other than that, the patch makes sense. Did you test that it fixes the issue?, Looking at the implementation of readFully(long offset, byte[] buffer, int offset, int length) in FSInputStream, it seems like there are 2 seeks + 1 read with this method. The second seek is to restore the position to the old position. I am guessing this additional seek will be a significant overhead for some filesystems (S3?) right? , Thanks for the review comments [~sershe] & [~prasanth_j].  I will upload revised patch with review comments addressed (to fix zcr & s3 case). , Uploading the patch with zcr changes.
[~prasanth_j] - S3AInputStream should actually have a lazy seek() implementation which can work well with readFully.  This is followed in PrestoS3FileSystem as well. Will create a separate bug in HDFS to track this., +1, [~rajesh.balamohan] Thanks for the S3 analysis. Can you link the new HDFS jira to this patch? 

The latest patch LGTM as well, +1,
