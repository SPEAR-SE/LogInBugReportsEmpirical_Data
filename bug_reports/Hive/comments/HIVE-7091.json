[Started some work in [http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/pre-commit-trigger|http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/pre-commit-trigger] , but it cannot get the first diff from the apache server as it is down.  Will try again after it comes up., Patch for testing, This seems to work : [http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-Admin/|http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-Admin/].  I manually tested it but have disabled it for now as not to interfere with the existing one.

[~brocknoland] can you please disable the other build and enable this one when you get a chance, as you have the privilege on the apache jenkins?, [~szehon] I have removed hive from the Apache Jenkins Precommit admin and enabled the new job., Thanks!  I'll resolve this JIRA then.]
