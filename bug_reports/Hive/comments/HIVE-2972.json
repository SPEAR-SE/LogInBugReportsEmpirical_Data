[Related to http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7104012, If it is a JDK problem that hive can not work around why not close the issue?, I think we should open until there's at least a workaround in place.  If there's no workaround we should at the very least catch the exception so that the job does not die., Fair enough if we can trap it.]
