[note that Load Data can simply move files with arbitrary names into the table namespace.
So non-acid to acid conversion (unbucketed) may see files with non-standard names
So the "-1" may be needed to send all such files a single logical bucket to number the rows correct for reading "original" files.

Could also hash the filename (that maps to -1) and mod N to send to different logical buckets so that 1st compaction doesn't have a lopsided split.]
