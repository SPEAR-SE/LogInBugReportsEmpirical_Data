[Stacktrace of the error., Caused by the acceptsURL method of the HiveDriver.
Will add a patch which works for me., This patch includes 3 changes. 1 to fix the "No suitable driver" error. Then commons-dbcp also calls getConnection() and getAutoCommit()

on the getConnection() I simply call getConnection("","") and on getAutoCommit() I return true since hive is actually committing automatically.

This allows me to now use "JdbcTemplate" stuff which makes my live a lot easier., +1 

looks good - will commit if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Bennie]
