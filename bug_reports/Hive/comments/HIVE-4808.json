[HIVE-4808.patch has the diffs.
Tested manually.
Ran WebHcat e2e tests. , It would be good to have an automated test for this as well. I understand that this will add 10+ minutes to the system tests (effectively almost doubling the run time). Maybe, we can have a separate ant target that runs the shorter running system tests, for use by developers before committing changes.

, 3 things to keep in mind when testing:
1. TempletonControllerJob is hardcoded to send ping every 1 second
2. Set mapred.task.timeout to 70+ seconds, i.e. larger than interval in #1
3. when running test case (in bug description) set -mt 90000 (to be larger than # 2), Couple of suggestions from Hadoop user list on setting timeout programmatically:

Yes, you can set it into your Job configuration object in code. If
your driver uses the Tool framework, then you can also pass a
-Dmapred.task.timeout=value CLI argument when invoking your program.
AND
'mapred.task.timeout' is deprecated configuration. You can use 'mapreduce.task.timeout' property to do the same.
You could set this configuration while submitting the Job using org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.setLong(String name, long value) API from conf or JobConf., Added a test for this case.
Ran Templeton e2e tests.
fork.factor.group=3 and fork.factor.conf.file=6 the suite runs in 11 minutes.

Added support for timeout_seconds property in .conf files to specify custom timeout.,

This message is automatically generated., I'm not sure I'm running the tests properly.  When I run the new test TestHeartbeat_2 it fails with:

{code}
./test_harness.pl::TestDriverCurl::checkResStatusCode INFO Check failed: status_code 200 expected, test returned <400>
{code}

Do I need to do something to set it up properly?, Never mind, my mistake.  I had my test harness configured incorrectly.  Tests pass, I'll check this in shortly., Patch checked in.  Thanks Eugene., This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.]
