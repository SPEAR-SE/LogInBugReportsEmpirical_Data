[This is unfortunately due to the fact that string literals in Hive type string, whereas most other databases treat them as of type char. When comparing string to char, both sides are converted to string before comparison, where trailing spaces are stripped when converting from char to string, and trailing spaces are significant during string comparison.

It would have been nice to have been able to change string literals to become char type, but this would have meant changing a pretty fundamental behavior in Hive, and I'm not really sure what the consequences would be here.

As you have already noticed, one solution is to cast string literals to char. Another option that might work here is to strip trailing whitespace from the string literals.

As with HIVE-9537, better documentation would probably be helpful here., Turns out I added similar comments in 2013 to HIVE-3745 where references were drawn to MySQL/Postgres in that thread etc.
