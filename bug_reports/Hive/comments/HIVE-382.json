[a few things:

1. Its not very apparently what kind of memory savings result with this change. is there a way to add a test for that? 
2. do you need the clear() call at the end of the loop?
3. can you change warn to debug or info?, i added just the test to a clean source tree and ran it without your code changes. the test seems to succeed on a mac as well as on linux., changed the test - for some reason mapred.child.java.opts does not work in local mode - increased the size of data generated by the dummy mapper.
Now, it fails without my changes, Committed. Thanks Namit!]
