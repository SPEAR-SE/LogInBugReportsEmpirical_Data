[[~asears] how are you installing Hive? This is a warning that is relatively harmless (JsonSerDe would not be supported by LLAP clusters deployed with that package), but I think that jar is normally there by default, Just grabbed the latest binaries and unpacked them. http://apache.mirror.gtcomm.net/hive/hive-2.0.0/

Coincidentally was doing some Twitter stuff with JSON SerdDe & Nifi.
Thought it would be a quick hit if it's not being added properly when being built.

Latest unrelated error from LLAP / Slider seems to come up as info instead of failure, haven't had a chance to dig in yet.

INFO  appmaster.SliderAppMaster - Unregistering AM status=FAILED message=Unstable Application Instance : - failed with component LLAP failed 'recently' 6 times (6 in startup); threshold is 5 - last failure: Failure container_e28_1461195599564_0003_01_000007 on host  (0): http://19888/jobhistory/logs/45454/container_e28_1461195599564_0003_01_000007/ctx/yarn
