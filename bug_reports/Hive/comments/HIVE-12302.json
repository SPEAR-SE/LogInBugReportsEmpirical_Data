[Attaching RB link https://reviews.apache.org/r/41065/, [~ashutoshc]/[~sershe] Can someone please review this patch? Moved all serialization related functions to SerializationUtilities.java class. Also, I don't know the reason for runtime,spark and cloning kryo threadlocal objects that existed before. This patch now has only one thread pool that is used by hive plan serialization, spark and for cloning., small nit on RB, also, why did some unrelated code get removed?, Addressed [~sershe]'s review comments, That was dead code suggested by IDE., +1,
