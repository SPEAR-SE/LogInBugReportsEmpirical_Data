ATTACHMENT ID: 12850901 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Test failures are unrelated. [~sershe], could you review please?, +1, Committed to master. Thank you for the review [~sershe]., [~hagleitn] would you mind sharing the script? Curious how did you find such files., [~vgarg] don't have a script, but didn't do anything fancy. Looked for all the ".q" files, same with ".q.out", then i stripped them to their base names and turned them into unique sorted lists. Finally diff'd the two sets, and "git removed" the delta., I bet it was done with one command in Emacs that required 24 fingers :)]
