[[~sushanth] Can you review?, With the current patch, the metastore will do a LOG.debug for every single null record, which can be a lot, and will also slow down that process a lot.

Would it be possible to simply update the UpdateMStorageDescriptorTblURIRetVal class with a int numNullRecords initialized to zero and incremented each time you get a null? Also, in that case, I would imagine that we shouldn't add that location to badRecords, since that would bloat up the size of badRecords unnecessarily. After we do that, we can then do a singular log in HiveMetaTool.printTblURIUpdateSummary along with the other statistics, mentioning how many null records we found, and that that is okay if the user has that many indexes/views., Thanks [~sushanth]. Updated patch as suggested.,
