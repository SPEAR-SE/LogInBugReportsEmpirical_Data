[The problem cause is that for the regenerated query in parser for statistics:
select compute_stats(key , 16 ) , compute_stats(value , 16 ) , part from jira.colstatspartint where part = 0003 group by part,
its return value for column "part" is the normalized integer 3 instead of 0003, so updating statistics data to partition with partSepc (part=3) failed in ColumnStatsTask since it is different from partition (part=0003) and does not exist.
, The same issue happens if the partitioning column is a char().]
