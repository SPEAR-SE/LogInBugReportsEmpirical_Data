[creates explicit close method for history and calls it from sessionstate, Updated patch uses a new SessionState per task (parallel execution), so they don't step on one another.
, Couple of comments:

* HiveServer uses TmpOutputFile, which it deletes (now via session.close()), but never closes the input stream which it opens on that file in readResults() and setupSessionIO() methods. This will result in leaking of file-descriptors. HiveServer2 has copy-pasted this code, so this leak occurs there too.

* I am not sure about changes in SessionState per task. With your patch, each task will close the {{SessionState}} when it finishes. A query may have multiple tasks, so this implies every task will create SessionState when it begin executing, which seems counter-intuitive, since there should be one sessionstate object across all tasks of the query which was the case earlier too, isnt it?, Good points. I'll look into it.]
