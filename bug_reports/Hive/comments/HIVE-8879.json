[Looks like hive uses derby 10.10.1.1, and this was fixed in 10.10.2.0 and 10.11.1.1 - those seem minor enough version bumps that we should be okay to bump our derby deps to for our unit tests., Uploading patch, I have also encountered this Derby bug {{ava.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException}} on linux if you run all Hive tests serially.
