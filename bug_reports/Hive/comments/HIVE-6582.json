[These four errors are in the description of *hive.user.install.directory* and the same errors exist in the current patch to HiveConf.java for HIVE-6037 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12631336/HIVE-6037.17.patch).

After HIVE-6037 commits, hive-default.xml.template will be generated from HiveConf.java so that's where these changes need to be made for Hive 0.13.0 and future releases.  But this patch could be applied to hive-default.xml.template to fix the problem in release 0.12.0 and previous releases.

I'll add a comment to HIVE-6037 so these corrections can be included with other fixes that HiveConf.java will need after HIVE-6037 gets committed., Opened HIVE-6586 to deal with this in HiveConf.java.,
