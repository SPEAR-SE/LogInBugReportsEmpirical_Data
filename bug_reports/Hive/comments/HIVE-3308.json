[Added a test to show the problem.
Result of the test will show:

#### A masked pattern was here ####
POSTHOOK: query: select count(*) from src
POSTHOOK: type: QUERY
POSTHOOK: Input: default@src
#### A masked pattern was here ####
NULL

But should show something like:

#### A masked pattern was here ####
POSTHOOK: query: select count(*) from src
POSTHOOK: type: QUERY
POSTHOOK: Input: default@src
#### A masked pattern was here ####

, [~jakobhoman] Would you like to review this patch?, Will do., I would really appreciate someone committing this. It has tests showing the issue with correct results after the patch. It makes the serde more consistent with other serdes. Basically anyone using compression combined with avro will hit this bug like we see with HIVE-4195., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Bennie., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2053 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2053/])
