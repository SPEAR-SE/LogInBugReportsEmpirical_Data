[ant testreport in hive/build.xml uses junitreport task which
expects each JUnit test to produce an TEST-*.xml file with results.
HCatalog tests were not producing such files.

Added logic for HCat tests to generate .xml result files and copy them to where they can be included in the .html file., tested manually with commands like
ant test -logfile ant.log -Dmodule=common -Dtestcase=TestHiveConf testreport
ant test -logfile ant.log -Dmodule=hcatalog testreport

all results are present in junit-noframes.html, +1, Patch committed to trunk., Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #262 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/262/])
