[related to HIVE-11241?, I don't know if they are necessarily related because in this case the database name is different than the table name and calling DESCRIBE `default`.`merchants`; executes successfully., Being related is just a way to give audience broader information. If you look the comments in HIVE-11241, the problem described here was actually spelled out., Ah, I see it now, and the underlying grammar issue makes more sense now.  Thanks Xuefu!, The grammer for describe has been simplified to eliminate ambiguity via HIVE-12184. Starting Hive 2.0, "describe TABLE.COLUMN" is no longer supported.
The new syntax is 
DESCRIBE [DB.]TABLE [PARTITION partition_spec] [COLUMN]]
