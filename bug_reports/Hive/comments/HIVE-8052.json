Problem was the loading of data into the test table (see new JIRA HIVE-8197).  Turning on vectorization was moved to after the loading and MR and Tez query results now match.,

Since you found the cause of the different results between MR/Tez, does that mean that the other agg functions you had allowed to be vectorized in your first patch will also work?, Yes, good point.  Added variance, var_pop, var_samp, std, stddev, stddev_pop, stddev_samp.

It turns out sum(timestamp) is planned with a Double as output from the aggregation instead of BigInt and this doesn't work when the reduce-side is vectorized.  So, it remains unvectorized (see HIVE-8211).,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12670341, Committed to trunk. Thanks for the contribution [~mmccline], Doc question:  Does this need any user documentation besides the new configuration parameter *hive.vectorized.execution.reduce.groupby.enabled*?

By the way, the latest HiveConf.java in trunk has six *hive.vectorized.xxx* parameters that aren't documented in the wiki yet.  So they all need to be documented in a separate section of the "Configuration Properties" wikidoc.

* [Configuration Properties | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, Doc note:  *hive.vectorized.execution.reduce.groupby.enabled* is documented in the wiki, along with the other vectorization parameters.  Removing the TODOC14 label.

* [Configuration Properties -- Vectorization | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-Vectorization]
* [Configuration Properties -- Vectorization -- hive.vectorized.execution.reduce.groupby.enabled | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.vectorized.execution.reduce.groupby.enabled]]
