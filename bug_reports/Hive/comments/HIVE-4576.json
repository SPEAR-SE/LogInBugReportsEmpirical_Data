[templeton.hive.properties now support '\' as escape character.

when hive.metastore.uris has multiple elements hive job ends up looking like this:

{noformat}
Starting cmd: [apache-hive-0.13.0.2.1.1.0-341-bin.tar.gz/apache-hive-0.13.0.2.1.1.0-341-bin/bin/hive, --service, cli, --hiveconf, mapreduce.job.credentials.binary=/tmp/hadoop-ekoifman/nm-local-dir/usercache/ekoifman/appcache/application_1397587392248_0017/container_1397587392248_0017_01_000002/container_tokens, --hiveconf, tez.credentials.path=/tmp/hadoop-ekoifman/nm-local-dir/usercache/ekoifman/appcache/application_1397587392248_0017/container_1397587392248_0017_01_000002/container_tokens, --hiveconf, hive.metastore.uris=thrift://localhost:9933,thrift://127.0.0.1:9933, --hiveconf, hive.metastore.sasl.enabled=false, -e, select count(*) from mynums]
{noformat}

and Pig job will have 
{noformat}
PIG_OPTS=-Dhive.metastore.uris=thrift://localhost:9933,thrift://127.0.0.1:9933 -Dhive.metastore.sasl.enabled=false
{noformat} set., Seems like blindly replacing \ after split may run into problems if \ is used in non-escaping context , eg windows path like D:\hive\hive-site.xml or may be I am misreading the patch., fix bug found by [~ashutoshc], +1, Should this be documented in the wiki now as to-be-fixed, or only after it's committed?

[~leftylev] webhcat-default.xml explains the escape character (in the patch), the same can be done on Wiki after this is committed., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Eugene!, After discussion on Eugene on whether this was a bugfix or a new feature to see if it should be included in 0.13.1, my understanding is now that this is a bugfix for cases where hive.metastore.uris can be a comma-separated value, and this bug breaks being able to use webhcat on those warehouses. Thus, I feel that a tag of "minor" is inappropriate, and am bumping it up., Attaching 0.13 version of this patch for application towards 0.13.1 backport., This jira has been fixed as part of 0.13.1 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.
, Adding a TODOC14 label to boost visibility.  (Already had a TODOC13 label.), Added to documentation and removed TODOC13 and TODOC14 labels.
