[Modified HiveHBaseTableInputFormat#getRecordReader to follow http://hbase.apache.org/book/perf.reading.html 12.9.6. Optimal Loading of Row Keys. Added a related test file.

Now it returns correct results with this cases.

It also will make faster SELECT COUNT(rowky) FROM HBASE_TABLE than other COUNT usages. So it is considerable to use it for COUNT(1) cases, too., Review request at https://reviews.apache.org/r/14587/,

This message is automatically generated., The failed tests on the test server passed on my computer. I'll try again, but it seems like a false alarm., I reproduced those errors, and I'm fixing them., The first patch returned only the row key column when all columns were selected. The second patch fixed this error. It passed all failed tests and hbase_null_cell.q test.,

This message is automatically generated., Bumping the priority on this to critical as it can cause hive to show completely wrong counts with null columns., Seems like this patch would need more work with all the updates on the master that have happened since this was logged.I can take the task to make this update.,
