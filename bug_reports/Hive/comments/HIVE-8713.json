[[~szehon] has this started failing due to DST?, Seems likely, I'll take a look, In the the original , I had actually tried to account for daylight savings time via inDaylightTime, but that didn't work.

So change the test to expect both possible values (PDT and PST)., +1 pending tests, 

{color:red}Overall{color}: -1 at least one tests failed

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:
