[There might some design issue. added preferredType for VectorizedExpressions annotation. Will try argument conversion if there are not proper VectorExpression. 

In this case, concat(column<int>/column<string>) is not supported but adding preferredType="String..." makes final try with first argument casted to string type.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12648447, I think design issue here is one raised in HIVE-7632 {{Vectorizer}} currently inserts casts and than evaluates it so that types of all operands match for UDF. It does so because currently Hive doesnt upcast operands while it does semantic checking and leave this to runtime where it is achieved, mainly via the logic in {{GenericUDFBaseNumeric}} Instead of delegating type casting to runtime, this should happen at compile time, when we are doing type checking and should upcast operands as necessary. Once we do this in {{TypeCheckProcFactory}} there will be no need to insert and evaluate cast later in compilation (like vectorizer) or runtime (GenericUDFOpNumeric)]
