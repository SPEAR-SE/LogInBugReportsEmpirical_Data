[https://reviews.apache.org/r/56774/, [~spena] [~stakiar] would you mind having a look to https://reviews.apache.org/r/56774/, Thanks for adding more tests :).
+1, Committed to master. Thanks [~juanrh] for your contribution., hey [~spena] it looks like on the commit, the patch might have been a little weird, it was committed outside of the itests directory:

https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/47d06fe0064536e194cb35d5d23f0572a398059d

master on github has a hive-blobstore/ directory in the project root, that should be under the itests/ directory. Can we fix this?, Oh. Sorry. I might have used the incorrect -p0 or -p1. I will revert it and re-commit it., [~poeppt] I fixed the commit.
