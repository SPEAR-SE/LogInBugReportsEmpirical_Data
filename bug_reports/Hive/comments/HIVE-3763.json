[This is independent of HIVE-3633.

Even a simple query like:

SELECT /*+mapjoin(b)*/ count(*) FROM test_table1 a JOIN test_table2 b ON a.key = b.key;

requires 2 MR jobs, if test_table1 and test_table2 are sorted and bucketed by key, Will be fixed as part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3784]
