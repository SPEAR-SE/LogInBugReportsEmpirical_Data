[This is a branch-1 only patch. As this fix is already in master/branch-2.0. [~sershe] Can you review this trivial patch?, I wonder if just passing the object w/o calling toString will call toString or handle null automatically? Otherwise +1, That will work too. Updated the patch, Committed to branch-1]
