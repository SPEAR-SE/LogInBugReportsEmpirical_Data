[we also need to encode using Text i think.

also - metadatatypedserde - i guess we need to fix that as well?, Modified serialization as well.
Also checked MetadataTypedColumnsetSerDe. That code is already using Text.
, +1

the only thing that concerns me is that if any row does not conform to utf-8 - then the whole job fails. earlier we had tried to have a setup that the serde throws a serdeexception and we deal with it in query layer (we can ignore some fixed % of bad rows for example).

but looking at the code - this might be hard to do right now - so happy to wait for a rewrite for this :-), Committed revision 740187. (for trunk)
Committed revision 740188. (for branch 0.2)
