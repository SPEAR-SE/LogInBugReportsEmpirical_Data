[I am trying to bisect now to see what broke the tests, since the failure is rather weird (buffer size mismatch when reading metadata), This re-enables the tests and removes all but one ctors to require that the callers think about the settings rather than getting the defaults blindly. The orc_llap test fails, I am bisecting to see what broke it.
[~prasanth_j] fyi, There was a really stupid (and hard to find) error in recent fileId patch. This is why having tests is important... 01 both enables and fixes it. [~prasanth_j] can you take a look?, Why is the version string "0.20" while hadoop-1 is removed? Are there unit tests for testing cache? If so are there unit tests for fileId, non-fileId and synthetic fileId cases?, Other changes, looks good to me., 0.20 is the default that was passed before for other cases. There are some unit tests but apparently don't cover this case. Regular and synthetic fileId are covered by MiniLlap and CliDriver respectively. I'll file a JIRA for file ID tests. Can you +1 meanwhile so we can fix the existing code and enable tests? , +1, Added HIVE-12654 , HiveQA queue looks empty. Retrying...,
