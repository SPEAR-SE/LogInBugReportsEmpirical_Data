[HIVE-4513 adds a config option to enable/disable hive history logging.
, In case you're still using an older version of Hive that doesn't let you disable the history log files, one workaround that you can use is to run
{code}
!rm -r /path/to/hive.querylog.location;
{code}
as your first shell command before running your queries.]
