ATTACHMENT ID: 12775439 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~ashutoshc], could you take a look? For the second patch, I just regenerated q files where the name of the columns had changed; this is expected. Thanks, +1, In general case, we need this fix. But there is an opportunity to optimize simple constant select queries for IN as pointed out on HIVE-12296 That optimization however needs to happen before we generate left semi join for IN clause. As that optimization will be in analysis of IN clause we shall take that up in follow-up jira., Agreed, we should optimize that. However we can also do it as a Calcite rewriting rule? I think we have every needed piece in place, so just trying to avoid adding more logic to SemanticAnalyzer... :s, Certainly. Make sense., Pushed to master, thanks [~ashutoshc]!, [~sershe], this is a bug fix. OK to backport for 2.0.0? , Sure. Backports to 2.0 don't currently require confirmation., OK, thanks.

Pushed to branch-2.0.]
