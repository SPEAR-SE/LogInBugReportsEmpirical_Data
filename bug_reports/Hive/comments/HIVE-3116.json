[Currently the very-clean target depends on ivy:cleancache. The original motivation for adding very-clean was to flush Hive artifacts out of the local Ivy cache, but the ivy:cleancache task actually deletes everything in ~/.ivy2.

The following page indicates that the ivy:cleancache task can be configured to use a specific Ivy settings file, which may allow us to limit the deleted artifacts to Hive only: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.0.0/use/cleancache.html

, Carl, shall we close this since HIVE-3092 is already in or is there anything to be gained from it ?, Yup, I don't think there's any reason to leave this open. Resolving as WONTFIX.]
