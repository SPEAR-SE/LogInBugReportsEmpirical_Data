[attached a patch to sort KeyValue array before creating HBase Result object., Hi, could you please attach a testcase that tests this as well? That way, the tests(including your test) fails without your fix, and succeeds with your fix.

Also, as a general note, the HBaseHCatStorageHandler is about to be deprecated in favour of the hive's HBaseStorageHandler with HIVE-4331., Canceling patch as HIVE-4869 package cleanup will invalidate all current HCatalog patches and will require patch regeneration., Preparing for 0.12 release. Removing fix version of 0.12 for those that are not in 0.12 branch.
, HBaseHCatStorageHandler is being deprecated, right? Can this ticket be closed as "Won't Fix"?

It would be great to convert this example into a unit test ;), I haven't tested this on latest trunk. I will test it and attach a unittest.]
