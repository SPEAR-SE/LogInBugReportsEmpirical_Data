[fyi [~prasanth_j], [~rajesh.balamohan] hive-log4j2.xml controls the client side logging (hive client, hadoop ipc client ) and hive-exec-log4j2.xml controls the server side logging. Can you try setting hive.log.level=INFO on both xml files and see if it solves the issue? With both being set, I am not seeing any DEBUG logs., "--hiveconf hive.log.level=INFO" -> This just sets the logging level for client. 

What is the value for this config hive.tez.log.level?, Attaching the log4j2 configs in my setup (both are of them are defaults and no changes done).

"hive.tez.log.level" has not been changed, so it defaults to INFO. 
, What is the value for tez.am.log.level? , Following is the issue
There is no equivalent of log4j.threshold in log4j2. HIVE-11304 added the value hive.log.threshold to root logger's level. The appender inside the root logger has its own level set to the value of hive.log.level. So if hive.log.threshold is set to ALL then root logger will allow all logging levels but the appender referenced inside root logger will use hive.log.level (say INFO). As a result,  all loggers evaluate DEBUG/TRACE/INFO expression but later will be filtered by the appender. The call trace should trace log in ProtobufRpcEngine being evaluated but then filtered later by the appender. The fix for this issue is to set hive.log.level to root logger instead of the appender referenced inside. , [~rajesh.balamohan] Thanks a lot for finding the issue. The attached patch should fix the problem., Verified the patch. It no longer evaluates the DEBUG statements.,
