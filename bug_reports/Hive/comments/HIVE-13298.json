[[~ashutoshc] can you take a look? This produces a better error; I also added switching the join sides for full outer join, I wonder why TOK_JOIN has inner join semantics, is it a spec or just an accident? I'd assume select * from a,b where a.a=b.a should have the same result as select * from a,b where b.a=a.a,

In that case I'd need to uncomment the case for JOIN., [~jcamachorodriguez] fyi also. Do you know about the join semantics (the above comment)? Is some change needed for CBO?, [~sershe], thanks for pinging me. I do not know if I got properly the problem you are facing; is it the order of the columns for full outer join? Or for every kind of join? Got confused with the inner join semantics comment...

I think SQL standard specifies that column order for * should be the order of the columns in the table. For the query given, we create a cartesian product of tables {{a,b}}, and then we filter them. Thus, I would assume it is correct to set the order of columns to: _columns of a + columns of b_ in that case. Did you mean that by "switching the join sides"?, I guess that's another consideration. In that case we also cannot switch. My original question is misguided, it doesn't actually matter which side of an inner join is which. But if we want to preserve column order, I'd have to remove the switch logic and just keep the error., Replacing the switch with a TODO, [~ashutoshc] ping?,
