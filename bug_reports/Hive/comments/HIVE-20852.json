[could you provide a more detailed repro case?, # Create stream_table(id int, body string)
 # Insert CSV data via NiFi 1.7 "GenerateFlowFile" and "PutHive3Streaming" into table stream_table.
 # At first, major compaction runs on stream_table.
 # After keeping flow running some more, there's enough files on stream_table to run minor compaction, but it isn't even checked by Initiator.
 # Create Another table normal_table(id int, body string)
 # Insert datas into normal_table manually
 # It is checked, and get compacted.]
