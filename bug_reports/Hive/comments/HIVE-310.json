[unfortunately tests that have output of 'describe extended' can't be compared easily since they contain user names. so there are no tests. need to figure out how to compare this output. will open a new JIRA, +1.

might make sense to test in java land., what do you mean by java land?, there is a work around in the meantime which is to set the correct SerDe using 'alter table ... set serde ..' command., can we check this in? i meant we could test the setting of the correct serde from a java test program. but would be good to get this in regardless., i will submit a new patch with the test., not sure this is required any more. going to close this as 'will not fix'. will reopen this if any one has a valid case for this still.]
