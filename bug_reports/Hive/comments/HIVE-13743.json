Notice "create table test_1 as select * from test;" fails in the move task., Tried a dirty hack by removing "HdfsEncryptionShim" check in needToCopy (which would get rid of the FileNotFoundException) and it went through without issues. , This is because of change in behavior of HDFS from 2.6 to 2.8 wherein api hdfsAdmin.getEncryptionZoneForPath(path) used to return null for non-existent path in 2.6, now throws FNFE.
[~rajesh.balamohan] Can you test this out in 2.8 cluster? Can't write unit test for this since Hive currently uses 2.6 hadoop, [~ashutoshc] - Checked the patch in Hadoop 2.8 cluster and patch works as expected. No longer seeing this issue., Thanks [~rajesh.balamohan] for verification. [~spena] can you take a quick look at the patch?, I haven't gone very deep into the logic, but based on a quick look-  The current logic seems broken, if the destination file/directory does not exist, it does not mean that the destination file's zone is not encrypted. 

What are your thoughts [~spena] ?

The new patch from [~ashutoshc] doesn't fix that issue, but it should get it working with Hadoop 2.8. We could get this in and follow up with another patch to address what seems to be an issue with current logic.

Comments regarding the patch -
 # Can you also include the exception in the log message ?
 # The indentation of return false; seems to be off
, updated patch to address Thejas's comments., +1 to this patch.

[~spena] what are your thoughts on the overall existing logic of this function and follow up jira ?
, Pushed to master. , [~thejas] is right. The destination path that does not exist might be encrypted (when created) by its parent directory if the parent is in an encryption zone.
May we try to check if the destination parent directory in case the destination path does not exist?]
