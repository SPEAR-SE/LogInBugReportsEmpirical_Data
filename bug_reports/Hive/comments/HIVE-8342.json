[jobClose method is setting null object in FileSingDesc parameter,  when calling  Utilities.mvFileToFinalPath method.. 
And  mvFileToFinalPath method is calling createEmptyBuckets method..

First.. I added the code in createEmptyBuckets method , which is null checker if FileSinkDesc object null 

But util class can be called everywhere~~
So I changed logic from null checker to throw new exception if null object

How about that? ^^



, Thanks for taking a stab. Unfortunately your code does not compile and {{NullPointerException}}s should usually not be thrown "manually".

I'm not sure what the correct behavior here would be., I changed from null pointer exception to hive exception.. How about that?, Ted, thanks for the reminder.

Looks mostly good. I'd suggest

{code}
    if (conf == null) {
      throw new HiveException("FileSinkDesc cannot be null");
    }
{code}

instead. Adheres to coding standard and removes extra period at the end of the message.

The only problem with this patch is that {{AbstractFileMergeOperator#jobCloseOp}} calls the method {{mvFileToFinalPath}} with {{null}}. I didn't follow the code to see if if this can actually happen though., Hey [~tedyu] I get notifications about this issue every once in a while because you seemingly change something but it looks like you're not actually changing anything. Is this a JIRA problem?]
