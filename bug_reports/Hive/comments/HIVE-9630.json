[Is there a way for you to check if the {{CURRENT_DATE}} scalar added in HIVE-5472 works for your use-case?, Cross-checked on today's hive-trunk build.

{code}
hive> set hive.optimize.constant.propagation;
hive.optimize.constant.propagation=true
hive> explain select * from store_sales where ss_sold_date = date_sub(to_date(current_timestamp), 1) ;
OK

This is because {{unix_timestamp()}} is not deterministic so isn't folded in, but {{current_timestamp}} is., If I read HIVE-5472 correctly, then the current_timestamp() and current_date() UDF functions were added during the course of January 2015.

We are not in a position to take a new release at this moment, but a month or two from now we will be.

As nothing is passed into unix_timestamp(), I did not realize it would be considered non-deterministic.  I will resolve this ticket. , As noted in the comments, unix_timestamp() is not deterministic while current_timestamp() and current_date() are.  ]
