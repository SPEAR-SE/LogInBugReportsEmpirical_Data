[Any known work-around for this issue?, Can you run explain for SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM t query  and post it here?, [~totto90] Did you get a chance to run explain per my previous comment?, [~ashutoshc] Sorry just saw your earlier comment, I ran the query on a simple table with 2 records, here's the result:

{code}
hive> truncate table test;
OK
Time taken: 0.371 seconds
hive> select * from test;
OK
Time taken: 0.187 seconds
hive> select count(*) from test;
OK
1
Time taken: 0.192 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)
hive> explain select count(*) from test;
OK
STAGE DEPENDENCIES:
  Stage-0 is a root stage

STAGE PLANS:
  Stage: Stage-0
    Fetch Operator
      limit: 1

Time taken: 0.086 seconds, Fetched: 8 row(s)
{code}, As a workaround, do :
{code}
set hive.compute.query.using.stats=false;
{code}, [~ashutoshc] thanks, Attached patch fixes truncate table scenario. Insert into is on different code path, for which I will open separate jira and submit patch their., https://reviews.apache.org/r/23421/,
