[You may also delete runDbCheck() with this patch, since thats not used anymore. 
But before that you need to pay attention to MySQL specific query here, because that does more than determining db type, it also sets ansi mode for mysql. We need to run this query but outside of the lock acquired in ObjectStore::setConf(). One way to do that is to keep your current changes as it is and than after doing unlock() in setConf() in objectstore, call a method on MetaStoreDirectSQL to run this query., Patch V2., Thanks [~ashutoshc], will do that in upcoming patch., Made patch V3. Can you review it? Thanks., 1) Why is setDbANSIMode called where it's called in ObjectStore? It should already be called in DirectSQL before each set of queries. Note that it only works for one connection internally, so it needs to be called in the same transaction is queries, calling it in ObjectStore doesn't make a lot of sense.

2) The detection changes need to be tested (manually is probably the only way to do it) with all the databases affected (mysql, oracle, mssql),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12700274 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks [~sershe] for review. If setDbANSIMode() call is moved to somewhere like patch V4. DB query within critical section still can not be avoided as the stack trace shows. This is a problem, do you have any comments?

MetaStoreDirectSql.determineDbType(...)
MetaStoreDirectSql.MetaStoreDirectSql(...)
ObjectStore.initialize(...)
ObjectStore.setConf(â€¦)


DB type detections is actually manually tested agains different backend, works well., The problem otherwise (if it's called outside) is that setting ansi_quotes will happen in some arbitrary transaction, not related to the query.
Why is this call needed there at all (other than is auto-create is on and the methods are called)?

+one small nit in RB,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12700595 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch V5 addressed [~sershe] comments., Hi. What I'm asking is - why is setDbANSIMode necessary during init with these changes? And logging is no longer valid at all since this method is no longer used for verification.

, V6 that removed setDbANSIMode.,
