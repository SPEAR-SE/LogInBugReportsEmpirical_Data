[I remembered that this case is not supported by design and we should throw an error in SemanticAnalyzer. 

In the first dynamic partition insert patch we disabled merge completely because in the case of using HiveInputFormat (eg. in Hadoop 0.17) the partition columns are not passed to the reducer (part of the partition columns exist in the HDFS directory). So the reducer will create one file that may mix data from different partitions. In HIVE-1307 we enabled merge for CombineHiveInputFormat. However we should disable merge for the case of dynamic partition inserts using HiveInputFormat. , Wont it also apply to non-dynamic partitions. 
Won't it apply to all partitions where merge is being performed ?, This is not a problem for non-dynamic partition inserts because the input and output is a single directory/partition. So even if there is only 1 reducer the output will be a correct merge of the input files. In the dynamic partition case, we have to guarantee that a single reducer only takes input from 1 partition. Otherwise the result partition will be mixed with different input partitions. , Talked offline with Ning
