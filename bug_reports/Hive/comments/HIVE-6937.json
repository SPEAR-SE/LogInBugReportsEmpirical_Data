[I also think it'd be great to link directly to the logs in the message we post jira., Yep , I can look into making that enhancement as well., Attaching a fix.  This is a client-side fix only, I'll probably do the enhancement in a separate JIRA as its a server-side fix and probably better to apply one at a time., +1, If I modify the jenkins call now without this change, PTestClient will throw a validation error, so one note, when commited, can you please also add this to the jenkins job?

{noformat}, Or let me know and I can modify it., [~szehon] isn't this just modifying the jenkins job on the jenkins instance you created?

http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/configure, Oh nevermind, I see what you are saying. Yes when we commit we can modify the job. , Thank you Szehon for the contribution! I have committed this to trunk., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
