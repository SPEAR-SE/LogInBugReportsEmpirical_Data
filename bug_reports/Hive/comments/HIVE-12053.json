[[~sseth] have found that creating following indexes would not help to improve the stats performance either
{code}
CREATE INDEX COLNAME_TBLID_IDX ON TAB_COL_STATS (COLUMN_NAME, TBL_ID);
CREATE INDEX COLNAME_IDX ON TAB_COL_STATS (COLUMN_NAME);
CREATE INDEX COLNAME_PARTID_IDX ON PART_COL_STATS (COLUMN_NAME, PART_ID);
CREATE INDEX COLNAME_IDX ON PART_COL_STATS (COLUMN_NAME);
CREATE INDEX PARTNAME_IDX ON PARTITIONS (PART_NAME);
CREATE INDEX TBLNAME_IDX ON TBLS (TBL_NAME);
{code}, Should HIVE-11786 be reverted while this is fixed ? The performance degradation is very noticeable. , [~sseth] I provided a patch reverting HIVE-11786 here, please review it. 
Though separating the big query to two parts like that done in getPartition in MetaStoreDirect may help to mitigate the performance impact in this case, we might have other performance issues with JDO. So probably we can leave these column stats tables unnormalized at this moment as a trade-off to the better performance. Thank you for the help., [~ctang.ma] - the patch looks good to me. It's a direct revert of HIVE-11786. Does another jira need to be created to capture the intent of HIVE-11786, without the normalization ?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12766539 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I was not able to reproduce TestSparkCliDriver test failures in my local machine and they seem not related to this patch. The failures from testTableSchemaPropagation and testSSLVersion are also not related.
[~sseth] AFAIK, there has not been other implementations on top of HIVE-11786 by now. As for HIVE-11788 which depends on the schema normalization in HIVE-11786, it looks like that we have to update the stats tables as well in db/table/partition rename :-), binding +1 :), committed to master, Committed to branch-1., Thanks [~sershe].]
