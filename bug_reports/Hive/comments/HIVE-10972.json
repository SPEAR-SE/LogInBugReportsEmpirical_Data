ATTACHMENT ID: 12738918 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I'm investigating lockneg_try_lock_db_in_use test case failure. Seems related., I think we have another issue in ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.java, in which when locking exclusively on an object we should also check if the children are locked.

The test passed before, is because we always locked the current database before. If we do {{use default; lock table lockneg2.tstsrcpart shared; lock database lockneg2 exclusive;}}, it will allow to do so which is not correct. 

HIVE-10984 has been filed to get it fixed. I will leave the test failure as it is. , [~damien.carol] Can you take a look again and see my following comments?, [~aihuaxu] I left some comments and questions on the RB., I updated the patch to address the comment. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12739244 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~aihuaxu] Could you have a look at and take care of the failed test lockneg_try_lock_db_in_use? I think the test is valid., Yeah. Please see my comments above. 

I think we have another issue in ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.java, in which when locking exclusively on an object we should also check if the children are locked.
The test passed before, is because we always locked the current database before. If we do use default; lock table lockneg2.tstsrcpart shared; lock database lockneg2 exclusive;, it will allow to do so which is not correct.
HIVE-10984 has been filed to get it fixed. I will leave the test failure as it is., Or I can update the test case temporarily to get it passed since HIVE-10984 may not be a quick fix. Then I will re-fix the test with HIVE-10984., Test case updated.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12739314 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The tests are not related., [~alangates]  Seems you worked on the initial version? Can you also take a look at the change to see if it will cause any issue?, Yes, I'll take a look., I don't think this change is right.  I agree that always locking the current database is a bug.  But the way the ZK lock manager works you do need to put a lock on the database if your are locking a table in that db.  (DbTxnManager does not work this way).  So it's fine to take out the code that locks the current db.  But you need to replace it with code that locks the appropriate db.  I don't see that code in the patch., Thanks [~alangates] Actually current code already locks the appropriate db (more accurate: all the parents of the lock object) which is done in getLockObjects() call in DummyTxtManager.java. , [~alangates] Ping. +[~ashutoshc] as well since seems you also have knowledge on that front., Yes, you're right.  I see where it's getting the parent locks.

+1 to committing this patch., Committed to Hive 2.0.0 and 1.3.0. Thanks [~aihuaxu] for the patch and [~alangates] for review.]
