ATTACHMENT ID: 12840486 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, could anyone please give suggestions and review the patch?, hi [~prasanth_j]
I dont know who can review this
could you please give suggestions and review it ?
thanks, cc [~spena][~jxiang][~xuefuz], many thanks, I think the 'amp;' from the this line is incorrect:

echo "download spark error, please retry" >&amp;2, hi [~spena]
Because changed file is pom.xml, '&' is correct.
If "download spark error, please retry" >&2 , mvn will throw errors like 'Non-parseable POM hive/itests/pom.xml: entity reference names can not start with character '2''
thanks, [~ferhui] How often does this error happen? There is another patch with a different approach to download the spark jar, and it won't have this issue anymore (See HIVE-14735), hi [~spena]
spark ball is large, it is related to network health.
When network is in bad condition, Maybe Both approaches fail, The HIVE-14735 approach will have a flag to disable the spark download. Something like -DskipSparkAssemblyDeploy so it might help on network issues too., hi [~spena]
If HIVE-14735 approach will be used, please close this issue.
Thanks.]
