[HIVE-8475-0.13.1.patch - patch for anyone interested in backporting the relevant portion of fix to 0.13 branch. (not for commit)
, HIVE-8475.1.patch - patch with just test case for trunk
, Verified manually that the test passed. I don't think we need to run this patch through the whole test suite, specially with the backlog we have right now.
, +1, [~vikram.dixit] It will be useful to add this test case in 0.14 as well, to make sure there is no regression.
, Patch committed to 0.14 branch and trunk.
Thanks for the review Vaibhav!
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
