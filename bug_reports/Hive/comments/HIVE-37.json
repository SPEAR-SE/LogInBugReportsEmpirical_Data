[The old syntax for doing that was:

    FROM (
        FROM pv_users 
        SELECT TRANSFORM(pv_users.userid, pv_users.date)
        AS(key, value) 
        USING 'map_script' 
        CLUSTER BY key ) map_output 
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE pv_users_reduced
        SELECT TRANSFORM(map_output.key, map_output.value) 
        AS (date, count)
        USING 'reduce_script'; 

We plan to change that to:
    FROM (
        FROM pv_users 
        MAP pv_users.userid, pv_users.date
        USING 'map_script' 
        AS key, value
        CLUSTER BY key
        ) map_output 
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE pv_users_reduced
        REDUCE map_output.key, map_output.value
        USING 'reduce_script'
        AS date, count;


The script is expected to read tab-separated fields, and also generate tab-separated fields.


The major changes are:
•         Schemaless Mapper/Reducer: if there is "AS" we assume "AS key,value" which takes the bytes before the first tab into key, and the rest to value.
•         SELECT TRANSFORM changed to MAP/REDUCE to make it clear what is map and what is reduce.
•         Reordered USING and AS to make it clearer.
*         Support different shuffling/sorting keys by using "DISTRIBUTE BY" and "SORT BY" ("CLUSTER BY key" means "DISTRIBUTE BY key SORT BY key ASC")
, This has already been fixed. Zheng can you confirm., This was committed earlier. Both the new syntax (MAP xxx, REDUCE xxx) and the old syntax (SELECT TRANSFORM(...)) are supported.]
