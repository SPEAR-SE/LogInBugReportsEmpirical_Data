[[~ashutoshc] can you review? Thanks, Couple of comments:
* You can use validator in HiveConf via ConfVars(String varname, Object defaultVal, Validator validator, String description) constructor to force allowed values for a particular config.  This will allow you to get rid of {{isConfigEnabled}} variable and thus simplify a logic bit there.
* This throws exception as soon as datastore is found to be incompatible. If direct sql query is indeed fired but than fails while executing against datastore, we still catch that exception and than falls back to ORM. This patch is not intended to capture that code path, is it?,
