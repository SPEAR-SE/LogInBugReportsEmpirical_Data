[A similar issue could be found in hive on spark: [HIVE-10073 | https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10073], [~edward] I am moving this to the Hive project as this seems like a bug in Hive and not in Tez. , The same issue can be observed on Hive 1.2 with Tez in HDP 2.5. Property hbase.mapred.output.outputtable is set to the name of the destination HBase table.

Hive with MR execution engine works as expected.]
