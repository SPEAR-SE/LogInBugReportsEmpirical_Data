ATTACHMENT ID: 12728004 - PreCommit-HIVE-SPARK-Build, Looks good, but should still set , if new value is null right?, If the new value is null, the set will fail at Configuration#set(String name, String value, String source), which checks to make sure neither name or value to be null., OK thanks.  +1, Integrated into the spark branch. Thanks Szehon for the review.]
