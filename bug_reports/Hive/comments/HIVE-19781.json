[after a few hours of painfull debugging...the following seems to be happening:

* explain analyze rowcounts are appearing and disappearing randomly...
* with a high chance also a few operator id-s are changing sometimes...
* the property being set in the other test doesn't matter; I currently has an empty second qtest....which runs after the EA2, I think the following is happening there is 50-50 chance of using 45 or 46 for the MERGEJOIN operator; and somehow when explain runs it may get the other one..., turned out to be an inconsistency caused by a HashMap in mergework; fixed in 19237]
