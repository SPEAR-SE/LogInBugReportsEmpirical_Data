[khorgath requested code review of "HIVE-3923 [jira] join_filters_overlap.q fails on 0.23".
Reviewers: JIRA

  Adding order-by to tests to fix 0.23 test breakage

  As with some of the other broken tests on 0.23, this is broken because the order of results generated by the query on 0.23 is different from the order in the golden output file. However, there appears to be nothing wrong with the query itself.

  This can be fixed by adding an order-by clause and regenerating the golden file.

TEST PLAN
  Patch attached is a test fix
