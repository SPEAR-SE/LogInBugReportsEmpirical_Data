[Great bug report. 
[~minions] do you want to take a look at this?, This seems related. Posting as a comment, but perhaps it should be in its own bug report.

Order By cannot see fields if they are projected with an alias.

The first two queries fail with:
{code}SemanticException [Error 10004]: line 7:9 Invalid table alias or column reference 'emp_no': (possible column names are: f_4, f_3, f_5){code}
The last two succeed.
{code:SQL}
SELECT `first_name` `F_4`, `last_name` `F_5`
FROM `default`.`employees`
ORDER BY `emp_no` DESC;

SELECT `first_name` `F_4`, `emp_no` `F_3`, `last_name` `F_5`
FROM `default`.`employees`
ORDER BY `emp_no` DESC;

SELECT `first_name` `F_4`, `emp_no`, `last_name` `F_5`

ORDER BY `emp_no` DESC;

ORDER BY `F_3` DESC;
{code}, May be related to HIVE-15160., [~pauljackson123], if possible, could u try Hive master? As this is a new feature in HIVE-15160 targeting version 3.0, I doubt it is available in any published version yet., There is no doubt these are the same issue. What do you think about the simpler issue in my comment that does not involve ORDER BY?, [~pauljackson123], i am sorry but i saw that all of your above cases involve ORDER BY. Which simpler issue do you mean?, [~pauljackson123]:the first two queries run on HDP3, there's probably a fix that went in for this which isn't in hive-2 branch.

{code}, [~pxiong] I'm referring to the four queries in this comment: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18375?focusedCommentId=16312051&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16312051, [~pauljackson123], i see. But all of the 4 queries involve ORDER BY if "involve" means we have ORDER BY in the query text. For those queries, they should be runnable on current Hive master as it contains HIVE-15160, which enables "order by non-selected column". The reason why you can not run that on your cluster is because  HIVE-15160 is not in any release (including what you are using) yet. I think you may need to wait until the next release that include this patch. Thanks.]
