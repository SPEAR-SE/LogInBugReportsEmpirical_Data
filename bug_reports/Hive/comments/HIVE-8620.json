[I have a fix that needs some testing..., add some more verbose logging, and fix the case where Hive adds the same thing twice,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12677470 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The patch is no good... it causes queries that CBO cannot handle to lose columns again, because they add same column twice because it is mentioned twice and it now works. I will look at another fix... probably the best long term fix is to exterminate the horror that is RowResolver and write something sane instead, where duplicates would never be allowed so there will be no programming-by-coincidence ambiguity, updated patch. Order changed in some tests, select_same_col needs HIVE-8635 to wotk; that is temporarily included in this patch, +1 pending tests, +1 for hive .14,
