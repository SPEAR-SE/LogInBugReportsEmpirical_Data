, [~ashutoshc] can you take a look? Thanks, We need bit more testing here. Will it be easy for you to setup postgres and run all the unit tests with metastore pointing to postgres instead of derby. Just modifying data/conf/hive-site.xml to point to postgres should do the trick., I verified manually it works against postgres manually. The tests fail due to verifyingstore by default, if it is removed the fallback now works correctly (as it used to before rollback/open was removed). Let me run normal tests to make sure it doesn't break anything else., 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass

, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Sergey!, Can you put it in 12? without it, Postgres metastore is broken by default in 12, the setting for Direct SQL needs to be disabled manually., [~thejas] is release manager for 0.12 So, I will request him for inclusion.
Thejas, I recommend putting this in 0.12. , FAILURE: Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2-ptest #96 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2-ptest/96/])
