cc [~thejas], [~vgumashta] Can you also add a test case for this ?
, The reason SeparatedValuesOutputFormat wrapping the output records with a double quotes is that it treats the complex structure as one record which contains a double quotes. And this patch may still wrap the result with single quote instead., [~vgumashta] It looks like this reverses the CSV change to use double quotes (done in HIVE-7390 ). Can you confirm ?
, Created HIVE-8615 to address the general issue of incompatible changes in csv and tsv formats.
, Resolving this as HIVE-8615 supersedes this.]
