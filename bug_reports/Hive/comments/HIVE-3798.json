[[~jghoman], could you please try again against HIVE 0.14? It seems that it works now.

hive> show tables;
OK
comment
lineitem
src
src1
srcpart
Time taken: 0.023 seconds, Fetched: 5 row(s)
hive> describe `comment`;
OK
key                 	string
value               	string
Time taken: 0.051 seconds, Fetched: 2 row(s), I don't currently have an Hive 0.14 install to test this, but happy it's fixed.  Thanks.]
