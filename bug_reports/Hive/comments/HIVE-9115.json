ATTACHMENT ID: 12687365 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Hmm, not sure why any of these failures would be related. The last 3 do not seem to be as they were failing in previous unit test runs. udaf_covar_pop.q is a new failure, will run locally to see if there is any issue., Some discussion from [~stevel@apache.org] on HADOOP-11411, about concerns this will cause Hive to fail at runtime when running on Hadoop-2.7.  If so, then this fix may also be a candidate to add to 0.14 branch.

Does this mean that at run time, older versions of Hive will not run against Hadoop 2.7?
Jason Dere added a comment - 1 hour ago
No, this just means that Hive will not compile against Hadoop 2.7. Run time should work on older versions.

looking at the patch, there's enough referencing of the Hadoop class that there may be some link problems
{quote}, +1 for 0.14, though I was thinking more of "revert that hadoop change from branch-2". We're looking at a minimal 2.7 release before the end of the month ("first Java 7+ only") release, and don't want any regressions from hadoop 2.6. this would be one., Tried udaf_covar_pop.q on mac/linux and it passed locally for me, I don't think the test failure is related to this patch. Re-uploading patch to see how tests look on a second run.,
