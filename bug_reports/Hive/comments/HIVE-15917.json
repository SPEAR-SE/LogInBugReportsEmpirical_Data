ATTACHMENT ID: 12852644 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Test failures are unrelated... spark tests have some RPC issues, I'm not sure when this gets invoked in Hive. e.g. If a query is submitted, and there's no session available, will this get invoked up front, or only after a session is obtained.
If it is after a session is obtained, then mostly looks good.
May want to cap the timeOutMs to some value instead of shifting it each time - (will go -ve at some point, and to a really large value before that). This is in case someone decides to change the timeout in the future., [~sseth] it's invoked when you run queries ;) what do you mean exactly by when. There is a session at that time.
Also the time is capped by max timeout, which is 30sec., +1. Discussed offline, this is while a query is running., cc [~anishek] , Committed to master after fixing a couple typos. Thanks for the review!]
