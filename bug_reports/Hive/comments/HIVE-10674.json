    HIVE-10674 : HIVE-9302 introduces 2 jars in the source control repo (Sushanth Sowmyan) (part 1/2 - required to be Apache release compatible)
{noformat}, Also, noting 2 more jars : ql/src/test/resources/SessionStateTest.jar.v1 and ql/src/test/resources/SessionStateTest.jar.v1, both of which also do not have sources attached, and are committed as binraries. For branch-1.2, I am going to go ahead and git rm them, and this jira can track putting them back in as a result of a compilation., One more commit to branch-1.2 alone:

    HIVE-10674 : jars should not be checked in to the source control repo (Sushanth Sowmyan) (part 2/3 - required to be Apache release compatible)
{noformat}
, Is there any workaround to pass through the failure and go ahead to build?

Thanks., This failures should only be related to unit test. You can go skipping them via "-DskipTests"., This jira rolled back HIVE-9302. [~Ferd] has fixed the core test issue with HIVE-10684. Marking this as closed.]
