[bq. The rewrite is not applied today and the current PK-FK relationship does not allow for a nullable relationship (i.e a declared Foreign Key can't be NULL).
So the rewrite for HIVE would be {code:sql} select ss_customer_sk as c_customer_sk,sum(ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) ssales from store_sales group by ss_customer_sk; {code}?]
