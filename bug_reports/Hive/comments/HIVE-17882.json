[cc/ [~harishjp] [~sershe], Thanks [~prasanth_j]. I'll fix that, I do not think its swapped. But status which is a string is displaying an integer, possible after the move to enums.

Please use "SELECT * FROM SYS.WM_RESOURCEPLANS" for now., Yes, the status and query_parallelism is swapped in TextMetaDataFormatter, I think the tests were using JsonMetaDataFormatter. Not sure how status is null thought and if its null, it should throw an NPE not sure how that works., Fixed ordering b/w status and query_parallelism., +1,
