, The second column value 'null' actually is correct since we escape newline, carriage return and tab so the text from the script is considered to be the first column.

The output is as following without sorting.
{noformat}
1
2       NULL
2       NULL
1       2       NULL
1
2       NULL
2       NULL
1       2       NULL
{noformat}]
