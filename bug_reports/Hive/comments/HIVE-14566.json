[[~sershe]/[~gopalv] Can someone please review this patch?, One comment on RB, What is causing the issue ? I see you are fixing by passing the timezone, but I assume this 1 sec difference is not caused by difference in timezone across machines or so.
, The issue is actually not 1 second difference. It happened to be the case in the test case (data/files/alltypesorc3xcols file was written with different timezone). The actual issue is, llap reader was not making timezone adjustments when reading timestamp columns causing difference in results. The non-llap reader used to make the timezone adjustments during start of stripe. This was missing for llap https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/orc/src/java/org/apache/orc/impl/TreeReaderFactory.java#L870

Each stripe in orc maintains the timezone that was used by the writer. The reader reads the timestamp values using reader's timezone and by knowing the writer's timezone information from the stripe footer, the reader will make offset adjustments to read timestamp correctly. , Addressed [~sershe]'s review comments., I really think that we need to make a context object for passing information down to the tree reader. Otherwise, we are going to get killed by adding parameters to this, especially when ORC makes it out of Hive.

How about something like:

{code}
public interface Context {
  SchemaEvolution getEvolution();
  boolean skipCorrupt();
  String writerTimezone();
}

public static TreeReader createTreeReader(TypeDescription readerType,
                                                                      Context context) throws IOException {
{code}

Then we can add new information without making sure a huge change that touches all of the methods., Added a junit test., +1 pending tests,
