This would have more impact when data is stored in cloud (e.g s3) where split generation could run for minutes together in single threaded approach (e.g TPC-H q1 at 1 TB scale)., +1. nit - no need to revisit when the metastore cache work is complete... for that, as long as its async when PPD is enabled it should be ok. I was assuming threadpool overhead would normally not be needed. So maybe it should always be true, or configurable between the old condition and always true.,
