[If the partition does not exist, we should fail the query.
Can you add a negative test instead?
, np. i can add that. But it seems many other commands just output error msg and succeed, like 'describe'., hive-1072.2.patch fails query when the given partition does not exist., +1. Will commit after test.
, Committed. Thanks Yongqiang., Zheng and Yongqiang, one test result file was missing for the committed version to branch 0.5.0: ql/src/test/results/clientnegative/invalide_t_alter1.q.out. Can you double check and commit it?, Ning, sorry about that. I just committed it to branch-0.5 under HIVE-1059.]
