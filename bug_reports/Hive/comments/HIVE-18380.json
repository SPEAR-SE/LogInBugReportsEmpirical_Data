[[~ekoifman] [~steveyeom2017] should it be? Alter table concatenate that preserves txn boundaries (i.e. concats files in each directory separately) would generally be pointless, and destroying txn boundaries to combine directories is basically a compaction and should be done by compactor, as far as I understand, I think concatenating/compacting contiguous deltas should be possible - there is no technical reason it can't be., Immediate concatenation(probably using the similar logic of compaction) necessity use case may require "ALTER TABLE CONCANTENATE", 
which can be run as a batch operation, again, with the similar logic. , fixed as part of HIVE-18288, This jira is resolved and released with Hive 3.0 If you find an issue with it, please create a new jira.]
