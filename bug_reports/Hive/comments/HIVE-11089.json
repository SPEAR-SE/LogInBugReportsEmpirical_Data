[HIVE-8427 introduces a change that causes incorrect behavior when using a proxy user with HiveEndPoint.newConnection(), Additionally, it seems that the Hive docs https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Streaming+Data+Ingest reflect the HiveEndPoint API prior to HIVE-8427 which does allow for specifying a proxy user., [~roshan_naik] [~alangates] - any thoughts here?, 
- That 'proxyUser' string argument was a parameter to a private method prior to kerberos support. it was never exposed externally and always set to null internally. At the time the thought was to support proxying but it never got fully tested. So I think i pulled it from the public interface very late in the dev cycle and did not reflect that in the wiki. I just updated the wiki.

- With introduction of kerberos support, the internal 'proxyUser' was dropped, and UGI based 'authenticatedUser' argument  was exposed publicly ... in a new overload for newConnection(). So to acquire connection as a user other than process user, kerberos will be needed.

- Wiki has a secure/kerberos example at the bottom. that should work.  API reference is in the Java Docs http://hive.apache.org/javadocs/r1.2.1/api/.   References to proxyUser in the javadocs need to be fixed., Hi [~roshan_naik],

I think the issue is that the code by using {{hasKerberosCredentials}} assumes kerberos for security. However that method will never return true when a user is a authenticated by a delegation token or when the user is real user is authenticated by kerberos, but the current UGI is a proxy user.

Brock, Had discussion with [~roshan_naik]. Looks like we didn't have proxy support for Hive streaming from day 1. As Roshan pointed out earlier, the "proxyuser" param was in a private method and was always null. The plan was to support proxy and that didn't happen (so the wiki was also updated).

If proxying is needed, this will be a new feature request. So I will close this ticket as invalid.]
