[[~sershe] - can you please take a look., Hmm.. For the the acls/user case, is it valid to use single session for all the restarts? If yes +1, Don't think the pool works when doAs is set to true?
This is also equivalent to how all the initial sessions are created, so I think it is safe., Updated patch. The SessionState only becomes available while starting the SessionPool. ,
