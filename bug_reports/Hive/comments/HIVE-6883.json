[The fix is small. I added more tests to verify sort by and order by cases. Also replicated the tests for vectorization and tez., Review Board is flaky.. will upload the patch once it is back.., [~rhbutani] this is a critical issue as HIVE-6455 fails to honor sort order in DDL.. Will it be possible to include this in 0.13?, Attaching RB link, I going to say, let's keep this off 0.13
The user can turn of the dyn partition optimization in the case of sort/order, Thanks. No problem. I will change the fix version then. And yes the user can turn off this optimization., orc_analyze.q test was failing in hadoop-2. Due to inconsistency in between hadoop-1 and hadoop-2 added order by to the test cases., +1 LGTM, +1 for 0.13,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12639717, The tests are not related., committed to trunk, [~sushanth] fyi.. attaching patch for branch-0.13., Thanks for the update, Prashant, I'll test it now., Thanks, Prashant, this merges correctly., This jira has been fixed as part of 0.13.1 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.
, @ [~prasanth_j] , this fix cause some problems when combine dynamic partitioning with group by. Consider the following case:
{code}
CREATE TABLE `t1`(  `a` int,`b` string) PARTITIONED BY (`dt` string);
create table src1 (
  `key` string,
  `val` string
);
explain insert overwrite table t1 partition(dt) select 1, "hello", "20140901" from src1 group by key;
{code}
The key expressions of RS in Stage-2 are wrong. The part of the patch which using the parent RS's keyCols needs more changes.
{code}
 if (parentRSOpOrder != null && !parentRSOpOrder.isEmpty() && sortPositions.isEmpty()) {
          newKeyCols.addAll(parentRSOp.getConf().getKeyCols());
          orderStr += parentRSOpOrder;
        }
{code}

, [~wzc1989] Thanks for reporting the issue. I will look at it and will post back a fix in a new jira., [~wzc1989] HIVE-8162 has fix for the issue., @ [~prasanth_j] , thank you for the fix:), [~wzc1989] The fix needs more revision wrt subqueries. Currently it doesn't preserve the ordering of records if any subqueries has order by. I am working on it and will post an update to that fix.]
