[Looks like it should be possible to support by adding {{'-'}} to the list on this line:
https://github.com/prongs/apache-hive/blob/master/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/typeinfo/TypeInfoUtils.java#L280

Any side effects of doing that?
cc [~prasanth_j], We are facing the same issue. Is there any progress / discussion going on?

Do you expect side-effects when allowing '-' ?

Thanks in advance for details.]
