[I put a break fix into place for this but we should make the change and commit this so we don't regress.

[~szehon] mentioned he was potentially interested in this., Removed cp task from the batch-exec.vm template, also fixed the unit tests.

Tested manually on my own cluster, and ran existing unit tests.  Let me know if more needs to be done., Looks great! 

Can we also stop publishing the variables numOfFailedTests and maxSourceDirs to the template?, Sure, no longer publishing those variables., Adding link to RB, Thank you Szehon! I have committed this to trunk!!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
