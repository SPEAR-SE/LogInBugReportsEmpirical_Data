[Is that not already fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-13463?, [~zyork] it seems that HIVE-13463 fixes issues when trying to import across filesystems, but in order for an export / import command to run against a filesystem, the scheme of the filesystem uri must be in the list {{hive.exim.uri.scheme.whitelist}} - currently there are no S3 schemes in that list.

At least, the following query fails:

{code}
export table src to '${hiveconf:test.blobstore.path.unique}/exim/src';
{code}

with the following exception:

{code}
org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.SemanticException: Invalid path only the following file systems accepted for export/import : hdfs,pfile,file

{code}, So you want to add this to the list by default? You can manually set hive.exim.uri.scheme.whitelist=hdfs,pfile,file,s3,s3a,s3n.

If you add s3a, can you also add s3 and s3n?, Yes, add them by default, and add qtests for them to the {{hive-blobstore}} module. Sure, will add s3 and s3n too., Hey [~stakiar], I've actually been working on import/export tests for blobstore, just created HIVE-15867 to track

Suggest we make this JIRA dependent on that one, Hey [~poeppt], sounds good. I haven't done much for writing the qtests yet, just started today. So if you have been working on this, that sounds good to me. I will make this JIRA dependent on HIVE-15867.

For reference, this is what I wrote earlier today:

{code}
create table hdfs_src (col1 int, col2 int, col3 int);
insert into table hdfs_src values (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9);

create table blobstore_src location '${hiveconf:test.blobstore.path.unique}/exim/blobstore_src' as select * from hdfs_src;

-- Test export HDFS to blobstore, and then import blobstore to HDFS

export table hdfs_src to '${hiveconf:test.blobstore.path.unique}/exim/export_from_hdfs';
import table imported_from_hdfs from '${hiveconf:test.blobstore.path.unique}/exim/export_from_hdfs';
select * from imported_from_hdfs;

-- Test export blobstore to blobstore, and then import blobstore to blobstore

export table blobstore_src to '${hiveconf:test.blobstore.path.unique}/exim/export_from_blobstore';
import table imported_from_blobstore from '${hiveconf:test.blobstore.path.unique}/exim/export_from_blobstore'; 
select * from imported_from_blobstore;

-- Test export blobstore to HDFS, and then import HDFS to blobstore

export table blobstore_src to '${hiveconf:hive.metastore.warehouse.dir}/export_from_blobstore';
import table imported_from_hdfs from '${hiveconf:hive.metastore.warehouse.dir}/blobstore_src_hdfs' location '${hiveconf:test.blobstore.path.unique}/exim/imported_from_hdfs';
select * from imported_from_hdfs;
{code}, The way that we will likely be doing this is with multiple different tests -- one for each of these cases. But in essence, that's what we have as well :), Hi [~stakiar], do you plan to add ADLS scheme {{adl}} to the whitelist in this JIRA or file a new JIRA?, [~jzhuge] yes I can {{adl}} to the whitelist, can you help in testing it against a real adls cluster? The tests Thomas is writing in HIVE-15867 can be run against ADLS - see {{itests/hive-blobstore/README}} for directions., With [~stakiar]'s help, I was able to run {{hive-blobstore}} itests on ADLS after adding {{adl}} to the whitelist. The itests eventually failed at other places, we will file a separate JIRA., This was done in HIVE-15867 - closing this JIRA. ADLS support will be done in a separate JIRA.]
