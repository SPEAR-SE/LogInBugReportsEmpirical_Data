[Note that it is not recommended that user whose access is being secured using SQL standards based auth is given direct access to metastore. With that practice in place, such users cannot act maliciously to change access control policy without authorization., HIVE-7209.1.patch - Has changes to allow for multiple authorizers to be registered for metastore authorization. 
Also includes a new authorizer org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.MetaStoreAuthzAPIAuthorizerEmbedOnly that can be added to the hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager config parameter. It will disallow any metastore api calls in remote metastore mode. If you use HS2 with embedded metastore, the HS2 can make these api calls, as the authorizer disables the calls only in remote mode.

This approach can be extended in followup work to allow the api calls to be made to remote metastore by only certain users from certain machines.
, adding review board link, HIVE-7209.2.patch - Addressing Ashutosh's suggestion of avoiding an additional interface.
, +1, HIVE-7209.3.patch - addressing Sushanth's comment - moving the wrapped table/partition creation outside of loop.
, Looks good to me. +1., HIVE-7209.4.patch - also updating hive-default.xml.template to mention that more than one metastore authorization manager classes can be specified under  hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager .

ATTACHMENT ID: 12650378, Committed patch 4. Thanks for the patch, Thejas!, (Reopening because of the weird resolution state, intend to close again), For the record:  The patch changes the description of *hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager* in hive-default.xml.template (see the release note for new functionality).

I added a comment to HIVE-6586 so it won't get lost in the shuffle when HIVE-6037 changes HiveConf.java., Doc notes:  The description of *hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager* needs to be updated in the wiki (with version information, and keeping some extra information not found in HiveConf.java).

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager]

Other than that, HIVE-7759 will add general documentation for this feature with a section in the SQL standard authorization doc about CLI behavior with SQL standard authorization turned on.

* [SQL Standard Based Hive Authorization | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, Doc:  *hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager* has been updated in the wiki, so I'm removing the TODOC14 label.  (Additional documentation will be covered with HIVE-7759, as mentioned two comments back.)
