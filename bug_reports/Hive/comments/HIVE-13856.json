[HIVE-13856.patch - preliminary patch, [~ekoifman], what is the status on this one? I plan to create the first 2.1.0 RC tomorrow and this is marked as Blocker. Should it go in and can it be deferred as it seems to only affect Metastore using OracleDB? Thanks, [~jcamachorodriguez], no it cannot be deferred.  Oracle is a supported DB type - hence a blocker., test result (age =1)
