found inside the standalone.jar, Potential patch, can someone review? The problem here existed from HIVE-538 which had the change to produce the artifact. HIVE-8126 was just to include it in the lib directory of distribution. The issue is that there the uber jar was built from classes from some signed jars and those two additional files (META-INF/DUMMY.SF, META-INF/DUMMY.DSA) were picked up from one of those. We need to explicitly exclude them and that is what the patch intends to do., Uploading a new one that works reliably., Uploading a new one that works reliably., I wonder if this bug is only present in CBO branch.
Because I use trunk and I have not this bug BUT when I'm using CBO branch Metastore/hiveserver2 or beeline throw this error.,
