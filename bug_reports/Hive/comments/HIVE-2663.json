[In the below case nulll check is not needed and this will make the code complicated and looks bugy like 

if (element == null && nullProtocol != null) {

here if element = null and nullProtocol = null the else block will be executed with element = null.

So we can remove the check nullProtocol != null., Please open new jira, still it is a problem on master.]
