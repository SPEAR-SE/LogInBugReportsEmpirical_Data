ATTACHMENT ID: 12660301, +1, Committed to trunk, Are there plans to commit this to branch-2?, Just realized that branch-2 is a hadoop branch., Does this need any user/admin documentation?

Also, shouldn't it be marked as Fix Version 0.14.0?, Thanks for catching that Lefty, need to set the fix version.
This could use some doc., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, Doc note:  [~jdere] documented this in the wiki, so I removed the TODOC14 label.  Thanks, Jason.
