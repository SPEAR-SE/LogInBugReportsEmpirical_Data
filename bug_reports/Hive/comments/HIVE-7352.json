ATTACHMENT ID: 12654441, I wonder if this will adversely affect {{MetadataonlyOptimizer}} since it may than launch many tasks for job, instead of just one. Currently, that optimization, removes all input paths from plan and put OneRowNullIF. Now, since this IF can now generate many splits, it may launch as many tasks, instead of 1. Since, paths from conf object wasnt removed. Can you test that?
Also, .q file is missing in patch., Hope it's ok to butt in [~navis]. This is another way of fixing it. I basically fall back to client-side split gen and combine file input format when the table scan is a dummy scan., https://reviews.apache.org/r/25138/, Ah, I've forgot this. [~hagleitn], you are welcome to take over., +1,
