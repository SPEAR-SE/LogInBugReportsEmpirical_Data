ATTACHMENT ID: 12884370 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, * org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniTezCliDriver.testCliDriver[explainanalyze_2] : runs fine on local machine
* org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestSparkCliDriver.org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestSparkCliDriver  : seems to be a local environment problem, on local machine it takes for ever to run, running for about 20 mins now and no errors, stopped it since on the test environment it failed pretty fast.

Other tests are failures from older builds., GitHub user anishek opened a pull request:
