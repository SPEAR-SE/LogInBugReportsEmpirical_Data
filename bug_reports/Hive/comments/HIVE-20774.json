[Master patch. The change looks too simple and logical to actually be a real Hive services fix... but it looks like it should work from the examination of the code. We'll see if any tests break.
[~thejas] can you take a look ;)

I might create a separate patch for branch-1 where the fix might be more involved., Actually, nm, this just undoes HIVE-19432. I'm not sure what the logic behind HIVE-19432 though, with many DBs 100s of separate calls would seemingly be much slower than one call. We need to see how this would affect the original case for HIVE-19432]
