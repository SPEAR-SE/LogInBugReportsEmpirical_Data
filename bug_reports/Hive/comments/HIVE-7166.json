[I looked at this issue. It seems that vectorization cannot be performed trivially for the above example because constant folding  is supported only for unary expressions as of now in vectorization. Once HIVE-5771 is committed, this query can be vectorized. The current fix is to disable vectorization in such a scenario so that we fall back to row-mode.

cc-ing [~jnp] and [~ehans] for reviewing the patch.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12648574, The patch looks ok as an interim fix so that results are correct. However, another jira should be filed to handle any expression in a between clause in vector mode.

+1, Create HIVE-7260 as follow up jira.

Thanks
Hari, [~jnp] Can you please commit this jira or review HIVE-7260 which improves this fix. Vectorization in hive with between operator is essentially broken if either of this does not get committed.

Thanks
Hari, cc-ing [~mmccline] . I am not sure if this issue happens with the latest Hive. It will be great if you take a look at it and close if this is no longer a issue. HIVE-7260 is the follow up jira for this. These 2 jiras : HIVE-7166 and HIVE-7260 have been open for ages with review pending status.

Thanks
Hari
, I am unassigning this jira from myself since there has been no response from anyone and I am no longer 100% up-to-date with vectorization code path., [~mmccline] Since this is a correctness issue can you take a look at see if it still exists on master ?]
