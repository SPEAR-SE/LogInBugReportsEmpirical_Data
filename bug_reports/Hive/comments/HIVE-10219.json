[Hmm... this is interesting. Do you think we should not clear HT at all and rely on GC? Is there any way to get notification of eviction from object cache?
Right now as I see it MapJoinOperator would clear HT after every run, so no sharing would work. I've no idea how it even works for some cases as it is, Fixed in branch by making clear a no-op for now (discardData method used for Hybrid case)]
