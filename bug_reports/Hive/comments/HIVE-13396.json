ATTACHMENT ID: 12796208 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sseth]/[~sershe] Can someone please review this patch?, +1. Who'd create the file from the template? Should there be a default file?, User :) If they want the metrics to be dumped out somewhere. Ambari will also generate this file in hive/conf directory which should be included in slider package. Hence this patch. 
We don't have any default sink so I did not add default file. Our default is JMX which should be available thro' web service., Committed to master., Needed for 2.0.1?, Committed to branch-2.0]
