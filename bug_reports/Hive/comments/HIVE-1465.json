[yeah - i am a little confused by this too. for many hive variables - when i try to print them out using 'set' command - i see the unexpanded variable. yet - when hadoop uses those same variables (typically path settings) - the variable is expanded out. i am guessing we are not using the right interface call to get these variables in hive code., I think that the current behavior of 'set' is actually correct. In my opinion you want to be able to see the actual value of the property pre-evaluation, though I do think it makes sense to add a switch to 'set' that allows you to force property substitution.
, Filed HIVE-1474 to track the force substitution enhancement to the 'set' command., Review request: https://reviews.apache.org/r/373/
, Can someone please review this? It's a simple one-line fix (calling conf.get() to force variable substitution for metastore properties).
Thanks!, Upgrading to blocker for 0.7.0., +1.  Will commit if tests pass.
, Committed.  Thanks Carl!
