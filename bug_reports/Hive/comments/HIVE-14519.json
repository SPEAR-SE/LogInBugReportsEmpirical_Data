[The issue is related to constant propagation optimizer, after
set hive.optimize.constant.propagation=false;
The query works fine.

The constant optimizer makes where 1=2 a filter always return false, which trigger WhereFalseProcessor in NullScanOptimizer.
The WhereFalseProcessor checks the filter's ancestors, if there is an TableScanOperator, change the TableScanOperator to
read MetadataOnly. Reading only metadata means no rows will be fetched, it works fine if the TableScanOperator only works with
the filter always returns false (where 1=2). But in the multi insert case, this TableScanOperator also an ancestor for two other operators:
filter( key = 100) and a filesinkoperator. No rows returned in the TableScanOperator causes issues to the other two inserts.

Fix it by do not use the NullScanOptimizer when the false filter has peers. , Need code review.,
