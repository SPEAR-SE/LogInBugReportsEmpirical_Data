[Shouldn't "(skip = in.skip(count - skipped)) != 0" prevent it?, [~sershe] Sorry about the confusion. Actually, when the InputStream is corrupted, skip function returns -1 instead of 0, causing the infinite loop., [~sershe] Actually it is a duplicated issue. Same as [HIVE-18219|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18219]]
