[Could you post the environment and the query that you run? I assume that this follows the standard practice when we pass conf. Another example is for quotedId in HiveLexer.g. cc'ing [~jpullokkaran]
{code}
public void setHiveConf(Configuration hiveConf) {
    this.hiveConf = hiveConf;
  }
  
  protected boolean allowQuotedId() {
    String supportedQIds = HiveConf.getVar(hiveConf, HiveConf.ConfVars.HIVE_QUOTEDID_SUPPORT);
    return !"none".equals(supportedQIds);
  }
{code}, We are calling hive in a proprietary setup, the query that passed on hive is:

{code:SQL}
CREATE TABLE Foo_Schema.TYPE  (
        TYPE int,
        ROW int
      )
      ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe'
      STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat' OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'
{code}

I can see the flow in ParserDriver.java, we call
{code:Java}
public ASTNode parse(String command) throws ParseException {
return parse(command, null);
}
{code}, the context is null. Which will result hiveConf to be not set in
{code:Java}
public ASTNode parse(String command, Context ctx, boolean setTokenRewriteStream) {}
{code} which propagate to HiveParser and throw a NullPointerException., I see that you are leveraging HiveParser only. I attached a patch for you. If you leverage HiveLexer in the future, you will have a similar issue.,
