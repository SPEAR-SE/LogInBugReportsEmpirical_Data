[Looks like common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/conf/HiveConf.java already has safe regex for hive.log.* so should work without any issues., I revised the description of *hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist* to cover this.

* [hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist]]
