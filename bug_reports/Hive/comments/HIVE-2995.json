[builtins and pdk test failure on branch-0.9:

{noformat}
/Users/carl/Work/repos/hive3/build.xml:321: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/Users/carl/Work/repos/hive3/builtins/build.xml:45: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/Users/carl/Work/repos/hive3/pdk/scripts/build-plugin.xml:122: The <classpath> for <junit> must include junit.jar if not in Ant's own classpath
{noformat}

This error was introduced by HIVE-2970 which removed a bunch of JARs from Hive's lib directory, including the junit jar. On trunk this problem was masked by the subsequent commit of HIVE-2646, but on branch-0.9 it's still an issue.
, This failure can be easily reproduced on branch-0.9 by applying the following patch, and then running 'ant clean package test':

{noformat}, Since, we want HIVE-2646 on 0.9 also, lets do that. As per Carl's comments, this problem will go away but we may have to redo some bits of HIVE-2970 again.]
