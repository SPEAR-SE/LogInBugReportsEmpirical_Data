ATTACHMENT ID: 12696902 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 - Confirmed that the change does not affect any encodings on disk. 

During testing, I merged HIVE-9188 + -Pprotobuf to regenerate generated code - that's probably necessary now that JIRA is in.

/cc: [~prasanth_j], Rebased to trunk (minus the autogen code) for application to other branches., I committed this. Thanks for the review, Gopal!, Does this need documentation?, Ping ... any doc needed?, [~leftylev] Not required as this is not user facing., Thanks Prasanth.]
