This behavior is really confusing and makes it hard to comment my SQL.

I see the same behavior when running HiveQL commands on Google DataProc using their web service APIs., Yes, +1 for fixing this too! Super annoying and confusing.Â , +1 for fixing this!, This particular scenario is already fixed in Hive 3.0  by HIVE-16935. 
{code:sql} 
-e "
