[Hmm. Aren't implementations allowed to have their own reserved keywords? I suspect all the RDBMS-es have some., We are moving towards SQL2011 standard compliance.  Those keywords conflict with SQL2011 standard.
, agreed.. closer to standard, better it is., [~ashutoshc] or [~sershe], could u take a quick look? Thanks.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12839090 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1, pushed to master. Thanks [~ashutoshc] for the review., Doc note:  The table of keywords needs to be updated in the DDL doc.  DAYOFWEEK and VIEWS were added in 2.2.0 so they just need to be deleted from the 2.2.0 row, but CACHE was added in 2.1.0 so a "removed" line needs to be added to the 2.2.0 row.
