[Would HIVE-9252 fix this?, HIVE-9252 uses a permanent way to register jar to a table at create time, therefore after create table in the way proposed in HIVE-9252, there is no need to use add jar command. So, the two jiras are different, but both will solve metastore's problem. 
, The root problem is that the path set by add jar only visible in HS2 client session, can not be seen by metastore server. My approach will
be passing the path throw HiveConfs. 
1. Get add jar path infor in HiveSessionImpl and add to MetaStoreClient's HiveConfs, to support this, I will add one method in
IMetaStoreClient to set the HiveConf property: hive.added.jars.path
2. MetaStoreClient will call HiveMetaStore methods with pass-in param environment_context(the context has the jar path info). To support
this, add two new methods in hive_metastore.thrift: get_fields_with_environment_context, get_schema_with_environment_context
3. The new MetaStore method will use the pass-in path infor to add the jar path to the classloader and clean it up before method return.

, manually tested and need code review. ,
