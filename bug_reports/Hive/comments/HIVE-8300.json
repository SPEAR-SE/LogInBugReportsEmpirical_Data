[I guess we need to revert this commented line here: https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/spark/ql/pom.xml#L601 as it was only there because spark had it's own version of guava. See trunk here: https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/pom.xml#L632, Thanks, Brock. I verified locally that the attached patch fixed the issue in Spark standalone mode.,
