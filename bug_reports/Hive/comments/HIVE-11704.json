Could a branch commit error be fixed when the branch gets merged to master, or is that asking too much?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12753413 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The next time they rebase the llap branch, they should fix it. Rebasing effectively edits the history and thus it doesn't cost anything to make the change at that point., I just committed this. Thanks for the review, Lefty., Doc note:  This should be documented in How To Commit, so I added a TODOC2.0 label.  (Also, the whole Commit section needs to be updated for git.)
