[Another case of Insert-Into-Select acting like overwrite.

This case DOES NOT work:

INSERT INTO TABLE marketing.omniture PARTITION( p_country, p_date, p_hour) 
SELECT *,hash(INPUT__FILE__NAME), country, SUBSTR(date_time,1,10), SUBSTR(date_time,12,2) FROM marketing.ingest;

This case works:

use marketing;
INSERT INTO TABLE omniture PARTITION( p_country, p_date, p_hour) 
SELECT *,hash(INPUT__FILE__NAME), country, SUBSTR(date_time,1,10), SUBSTR(date_time,12,2) FROM ingest;


Conclusion:
Table names must be simple and lower case ONLY., [~lagomorph] It's fixed by HIVE-3465. Could you check that?, [~navis] It appears this was a regression I'm currently on version 1.1.0 and can still reproduce this issue on both partitioned and non-partitioned tables. Issuing a `USE database;` then using non database prefixed table names works.]
