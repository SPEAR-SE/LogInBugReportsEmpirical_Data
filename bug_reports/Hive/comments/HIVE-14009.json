[[~ekoifman] fyi, why would there be parallel threads creating the same DB?
I thought UTs are supposed to run sequentially (on a given machine), No idea. , [~spena] could you comment?, That's weird. TestEncryptdHDFSCliDriver is just a clone of TestCliDriver that prepares encryption during the tests. But all tests are run sequentially as other tests do.

I found there is one test that runs queries in parallel, I don't know if it has something to do with this. Test is {{TestMTQueries}}]
