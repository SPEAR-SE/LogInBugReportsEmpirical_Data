Review request for hive and Amareshwari Sriramadasu.


Summary
-------

This patch does two things:

* Fixes the eclipse project generation code by including mockito
  on the classpath

* Updates the HiveCli launch configuration template so that the
  metastore JAR is no longer on the classpath, and also moves the
  hive-exec JAR to the end of the classpath. This was done in
  order to give preference on the classpath to local changes,
  which up to this point have been obscured by hive-exec and
  hive-metastore JAR files located in the build directory. Note
  that in order to run the HiveCLI launchtemplate you now need to
  have the Datanucleus Eclipse Plugin installed, and
  must "enhance" the project.


This addresses bug HIVE-2412.
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2412


Diffs
-----

  eclipse-templates/.classpath b59b343

Diff: https://reviews.apache.org/r/1665/diff


Testing
-------

Verified that project generation and import works. Also verified that HiveCLI launch template works.


Thanks,

Carl
