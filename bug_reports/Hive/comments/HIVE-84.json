[I think each thread here needs a separate Hive db since each thread will have its own database session (transaction). Metastore Client (s0 Hive.java) is never intended to be thread-safe. I am not sure how the problem went away in HIVE-77.

, in the patch, Hive.java maintains metastore client in tss which makes it thread safe. Also it provides a new function to refresh the HiveConf. , Do you still need the needsRefresh code in SessionState.java

Also why just check for the refresh stuff only for MetaVars and why not do it for all the vars? Why the special case?
, I don't think needsRefresh code is needed in SessionState.java

I think only these variables are needed to check whether connection to metadata server is needs to reset. But would it be safe to change conf to whatever passed in through Hive.get() function and refresh only when meta vars change?, ok, i take back my previous comment about needsRefresh code not being needed in SessionState.java. That is the only place where a copy of the current metastore options stored. So even if HiveConf object is directly changed, we would know what these options were for the current connection.
, Prasad explained to me why this is needed in SessionState.java.

So 

+1 on this modulo cleanups. I think we can refactor the code a bit so that all the refresh logic is at one place. Please file a separate JIRA for that.
, I just committed this. Thanks Prasad!]
