  HIVE-2711

  Make the header of RCFile unique wrt SequenceFile

  The RCFile implementation was copied from Hadoop's SequenceFile and copied the 'magic' string in the header. This means that you can't use the header to distinguish between RCFiles and SequenceFiles.

  I'd propose that we create a new header for RCFiles (RCF?) to replace the current SEQ. To maintain compatibility, we'll need to continue to accept the current 'SEQ\06' and just make new files contain the new header.

, @Owen,
 I think original design of RCFile was done with compatibility with Sequence File in mind. This patch will break that. Whats the advantage of this change?, The compatibility is very fragile in that SequenceFile can only read an RCFile if they have the RCFile class since the key and value classes are contained in RCFile.java. Additionally, SequenceFile would present the RCFile blocks instead of the RCFile rows.

Furthermore, in the future if either RCFile or SequenceFile has a new format revision, it breaks badly., That makes sense. I will take a look., ashutoshc has commented on the revision "HIVE-2711 [jira] Make the header of RCFile unique".

  It seems like you are backward compatible with SEQ6 but not for anything before that. If the intent is to break backward compatibility, then I think we should send an email on both dev and user list about this change, since folks might have historical data in this format, which can't be read then.

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/RCFile.java:1205 By doing this, you are effectively dropping the ability to read data before version SEQ6. This is backward incompatible change.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/RCFile.java:1224 By removing this, you will not be able to read data before version SEQ2.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/RCFile.java:1252 This removes ability to read before version 6.

  Ashutosh,

  My point is that RCFile was *always* distinct from Sequence Files. RCFile was a fork of Sequence File when the Sequence File version was 6, therefore nothing before version 6 can possibly be an RCFile.

  Headers:
    Sequence Files: SEQ1, SEQ2, SEQ3, SEQ4, SEQ5, SEQ6
    RCFiles: SEQ6, RCF1

  Also note that SEQ5 was last written by Hadoop 0.10 back in Feb 2007, a year and a half before Hive was created.

, I see. Yeah, very first commit of RCFile http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/hive/trunk/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/RCFile.java?view=markup&pathrev=770548 started with SEQ6 so there could possibly be no data written in RCFile format with version SEQ5 or earlier. So, backward compatibility with SEQ6 suffices. So, +1 will commit if tests pass., Patch fails to apply. Needs to be rebased., omalley requested code review of "HIVE-2711 [jira] Make the header of RCFile unique".
