, Hi Paul, before calling showJobDebugFailInfo() can you please print out a message telling the user that you're going to do this, that it may take a long time to complete, and that this feature can be disabled by setting the conf property {{hive.exec.show.job.failure.debug.info}}?, It would probably also be a good idea to add some INFO level logging statements to the loop in showJobDebugFailInfo() so that the user can roughy gauge the rate of progress., Committed. Thanks Paul., looks like the CHANGES.txt message of this commit and the merge commit got mixed up, @Carl

The message to the user about the conf var is a good idea. I can put info level logging statements, but I don't think it's possible to know the number of task completion events before retrieving them, so there won't be a % complete message., @Paul: I understand that showing % complete is not possible, but I do think it would help to log a message as each task completion event is retrieved so that the user sees progress is being made. The most frustrating thing about the current behavior is that the CLI appears to just freeze leaving the user with no idea what's going on.]
