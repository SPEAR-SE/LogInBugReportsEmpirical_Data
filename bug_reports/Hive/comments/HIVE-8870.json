[I found the issue is because ORC is case sensitive.

SELECT element.elementId FROM foobar_orc;  (fails)
SELECT element.elementid FROM foobar_orc;  (success)

I'll fix this by lowering the case on the query elements., This patch converts the query columns to lower case in order to search for the correct struct column.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12683353 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Hi [~hagleitn], 

I've heard you have experience with ORC. 
Could you give me a quick review on the attached patch? It is a trivial change., Hi [~owen.omalley],

Could you help me reviewing this simple patch? 
[~brocknoland] told me you have experience with ORC.

Thanks, [~spena] Thanks for the patch. Minor comments:
1) OrcStructInspector.equals() must also be changed accordingly.
2) nit: equalsIgnoreCase() is more readable than toLowerCase() on both sides., Thanks [~prasanth_j] for the tip. 
I updated the patch with your recommendation., LGTM, +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12684745 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Both tests are not related with this bugfix. 
I run the vector_decimal_aggregate (ORC query test) in an unpatched environment, and it is failing as well., [~spena] Yeah. The test failures are not related. I will commit once SVN is backup again. 
[~vikram.dixit] Can we have this bugfix for 0.14.1? , +1 for 0.14, Committed to trunk and branch-0.14. Thanks [~spena] of the patch!, Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
