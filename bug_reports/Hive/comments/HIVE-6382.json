ATTACHMENT ID: 12627461, Added configuration to orc readers to support skipping of corrupted data., Addressed [~sershe]'s review comments., wrt 64 bits that's what I meant by relying on internals of that func... maybe it can check and throw assertion error if it is >56 but not 64... anyway that's nit.
Otherwise +1, Gotcha! Fixed it in this patch., Earlier patch was not compiling clean as conf object of some orc reader interface was missing. Fixed it in this patch.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12629962, The test failure does not seem to be related to this patch. , Committed to trunk. Thanks [~prasanth_j] and [~sershe]!, For the record:  this adds the configuration parameter *hive.exec.orc.skip.corrupt.data* to HiveConf.java and hive-default.xml.template., *hive.exec.orc.skip.corrupt.data* is documented in the wiki:

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.exec.orc.skip.corrupt.data | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.exec.orc.skip.corrupt.data]]
