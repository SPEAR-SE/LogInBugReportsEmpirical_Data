[[~chengxiang li] or [~lirui], could you take a look? Thanks., OK I'll have a look., Hi [~xuefuz], what's the data size is the user using? I have tried TPC-H Q22 on 320GB but can't reproduce the difference in performance., Hi Rui, the user has the following data sizes (from command  hadoop fs -du -h /tpch):
{code}
2.3 G    6.9 G    /tpch/customer
74.1 G   222.3 G  /tpch/lineitem
2.2 K    6.5 K    /tpch/nation
16.6 G   49.7 G   /tpch/orders
2.3 G    6.9 G    /tpch/part
11.4 G   34.1 G   /tpch/partsupp
389      1.1 K    /tpch/region
136.3 M  408.8 M  /tpch/supplier
{code}
The user's cluster has 27 nodes. User observed 43s for yarn-client vs 162s for yarn-cluster. Other configurations are the same for both cases.

, Why does each table have 2 sizes? The following is the output of the same command on my cluster:
{code}
[root@node13-1 ~]# hadoop fs -du -h /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db
2.4 G    /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db/customer
53.8 G   /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db/lineitem
1.7 K    /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db/nation
12.6 G   /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db/orders
1.2 G    /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db/part
9.2 G    /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db/partsupp
980      /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db/region
156.8 M  /user/hive/warehouse/tpch_flat_orc_320.db/supplier
{code}
Q22 runs for about 57s in both yarn-client and yarn-cluster mode on my side.
I'll try other cases., I managed to reproduce this with other queries. The problem turned out to be some bug in adding jars for yarn-cluster mode: we're downloading the same jar multiple times.
This patch solves the issue on my side. It'd be great if the user can try it out., Thanks, [~lirui]. This is great!
[~chengxiang li], could you please review the changes here, as you originally authored this part of the code? Thanks. I will also take a look.,
