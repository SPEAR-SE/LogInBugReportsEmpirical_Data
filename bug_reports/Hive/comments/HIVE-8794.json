ATTACHMENT ID: 12680384 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Don't like it, it is too complicated - the private final + static was sufficient & thread-safe (because {{<clinit>}} is).

Now this isn't. An easier fix would be to do

{code}
public static void initShutdownHook() {
    Preconditions.checkArgument(shutdownList != null, "Unexpected initialization case for shutdown sessions list");
}
{code}

This would run the previous code exactly as before, under the JVM class lock, but won't need any active code within the init calls., Nice. I was using classForName first, but didn't like the string. This is better.,
