ATTACHMENT ID: 12698577 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~wzheng] any update?
[~ashutoshc] can you please review? thanks, [~sershe] There was a small bug with assertion failure in BytesBytesMultiHashMap.deserializeInternal:
assert offset == tmpLength;
So I temporarily backed out this patch from my code, to follow the original plan of using row container for the first version, and make improvement later on.]
