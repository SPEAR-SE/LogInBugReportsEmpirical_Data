, @Carl: out of curiosity, what was the fix here?  I was trying to trace this error for a little while., Committed.  Thanks Carl!
, @Sohan: The test failures were a result of some trailing whitespace getting excluded from the updates for udtf_explode.q.out and udf_exlode.q.out, but I'm still not exactly sure how this happened., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #882 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/882/])
