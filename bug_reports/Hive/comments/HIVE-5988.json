[This information can go in the Getting Started wikidoc, which has a section on [Error Logs|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs], but it should also go in either the admin docs or the user docs, or both.  Perhaps just mention it in appropriate places with links to Getting Started.

* Is there enough information for a separate wikidoc, or is it just what's in the description here?

* If not, would the user doc [Authorization|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Authorization] be an appropriate place for it?

* In the admin docs, Configuration has a skimpy section that links to log file information in Getting Started and the WebHCat docset:  [Log Files|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+Configuration#AdminManualConfiguration-LogFiles]., Added this little section to [Getting Started |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-AuditLogs]-- please review:

*Audit Logs*

Audit logs are logged from the Hive metastore server for every metastore API invocation. 

An audit log has the function and some of the relevant function arguments logged in the metastore log file. It is logged at the INFO level of log4j, so you need to make sure that the logging at the INFO level is enabled (see HIVE-3505). The name of the log entry is "HiveMetaStore.audit".

Audit logs were added in Hive 0.7 for secure client connections (HIVE-1948) and in Hive 0.10 for non-secure connections (HIVE-3277; also see HIVE-2797).

Does it belong anywhere else (admin or user docs)?, [~thejas], would you please review the doc and close this jira?  (Or suggest improvements.)
