[HIVE-4768.1.patch - patch that fixes the issues described above
, Every hcatalog build target component is calling mvn-install, and when tests are run in parallel on single machine more than one mvn-install is running at same time and ends up corrupting the local maven cache. 
So I had to use HIVE-4768.disablehcattest.patch to run it in parallel without the hcatalog tests. I ran hcatalog tests separately without the parallel mode. , Verified that all unit tests passed during parallel unit test run with this patch. 
{code}
Summary:
  tests run: 2461
  failures: 0
  errors: 0

{code}, ptest1 does not work anymore (post mavenisation). ptest2 is the recommended parallel test framework.
Closing as wontfix
