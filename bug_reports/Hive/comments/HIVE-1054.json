[Right now, it seems hive meta data does not support alter partition keys. I am getting "Invalid alter operation: partition keys can not be changed.", Talked with Prasad today, this should not be supported., Yongqiang, could you comment on why this should not be supported?, I think problem there is what will happen to existing partitions? One has to come up for the convention of how does adding / dropping of column maps to dir structure on hdfs and then possibly need to move around/rename  partition dirs to match with this convention., @Ashutosh

What if we only allow changing the type of a partition column?

I agree adding/dropping/renaming partition columns has a host of difficulties to manage, but I thought changing a partition column's type shouldn't involve a change in hdfs, simply a metadata change., One problem there could be that all partition values are stored as string, so type info is completely lost in mysql. As a result partition filters cannot be pushed in mysql for any types other then string. This is also documented in listPartitionsByFilter() api of metastoreclient. Though, I don't find that this is enforced anywhere (that might itself be a bug). As a result, changing a type of partition column from string to int or vice-versa might result in change in behavior.]
