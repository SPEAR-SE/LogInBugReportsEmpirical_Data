[Did you forgot to attach a patch : ), Can you also add a negative test cases for:
{code}
 select count(distinct last_value(i) over ( partition by si order by i )) from over10k;
select distinct last_value(i) over ( partition by si order by i ),  distinct first_value(t)  over ( partition by si order by i ) from over10k ;
{code}

and positive test for:
{code}
select distinct last_value(i) over ( partition by si order by i ),  first_value(t)  over ( partition by si order by i ) from over10k ;
{code}, +1 pending tests, 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:
