[This patch fixes the problem by rewriting all the converters.

The converters are expanded to a class hierarchy so it can reuse the returned conversion result (a Writable object) more easily.


I also added the Settable*ObjectInspector which provides a delegated way of setting the value of an object and creating new objects.

It also adds one new test case for the converters, and one more client positive test case.
, Fixed a compilation problem that didn't surface till "ant clean"., Committed. Thanks Zheng., Committed as HIVE-616.
