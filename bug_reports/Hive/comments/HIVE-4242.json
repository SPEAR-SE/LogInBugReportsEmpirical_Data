[omalley requested code review of "HIVE-4242 [jira] Predicate push down should also be provided to InputFormats".

Reviewers: JIRA

HIVE-4242 predicate pushdown for all input formats

Currently, the push down predicate is only provided to native tables if the hive.optimize.index.filter configuration variable is set. There is no reason to prevent InputFormats from getting the required information to do predicate push down.

Obviously, this will be very useful for ORC.

To: JIRA, omalley
, The patch sets the filter unconditionally. Should it rather change the config setting or add a new one?]
