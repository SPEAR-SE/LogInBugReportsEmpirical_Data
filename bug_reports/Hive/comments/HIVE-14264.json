[Tried on 2.1.0-rc0 running on Derby db. 

Beeline was started using the command: ./beeline --hiveconf hive.cbo.enable=false -u jdbc:hive2://

Test data created using the following commands:
CREATE DATABASE hive_14264;
USE hive_14264;
CREATE TABLE table1 (key STRING, value STRING);
INSERT INTO TABLE table1 
	VALUES ('key1', 'value1'), (null, 'value2'), ('key3', null), (null, null);

Tried to reproduce the issue by using the following queries:
0: jdbc:hive2://> SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE key IS NOT NULL;
OK
+-------------+---------------+--+
| table1.key  | table1.value  |
+-------------+---------------+--+
| key1        | value1        |
| key3        | NULL          |
+-------------+---------------+--+
2 rows selected (0.29 seconds)
0: jdbc:hive2://> SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE value IS NOT NULL;OK
+-------------+---------------+--+
| table1.key  | table1.value  |
+-------------+---------------+--+
| key1        | value1        |
| NULL        | value2        |
+-------------+---------------+--+
2 rows selected (0.087 seconds)

Queries executed as expected; issue was not reproducible.
Could you please provide more info to reproduce the issue?, Tried with both hive.cbo.enable=true and hive.cbo.enable=false: issue was not reproducible in either cases., [~gszadovszky], Thanks for looking into this. We were also not able reproduce in our local setup, query was only failing in our production with above stacktrace. By disabling cbo, we were able to move forward., Are you able to add some details about your environment? Unfortunately, I was not able to figure anything out of the stacktrace., [~gszadovszky] We are running queries on hive server on version 2.1 and using MR execution engine. The tables are partitioned and the issue mostly happens when col is not projected but it is only in filter clause with 'IS NOT NULL' filter. But we have seen failures in some cases when column is projected as well.]
