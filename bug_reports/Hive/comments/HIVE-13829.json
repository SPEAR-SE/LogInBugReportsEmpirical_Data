[HIVE-9331 removed *hive.mapjoin.optimized.keys* and *hive.mapjoin.lazy.hashtable* in release 1.1.0 but the documentation hasn't been updated yet., Hi [~leftylev], thanks for the feedback. In that case, I think this JIRA can be closed. , HIVE-9331 has now been documented, so this JIRA will be closed.]
