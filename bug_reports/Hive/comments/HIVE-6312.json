ATTACHMENT ID: 12625302, Hi [~navis]. Thanks a lot for the patch! Can you also upload it to rb since it's easier to read there?, [~vaibhavgumashta] Intended to make review board entry when all tests passed. Made one with on-going patch and thanks for your interest.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12625494, [~navis] Left some minor comments on rb. How about we get rid of TUGIContainingProcessor class too since it won't be used anymore?, The patch does not apply cleanly on trunk anymore. It would be great to have this in hive 0.13, since we are running out of time, I will go ahead and rebase it.
, HIVE-6312.3.patch.txt - rebased patch, address my own minor comments .
The changes in the original patch look good. [~navis] can you please review my rebase changes ?
, +1 to original changes. Will consider it a complete +1 once I get a review from [~navis] or another committer.
I am unable to upload to the existing reviewboard .
, I have kicked off a pre-commit test build.
, [~thejas] Sorry for the delay. Look good to me. +1, [~thejas] Should we also get rid of TUGIContainingProcessor?, [~thejas] The TUGIContainingProcessor related changes are in fact already in trunk via HIVE-5155. You might want to rebase the patch to see if there are conflicts., [~prasadm] Yes, the patch from Navis didn't apply on post HIVE-5155 trunk, that is why I had to rebase it. HIVE-6312.3.patch.txt is the rebased patch I uploaded. It is not in the reviewboard link that Navis created, because I can't upload it there.

, ah ok. I only looked at the review board and not the latest patch. sorry about that.
Updated changes look fine to me.

+1
, [~vgumashta] Yes, I think it makes sense to remove TUGIContainingProcessor. I will create a followup patch for it.
, Thanks for pointing that out Vaibhav. Created HIVE-6663, [~thejas] How about just removing it in here?, HIVE-6312.4.patch.txt - removes TUGIContainingProcessor, Navis, I included it in a different jira because I wasn't sure if I would get a +1 in time. Somehow thought that its late in night there (Seoul?) and you might not be around ! :)
, It's about the time to go home :)
I've checked TUGIContainingProcessor is not included in any other class or document. Thanks again for a review.,
