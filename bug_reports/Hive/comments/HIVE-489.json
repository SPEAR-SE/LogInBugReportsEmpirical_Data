[HIVE-488 should fix the issue of not creating the parent directories., this happened on insert overwrite directory though .., shouldn't matter. both queries use MoveTask underneath., ok - that covers my problem - i can't think very many reasons other than the parent dir issue on why things would fail - perhaps things like permissions if the hadoop instance is using one. 

otherwise - let's dup this one .., the fix for 488 doesn't seem to cover the loadFile case which applies to the 'insert overwrite directory' clause .. - correct?, 488 only creates parent directory before moving the data (both insert overwrite and load) but it doesn't validate the output path before executing the job.Hive should validate the output path while generating the plan so that job wouldn't be executed unnecessarily. , i don't see any code for the insert overwrite case:
- genFileSinkPlan generates a loadFileDesc
- MoveTask does not mkdir on parent for loadFileDesc

the changes in 488 only seem to cover loads into tables and partitions if i am not mistaken ? , yeah, i didn't realize 489 was for directories and not partitions. 488 doesn't help with directories.]
