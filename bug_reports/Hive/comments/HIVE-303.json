[Actually it compiles but may not run well.

It turns out to be that Hive compilation may have a problem if user didn't do a "ant clean" before switching to a different version of hadoop using "ant package -Dhadoop.version=<new version>"

The solution is simple: Just run "ant clean" before "ant package -Dhadoop.version=<new version>"
, seems like the workaround is known. it's better to set the expectation that user is supposed to do ant clean before switching hadoop versions.]
