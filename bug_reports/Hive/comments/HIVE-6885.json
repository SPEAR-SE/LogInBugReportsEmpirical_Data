 * Lefty's comments on https://reviews.apache.org/r/19754/, I see why this was pushed through so fast but it'd be nice if the promised cleanup were to actually happen. The Hive code base is littered with inconsistencies and hard to understand as it is. I don't think we need to add to that by rushing out features., Speaking of doc issues, a diagram on the HCat overview page shows streaming grayed out.  Can it be updated now?  (I only noticed it because Confluence told me Andrew Lee likes "my" page -- kudos to Alan, not to me.)
