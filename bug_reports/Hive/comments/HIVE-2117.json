[single row of data that is used to reproduce the issue, This patch is a work in progress, it resolves this jira in branch 0.7 while maintaining compatibility with the requirements from HIVE-1707. All unit tests are passing with this patch applied, also fixes the example I provided in the description (managed and external table).

I'm still working on two aspects of this JIRA; 1) creating a patch for trunk, and 2) adding unit tests to verify this behavior.
, Updated patch files for branch 0.7 and trunk.

This fixes the problem -- I've also added a new test which verifies the location used for the partition. I verified this failed before my patch and passes after applying my patch.,

Review request for hive and Carl Steinbach.


Summary
-------

This change resolves a regression introduced by HIVE-1707, specifically that the partition location (set via alter table partition location) is not being respected.

I addressed this by using the user specified location (as done originally), except in the case with cross-filesystem moves (which was the concern in 1707).


This addresses bug HIVE-2117.

Testing
-------

I added a new test which verifies partition location explicitly - as the existing tests ignore this detail. This test failed w/o my fix applied, it passes with the fix applied.


Thanks,

Patrick
