other failures are from previous builds.

[~daijy] can you please review !, +1. Patch pushed to master. Thanks Anishek!, [~daijy]
Could it be that the new CopyUtils class is missing from the commit? I can see it in the patch file but not on github (https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/68b2f9b2a78d9727f034ece8b3d7adc1c29054ad), and my build is failing.

And it seems TestExport.java suffered a similar fate. :), Thanks [~zsombor.klara] for localizing this issue.
Committed the remaining files using the attached patch file. I hope there is no difference between the pull request and the patch file :)

[~anishek]: Could you please file a jira and add the remaining apache headers to the new files? I was not sure if I am allowed to change the patch, so committed it without change to unblock others., Thanks Barna/Peter to fixing this quickly! I have put back the license header., Thanks everyone for helping on this one !., Github user anishek closed the pull request at:
