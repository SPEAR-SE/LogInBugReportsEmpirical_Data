[I was not able to reproduce this issue in Hive 3.0.0, though I could reproduce this issue in CDH5.4.0 but only when hive.metastore.try.direct.sql is disabled.

, The issue was caused by the discrepancy in column definition between a table and its partition. The first command "ALTER TABLE test1 CHANGE name name1 string;" changed the table's column "name" to "name1", the 2nd command "ALTER TABLE test1 CHANGE name1 name string cascade;" with "cascade" clause attempted to change the partition column "name1" to "name" which did actually not exist. When executing the 2nd command, Hive failed in validateTableCols (validating partition columns against its table) in getMPartitionColumnStatistics. It is the root cause to the seen issue in this JIRA though the thrown exception and its message is not so informative.
The issue has been fixed as a side effect of HIVE-16147. , It has been fixed in HIVE-16147., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
