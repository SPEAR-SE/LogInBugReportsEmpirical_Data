ATTACHMENT ID: 12620965, Thank you for for the review! I committed this to trunk/, Does this need to be mentioned in the wiki?

If so, here are some possible locations:

* [Developer Guide:  Object Inspector |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DeveloperGuide#DeveloperGuide-ObjectInspector] -- by the way, would someone please explain what the exclamation points mean in this section and the previous one (Hive SerDe)?
* [Developer Guide:  how to add a new SerDe |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DeveloperGuide#DeveloperGuide-SerDe-howtoaddanewSerDe]
* [Hive Plugins |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HivePlugins]
* [SerDe:  Additional Notes |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SerDe#SerDe-Additionalnotes]
* [Language Manual:  Create Table:  Row Format, Storage Format, and SerDe |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-RowFormat,StorageFormat,andSerDe], Good call... I added it to the Object Inspector section!, Looks good, thanks [~brocknoland]., [~lars_francke] identified the source of the exclamation point prefixes in the Hive SerDe & Object Inspector sections of the Developer Guide:  old MoinMoin syntax.  (See his comment on the SerDes doc:  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SerDe?focusedCommentId=39620650#comment-39620650.)  So I'm taking them out.]
