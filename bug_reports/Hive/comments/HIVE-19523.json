[[~ashutoshc] [~jcamachorodriguez] do you have any input? Seems like this would be behavior change for Hive. I am not sure why Hive would change precision/scale, but I'm assuming it's there for some reason... not changing it seems more logical to me., {{HiveDecimal}} is a class internal to Hive. Its not suppose to be use outside of Hive. [~vgarg47] Can you expand on usecase? Do you have a hive query which exhibits the issue?, {{HiveDecimal}} doesn't carry precision and scale info even though it's backed by a {{BigDecimal}} object. Internally, Hive normalizes the {{BigDecimal}} input when storing it as a {{HiveDecimal}} instance. If desired, you can call {{HiveDecimal.enforcePrecisionScale()}} to generate an instance that has certain precision/scale.]
