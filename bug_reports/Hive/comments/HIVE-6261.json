ATTACHMENT ID: 12624293, Failures are unrelated. The hadoop-1 build isn't even touching the file changed in this patch., We need to investigate as to why in tez we have an extra stage for a couple of queries. We can take that up in another jira., I've created: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6295 for that., Cool. +1.]
