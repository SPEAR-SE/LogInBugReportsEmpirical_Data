[making sure that the timezone is the same as the hive server will solve the issue.
Hence avoid doing {code} SET hive.tez.java.opts=-Duser.timezone="UTC" {code}, [~jcamachorodriguez], will this go into 2.3.0? Thanks., I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker.
, This should not be an issue anymore, as timestamp with local time zone type is not dependent on system time zone. Closing as not a problem.]
