[Isn't that intentional to avoid an exclusive lock in Hive?, That was the case when SQL queries where used to add partition (alter table <tablename> add partition if not exists). Direct metastore API interaction would not acquire X lock afaik.  , it won't currently, but perhaps it should/will
How much overhead is this?, The overhead in terms of perf is not much (haven't measured it but it shouldn't be significant). Just that customer reported errors (already exists partition errors) in metastore logs which are safe to ignore for this specific case. To avoid the error logs, add_partitions with ifNotExists can be used. ]
