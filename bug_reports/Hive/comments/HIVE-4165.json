[In UnionOperator class:
{noformat}
/**
   * Union operators are not allowed either before or after a explicit mapjoin hint.
   * Note that, the same query would just work without the mapjoin hint (by setting
   * hive.auto.convert.join to true).
   **/
  @Override
  public boolean opAllowedBeforeMapJoin() {
    return false;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean opAllowedAfterMapJoin() {
    return false;
  }

{noformat}, Why are union operators not allowed before or after an explicit mapjoin hint?

Thanks
Vikram., [~namit] Could you please explain why union operator was explicitly not allowed before or after map join? This above change was introduced as part of the change converting joins to mapjoins automatically without need for hints.

Thanks
Vikram.]
