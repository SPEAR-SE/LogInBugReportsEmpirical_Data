[Exception are throws because show_compact() return object {{ShowCompactResponse}}.

Main property of {{ShowCompactResponse}} is a list of  {{ShowCompactResponseElement}}

Thrift definition of {{ShowCompactResponseElement}} is :

{noformat}
struct ShowCompactResponseElement {
    1: required string dbname,
    2: required string tablename,
    3: required string partitionname,
    4: required CompactionType type,
    5: required string state,
    6: required string workerid,
    7: required i64 start,
    8: required string runAs,
}
{noformat}

But in metastore database, table which store compactions infos is defined with non required properties :
{code:sql}
CREATE TABLE "COMPACTION_QUEUE"
(
  "CQ_ID" bigint NOT NULL,
  "CQ_DATABASE" character varying(128) NOT NULL,
  "CQ_TABLE" character varying(128) NOT NULL,
  "CQ_PARTITION" character varying(767),
  "CQ_STATE" character(1) NOT NULL,
  "CQ_TYPE" character(1) NOT NULL,
  "CQ_WORKER_ID" character varying(128),
  "CQ_START" bigint,
  "CQ_RUN_AS" character varying(128),
  CONSTRAINT "COMPACTION_QUEUE_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("CQ_ID")
)
{code}

Also, ACID code store NULL values in this table.
This throws exceptions when doing {{SHOW COMPACTIONS}} in CLI because metastore Thrift server try to send {{ShowCompactResponseElement}} with required properties to NULL.

Properties that throws errors :
1. {{partitionname}}, when the table have no partition
2. {{workerid}}, {{start, {{runAs}} when the table have partitions, Change Thritft definition from :
{noformat}
struct ShowCompactResponseElement {
    ...
    3: required string partitionname,
    4: required CompactionType type,
    5: required string state,
    6: required string workerid,
    7: required i64 start,
    8: required string runAs,
}
{noformat}
To :
{noformat}
struct ShowCompactResponseElement {
    ...
    3: optional string partitionname,
    4: required CompactionType type,
    5: required string state,
    6: optional string workerid,
    7: optional i64 start,
    8: optional string runAs,
}
{noformat}

seems to fix the problem. Pushing the first patch.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12667148, +1.  I do not believe the schemeAuthority test failure is related., [~alangates] I verified the error.
The test failed to execute {{dfs -rmr file:///tmp/test}} command at start of the test.
It's strange but definitely not related to this patch., Patch checked in.  Thanks Damien for fixing this., [~alangates] Great ! 

Error with {{dfs -rmr file:///tmp/test}} is very strange. I can't believe that unit test try to delete {{/tmp/test}} directory on local machine.
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
