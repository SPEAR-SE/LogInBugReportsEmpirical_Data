[hi,

I got an error when trying to use hive 0.9.0 import to hbase 0.94.0
:
FATAL ExecMapper: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access field org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder.SINGLETON from class org.slf4j.LoggerFactory

dose this patch fits this problem?, Hi Qipan,

This patch only bumps up the hbase version and adds a few dependencies required by hbase 0.94-1 version. Can you tell me when you hit the above error? What operation causes it? Maybe there is some other JIRA that addresses that issue.

Thanks
