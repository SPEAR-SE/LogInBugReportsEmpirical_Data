[I think this has also been addressed. Will verify and then close out., Prasad,

can you verify if this works and close out...

Thanks,
Ashish, I think that this query's syntax is wrong. "as tx" must follows "using 'mapper'". so this query should is changed like
"from (from cdx select transform(cdx.a.b) using 'mapper' as tx cluster by tx) mo insert into output select tx;". also hive should be patched about "insert into" - HIVE-2207.]
