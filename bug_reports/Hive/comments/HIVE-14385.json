[Verified the issue, issue occurs only if we use show create table to see view definition. Show create table works fine for tables, but for views it skips comments.
[~pvary]: You can see comments using 
{code}describe extended escape_comments_view1;{code}
I'll check it further, if its expected behavior or a bug. Behavior is consistent on 1.2.1 and master branch. ]
