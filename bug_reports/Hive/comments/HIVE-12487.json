[I didn't find anything specific to HIVE-12319 in test logs. The only issue I see when running locally is that aop library is missing which results in TEZ execution being stuck. Which could potentially lead to result filen not being produced.
After the change I'm able to successfully run one of llap itests:
{code}
mvn test -Dtest=TestMiniLlapCliDriver -pl qtest -Dqfile=bucket_map_join_tez1.q
{code}, If you are saying you cannot repro the issue might be somehow specific to HiveQA setup... I'll take a look a bit later, I was able to successfully run locally a large portion of qfile tests in Llap, so I think that test failure is unlikely to be caused by a code change.
Another potential reason for tests failure with no TEST-*.xml file is that "orc_ppd_basic.q" test took almost 2 hours on my machine, so it could easily have been killed by a timeout. This is a more likely reason which has some confirmation in log. Splitting or temporary disabling this test will help.
In any case, so far I haven't seen any relationship between Llap test failure and a change in HIVE-12319., Oh, yeah, that's definitely a timeout then, the timeout on HiveQA is 1 hour. The test runtime might have been increased by changes in HIVE-12319, because these failures never happened before (since we merged to master).
Maybe some configuration has changed for some code... I will take a look a bit when I have some cycles.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12773588 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I was able to debug the problem. The patch in HIVE-12319 used incorrect config (input one, not output) in one of the places when setting splits for TEZ which resulted in a split not being set and default value of 1 being used. As a result, tests had a lot of splits to process which caused some of them to run much longer and one of them caused a timeout.

After fixing the issue, the test passed in a minute. I also double checked the patch to make sure correct config is used in all other cases.
, +1 
[~Aleksei] Can you reupload the patch and make it "Patch Available". Seems like Hive QA didnt pick it up., Reuploaded the patch to trigger Hive tests., +1. Thanks for looking into this!,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12773865 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, TestMiniLlapCliDriver tests pass fine now.

Spark tests pass fine for me locally. Error during test run seem to be unrelated:
{code}
Unexpected exception java.lang.IllegalStateException: Error trying to obtain executor info: java.lang.IllegalStateException: RPC channel is closed. at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.QTestUtil$1.setSparkSession(QTestUtil.java:1022)}
{code}

, Pushed to master. Thanks, Aleksei!]
