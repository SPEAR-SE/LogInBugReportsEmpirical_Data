ATTACHMENT ID: 12768590 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Hi [~thejas] - looks good to me, +1.

I will admit that for a moment there, I thought that HiveSchemaTool.verifySchemaVersion was now doing the wrong thing by testing for newSchemaVersion >= MetaStoreSchemaInfo.getHiveSchemaVersion() instead of the equality before to verify the update, but I see why I was wrong to assume so. Maybe worth adding a comment there to explain there what the compatibility check does, and why the direction of >= is correct for it.
, Thanks for the review [~sushanth] . I have added some more comments.
Patch committed to master and branch-1.
