It might be works , thank Cazen Lee,it`s exactly this reason. is it a bug? is there any issue?, Let me take a look at it after company work.

It's from "org.codehaus.jackson.JsonParseException: Unrecognized character escape"

But I'm not sure it's bug or Intended work

I'll reply soon, I searched a while and guess it's your JSON problem.

First of all, your JSON string was something wrong(it means it's not standard)

And hive has strict rule when reading JSON format(excption occured when wrong escape)

So, If you want to read your JSON files
- Convert and validate your escape character(ex. from \ to \\) when it created
- OR write custom UDF extend UDFJson with ALLOW_BACKSLASH_ESCAPING_ANY_CHARACTER enabled(recommended)

Not sure it's OK that added ALLOW_BACKSLASH_ESCAPING_ANY_CHARACTER enabled in trunk(If can, Could I participate?)
Hive has many history and discussed by people, so I think there are reason that strict JSON rules.

If I'm wrong or any suggestions, please let me know.

Thank you, thank your detailed reply,i will try your 2nd way,if you have time ,could you please commit your patch about "ALLOW_BACKSLASH_ESCAPING_ANY_CHARACTER "? thank you！

, Here it is, thank you so much ,it works!, Good :)

Have a good day!,  Good Day [~ashutoshc]  Could you please take a look at this property?, Although its not standard JSON, I think we can allow this since parser can handle this.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12756189 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Pushed to master. Thanks, [~Cazen], Thank you [~ashutoshc] 
And Congratulations :), Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug., Good day [~sershe] This is Cazen
Does branch-1 means ver1 of hive?
If then, I think it`s good idea to apply to branch-1
Jacksonparser do not want unstandard backslash in the body, so it cause exception(Unrecognized character escape) by strict rule when parsing
But hive is not. It looks like a bug in user's view(like this jira issue) Most of them concentrate upon data context, not row by row
If i can, may I reopen or create issue to apply this patch to branch-1?, Reopening is probably not necessary. Let me see if I can cherry-pick the commit]
