ATTACHMENT ID: 12624985, looks good. Can you check why the 5 minimr tests are failing., Looks like those tests are all failing due to the current issues in the minimr tests (HIVE-6293). I'll kick off another precommit run when these are resolved., Try running precommit test again, looks like the issues with Minimr tests have been fixed (HIVE-6310)., +1, upload patch again to run pre commit tests,
