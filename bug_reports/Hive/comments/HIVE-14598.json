[Do we just want to strip out newlines from the query text when determining the query name? Or replace it with a special character?, Replacing with a space should be good enough. (Ensuring there's a space when the newline is removed), I'd like to give this a shot. I think I've got it figured out but I'm still learning the hive internals. 

This occurs when:
String jobname = Utilities.abbreviate(queryStr, maxlen - 6); 
is called in execute in org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.Driver

The solution would be to replace that line with something like:
String jobname = Utilities.abbreviate(queryStr.replace('\n',' ').replace('\r',''), maxlen - 6); 

If this is right, can I please get it assigned to me so I can write a patch. Thank you., [~toza] - I'm not absolutely sure about the jobName being the correct parameter. It definitely seems to be it. If making the change, please add it as a helper.

Another place where the change will be required is TezTask - for the dag name. (This is actually what I had opened the jira for)
, I'm moving this JIRA out of 2.1.1 release as it is not a blocker nor critical for a 2.1.1 RC version., Hello, I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release.]
