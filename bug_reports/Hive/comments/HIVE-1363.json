[A minor comment: why to support three kinds of usages? That may make users confusing., My understanding is that backticks are reserved for enclosing
identifiers that conflict with other tokens in the HQL grammar, e.g. 

{code}
hive> CREATE TABLE function(stuff INT);
FAILED: Parse Error: line 1:13 mismatched input 'function' expecting Identifier in create table statement

hive> CREATE TABLE `function`(stuff INT);
OK

hive> show tables;
OK
function
pokes
{code}

Based on this I would argue that the SHOW TABLES command currently exhibits the expected
behavior whereas SHOW TABLE EXTENDED does not:

{code}
hive> SHOW TABLES "pokes*";
OK
pokes

hive> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE "pokes*";
FAILED: Error in metadata: MetaException(message:Got exception: javax.jdo.JDOUserException ')' expected at character 54 in "database.name == dbName && ( tableName.matches("(?i)"pokes.*""))")
FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask

hive> SHOW TABLES 'pokes*';
OK
pokes

hive> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'pokes*';
OK

hive> SHOW TABLES `pokes*`;
OK

hive> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE `pokes*`;
OK

ATTACHMENT ID: 12667028, The describe_table_json.q test failure is related to the change from this patch. Actually the original test output seemed not right. For the query SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'json*', it returned empty results and its output in json was {"tables":[]}. But the expected result should have one entry for table jsontable, and the output should look like following, which is to be masked in its q.out file.
==
{"tables":[{"minFileSize":0,"totalNumberFiles":0,"location":"file:/user/hive/warehouse/apache/jsontable","outputFormat":"org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat","lastAccessTime":0,"lastUpdateTime":1410049821000,"columns":[{"name":"key","type":"int"},{"name":"value","type":"string"}],"maxFileSize":0,"partitioned":false,"tableName":"jsontable","owner":"ctang","inputFormat":"org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat","totalFileSize":0}]}
==

Change describe_table_json.q.out to reflect the expected query output and uploaded a new patch., +1, pending on the new test result.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12667057, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks to Chaoyu for the contribution., _If_ this needs to be documented in the wiki, here's where it goes (but maybe it's just a bug fix that doesn't need user documentation):

* [Language Manual -- DDL -- Show Table/Partition Extended | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-ShowTable/PartitionExtended], Thanks, [~leftylev]. It seems to me that is a just a bug fix., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
