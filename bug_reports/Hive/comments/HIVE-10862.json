[Added a util function to set a fresh datanucleus dir.
, 2.patch - added more comments to the util func
, Note that the util function can also help in cases where tests are executed in parallel, in such cases cleaning up the tables and dbs might not be sufficient.
, on second thoughts, we need a better solution than this if tests are being executed in parallel, same derby location can't be used in parallel.
