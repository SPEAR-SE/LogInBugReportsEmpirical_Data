[The proposed fix uses an existing LDAP configuration property {{hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupMembershipKey}} to find the users if the user-configured LDAP query returns a group instead of a user. This property is already used for group filters., review posted to reviewboard at https://reviews.apache.org/r/50970/, +1 Pending on tests,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12823145 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, There is just ONE test failure which had not failed in the prior build. Looking at the test, I do not see how this fix could cause that failure. There are bunch of exceptions when running the test, so I suspect it is a result of those. running locally fails with different output that shown here.
, The same test failed in another build (2 builds after mine)
https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/Hive/job/PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build/856/
So this does appear to be a flaky test. So the fix looks good. +1 for me., Committed to 2.2.0 and 2.1.1. Thanks Naveen for the patch., Thanks Chaoyu for review and the commit., Should this be documented in the wiki?, 
I already documented this feature this in the past but yes, I plan on enhancing it at 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/User+and+Group+Filter+Support+with+LDAP+Atn+Provider+in+HiveServer2#UserandGroupFilterSupportwithLDAPAtnProviderinHiveServer2-CustomQueryString

which needed a bit more details to begin with. I do not think it was clear as to what the custom query should result in., 
[~leftylev] I have update the LDAP authentication configuration documentation [here|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/User+and+Group+Filter+Support+with+LDAP+Atn+Provider+in+HiveServer2]. Could you please review it to make it consistent with other pages? Thank you in advance, Good docs, [~ngangam].  I made a few format changes and minor edits, and added information about this issue to *hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupMembershipKey* in Configuration Properties.

One question:  Is the repetition of the word "represents" correct in this sentence (or should it be reworded?): "This property represents the attribute name that represents the user DN on the Group entry."  I tinkered with alternatives but didn't want to change the meaning, so left it unchanged.

Here are the specific doc links:

* [Support for Groups in Custom LDAP Query | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/User+and+Group+Filter+Support+with+LDAP+Atn+Provider+in+HiveServer2#UserandGroupFilterSupportwithLDAPAtnProviderinHiveServer2-SupportforGroupsinCustomLDAPQuery]
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupMembershipKey | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupMembershipKey], 
Thanks for the review [~leftylev]. So with "represents" I meant to indicate that the value for that hive property maps to the attribute name (on the LDAP entries). If there is a better means to express it, please feel free to change it. Thank you again.]
