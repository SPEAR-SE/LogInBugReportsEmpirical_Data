ATTACHMENT ID: 12644976, Ran the tests myself and results look good.
, Thanks Thejas for running the tests! Attaching patch that applies cleanly on branch-0.13., Committed patch to trunk. [~sushanth] can you please commit this to 0.13 branch?, I'm okay with backporting this to 0.13.1, but I want to follow the process I set out for candidates for late inclusion for 0.13.1, and for that, I need two +1s for this. [~thejas] / [~hagleitn] / [~jdere] , would you please confirm that you're okay with this inclusion request?, +1 for 0.13.1
, +1 for 0.13.1, Thanks folks, I'll include this in 0.13.1 RC2., Committed to 0.13 branch., This jira has been fixed as part of 0.13.1 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.
