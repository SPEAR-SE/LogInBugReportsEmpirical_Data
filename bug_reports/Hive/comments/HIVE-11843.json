15	select * from newtypestbl where b<=true;	15	select * from newtypestbl where b<=true sort by c;
29	select * from newtypestbl where b<=true;	29	select * from newtypestbl where b<=true sort by c;
{noformat}
Could you change "sort by c" to "sort by b"? The same as other files in parquet_ppd_date.q file, parquet_ppd_decimal.q and parquet_ppd_timestamp.q.,

What's the issue with 'sort by c'? I am sorting the first string column to match with the rest of the tests. I run the tests with MR1/MR2 and it works correctly., I see. You are using "select *". So it's not problem. +1, Thanks [~Ferd] for reviewing the patch.]
