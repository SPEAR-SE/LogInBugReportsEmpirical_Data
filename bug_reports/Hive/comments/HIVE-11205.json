ATTACHMENT ID: 12744176 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks for the patch [~szczeles]!
I see that the current code is incorrect. Does the code later end up calling authorization for create table ? ie, do we still get the error if the "create table ro_db.test(.. )" is called ? (I am not as familiar with the legacy auth mode, so I can't quickly tell).

Will you also be able to include a test case for this ?
You can create one similar to ./ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive/authorization_1.q
To run test 
cd itests;  mvn  test   -Dtest=TestCliDriver '-Dqfile_regex=.*<your_new_authorization_test>.*'

(replace <your_new_authorization_test> with your new test file name)
