[how is this different from cluster by? U can do a union of two tables and cluster the union on the column(s) that require co-grouping. If the desire is to have co-groups with different schemas - it hadn't been clear to us how we could support this in the language (how can a reducer ingest rows with different schemas) - and this didn't seem like a big deal since one could add dummy rows or do map-side transformations to homogenize., The idea was to merge different rows:

For eg:

A  1 2
A  3 4
A  5


should yield 1 row

A 1 2 3 4 5


I was mistaken about co-group. I thought, it did that. I agree, the user can always write a custom reducer for that. The idea was to make it simpler.
But, after looking at the documentation of co-group, this is redundant
