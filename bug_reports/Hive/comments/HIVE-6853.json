[Attaching a patch that checks if the table uses the HBaseStorageHandler and removes the LOCATION field in the show create table method. , Thanks for the fix, only one minor comment, is it needed to make a StringBuilder when there is only one string to return?

Also can you upload the patch in right name-format?  The precommit test takes patches in the form HIVE-XXXX.patch or HIVE-XXXX.n.patch only., bq: is it needed to make a StringBuilder when there is only one string to return?
Fixed. I removed it and just returned the string. 
, Thanks , for the most part it LGTM.  I guess its not the cleanest, as its breaking the StorageHandler abstraction.  Probably cleaner to add some hook to StorageHandler interface, but due to backward compatibility, its probably not worth it for this use-case.
