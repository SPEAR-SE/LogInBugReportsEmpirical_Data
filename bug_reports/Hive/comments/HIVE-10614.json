[Marked as outage, approved for 1.2, This happens because schematool runs via beeline and when there is a ";" in the command, beeline interprets it as the command terminator. Stored procedures use ";" as delimiter between statements, thus the entire stored procedure does not get send to mysql as a single command  and hence the above error. I am uploading a patch to back out the fix for HIVE-7018 for now. Once we have the fix for HIVE-7018 working with schematool, we can add them back. The task mentioned in the previous line can be done via a follow up jira. cc-ing [~sushanth], [~thejas] for reviewing the change.

Thanks
Hari,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12730668 - PreCommit-HIVE-METASTORE-Test, +1 for current patch, it would work with 1.2 branch. We need another one for master (that also has similar change for hive-schema-1.3.0.mysql.sql)
, [~thejas] Thanks for the review, added HIVE-10614.1.master.patch for the master branch
, As with HIVE-9456, precommit tests would not be able to test anything here. After the requisite 24 hours, I think this can be committed as-is., [~spena] Would the metastore test suite you added be useful to test this ? I see that PreCommit-HIVE-METASTORE-Test-43 got run, but that picked the 1.2 branch patch file, so that result might not be valid.


, Hi [~thejas] 
The script does not test an upgrade skipping hive versions. It only executes the upgrade-a.b.c-to-x.y.z.mysq.sql files. Starting from 0.10.0 until 1.3.0.
For example:
{noformat}
Executing sql test: mysql/hive-schema-0.10.0.mysql.sql
Executing sql test: mysql/upgrade-0.10.0-to-0.11.0.mysql.sql
Executing sql test: mysql/upgrade-0.11.0-to-0.12.0.mysql.sql
Executing sql test: mysql/upgrade-0.12.0-to-0.13.0.mysql.sql
Executing sql test: mysql/upgrade-0.13.0-to-0.14.0.mysql.sql
Executing sql test: mysql/upgrade-0.14.0-to-1.1.0.mysql.sql
Executing sql test: mysql/upgrade-1.1.0-to-1.2.0.mysql.sql
Executing sql test: mysql/upgrade-1.2.0-to-1.3.0.mysql.sql
{noformat}

How does the schemaTool work? Does it try to upgrade from hive-schema-0.14.0 to hive-schema-1.3.0 directly?, schematool upgrades one version at a time. 
It uses the version order specified in ./metastore/scripts/upgrade/<dbtype>/upgrade.order.<dbtype> (eg ./metastore/scripts/upgrade/mysql/upgrade.order.mysql).

Though it says "no tests executed", everything it ran seems to have succeeded. It looks like the run was actually successful. But I am not sure about the scope of the tests being run, can you please take a quick look ? http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-METASTORE-Test/47/console

Tests were run successfully!.

I noticed there is a bug on the test script. I just filed a bug (HIVE-10634), and attach a patch to fix it., Cool, will go ahead and commit HIVE-10614.1.patch to master and HIVE-10614.1.branch-0.12.patch to branch-1.2.

[~hsubramaniyan], could you please file another jira and link it to HIVE-7018 and this jira as a follow-up jira to address removal of LINK_TARGET_ID in a manner that is schematool compliant?, Committed to branch-1.2.

Thanks, Hari, Thejas & Sergio!, [~sushanth] Thanks, HIVE-10635 is the follow-up jira.

Thanks
Hari, Reopening to address follow up issue discovered by Dmitrii Vitiiuk and Thejas - there is a missing comma that causes hive-1.2.0-schema.sql to fail when setting up a fresh metastore. Ditto with 1.3., Additional patches attached. These are not standalone patches - they apply on top of the existing patches., +1
Lets get this in soon, otherwise trunk and 1.2 branch are broken.
, Yup, skipping 24hour wait for this - it's either that or we revert the patch, and reverting the patch is no good either, because that breaks schematool. I will go ahead and commit., Addendum committed on branch-1.2 and master., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
