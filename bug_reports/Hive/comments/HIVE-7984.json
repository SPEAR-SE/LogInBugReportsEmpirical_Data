[I think the cause is that {{PlanUtils.configureInputJobPropertiesForStorageHandler(TableDesc)}} or {{PlanUtils.configureOutputJobPropertiesForStorageHandler(TableDesc)}} aren't called in the Tez "pipeline". Still trying to figure out where exactly that should go., After a bunch of digging, I found that I could still work around this via the custom OutputFormat for Accumulo without having to actually dig into the calls to the StorageHandler WRT to the execution engine., Fixes the OutputFormat to be a little more resilient. Also removed a really nasty log.info statement that shouldn't have been committed in the first place., Same changes, but named the original attachment wrong. Fixing suffix to trigger HIVE-QA, reupload to make precommit tests happy.,

Thanks [~elserj]!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
