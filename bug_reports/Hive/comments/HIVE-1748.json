[Can you upload the patch here ?

It needs to be committed here first, before we can deploy internally in facebook, @Namit added.

It took a while as I had to check out Hive from Apache's repo and apply my patch to that; is there a better way to create patches against the Apache repos from the internal one?, Depends on which internal branch you are working off - we can take it offline, I can go over the internal branch structure with you tomorrow, +1

Looks good - the patch was generated from a higher level directory - for now, I manually removed trunk/ from it, Committed. Thanks Paul]
