[The {{SimpleStruct}} UDF java code to reproduce the issue., This was fixed by HIVE-7027, right?, This bug consists of two parts. 

1. The query cannot be executed without the predicate pushdown because the column descriptor associated can be changed in an unexpected way during Hive query transformation under some certain conditions.  This was fixed in HIVE-7027. The essence of the patch is an [one line fix|https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/cf2ad57d21a77ad4f6f2deb72a576b90275d6055#diff-e0b3d4ba0783fc2f31724d01aa6f65a7]  fix that makes sure the column description are copied.

2. Hive 0.13.1 didn't perform the predicate pushdown for {{UDF().xx}} because of the following lines in [oah.hive.ql.ppdOpProcFactory.createFilter|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-0.13/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/ppd/OpProcFactory.java#L706]:
{code}
    ExprNodeDesc condn = ExprNodeDescUtils.mergePredicates(preds);
    if(!(condn instanceof ExprNodeGenericFuncDesc)) {
      return null;
    }
{code}

This was fixed as a by-product in HIVE-7826, see the [changes to OpProcFactory class |https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/98992da55cbe7b2647bad7bb69f9587c320c805a#diff-3e9f4827f7991810570353623f74f3d9]
