[Add the hbase-config into hive-site.xml:

<property>
<name>hive.aux.jars.path</name>
<value>file:///etc/hbase/conf/</value>
</property>

, Ping. Does this solution resolve your issue?, [~amalakar] I tested this put on the latest version of hive with kerberos enabled and these queries succeed just fine. Is this still a problem for you or are we good to close this one?, [~amalakar] Like I mentioned, I tested this out on a kerberos enabled cluster and was able to create and run queries just fine. This issue should have been fixed with HIVE-8874 where we added the capability to retrieve the auth tokens from HBase.

Please feel free to open another one if you continue to see issues., I don't have the setup to test this, will reopen if I see it again. Thanks! ]
