ATTACHMENT ID: 12660295, cc-ing [~jnp] [~ehans] [~ashutoshc] for review. Given that HIVE-7166 is not commited, without either of HIVE-7166 or HIVE-7260, between operator with vectorization in hive is broken.

Thanks
Hari, cc-ing [~mmccline] for this issue. Follow-up of HIVE-7166.

Thanks
Hari, I am unassigning this jira from myself since there has been no response from anyone and I am no longer 100% up-to-date with vectorization code path.]
