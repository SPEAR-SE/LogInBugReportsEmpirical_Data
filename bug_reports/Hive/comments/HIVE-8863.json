[Hi Juan,

   I tried to reproduce the issue but it's working fine in hive-0.9.0-bin version with local mode. Below are the logs.

Can you help me providing simple steps to reproduce the issue and How much data present in Test table , what hive version , configuration details hive-site.xml of your environment.



Thanks,

   , Hi [~Prabhu Joseph] Thanks for looking at this issue.
I use hive 0.12.
just compute table statistics is fine, but after compute column statistics, I cannot drop the table.
Could you try " analyze table Test compute statistics for columns col"?
you can verify if there is any record inserted into TAB_COL_STATS. once there are records, you cannot drop table "Test"., Hi Juan,

   The issue got reproduced in my machine with hive 0.12 version. I am using Derby for metastore in server mode. Earlier when i drop the table i recieved different exception.
  
    drop table Test;

The error i got is 

Caused by: MetaException(message:java.lang.RuntimeException: commitTransaction was called but openTransactionCalls = 0. This probably indicates that there are unbalanced calls to openTransaction/commitTransaction)

After applying HIVE-4996 patch, receiving same exception you have reported.

drop table Test;

NestedThrowablesStackTrace:
java.sql.BatchUpdateException: DELETE on table 'TBLS' caused a violation of foreign key constraint 'TAB_COL_STATS_FK1' for key (19).  

But with or without applying patch, drop table test; [ small 't'] works.

There is some issue.

 , [~jyu@cloudera.com] what database you are using? I am not able to reproduce the issue with trunk code against postgresql., [~jyu@cloudera.com] what database you are using? I am not able to reproduce the issue with trunk code against postgresql., I tested with both mysql and postgresql. but I am not using trunk version. , This case issue does not only occur to the table, but also to the database. For example, drop table TESTDB.test will also fail after compute statistics. Upload a patch with tests., Patch looks good. But it seems we might have problem for partitioned table as well, looking at ObjectStore::deletePartitionColumnStatistics() which looks like suffer from same casing problem
{code}
   mStatsObj = (MPartitionColumnStatistics)query.executeWithArray(partName.trim(),
                                                dbName.trim(), tableName.trim(), colName.trim());
{code}
Can you test dropping a particular partition of a table which has statistics as well as dropping a partition table altogether?, Chaoyu, HIVE-6335 similar issue has been raised earlier, please close this as well.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12682495 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks [~ashutoshc] for pointing that out. Yes, drop partition also has this case sensitivity issue. I created a new patch to cover this case as well and uploaded it to https://reviews.apache.org/r/28286 for review. Thanks.
, Thanks [~Prabhu Joseph], I will also take a look at HIVE-6335 to see if it has the same cause., +1 pending tests,
