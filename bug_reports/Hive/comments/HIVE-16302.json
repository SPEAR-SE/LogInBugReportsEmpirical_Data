[This issue occurs because junit dependency is missing. Hadoop 2.7 has a transitive dependency for junit via commons-httpclient and the commons-httpclient dependency was removed by HADOOP-12552. I'll create a patch to add the junit dependency explicitly., Attaching a patch. With the patch, I can execute {{mvn install -DskipTests}} successfully with Hadoop 2.9.0-SNAPSHOT.,
