[[~stakiar] [~Ferd] Have you seen this error before?, Haven't seen this before, not sure why it would be vectorization specific., Not likely to cause by Vectorization, will try to reproduce it locally., HI [~Ferd] I investigated this and in the end found that it a problem with my local dev environment (git conflict issue due to which close() method for VectorizedParquetRecordReader was missed.). When I fixed that, I don't see the issue anymore. Thanks for responding.]
