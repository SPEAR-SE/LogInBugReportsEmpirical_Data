[yeah.. its better to use HiveParser.TOK_FUNCTIONDI there instead., Hi [~jcamachorodriguez],
I would like to provide a meaningful unit test for this case, but I am a bit lost in the CalcitePlanner.
My first approach was to generate a simple syntax tree containing a TOK_FUNCTIONDI, then set it on the QueryBlock of a CalcitePlanner, and call the CalcitePlanner#getOptimizedAST, but it seems the QueryBlock needs a lot more setup than just an ASTNode to work properly.
Since you are handling CBO jiras, could you maybe help me with a better approach?

Alternatively I can provide a unit test of an ASTNode showing that TOK_FUNCTIONDI and other tokens are indeed turned lowercase in the string tree., Thank you for the reply [~ashutoshc], of course I am happy for comments from anyone, not just Jesus.

ParseUtils#containsTokenOfType(ASTNode root, Integer ... tokens) I guess would be equivalent with the contains on the string tree, without the burden of case sensitivity., Agreed that the check should be on the token, thus using containsTokenOfType makes sense. To see whether we are hitting the block, you could add a negative q test with a query that contains a distinct without an aggregation (since that is what the block is about)., I have added the patch with a negative qtest and the change to ParseUtils#containsTokenOfType.
The semantic exception is only thrown when we look for a token in the ASTNode, and is not thrown for the String#contains check., +1 pending tests,
