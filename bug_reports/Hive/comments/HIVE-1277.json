[*Changes:*

- Modified the {{MapRedTask.execute()}} to test if the scratch directory exists.
- If the scratch directory does not exist, an attempt is made to create it using {{File.mkdirs()}} call. 
- If the call to create does not succeed and the directory still does not exist, an exception is raised to indicate a failure condition.
- A new unchecked exception type is introduced {{TaskExecutionException}} to be used as a generic mechanism to signal execution failures.
- Added a package-info.java file for the package.

*Testing Done*
- Built with default Hadoop as well as version 0.17.2.1.
- Running tests against Hadoop 0.17.2.1 since the past hour, no failures recorded yet., Please see comments associated with the patch attachment., Can you generate a patch using svn ?, This is the same as the previously submitted patch, only this time generated using {{svn diff}}., For the record, this bug happens when the local scratch directory is missing *and* - either the job tracker is not configured (i.e., is local) or the property {{hive.exec.submitviachild}} is set to {{true}}., +1

looks good, Committed. Thanks Arvind]
