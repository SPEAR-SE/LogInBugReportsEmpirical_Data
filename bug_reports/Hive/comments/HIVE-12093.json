[Have you tried running with tez execution engine ? (set hive.execution.engine=tez). It does away with this local task.
, Normal with tez execution engine ,  with mr execution engine cost long time , [~cqliu] Is this issue reproducible? Can you turn on debug mode to see how time is spent between those two log messages? , https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12217
this issue can cause mapjoin very slowlly when MapJoinKeyObject is org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.io.DoubleWritable extends org.apache.hadoop.io.DoubleWritable 
, Yeah. We have such issue. HIVE-11502 and HIVE-11761 seems to have fixed this issue for map-side GROUPBY. Do you already have such fix?, yeah ,  after  use  cast as string  ,   run normal   . 
close this issue
