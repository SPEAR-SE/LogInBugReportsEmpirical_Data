ATTACHMENT ID: 12860804 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~ctang.ma], [~vihangk1] could you take a look? This is mainly an improvement to the ptest framework. The {{hive.log}} file prints out the contents of the {{PreExecutePrinter}} and {{PostExecutePrinter}} as ERROR messages. They aren't really errors, so this patch changes them to INFO level.

Failed tests are flaky:

HIVE-16256 - TestCliDriver.testCliDriver[comments]
HIVE-15776 - TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[vector_if_expr]
HIVE-16312 - TestHCatClient.testTransportFailure, cc: [~prasanth_j], I do not know if there is any particular reason that console.printError instead of printInfo was used in HIVE-14936. Otherwise, the patch looks good to me. 
+1., As long as printInfo goes to STDERR it should be fine. If it goes to STDOUT then it will break scripts that rely on stdout redirection for query result., Thanks [~prasanth_j], I took a look at the code and {{printInfo}} prints to {{SessionState.info}} which is redirected to STDERR. So this patch shouldn't break the scripts you referenced., [~prasanth_j], [~ctang.ma] is this good to be merged?, Yes. Looks good for merge. I took a look at printInfo as well and it is using STDERR. So should be fine. , Committed to 2.3.0 & 3.0.0. Thanks [~stakiar]., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
