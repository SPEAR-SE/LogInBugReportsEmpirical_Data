[[~ashutoshc] and [~rhbutani], do you have any idea why this is happening? Thanks., Out of three queries cited in description, atleast 1 one of those {{join_nullsafe.q}} was impacted in fix of HIVE-9025 and should have been fixed after that. [~csun] Did you run these tests with fix of HIVE-9025 applied?

Other than that, OTOH I don't have a theory what might be wrong here., [~ashutoshc] Yes, I ran them with the HIVE-9025 patch. To me, they appear to be a different issue - when I debugged into it, the hash code issue in HIVE-9025 is gone., [~ashutoshc], any further idea on this? Thanks., Not really. Probably need to do git bisect to figure out which commit brought in this bug., Hi [~tedxu], looks like this is related to Constant Propagation. The (partial) plan with this optimization:

And diff for this part (on the left is the plan w/o the optimization):

---
>                 expressions: l_orderkey (type: int), 1 (type: int)
{noformat}

Notice that on line 85, the MR partition column {{_col4}} has been optimized away, which causes an inconsistency.
Later on, output rows for join will be hashed to different reducers, and therefore introduces wrong results.

I saw that [~navis] has a [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7232?focusedCommentId=14032106&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14032106] about some similar issue, maybe it's related?

I'm not an expert in Constant Propagation, and I'm thinking whether you can take a look at this issue? Thanks., Forgot to mention, the plan from last comment is for the last query in {{subquery_in}}:

{code}
-- non agg, corr, with join in Parent Query
select p.p_partkey, li.l_suppkey
from (select distinct l_partkey as p_partkey from lineitem) p join lineitem li on p.p_partkey = li.l_partkey
where li.l_linenumber = 1 and
 li.l_orderkey in (select l_orderkey from lineitem where l_shipmode = 'AIR' and l_linenumber = li.l_linenumber)
;
{code}, Thanks [~csun].

Looks like [HIVE-9025], I will look into this. , Hi [~tedxu], I'm assigning this to you for investigation/fix. Thanks., Thanks [~xuefuz], it is a bug of constant propagation optimizer.

I'm running the unit tests and hopefully will get the patch ready soon.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12691908 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Code changes looks good to me. Failures are just updates to golden files. 
[~csun] since you found bug originally. Would you like to run this through your test cases to make sure those cases are covered. , [~ashutoshc] OK, will do it., I ran a few tests and the issue is gone.
Although ppd_multi_insert.q has a ordering issue: when mapred.reduce.tasks is set larger than one it generates same results with different order, even with {{SORT_QUERY_RESULTS}}. But, this is irrelevant and can be addressed in a separate JIRA., Regenerated golden files., cool. thanks for checking. +1, Thanks [~csun] and [~ashutoshc]!,
