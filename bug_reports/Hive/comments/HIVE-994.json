[String comparison works for me on 0.18.3 with the latest trunk.

@Nhan: Can you include the output of "select * from staff" and "describe extended staff"?
, Hi Steinbach,

Thanks for looking into this problem. Here's the complete output of your requested queries

{code}
hive> select * from staff;

I believe this has nothing to do with Hadoop as when I switch back to Hive stable release 0.4.0 with hive-default.xml copied from my current Hive, string comparison just works perfectly.

Thanks,, I found that the problem occurs only from r889672. Previous revisions don't have this problem.

Thanks, Nhan, please try:

{code}
select *, length(name) from staff;
{code}

It's likely that the name column in your table has trailing spaces.
, Blocker for 0.5, Hi Shao,

Here's the output of your query. It shows correct length of each entry.

So, you could see that in r889672 we have 
{code}
expr: (name = '"Peter"')
{code}

while in r889506 we have 
{code}
expr: (name = 'Peter')
{code}

Do I miss something? Am I the only one that have this problem ?

Thanks, This definitely is a bug. I will take a look., Nhan, I cannot reproduce your problem with r889672.
Can you check if you have any local modifications?
, I make no change to the source code. Just gets the code synced with trunk and rebuilds Hive. However, the problem has gone when I tried a clean svn checkout. I guess the problem occurred because I compiled new code without cleaning the old compiled code first.

Thanks alot for your help Zheng.
