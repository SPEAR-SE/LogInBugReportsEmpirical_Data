[Patch v1 has some issues - uploading a new one shortly., [~aihuaxu] Thanks for the comments on rb. As you have also identified, there are some issues with v1 patch (I re-read the Query.close API to figure that calling close aggressively will cause losing the iterators). I'll upload a new patch shortly - we need some way to close the query object other than in places which you plan to do in HIVE-11021.
, Thanks Vaibhav. Will check the new patch when it's ready., Hi [~vgumashta] Any updates on that? Sorry to push you on that. Our customer is waiting on the fix. , [~aihuaxu] I'm OOO for next few days. Please feel free to take over if you have a potential solution. If you can wait, I plan to work on this after 07/05. Thanks for checking back., [~aihuaxu] I'm OOO for next few days. Please feel free to take over if you have a potential solution. If you can wait, I plan to work on this after 07/05. Thanks for checking back., Got it. Thanks for letting me know. I will take over then and try to work on it. Haven't looked too much on the solution yet. Will keep you posted., [~vgumashta] I was looking into two solutions. 1. a wapper class for the JDO query result which will dispose the resources when the wrapper class gets garbage collected automatically.  But this approach could still cause issues that resources like cursors may not get released soon enough.  2. Clone query result to a new list to force iterating the result and return that new list and then call query.closeAll() immediately. I will work on the second approach, , In the patch, we clone the query result to a new list if the query result is a list and was directly returned.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12741627 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Seems both tests are unrelated. TestPigHBaseStorageHandler test passed locally., The new patch takes a different approach. It creates QueryWrapper class the caller needs to pass to the callee and then the caller will call QueryWrapper.query.closeAll() to release resources when it's consumed the data. 

I went through all the cases and did some refactoring so we can can call closeAll() within the callee as much as possible. And also try to handle releasing resources within ObjectStore. Based on the usage from HMS, we won't add too much memory consumption when in some cases, we try to return the whole list.   ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12742160 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~aihuaxu] I'll be able to look at the patch today. Thanks for the effort., [~aihuaxu] Were you able to reproduce the db leak at your end? In our setup, when we used oracle as the metastore db, we saw oracle running out of cursors. I'll try to run the patch through that system test as well. , Really appreciate it if you can review the code, give it  a test so that we can move it forward [~vgumashta].  Actually the customers are seeing the "out of cursors" in the production. I'm trying to repro locally (not able to repro yet). It would be great if you can try out on the test system.  , [~aihuaxu] I left some comments on RB., [~aihuaxu] Are those users also seeing the failures when Oracle is used as the metastore database ? In the internal testing at Hortonworks, we have seen it only with Oracle.
This happens in our concurrency test suite, where many queries are hitting HS2 in parallel.
, [~thejas] Yes. Those users are all using Oracle as the metastore database.  , Address feedback by fixing some possible leaks in MetastoredirectSql class., nit: patch appears to add tabs,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12742829 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~aihuaxu] Patch looks good to me except the nits that Sergey mentioned. I wonder if [~vgumashta] had a chance to run his tests to verify it could resolve his issue as well., [~ctang.ma] and [~sershe]. I double checked the patch. Those are not "tab" but some extra spaces when formatting the string. , +1, [~aihuaxu] I'm back to work. Will review and try your patch today. , +1 on the patch. Tests will take few hrs to report results. , Thanks [~vgumashta] for doing the testing., [~aihuaxu] I'll need one more day to report the status of the tests. Thanks for your patience., [~aihuaxu] Although the tests are still running (I fired a run that will go on for multiple days), we have not seen any failure yet. Typically in past, we would have hit the cursor issue by now. So looks like we're all good. I'll commit this shortly., [~aihuaxu] The patch (.3) does not apply cleanly. Can you check?, [~vgumashta] ObjectStore.java seems to have been changed after the patch unload. Let me regenerate the patch., [~vgumashta] Please commit the new .3 patch. I just regenerated with the new code. Thanks.,
