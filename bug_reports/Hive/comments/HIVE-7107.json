ATTACHMENT ID: 12646059, I'm pretty sure none of those tests are related to my patch. All other patches tested around the same time fail on the same tests., HS1 is no longer actively maintained and will soon be removed. See, HIVE-6977 Please provide only HS2 patches., This patch *does* actively maintain HS1 and there's no timeline or patch for HIVE-6977.

Who knows when HIVE-6977 will actually happen. It'd not be the first time that things slip because some company decides that they need a release of Hive.

Feel free to ignore this patch. I'm not going to provide a new one., https://reviews.apache.org/r/24076/

I realize that HS1 is scheduled to be removed but I submitted this before 0.13.1 was released and maybe 0.13.2 will be released still. Also I think there's a chance that some distributions will keep HS1 in for a bit longer and this patch fixes an issue with it. I also don't see any harm in maintaining code that's scheduled to be removed at some point., Lars,
I usually prefer large cleanups (relative to the fix) to be done as part of separate jira. That way it is easier to determine what part was the actual fix, while looking at svn/git history. I feel around 10-20% of changes in a bug fix being cleanup is OK, but more than 80% of the changes for a bug fix being cleanup makes it little difficult to handle.
I can review a separate HiveServer* cleanup patch in another jira.

, Sure, I'll prepare a separate patch. Thanks for taking a look., This is the patch for the mentioned JDBC issue and without any cleanup., I have also updated Review Board. [~thejas] it should be ready for review now, thanks!, +1,
