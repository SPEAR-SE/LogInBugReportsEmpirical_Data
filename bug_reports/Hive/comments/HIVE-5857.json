ATTACHMENT ID: 12614761, [~kawaa]: Thanks for providing a fix. In order to get committed this patch needs a test case. Can you please add a qfile test that enables ubertask mode before running an aggregation query? Thanks., [~cwsteinbach] Thanks for having a look on this patch. I will prepare tests during next week., Hi Adam, thanks for the patch/test.  I tried running your test, but when it runs as a regular q file test it doesn't actually fail when I comment out your fix. I've taken the liberty of making the test a MiniMR test, which does fail without your fix. Patch attached., Question, your fix only kicks in in the case of REDUCE_PLAN_NAME .. would we ever need to worry about MAP_PLAN_NAME?, {code}
 } catch (FileNotFoundException fnf) {
>       // happens. e.g.: no reduce work.
>       LOG.debug("No plan file found: "+path);
>       return null;
>     } ...
{code}

Can we remove this code? This bothers me. It is not self documenting all. Can we use if statements to determine when the file should be there and when it should not. 

Something like:
if (job.hasNoReduceWork()){
  retur null;
} else {
throw RuntimeException("work should be found but was not" + expectedPathToFile);,

About [this|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5857?focusedCommentId=14029325&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14029325], is there a way to know if a job should have reduce work or not, based on the conf or job? Would we be able to fix that part as a separate item?,
