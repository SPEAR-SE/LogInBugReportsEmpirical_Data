ATTACHMENT ID: 12708085 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, Patch committed.  Thanks Alexander.

TestStreaming passes with patch on my box.  MiniMRCluster .q file doesn't return in a rational amount of time.  But I see it failing on other patch tests as well., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
