[Attached the patch which added deprecated inner class and initSerDeParams() back., +1 lgtm.  Minor suggestion is to annotate the new class with public and stability interfaces to make it clear-er in future., Thanks [~szehon] for reviewing. I attached the new patch to address the comments., Thanks Aihua!  Do you think LazySimpleSerDe also need the annotations (the method is on there) ?, +1 thanks!,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12773587 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Seems the tests are not related., [~szehon] We should only commit the patch to branch-1, not to master branch since it's OK to break in 2.0.0 version, right? , Talked to Szehon offline. I will commit both branches and then worry about removing the deprecated interface later., Committed to branch-1 and master. Thanks Szehon for reviewing the code.]
