[This looks like it might be related to using setRef() in BytesColumnVector whe setVal() should be used. That is something to look into., Also, I recall in a past an error that looked similar to this, which I think was related to incorrect column re-use within batches. The code for that was in VectorizationContext., Assigner doesn't take into account length, so when the object is reused it gets the maximum length previously set. , [~mmccline] [~jnp] can you take a look?

[~gopalv] fyi, Fix looks good.  Thanks for finding the problem!
