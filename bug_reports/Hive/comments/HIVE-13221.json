ATTACHMENT ID: 12792324 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~thejas] [~sushanth] ping?, I've been intending to review this forever and not finding time to do so. Sorry for the delay! :(

I'm a strong +1 on the intent of this patch, and would definitely like to see it in. :)

Looking at the code itself, I'm mostly +1, I have a couple of questions regarding the following comment:

{noformat}
      // Note that this doesn't start metastore (ACID) background threads.
{noformat}

Why not?

I guess I don't yet know enough about the background ACID threads to know if they're safe to be started across multiple instances, but I would imagine so? (Otherwise, is there some config that keeps them from trampling on each other if multiple HMS instances are running on a single cluster?) But if they were safe to run on multiple instances, is there a reason we don't start them here? If this was enabled, I can see a case wherein, for small warehouses, they only ever run a single HS2+HMS service. I think that would be the biggest usecase for this patch.

Also, from a brief run-through, it looks like the ACID threads are instantiated at HMSHandler.init() time, so each HMSHandler that the metastore creates would invoke them, would it not? So I would imagine that they're started anyway, which confuses me. (Unless that's what you meant by saying that that doesn't start the ACID background threads, in that that's not where they are started.), as of HIVE-11388 it is safe to start multiple instance of ACID background task.  
Prior to HIVE-11388, it was expected that hive.compactor.initiator.on = true for only 1 standalone metastore in the cluster (not enforced).
This prop is checked in HiveMetaStore before stating these threads (except for Worker which was always ok to have multiple instance of).
Further, before HIVE-11388, the expectation was that only 1 instance of each thread (except Worker) is started in the single metastore instance.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12792324 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Well, to the original question, the threads are not started because this ticket is about exposing APIs ;)
I just added the comment to avoid confusion as the init is kind of convoluted.]
