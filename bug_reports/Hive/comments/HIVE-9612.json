[Hey guys when you are in there, do you mind turning off 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.ObjectStore' as well?   That was my fault from awhile back in adding that debug log, and noticed it also tends to spam logs., Appreciate it, will be a big help.  Though for the lazy objects debug log, that might be needed in hive-exec as well as Brock indicated?,
