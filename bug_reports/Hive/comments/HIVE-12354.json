[LGTM. [~t3rmin4t0r]/[~ashutoshc] take a look?, I wonder if its better to have {{long result}} instead of {{int result}} since than there is a lesser possibility of repeated overflow in {{result = prime * result + hashCode;}} and than at last {{return (long) result}}, Taken from Arrays hashCode. Repeated overflow may produce more variability in the low bits, I dunno.
Tested it locally btw, the code does execute on double join at least :), HIVE-11502 has the same issue. Can this be put into util method and used in both places?,
