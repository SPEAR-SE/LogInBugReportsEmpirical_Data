[this has the advantage that it makes it easier(possible) to pass various hadoop props to the LauncherTask.
We should make sure to Release note this since up until now only very specific properties supported in webhcat-site.xml would be passed to LauncherTask.  With this change all of core-site.xml and other settings will be passed.  It may catch users by surprise.

+1, The rel note should also mention that, for example, if templeton.mapper.memory.mb is set in webhcat-site.xml, it will overwrite mapreduce.map.memory.mb in hadoop conf files.  This is just one example., Patch committed to master and 1.2 branch.
Thanks for review Eugene!, Unfortunately this has unexpected side effects.
Every time a job is submitted, various properties are passed in cmd line using -Dfoo=bar

This change causes AppConfig Configuration object to accumulate the union of all these properties so Job N+1 includes properties that belong previous jobs.

for example, if you run a job with "-D, templeton.statusdir=TestSqoop_1" and then another job that does not specify "statusdir", the 2nd job will write to TestSqoop_1....

this will cause a major problem
