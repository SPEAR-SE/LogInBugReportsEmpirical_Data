[The RPCs in the [WebHCat REST API|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference] can be divided divided into the following categories:
# General (version, status, etc)
# DDL
# MapReduce job submission
# Pig job submission
# Hive job submission
# Queue (job management, deprecated)
# Jobs (job management)

We should provide administrators with the ability to selectively disable categories 2-7 by setting properties in the WebHCat configuration file. By default all categories will be enabled.
