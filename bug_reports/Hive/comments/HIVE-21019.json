[[~ychena] I don't think it is a good idea to turn off the optimization in tests. We should fix the underlying issue. I am closing this and marking it as duplicate of HIVE-16100 since that fixes the problem., [~vgarg], turn off because the test is always tested the case when the optimization is off before, just recent changes of 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20703 . makes the optimization can be turn on in default setup. Turn off it explicitly just do not want to lose the test scenario. I do not mind that this jira will be never checked in, as long as you can add more test when fix HIVE-16100 to test both case (the optimization is on or off). , Hi [~ychena] These tests are testing {{stats auto gathering}} functionality on "default configuration". since HIVE-20703 and HIVE-20915 have updated the default configuration by enabling SDPO these tests should continue testing the original functionality on that configuration.

I closed this JIRA since you were updating existing tests. If you would like to add tests for auto gather statistics for both cases feel free to reopen the JIRA and add new tests (without disabling the optimization for existing ones)., Sure, I can work on the test once you fix HIVE-16100.]
