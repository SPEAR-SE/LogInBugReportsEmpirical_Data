ATTACHMENT ID: 12676235 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, why is it only done for string? just checking, doesn't require changes. Will it work if there's say an int column, and cast is introduced by CBO internally?

 If yes +1, This patch remembers string representation of constant of any type. So, source type can be anything, but  target type needs to be string when cast is happening. AFAICT, this problem of change of representation can only  happen when target is string, but I havent tested other types. If it turns out change of representation happens for other type, we can address them in subsequent jiras., Added test for more types., My +1 still stands, Committed to trunk. 
[~vikram.dixit]  ok for 0.14 ?, +1 for 0.14, Committed to 0.14, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
