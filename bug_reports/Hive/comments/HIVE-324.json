[Since it's a temporary path will remove  in the end of that function, we can use a relatively path.  , Assigning., I think this should go into the tmp file that is created for the query as that gets automatically cleaned up once the query is done its execution. The correct way would be to augment moveWork to include a tmp directory and then pass it from SemanticAnalyzer by first generating the name there using the getTmpFile() call. You can look at the SemanticAnalyzer.java to see how this happens.

Thanks,

, look at the function getTmpFileName() in BaseSemanticAnalyzer.java - it creates a dummy file, which is automatically cleared at the end of the query
You should use the same function to generate tmp files, Is this issue considered a blocker for 0.3.0? Perhaps it can go into 0.3.1?, Actually I have a fox for this almost ready. If I get it in the next few hours  I think we can get it in before we start the vote.
, Fix that creates the temporary directory in the query scratch area., I assume all of those xml files shouldn't be in the patch?, Actually, they are a part of the patch. The plan files have changed as I have pushed the information of the temporary directory into the loadTableDesc. This is used in the move task. We had been hardcoding this in path to /tmp in the code previously.
, QTestUtils.java: nitpick: Do you want to extract the repetitive code for loading a table and checking the results into a method?
ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/metadata/Hive.java: Please remove: Random randGen = new Random();
, Fixed issues raised by Zheng.
, +1. Will commit soon., Thanks Ashish!, hey.. this didn't get committed to trunk.q, and it doesn't get patched to trunk cleanly..., My bad. Fortunately the conflicts are all in test xml results. I am merging and testing right now, and will commit it once passed., Committed to trunk.]
