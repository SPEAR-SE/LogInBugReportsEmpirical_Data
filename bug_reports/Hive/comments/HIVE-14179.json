[Currently the only way to deal with this is to run compaction to reduce number of delta files and then run the queries.  hive.compactor.max.num.delta introduced in HIVE-11540 is relevant here.  If number of deltas is extreme, HIVE-12403 may still be an issue., Hello, I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release.]
