[You are right, there is no support for a regex on tables in grant statements in sql std authorization. That would be nice to have.
There are more flexible granting is possible via Ranger.
, Agreed Ranger is nice but not everybody has Ranger, I have it on the other cluster but haven't deployed it to this one yet, and other distributions don't even have Ranger yet.

From Hive's perspective this should be solvable using native SQL grants.

The whole point of SQLStdAuth was to be similar to grants in RDBMS and since they can do grant  on <db>.* then Hive should support this syntax also.]
