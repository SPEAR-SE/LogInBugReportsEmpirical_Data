[How do we handle 'null' condition? I am not sure what does standard say although Postgres allows it, Standard says {{<join condition>}} syntax is {{::ON <search condition>}} (SQL99 pg. 238) and {{<search condition>}} is the same as {{<boolean value expression>}} (SQL99 pg. 322). I guess {{NULL}} does satisfy the criteria, since is a valid value for a boolean. I think the NULL condition should not match any rows.]
