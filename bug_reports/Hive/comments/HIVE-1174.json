[+1. Will test and commit.
, The problem in this jira is:
1) countJobs in Driver only count map-reduce tasks. 
2) For mergeJob, there are two tasks (one dummyMove, and one merge task which is a MRTask). It will count 1 job because dummyMove is not a MapReduceTask
3) But a bug in ConditionalTask will  always inc jobCounter by 1 when removing a task from candidate task list, even though it is not a MRTask,, Committed. Thanks Yongqiang!]
