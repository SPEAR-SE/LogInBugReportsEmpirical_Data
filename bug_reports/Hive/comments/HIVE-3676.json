[Prior to HIVE-3465 the following set of statements produced the expected result:

{noformat}
CREATE DATABASE db2;
USE db2;
CREATE TABLE result(col1 STRING);
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE result SELECT 'db2_insert1' FROM default.src LIMIT 1;
INSERT INTO TABLE result SELECT 'db2_insert2' FROM default.src LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM result;
> db_insert1
> db_insert2
{noformat}

While the following set of statements produced inaccurate results:
{noformat}
CREATE DATABASE db1;
CREATE TABLE db1.result(col1 STRING);
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE db1.result SELECT 'db1_insert1' FROM src LIMIT 1;
INSERT INTO TABLE db1.result SELECT 'db1_insert2' FROM src LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM db1.result;
> db1_insert2
{noformat}

After HIVE-3465 the first set of statements produces inaccurate results, while the second set of statements now behaves as expected.

, Carl / Navis, 
After this commit ant test -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=insert1.q is failing consistently on trunk. First failure was reported on https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1805/

Can you take a look?, @Ashutosh,
Newly added test case seemed not deterministic. I'll fix this in another issue. Sorry., Thanks, Navis for taking a look. Yeah, it seems non-deterministic. It passed for me on one machine, but failed on other two. Appreciate your help. If you are going to open a new jira to fix this, feel free to resolve this one., This is getting taken care of in HIVE-3749, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1821 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1821/])
    HIVE-3749 : New test cases added by HIVE-3676 in insert1.q is not deterministic (Navis via Ashutosh Chauhan) (Revision 1414488)
