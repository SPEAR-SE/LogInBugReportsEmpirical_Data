The patch removes lower-case items from input to avoid collision in partition directories in this test., [~ashutoshc] can you take a look?, [~sershe], i am sorry that i do not get it. you just remove distinct a, b, c.. etc, why there is collision?, [~pxiong] the FS on Mac is case-insensitive, Retrying the same patch., [~sershe], i have already committed this just now as part of HIVE-15297.... Besides escape1, we just need to modify escape2.q., as part of HIVE-15297, Thanks a lot for your patch. :), The patch was not committed properly as part of [~pxiong]'s patch.
