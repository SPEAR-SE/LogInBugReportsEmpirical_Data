[I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release., [~nishantbangarwa], I think this is fixed now? Can we close pointing to issue that fixed the issue? Thanks, Null handling still un-merged yet... pending on reviewsÂ https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/5278]
