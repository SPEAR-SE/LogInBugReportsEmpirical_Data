[[~alangates] could you review please, Why is it that insert should get an exclusive lock for non-acid tables?  Two inserts still can't interfere with each other in any way.  Insert overwrite should certainly get an xlock, but I believe it already does., Because unless you have MVCC architecture in your data so that readers can lock in a snapshot, any modification must block readers., Well, not necessarily.  As it stands now non-ACID readers get read committed consistency.  So you're arguing that both acid and non-acid tables should have the same consistency model.  I need to think about that.  It's not obvious to me whether that should be true or not., That is the behavior documented previously in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Locking.  W/o this, if users enable ACID but continue to run their existing workflows with non-acid resources they end up with with different semantics than before and they have no way to get those semantics back except to disable acid.  ,
