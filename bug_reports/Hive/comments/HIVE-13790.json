[Nothing new about this JIRA? Nobody tried to use a SYSLOG appender with Hive 2.0.0?, Shouldn't the loggerFields need the keys to be set in MDC? AFAIK hive does not set any keys to MDC., Hi [~prasanth_j],

I tried to set the keys in MDC without a better result. Hive seems to ignore the MDC configuration.]
