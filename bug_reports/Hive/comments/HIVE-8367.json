[The issue comes out when input sizes are large enough that they exceed one map task.
This patch fixes it by turning on reduce deduplication in the optimizer (which was being turned off before) and dropping the minimum number of reducers to 1 (instead of 4). This has the side effect of halving the time it takes to do an update or delete.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12673376, I think this needs more info.  What was the original query where the issue showed up?
What precisely was the problem and how does the RS deduplication change help?  The explanation for the latter would be useful to add to the code where this setting is set.
How is the changes to sort order of ROW__ID related?, also, ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java change is not needed, bq. What was the original query where the issue showed up?
{code}
create table concur_orc_tab(name varchar(50), age int, gpa decimal(3, 2)) clustered by (age) into 2 buckets stored as orc TBLPROPERTIES ('transactional'='true');
insert into table concur_orc_tab select * from texttab; -- loads 10k records into the table
delete from concur_orc_tab where age >= 20 and age < 30;
{code}
This resulted in only some rows being deleted (~300 of the 1700 that should have been deleted)

What precisely was the problem and how does the RS deduplication change help?
The problem was that because the code was turning off the RS deduplication it was getting a plan with two MR jobs.  The sort by ROW__ID was done in job one, and the bucketing was done in job two.  This meant that the bucketing in job 2 partially undid the sorting of job 1, resulting in only some of the records showing up as deleted (since the records have to be written in the delta file in proper order).  The minimum number of reducers on which to apply the RS deduplication is pushed to 1 so that this optimization is used for even small queries.  

How is the changes to sort order of ROW__ID related?
That should never have been set to descending in the first place.  ROW__ID needs to be stored ascending to work properly.  I suspect it was a fluke of most of the qfile tests that they worked with this on.  (Actually Thejas asked at the time why this was necessary and rather than fixing it (which I should have done) I just said I didn't know.  Oops.)
