[Please code review this patch for validity. It includes a fix, as well as a unit test that fails without the fix.

In the case where a tableDesc isn't set on the FetchTask object, I look for a partDesc. If one is found, I use the tableDesc from the first partDesc to get the deserializer. This seems like a reasonable thing to do, but please review if this logic is valid and won't cause other issues., Looks good. Couple things:

1. Can you verify that the changes you are making here for show table and describe table tests are the same as in HIVE-526. If yes, can you close that jira as a duplicate?
2. There are a couple of space issues (no space after if) and typos (partion), Thanks Raghu, here's an updated patch. My show/describe table changes are the same as HIVE-526, so I'll mark that one as a duplicate. 

There was one additional minor change in the HIVE-526 patch that I've incorporated into this one. A log message was moved in HiveServer.main(..)., +1
Will commit once tests pass., There was a unit test failure: input20.q

To run the specific test:

$ ant test -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=input20.q

I am attaching the results of the test., I'm able to reproduce the same test failure both with and without my patch applied. I'm at svn revision 787324. Can you please remove my patch and try this test. I don't think my patch is causing this., Just verified that the test in question fails with a fresh checkout:

svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/hive/trunk hive-trunk
cd hive-trunk
ant test -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=input20.q, looks like its a problem with running this test on a mac. it seems to succeed on linux. i'll investigate this further. i'll also rerun all the tests on linux to make sure no other tests fail., Merged in changes along with HIVE-590 and committed. Thanks Bill!]
