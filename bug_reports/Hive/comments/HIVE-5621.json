[I got the same error while giving target "tar". On specifying the target as "package", the build proceeds ahead but fails with following error:

{code}
satish@dev1$ /usr/bin/ant -Dhcatalog.version=0.5.0 -Dforrest.home=/home/satish/work/forrest/apache-forrest-0.9 package

[artifact:dependencies] Unable to resolve artifact: Missing:
[artifact:dependencies] ----------
[artifact:dependencies] 1) org.apache.hcatalog:hcatalog-core:jar:0.5.0
[artifact:dependencies] 

[artifact:dependencies] 
[artifact:dependencies]   Path to dependency: 
[artifact:dependencies]     1) org.apache.hcatalog:hcatalog-pig-adapter:jar:0.5.0-    incubating
[artifact:dependencies]     2) org.apache.hcatalog:hcatalog-core:jar:0.5.0
[artifact:dependencies] ----------
{code}

This issue got resolved by specifying project.version as "0.5.0-incubating" instead of "0.5.0" in build command line. The reason for error is that build installs hcatalog-core artifact as hcatalog-core-0.5.0-incubating.jar. However because of wrong project.version, the dependent projects were instead searching for hcatalog-core-0.5.0.jar.

Build succeeded with:

{code}
satish@dev1$ /usr/bin/ant -Dhcatalog.version=0.5.0-incubating -Dforrest.home=/home/satish/work/forrest/apache-forrest-0.9 package
{code}

Probably the build instruction at the [link|http://hive.apache.org/docs/hcat_r0.5.0/install.html] needs to be fixed., We don't use ant anymore., We don't use ant anymore so closing this.]
