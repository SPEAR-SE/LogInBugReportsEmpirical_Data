[patch-1: decimal, date and timestamp currently are supported for filtering for parquet. Currently if there is such type in the filter expression, such subexpression with that type is incorrectly ignored. 

With the patch, if we can't convert search argument into filter expression, then no filtering will be applied on parquet files.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12850463 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, patch-2: fix affected unit tests. If we can't convert part of the expression, then we should return null rather than returning partial expression since it could be incorrect., The source code change makes sense. But it may have performance issue for some query. Should you treat "or" statement , "and" statement differently?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12850645 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, We will not filter the data when there are nonsupported data types and currently Hive is returning incorrect result. For good ones, we will not have performance impact. I will investigate if we can support decimal, date and timestamp in the following jiras., The test failures are not related., Agree with, we'd better make the value right first.
The patch looks good.  +1, Pushed to master. Thanks Yongzhi for reviewing.]
