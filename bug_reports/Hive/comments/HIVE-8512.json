[The problem is that validation for this is done in highly unobvious manner when generating exprs from AST nodes; however, for select-star, we never generate exprs from AST node the normal way, so some bogus exprnodedesc gets added without checking, The more fundamental problem is that when * is resolved, RR used it the one from preceding operator, in this case GBY. This is incorrect, since * does not refer to the columns produced by the GROUP BY.
For example, this (which is a valid it would seem, although strange; src contains 2 columns) - {noformat}select *, sum(key) from src group by key, value{noformat} duplicates the SUM column, because it derives * columns from operator generated during group by, [~ashutoshc] fyi... I will have a patch soon, but I'm not sure it will work for all queries due to RowResolver mess, Patch with new tests. Need to run HiveQA for sure..., [~ashutoshc] [~jpullokkaran] fyi. https://reviews.apache.org/r/28020/,
