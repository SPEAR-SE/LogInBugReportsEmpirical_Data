[the second stmt above silently inserts 'null' for the 'hr' partition key value., fixed not lowercasing the partition key names in couple of places.
added a check that load/insert query contains all partition keys for the specified table. currently it inserts a null value. fixed that., added more tests to check that partition key names are case insensitive and partition key values are case sensitive., +1. Will commit once the tests pass.]
