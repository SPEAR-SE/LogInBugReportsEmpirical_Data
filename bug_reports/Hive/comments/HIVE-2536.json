  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/Hive.g:2382 I totally don't know why, but not having this OR clause here (and using the version on the left) will cause all scientific notation to break.  ANTLR bug perhaps?

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/Hive.g:2382 Interesting.  Before, it was interpreting

  select 1.0e3

  the same as

  select 1.0 e3

  which fits the pattern

  select 1.0 mycolumnaliaswhichendswithadigi7

  Dunno why introducing the choice into the grammar gives the fragment precedence over the column aliasing rule, but since we need it anyway...shipit.
