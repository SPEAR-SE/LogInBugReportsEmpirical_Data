[I'm experiencing the same issue, thank you for documenting this!  Can someone at least explain why the reduce step is never happening?  It seems to simply ignore the LATERAL VIEW part of the query and everything after., Could you try it again with cp disabled? (set hive.optimize.cp=false;), tried, didn't help :(

I added a log (with `-hiveconf hive.root.logger=INFO,console -v`) to the gist, Could you upload explain result for that query? It seemed to be a genMR order issue which was thought to be resolved already., same script but without using the JSON Serde: https://gist.github.com/3047737

I found another query that was failing, but with the `set hive.optimize.cp=false` that one was fixed, but the one that was failing before is still failing!
And with `set hive.optimize.cp=false` the mapjoin seems to fail (crash), Here are the queries with their explain: https://gist.github.com/3047871, HIVE-3226 is one of the bugs which caused your problem. I'm working on it., This seemed to be solved by HIVE-2642. Could you consider using hive-0.9?, hmm, I'm using hadoop-0.20.2 and can't really upgrade to higher versions of hadoop atm because of jobs running on the same clusters developed and maintained by other teams.
I do have control over the version of hive however, do you know if 0.9 plays nice with hadoop-0.20.2 ?

Anyway, I'll grab 0.9 for my local development cluster and check if it solves the problem :-), Both test cases pass using hive-0.9]
