ATTACHMENT ID: 12859974 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Thanks [~juanrh]. I committed this to master., Doc note:  This appends ",s3,s3a" to the default value of *hive.exim.uri.scheme.whitelist* so the wiki needs to be updated again.  (It already has a 2.2.0 update for HIVE-15151.)

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.exim.uri.scheme.whitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.exim.uri.scheme.whitelist]
* formatting example using bullet list: [hive.mapred.mode | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.mapred.mode]
