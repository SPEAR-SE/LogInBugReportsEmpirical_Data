[@Swathi,

* Are you running in secure mode or non-secure mode?
* Are you running metastore as separate process or embedded within HiveServer?, Hi @Ashutosh,
Am running in non-secure mode 
I guess this is mainly due to HDFS-3545.So closure of HDFS-3545 will resolve this issue., Hi@Ashutosh
Am running metastore embedded within HiveServer, Was this problem fixed or you still getting it?

We are using CDH4U1 for HDFS and HIVE, and facing memory leaks in the HiveServer, could it be this bug?

How did you workaround it?

Thanks , Hey, All. Sorry, I've been meaning to update this bug for a while now. This problem ought to have been fixed with HIVE-3098. Do let me know if this isn't the case. 

Cheers.]
