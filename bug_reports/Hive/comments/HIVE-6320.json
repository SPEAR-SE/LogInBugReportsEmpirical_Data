[The issue was related to generating the disk range boundaries. If two adjacent row groups have same compressed block offset then the worst case slop that was added to the end offset will contain only the current compression block. In some cases the values towards the end of this compression block will stretch beyond the boundary to fetch values causing BufferUnderFlowException. 

The attached patch extends this worst case slop boundary to safely accommodate the adjacent compression block., Making it patch available for precommit tests.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12626175, The test failures seems to be unrelated., Actually, you always need the next 2 compression blocks regardless of whether the compression blocks are the same for the two row groups.

The rest of the patch looks good., Addressed [~owen.omalley] and [~gopalv]'s code review comments., HIVE QA did not pickup the patch. Uploading again.,
