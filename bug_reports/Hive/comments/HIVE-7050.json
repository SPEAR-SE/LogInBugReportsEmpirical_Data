[attaching RB link, Thanks for the patch. Minor comments/questions on RB.

One clarification: are column stats shown when either EXTENDED or FORMATTED is specified? And only when column is specified? I think this is important for documentation purpose. It would be good if functional details can be put in the description area., Addressed [~xuefuz]'s review comments., Column stats are stored only when a column is specified and only when FORMATTED is specified. It does NOT show for EXTENDED because extended output does not show the column names at the top which makes it difficult to comprehend the column stats output., Patch looks good. I left a couple of minor comments on rb., Addressed [~xuefuz]'s review comments. Left reply in RB. RB is flaky now will update the patch in RB later., Addressed Xuefu's comments in RB.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12645388, [~prashuj] Could you take a look at the test failures above to see if they are related to your patch?, Sorry, but the above comment was intended for [~prasanth_j]. :), [~prasanth_j] Could you give an analysis of the above test failures?, [~xuefuz] only describe_syntax and describe_table seems to be related. Other test failures are unrelated and are tracked else where. I quickly ran describe_syntax and describe_table and found that the diffs are showing additional spaces. I will analyze more to see if those spaces valid or added as a side effect. Will post a new patch later today with the fix., This patch fixes the relevant test failures. Another change is when column stats is not available then empty string is displayed instead of "null" to be inline with how comments are handled (empty instead of null).

[~xuefuz] sorry for getting back late on this. Can you please take a look again at this patch?, +1, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks to Prasanth J for the contribution., [~prasanth_j] Does this also support display of column stats for a particular partition of table? Test case doesnt cover it, so not sure. I was hoping following syntax to work, but seems like not supported yet.
{code}
describe formatted T partition (k1=v1) c1;
{code}, No it is not supported yet. HIVE-7051 is created to support it. , Ok..cool, [~leftylev] I added "Display column statistics" section here https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-Describe
which should cover the features added in this jira as well as HIVE-7051. Can you take a look to see if its good?, Thanks, [~prasanth_j], especially for HIVE-7051 which had slipped through my net.

Your new section is good, but needs version information -- I'll add that, plus a link to the ANALYZE syntax, and a bit of editorial tinkering.  Then you can verify my changes.

Would you please change the release note (which currently says "Please document the new functionality") and add one on HIVE-7051 too?

Q:  Does this only work for FORMATTED, not EXTENDED (although it's in both jira titles)?, Done. Updated release notes and title of both JIRAs to say only FORMATTED.
, Besides the doc changes already mentioned, I added the FOR COLUMNS option to ANALYZE in the Statistics doc for HIVE-1362:

* [Statistics in Hive -- Existing Tables | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/StatsDev#StatsDev-ExistingTables]
* [DDL -- Display Column Statistics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-DisplayColumnStatistics], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
