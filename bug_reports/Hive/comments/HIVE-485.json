[hive.485.2.patch:
1. The patch adds ObjectInspector[] to Operator.initialize, but that parameter is only set for JoinOperator. I guess the intention is to leave the rest of the work to HIVE-405?
2. Utility.hashCode() is not very efficient. I think we should do a "switch" based on the Category and PrimitiveCategory of the object.
