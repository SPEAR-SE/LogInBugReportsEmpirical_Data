[Can you try condition: "part = 'part1' AND part > UDF2('part0')"

The optimizer might do something different because of the short-circuit calculation of "AND".
, I just tried "part = 'part1' AND part > UDF2('part0')" condition. Query plan remained the same., I think we should fix this for 0.5 also, https://reviews.facebook.net/D4503, Passed all tests, comments on phabricator, +1

running tests, The following tests failed:

input42.q
nomr_fetch.q
rand_partitionpruner2.q
rand_partitionpruner3.q

, @Namit Jain;
I thought if predicate is mix of deterministic and non-deterministic parts, deterministic part always can be extracted safely. But it was not. The order of each part should be also considered. For example, "rand(0) > 0.1 AND a > 50" should not be PPDed, but "a > 50 AND rand(0) > 0.1" could be. Similarly, "rand(0) > 0.1 AND ds = '2008-04-08'" should not be partition pruned, which might affect results of some tests.

I'm working on it.]
