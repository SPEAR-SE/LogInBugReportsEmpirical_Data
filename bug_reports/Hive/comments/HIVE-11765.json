[[~nyang] I am unable to reproduce this issue locally using the steps provided (i created a dummy employee.csv dataset). Can you provide the actual dataset that you are using for the tests?, Also let me know if you using tez or mr., Both mr and tez seems to be working for me., Seems to be happening on MR, I just tried in hive-1.2.1 release binary. Still unable to reproduce. Tried again with mr and tez. , I also missed this issue when add the patch of HIVE-10591 based on 1.2.1]
