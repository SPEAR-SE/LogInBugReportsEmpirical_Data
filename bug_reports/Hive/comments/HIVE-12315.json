[If you turn off the vectorization environment variable, different results are produced that with vectorization., The class I suspect is DoubleColDivideDoubleColumn., Gopal suspects this might be related to the recent HIVE-10235 "Loop optimization for SIMD in ColumnDivideColumn.txt (chengxiang, reviewed by Gopal V)" change., [~mmccline]: That loop hoist assumes one important thing - that the operations have no aliasing at all. 

The input1, input2 and output scratch vectors cannot be the same. 

We need to confirm that the same scratch columns aren't generated for 3-address operations., [~mmccline]: the loop-hoist was correct, please review attached patch.

The divbyZero codepath unconditionally resets .noNulls=false, without considering that the .isNull[] state is not reset when the input had .noNulls = true., + LGTM, tests pending.

We should add more tests as a separate exercise.,
