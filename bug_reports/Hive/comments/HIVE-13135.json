[Probably was a bad idea to always enable SSL too - adding a config to disable/enable that (& using the magic word "SPNEGO" in the HiveConf), +1. Btw, after HIVE-12942, I don't think LLAP_WEB_AUTO_AUTH serves any purpose. It used to override bunch of conf settings that the user could have set manually to custom values instead of relying on the values that would work by default; now it just calls some methods that should probably always be called, if it's off, there's no alternative way for the user to set this up as far as I see. Can be removed on commit or in a separate JIRA. ,
