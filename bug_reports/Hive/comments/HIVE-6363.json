[Found same bug.  Will have patch ready soon.
, Uploaded patch, Fixed Bug.  Replaced IllegalArgumentException with SQLException per JDBC standard.  , Updated patch fix  TestJDBCDriver2.testBadURL() to match changes, A similar issue was fixed in HIVE-4194.  The changes were overwritten by the changes to HIVE-4802., Thanks for the patch. It looks good. Is the jdbc/pom.xml change related to this issue ?
, Thejas M Nair: Yes, the change to  jdbc/pom.xml is to add unit test coverage to the methods that were modified., I think the issue is resolved by [HIVE-4194|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4194].
The parseURL is called from two places.
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/jdbc/src/java/org/apache/hive/jdbc/HiveDriver.java#L233 (from parseURLforPropertyInfo() function)
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/jdbc/src/java/org/apache/hive/jdbc/HiveConnection.java#L122 (Constructor of HiveConnection)

Both are having the condition check if(URI.startsWith("jdbc:hive2://"), hence the parseURL() never gets called when the condition    uri.startsWith(URL_PREFIX)  is false.
But it is good to have fix so that if some one calls the function unconditionally in future, the issue will resurface.

I think [HIVE-4802|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4802] did not affect changes made by [HIVE-4194|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4194] as conditional call is still in place. 
I was testing this on Hive 0.11 & saw the code for parseURL was not changed from throwing IllegalArgumentException. I think the JIRA can be changed to lower priority., Hello everyone,

I don't understand clearly the status of this issue. I understand a patch has been created, but I also see that HIVE-4194 should fix this issue, but has not been closed after it's been reopened.
Can you please clarify?

Thanks in advance,, The issue appears to have been resolved by the fix for HIVE-7935.]
