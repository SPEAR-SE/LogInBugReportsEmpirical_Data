[kevinwilfong requested code review of "HIVE-2750 [jira] Hive multi group by single reducer optimization causes invalid column reference error".
Reviewers: JIRA

  When generating the list of value columns for the reduce sink operator, in the case of multiple group bys occurring in the same reducer, only the columns used by the first query block was being considered, due to a typo.  This patch fixes this typo, and adds a testcase to ensure the error does not reoccur.

  After the optimization, if two query blocks have the same distinct clause and the same group by keys, but the first query block does not reference all the rows the second query block does, an invalid column reference error is raised for the columns unreferenced in the first query block.

  E.g.
  FROM src
  INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest_g2 SELECT substr(src.key,1,1), count(DISTINCT src.key) WHERE substr(src.key,1,1) >= 5 GROUP BY substr(src.key,1,1)
  INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest_g3 SELECT substr(src.key,1,1), count(DISTINCT src.key), count(src.value) WHERE substr(src.key,1,1) < 5 GROUP BY substr(src.key,1,1);

  This results in an invalid column reference error on src.value

, Unless we turn off group-by optimization, the query as described in Jira 12412, which worked fine in Hive 1.0 fails in Hive 1.1 and later., Sorry... wrong link.]
