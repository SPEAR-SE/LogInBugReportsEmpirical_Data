[[~navis] [~cwsteinbach] You that worked on creating Column.java. would you help me review this patch? it is pretty straightforward. 

The patch displays the correct FLOAT precision now:
{noformat}
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select f, af, af[0], d, ad[0] from decimals;
+----------+------------+----------+---------+---------+--+
|    f     |     af     |   _c2    |    d    |   _c4   |
+----------+------------+----------+---------+---------+--+
| 1.10058  | [1.10058]  | 1.10058  | 2.0133  | 2.0133  |
+----------+------------+----------+---------+---------+--+
{noformat}, I guess the fact that the patch doesn't include any test updates means that there's no test coverage for this right now? If that's the case can you add some?

Also, does the HiveCLI behave correctly in this scenario, and is there any test coverage provided for this there?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12755466 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~cwsteinbach] I submitted another patch with the unit tests.

This issue happens only on beeline and JDBC connections. The values are correctly displayed on HiveCli. I believe the correct precision is corrected when converting the values to JSON string. But on JDBC, the values are sent with a different precision to the client.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12755592 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks for adding a test. Here's some feedback:
* TestColumn is missing an ASF header.
* TestColumn doesn't prove that beeline returns correct results. What we need is an end-to-end test that validates the output of beeline. There's an existing test driver (TestBeeLineDriver) that was included in the original HiveServer2 patch. The goal was to make it easy to write end-to-end Beeline tests in the style of the existing qfile tests. There's also a set of sample data files in files/types/primitives that cover all primitive types, and an initialization file (data/scripts/q_test_init.sql) that creates a 'primitives' table on top of it. I think we'd get more complete and easier to maintain test coverage with less code by resurrecting TestBeeLineDriver and writing a new beeline qfile test that runs a 'SELECT *' query against the primitives table. I suspect the original HS2 patch even had a qfile test for this, but I'm too depressed to look. It would be awesome if you want to fix this, but all that really stands in the way of a +1 is adding the missing ASF header.

, Thanks [~cwsteinbach] for the recommendation for the tests. However, I think there is still an issue with TestBeelineDriver that it gets stuck on Hive QA (see HIVE-10884). I enabled the driver on Jenkins before, but there are still issues with it.

We're not sure what it is yet. I will need to disable it, and fix it later. In the mean time, it would be great to have this patch committed so that users can benefit from it., +1. Can you commit this yourself?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12755814 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks [~cwsteinbach] for your help.
I committed the patch., [~spena] fyi.. this breaks compilation in JDK 8. The FloatingDecimal(float) constructor is removed in JDK 8. Created HIVE-11832 for this compilation issue., Thanks [~prasanth_j], should we revert this meanwhile? or is the patch forthcoming, There's a patch forthcoming. I found the fix., [~cwsteinbach] I've been thinking on this patch regarding the use of {{new Double(field.toString())}}, and it might cause a extra performance overhead because the conversion from Float -> String -> Double everytime we send values through JDBC. What do you think about this? Should we revert this bug, and figure out another way to fix it?, I think this is a case where correctness is more important than performance. Let's aim first for the former, and once it's achieved we can worry about the latter., TO:Mr Sergio Pe√±a 

About HIVE-11802,I wanted to get some help. Like following ,I can not get the patches about HIVE-11802,could you help  me to provide the URL ?
Forward to get your help.
