[The problem is that with container reuse the PTFOperator gets initialized multiple times. With the streaming support we now update the PTFDesc in a way that can't be repeated. We replace a GenericUDAFEvaluator with a wrapper class - GenericUDAFStreamingEvaluator. The second time around we call init it throws an exception.

The fix is simple, just forward the init call to the wrapped class. The wrapping does not happen twice, everything else seems to get initialized correctly (second time around). I tested it on a few queries - seems ok.

[~rhbutani] can you take a look? [~gopalv] if you have some time for review that'd be great too., lgtm +1
(probably can avoid the reconstructQueryDef processing after the first time; will look into this as a follow up),
