[Actually I just realized it's a dup of HIVE-13185, This could still be a problem if Reader api is directly used. Hive filters 0 length files in OrcInputFormat during split generation and validateInput but if someone uses Reader api directly this could still be an issue. Ideally this should be fixed in ORC project. I will keep this open anyways for tracking. , Fixed in ORC-103]
