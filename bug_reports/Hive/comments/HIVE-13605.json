[this "already exists problem" can be easily addressed by adding cleanup prior to create...but thats a bit ugly -- it might not solve the issue; but might make the view a bit more cleaner

i think when the testdbtxnmanager fails...the following test also fails...and it flaps more frequently

i'm not sure how ptest executes the tests...i've seen connection refused messages earlier; and it was caused by some bad xml inside the common module; which ended up earlier in the classpath by mistake...without the stderr/stdout i can't tell its connected or not
