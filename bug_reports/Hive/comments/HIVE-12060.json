ATTACHMENT ID: 12765671 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, There's a typo in the description of *hive.tez.input.generate.consistent.splits*:  "Whether to generate consisten split" -- need "t" for consistent.

Several of the new hive.llap.* configs don't have descriptions.  Are they for internal use only?

Please add newlines (\n) in the description of *hive.llap.queue.metrics.percentiles.intervals* and keep the indentation identical for all three lines of the description.  (And to pick a nit, a few config description indentations are off by one character, including that one.), I'll file a jira to do all this, Another attempt with separate variable. I cannot understand why stats in explainuser1 keep getting spurious diffs.,
