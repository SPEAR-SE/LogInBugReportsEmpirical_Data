[[~ashutoshc], [~bslim], could you take a look? The patch 1) removes one of the definitions of the joda-time dependency in the POM file for druid-handler, 2) includes the banned dependencies definition within the previously existing maven-enforcer-plugin plugin description, and 3) excludes some dependencies that were being pulled transitively and should not.

After applying the patch, warnings and test fails are gone.

As a side note, I had to clean up my local mvn repo to reproduce the test fails; that might be the reason why we were seeing failures only in some environments., [~jcamachorodriguez] thanks LGTM ,
