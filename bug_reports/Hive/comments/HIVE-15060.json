[For now I don't think we have to disable/remove the autoCommit option from beeline (unless it has caused too much confusion to the users). Also we might support "--autoCommit=false" in future., cc [~prasanth_j], we do plan to support autoCommit=false in the future, [~taoli-hwx] Can you add a test as well ? See TestBeelineArgParsing.testBeelineOpts for example.
, [~thejas] Good point. Will do., +1 Pending tests
