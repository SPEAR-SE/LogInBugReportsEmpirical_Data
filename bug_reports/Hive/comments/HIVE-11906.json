[Any updates on this? I'm facing the same issue. 

PS: As of now, i using more than 1 transaction and hence fine., Hmm, 
you are currently assigned to this issue => do you plan to fix it?

And yes, it is an annoying bug. , this Exception is thrown for a reason.  In Streaming API use cases each TransactionBatch is expected to include > 1 transaction.
Creating batches of size 1 is usually a mistake which causes a perf hit - this is what the exception is preventing.

The fix would be in TransactionBatchImpl to special case batches of size 1 to not call flush(), but like I said most likely this exception means you are not using API as it was meant to.
, I am using Streaming ingest API to load files coming in at regular intervals from another system. The way I thought of implementing the file loading into Hive is to get one TransactionBatch instance and write the contents of one file using the single TransactionBatch instance obtained in single transaction. Basically trying to write one file contents in single transaction and commit it so that in case of an error I can always attempt to re-process the whole the file. 

Currently I am working around the API by getting more than one transaction batches but using only one of those.]
