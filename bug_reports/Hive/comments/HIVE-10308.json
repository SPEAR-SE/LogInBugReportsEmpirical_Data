ATTACHMENT ID: 12724726 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Actually the test results show only 1 test failure and the failure is 33 days old. So should be irrelevant. , The Vectorizer class is suppose to *exclude* the MAP data type from vectorization.  We should never execute a Map or Reduce vertex with a MAP type.

So, I am a -1 on this patch.  Some verification path is missing in the Vectorizer class., I see the problem.  The Vectorizer class has in fact correclty validated that all data types used in the query are ok.  The test (thank you) above does not reference the MAP data type.

However, in the initializeOp method of VectorReduceSinkOperator, we convert the input object inspector inputObjInspector\[0\] to vector expression row writers and that inspector includes the MAP data type.

{noformat}
inputObjInspectors[0] a:INT, b:MAP
{noformat}

We use the ReduceSinkOperator as a super type and it is expecting a standard row object that looks like inputObjInspector\[0\].

So, need to rethink how we are creating the vector expression row writers here.

I'm assigning this to me since I wrote the recent addition to VectorReduceSinkOperator initializeOp that is producing the problem.  We are missing some negative tests here, too.

, I ended up fixing this problem with one of my other changes because it caused some Q file failures., [~mmccline] Thanks for reviewing this! Which patch fixed this problem? , [~selinaz] It was part of the huge HIVE-9824 patch (improved vector map join performance).

The change was to VectorExpressionWriterFactory (the class you modified in your patch):

I added this to public static VectorExpressionWriter genVectorExpressionWritable(ObjectInspector fieldObjInspector):

{noformat}
      case STRUCT:
      case UNION:
      case MAP:
      case LIST:
         return genVectorExpressionWritableEmpty();
{noformat}

and a the new method genVectorExpressionWritableEmpty:

{noformat}
  // For complex types like STRUCT, MAP, etc we do not support, we need a writer that
  // does nothing.  We assume the Vectorizer class has not validated the query to actually
  // try and use the complex types.  They do show up in inputObjInspector[0] and need to be
  // ignored.
  private static VectorExpressionWriter genVectorExpressionWritableEmpty() {
    return new VectorExpressionWriterBase() {
	
      @Override
      public Object writeValue(ColumnVector column, int row)
          throws HiveException {
        return null;
      }
	
      @Override
      public Object setValue(Object row, ColumnVector column, int columnRow)
          throws HiveException {
         return null;
      }
	
      @Override
      public Object initValue(Object ost) throws HiveException {
         return null;
      }
    };
  }	
{noformat}, Could we document the fix version of this issue? [~mmccline] Is it correct to assume that this was fixed in 1.2.0 together with HIVE-9824? I want to double check as 1.2.0 is still listed as affected version here., Removing fix version 1.2.2]
