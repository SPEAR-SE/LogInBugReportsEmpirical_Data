[Hi Ido Hadanny,

Can u update what is the scenario.  

Create connection and close that connection not throwing any exception and same thing is automated in this test case "org.apache.hadoop.hive.jdbc.TestJdbcDriver"., This issue occurs when hive connection is used in threads. When one thread using hive connection is executing a query while another thread is trying close the same hive connection]
