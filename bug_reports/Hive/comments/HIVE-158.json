[When there is a TABLESAMPLE clause, the alias is not the second child of the join node (its the last child)., Can you add a test case?
, Missed doing svn add on the tests. done now., diff looks good to me.

Please do run this with both -Dhadoop.version="0.19.0" and -Dhadoop.version="0.17.0" to make sure that the diff still holds and the ordering does not screw up things., Changed example so that it passes with both hadoop 17 and 20., The sample operator created is not begin added to the hashmap - line 3549 SemanticAnalyzer.java
You have to add this.

I am forgetting the exact test-case. do you remember the scenario which we were debugging last week ?, looked at the code more carefully - you are right - we dont need to to put in the hashmap, we are already doing it.
The changes look fine to me.
