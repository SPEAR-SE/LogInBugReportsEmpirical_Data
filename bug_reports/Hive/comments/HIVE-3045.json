, I did the following:
{code}
$ svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hive/trunk .
$ curl https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12560133/HIVE-3045.D3351.2.patch | patch -p0
$ svn revert ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/MapOperator.java
$ ant package test -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=virtual_column.q
:
$ BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2 minutes 53 seconds
{code}

I was expecting test case to fail if I revert the code changes. Instead, it succeeded. That is not what I was expecting. 
Than I repeated the same process, except for svn revert step, test still succeeded. , This is rather old issue and possibly could be fixed by other issues like HIVE-2925. I'll check on it., Yes, it's fixed by HIVE-2925. , navis has abandoned the revision "HIVE-3045 [jira] Partition column values are not valid if any of virtual columns is selected".

  Fixed by HIVE-2925
