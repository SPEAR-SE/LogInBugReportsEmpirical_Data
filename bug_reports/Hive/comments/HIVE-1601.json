[This JIRA is in honor of Facebook HQ.
, - fix the jsp include
- don't run minimr in 0.17 - it doesn't work
- added ant-contrib jar (attached as a separate file). very useful for writing ant conditions (we simplify a bunch of other stuff with it), +1.  Will commit when tests pass.
, Committed.  Thanks Joydeep!
