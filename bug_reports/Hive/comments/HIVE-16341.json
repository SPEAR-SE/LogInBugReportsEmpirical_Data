[It looks like there are Tez counters which show the # output records going from one vertex to another vertex - for example group TaskCounter_Map_1_OUTPUT_Reducer_4, counter OUTPUT_BYTES. Attaching patch to use this rather than the total intermediate rows for the vertex (which may include rows going to other vertices).

cc [~sseth] [~prasanth_j], [~jdere]: I think the existing codepath assumes {{tez.task.generate.counters.per.io=false}}

Fixing this correctly requires per-io counters to be always enabled (check that and if/else the counter checks?).,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12861356 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Tried checking for tez.task.generate.counters.per.io, but this did not seem to be visible from the hiveConf, maybe this was set in the tez-conf on HDFS.
I've changed the patch to use the Tez counters if they exist, and to fall back to the old method using the Hive counters if it can't find them.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12861491 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~gopalv] does the newer patch look more acceptable?, Yup, LGTM - +1, Committed to master/branch-2/branch-2.3, Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
