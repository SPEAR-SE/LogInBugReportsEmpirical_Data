[Attached HiveResultSet.java (SVN revision 760370) contained described fixes , Can you upload a patch instead of the file:

svn diff > <patchname>

and then upload the <patchname> and submit patch.

Also, can you add a test for this case ?, Sure + will modify the current unit test to check for this condition., Fixes for next() to return false when reaching the last record in the Resultset, Fixes for next() to return false when reaching the last record in the Resultset, The patch does not contain the unit test, Modified TestJdbcDriver.java to also check for no more data rows, Kim, after looking at the code again, I had some questions:

In the test (without your patch), the while loop should have never exited, and eventually some random timeout happened.
I am not sure how is it working without your patch ?

I should not have accepted in the first place - I will delete the above comment, Investigated the test in more detail with Raghu and Ashish. The current test is working due to some java idiosyncrasy.
Your changes look good.

+1, Committed. Thanks Kim]
