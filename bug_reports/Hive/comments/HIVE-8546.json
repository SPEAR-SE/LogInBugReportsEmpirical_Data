ATTACHMENT ID: 12678024 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch looks good to me. +1 for both .14 and trunk. However it'd be good to have [~sseth]'s opinion too., Looks good to me. I think it'll be better to use LocalResourceType.ARCHIVE though, since PATTERN seems to follow a slightly different dir structure when handling jars., [~sseth]: Pattern changed to Archive now.,
