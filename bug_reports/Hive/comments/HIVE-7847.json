ATTACHMENT ID: 12663601, According to the testreport,  org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniTezCliDriver.testCliDriver_dynpart_sort_opt_vectorization has failed for 43 times. So I think it is unrelated to the patch. , @ [~owen.omalley],  would you like to look at this patch?  It's just a simple one-line fix., @ [~prasanth_j], would you like to look at this patch? It's just a simple one-line fix., I also encountered a similar type cast exception with ORC and changing the column type.

I took the alter_partition_change_col.q test and created a vectorized version of it by making the table ORC.  I started with vectorization *OFF* to try and get a base case running, but it fails.

And, I applied your patch, but the exception:

{noformat}
... ClassCastException: org.apache.hadoop.io.Text cannot be cast to org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.io.HiveDecimalWritable
{noformat}

still occurs., @ [~mmccline],  in alter_partition_change_col.q it alters the column type of the existing partition which cause the exception.  My patch doesn't handle this case. I just fix the case when you query multiple partitions which some partitions are generated before column type change and some are generated after that.

Sorry for the late reply., I encountered a similar(?) issue yesterday, which is tightly linked with the use of INSERT OVERWRITE.
1. create ORC partitioned table with datatype X for a column
2. insert into the partition
3. ALTER TABLE change to datatype Y
4. INSERT OVERWRITE in partition
5. Query fails with Error X cannot be cast to Y (or the other way around, doesn't matter)
This is because, as I checked, the datatype is kept in the hive metastore for the specific column and partition; when you insert overwrite (with the new datatype) it doesn't update that information in the metastore. So you insert a column of datatype Y (since the table definition now says so), which at query time hive thinks is of type X. And it breaks. Manually fixing the column type in the metastore DB fixes it., I think I'm seeing this on an INSERT OVERWRITE tied with a series of GROUP BY/SELECT and WITH clauses., Hi, [~wzc1989], whether this problem is solved or not ??

Thanks~,
