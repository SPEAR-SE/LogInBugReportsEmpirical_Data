[Note its possible to publish snapshot jars to the apache snapshots repo from CI; we do this in HCatalog. If theres interest in doing the same for Hive I can help make it happen., @[~cwsteinbach]: Could I please request you to push a snapshot for the hive-10 branch into maven? HCatalog-556 (and HCatalog-546) depend on this... Ashutosh has had some trouble pushing the artifacts, and it appears only Hive committers can do this., Thank you, Ashutosh and Giri., This issue is fixed and released as part of 0.10.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
