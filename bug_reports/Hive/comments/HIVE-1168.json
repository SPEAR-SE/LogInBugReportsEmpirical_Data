[I am following up on some leads on who might have access to the Hudson build environment and will update status here once I get an answer.
, Mailing list thread quoted by Carl is here:

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-hive-dev/201002.mbox/%3C7B4F4FE5-D478-4D67-A30E-D3E88E74472E@facebook.com%3E
, Apologies for not keeping an eye on it, have been away for a few months. I poked the hudson machine after an email from John and the Hive build against Hadoop 0.17 finished ok. The two others will run as scheduled in a few hours and I bet they will run fine., Seems the builds started and got past this issue, but a test failed:
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Hive/job/Hive-trunk-h0.18/368/testReport/junit/org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli/TestNegativeCliDriver/testNegativeCliDriver_script_broken_pipe1/, Thanks Johan!

0.17, 0.19, and 0.20 all passed, so maybe it was a one-off glitch on 0.18.  Let's see if it clears itself up.
, Hudson builds have passed for all configurations now, so marking this resolved.
