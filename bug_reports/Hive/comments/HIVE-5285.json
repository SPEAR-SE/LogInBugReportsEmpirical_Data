[The fix is to do a recursive search to make sure all the datatypes can be typecasted to "Settable<DT>" in ObjectInspectorConverters.getConverter().
If not, we need to create a new Object of settable type within ObjectInspectorConverters.getConvertedOI()., [~hsubramaniyan] Can you create a phabricator or RB link for the patcb?, [~ashutoshc] https://reviews.apache.org/r/14144/,

This message is automatically generated., Looks like legit test failures [~hsubramaniyan] Can you investigate?, The previous upload had an optimization fn hasAllFieldsSettable() which breaks a couple of tests because the checks are not precise. I am keeping things simple for now by avoiding any optimizations for creating a new SettableObjectInspector type. This would ensure correctness in all cases, however the future scope would be to prevent creating new SettableObjectInspector object every time we invoke getConvertedOI(). I have tested the changes with partition_fileformat*.q tests and they pass in my local machine., RB link updated with new diff file : https://reviews.apache.org/r/14144/,

This message is automatically generated., +1 [~hsubramaniyan] Would you mind creating a new jira for figuring out a reliable way to ascertain if structOI is settable or not. Also, we need to make sure list/map/union OIs implement settable interface., Created HIVE-5202 to handle all optimizations/enhancements associated with this code., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Hari!
