[The vectorization test case in dynpart_sort_optimization2.q must be revisited as HIVE-7557 disabled VectorFileSinkOperator. The proper fix for HIVE-7557 should make sure that VectorFS should inherit mostly from FS operator. Current code in trunk is stale as VectorFS contains old code from FS which went through many changes recently. cc/ [~mmccline],

ATTACHMENT ID: 12671603,  We have some orc tables generated by dynamic partition with group by. when we upgrade our hive from 0.11 to 0.13 and use hive 0.13 to produce new data, we find that the data from these tables can't be read. Below is the  exception when we try to read the data:
{code}
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable cannot be cast to org.apache.hadoop.io.LongWritable at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.RecordReaderImpl$LongTreeReader.next(RecordReaderImpl.java:717) at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.RecordReaderImpl$StructTreeReader.next(RecordReaderImpl.java:1788) at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.RecordReaderImpl.next(RecordReaderImpl.java:2997) at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcInputFormat$OrcRecordReader.next(OrcInputFormat.java:153) at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcInputFormat$OrcRecordReader.next(OrcInputFormat.java:127) at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveContextAwareRecordReader.doNext(HiveContextAwareRecordReader.java:339
{code}
After some troubleshooting we find this issue and have to turn off this optimization and recreate the table,  we finally fix this problem.  It seems like this feature doesn't work well with group by (also in HIVE-6883).  

After turning off this feature, some dynamic partition etls which generate orc tables start to run into OOM.We have to enlarge the reduce memory in order to get passed. Hope this feature will  become mature soon:), [~wzc1989] There are 2 issues with this optimization which was found recently. One is this issue (HIVE-8151) where the last record of a particular group by ends up in the next partition. Other one is HIVE-8162 where in case of group-by additional columns are added to reducer key which should have been done only for order-by queries. Does any of these issues solve your case? I am still not sure how ClassCastException is related to any of these cases. Would it be possible for you check if HIVE-8151 or HIVE-8162 solves your issue? Alternatively, you can provide me a small reproducible case which I can use to make sure this feature works properly., Rebased the patch to trunk. The last test failure seems to be working on my local box.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12671975, Rebase patch after HIVE-8196 commit., [~wzc1989] Thanks for providing test case. Looks like the there is some issue with casting before writing the file. I will put up a fix for it soon in the next version of this patch., @ [~prasanth_j] , I find that the explain of the insert sql in the testcase diff a little when enable/disable this optimization. After digging into the code it seems that before applying NonBlockingOpDeDupProc optimization, there are three select operators in a row before FileSink operator. NonBlockingOpDeDupProc would try to deduplicate these select operators. Casting _col1 into int before writing to file is lost durning the deduplication process. More precisely, cSELExprNodeDesc  backtracks fails due to missing of columnExprMap :
{code}
ExprNodeDesc newPSELExprNodeDesc =
                ExprNodeDescUtils.backtrack(cSELExprNodeDesc, cSEL, pSEL);
{code}
Here I try to include the columnExprMap in SemanticAnalyzer#genConversionSelectOperator and the testcase passes.
Please correct me if I'm wrong., [~wzc1989] Agreed. The explain plan of the query when the optimization is enabled/disabled shows different ExprNodeDesc for Select operator. As you said, the UDF to cast from bigint to int is lost during deduplication process. I will dig down further to see why colExprMap is missing and deduplication of select operators fails to retain the UDF. I am exactly right at this point debugging now. Thanks for debugging this issue and providing insights. Will post update soon and will also see if your suggested fix is the right way to do it., [~wzc1989] You are exactly correct. The getConversionSelectOperator does not seem populate and pass columnExprMap in constructor or set it explicitly. As you had mentioned this is the reason why Select operator deduplication did not propagate the UDF for type conversion properly. I also verified that the test case passes now. I will put up another version of patch with the fix and test case. Thanks again for the test case and suggested fix. , Added fix for issue reported by [~wzc1989]. [~hagleitn] Can you take a look at changes to SemanticAnalyzer? The change is necessary for select operator deduplication to work properly. It sets columnExprMap for SelectOperator which was not populated/set for GBY query case. See discussion above for more info.,

Thanks [~hagleitn] and [~wzc1989]., Doc note:  This changes the default value of configuration parameter *hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition* to false in 0.14.0.  It was introduced in 0.13.0 by HIVE-6455 but hasn't been documented in the wiki yet., Doc note:  Prasanth added *hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition* to the wiki here:

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition]

So I'm removing the TODOC14 label., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
