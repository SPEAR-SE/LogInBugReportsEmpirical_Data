[The fix for this issue is contained in HIVE-10592 (changes to ColumnStatisticsImpl). This bug is created merely as a placeholder for stacktrace., Any ideas on the timeline for Hive 1.3 release including this fix? This problem is currently affecting my users so we're eager to get a new release of Hive.

Hortonworks HDP 2.4 is due to be released some time this or next month based on the bi-annual release schedule, would be good to get Hive 1.3 included in that release.]
