[This attachment has a qfile-test that reproduces the error I'm talking about, including a scrubbed data-file that's readable with the schema-literal, but not without it. 

This was a fairly common failure at Yahoo. Our current recommendation is for users to only use Avro tables with the schema-file with which they were produced. The metastore-based schema is to be ignored entirely.

I've already tried modifying how the Avro schema is generated from {{columns.list.types}}, but I find that the conversions (to and fro) are lossy, brittle and unreliable. :/]
