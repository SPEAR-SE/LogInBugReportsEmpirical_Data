[[~mmccline], I have reverted the changes to those q files from HIVE-16602, thus those tests will be failing again. 
https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/c19981c66070b51df8c9129da69407c8be586d9d

Could you check whether those changes are expected? If they are, feel free to push the regenerated q files and close this issue. Thanks]
