[UDAF was deprecated long time before HIVE-5279 and I just added the annotation along with the patch but I should have fixed the javadoc also. Currently, implementing GenericUDAFResolver2 or extending AbstractGenericUDAFResolver is the standard way to implement aggregation function., Adds deprecation notice and cleans up Javadoc a bit.

Thanks for the hint Navis, I accidentally named the patch after the wrong issue but it's still correct for this one., Trivial review comments:

1.  "support" should be "supports" since UDAF is singular:
{code}
+ * Optional for a UDAF class (by implementing these two methods, the user declares
+ * that the UDAF support partial aggregations):
{code}

2.  Second <li> should be indented like the first one:

{code}
+ * <ol>
+ *   <li>Implement a single method called {@code evaluatePartial} that returns the PARTIAL aggregation result.
+ * {@code evaluatePartial} should never return {@code null} or an Exception will be thrown.</li>
+ * <li>Implement a single method called {@code aggregatePartial} that takes a PARTIAL
{code}, This new patch addresses Lefty's comments,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12635056, +1 , Can we not remove the statement "UDAF classes are REQUIRED to inherit from this class." completely. IMHO, the statement "Base class for all User-defined Aggregation Function (UDAF) classes." is good enough indication that new UDAFs are required to inherit from this class. The previous statement with the deprecation statement makes things a little confusing., Incorporated latest comments,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12635984, [~lars_francke] I'm wondering if the test failures are related to your change. I guess not, but could you confirm?, The patch is a doc only patch and as such shouldn't affect any tests. They seem unrelated to me., Patch committed to trunk. Thanks Lars., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
