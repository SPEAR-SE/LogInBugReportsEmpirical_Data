[[~lirui] : do we support "org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat" on hive on spark?
I saw following in  itests/qtest/target/testconf/spark/standalone/hive-site.xml, it suggests to override CombineHiveInputFormat with HiveInputFormat if users meet error.
{code}
<property>
  <name>hive.input.format</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat</value>
  <description>The default input format, if it is not specified, the system assigns it. It is set to HiveInputFormat for hadoop versions 17, 18 and 19, whereas it is set to CombineHiveInputFormat for hadoop 20. The user can always overwrite it - if there is a bug in CombineHiveInputFormat, it can always be manually set to HiveInputFormat. </description>
</property>

{code}, duplicated with HIVE-8722, [~kellyzly], I think this is just a warning in the log and doesn't cause test failure right? I also had a very old task HIVE-9227 to solve it. I had some difficulties with it, although don't remember what they were exactly.
In my opinion, the issue doesn't have a big impact on performance. But let me know if you want to work on it.]
