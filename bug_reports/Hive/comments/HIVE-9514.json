[I ran all metastore tool unit tests for this and they pass. Also manually verified schema initialization and upgrade with derby. Also ran queries with "hive.metastore.schema.verification=true"

, Also manually tested upgrade from 0.11 on mysql. The fix is applicable to all databases, so I don't think verifying it against all variants is necessary.
, +1 LGTM., Patch committed to branch-1.0 and trunk.
, [~brocknoland] Can you please merge this into branch 1.1 ?
, Committed to 1.1.0 thx!, Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
