[Two changes:

One is using fileformat from partition desc when needing to create an empty file.
this is to fix the bug for 'select src from fileformat_mix_test;'


The other is set oc = null when do closing in ExecMapper. 
And in ExecMapper's close, when see no data came to the mapper (which means an empty file), just return and do nothing.
this is to fix the bug for  'select count(1) from fileformat_mix_test;' When encountering empty file, we are not closing MapOperator tree. Hope this is fine. If we do the close, we will get NullPointerException from deep Hadoop code because of non-valid output collector, +1


will commit if the tests pass, duplicate of 1421]
