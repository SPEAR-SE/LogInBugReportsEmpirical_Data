[jsichi requested code review of "HIVE-2574 [jira] ivy offline mode broken by changingPattern and checkmodified attributes".
Reviewers: JIRA

  Factored out existing ivy offline properties to common buildfile, and
  added new ones to control the relevant settings.

  As described here:

  http://www.mail-archive.com/ivy-user@ant.apache.org/msg03534.html

  This wasn't the case formerly (maybe the upgrade to ivy 1.2?)

  Marek, this may be good enough for fixing the parallel testing ivy problem (without sed hacking) if you run the slaves with -Doffline=true

  Not sure if this is the reason, but it took 34min to update and build Hive and when it got to tests I got this:

    ivy-resolve:

  Tentative change to see if we can avoid ivy concurrency problems.

  Turns out we only need to set resolutionCacheDir.

  Not sure why, but it started working.  Didn't work with both this patch and the one downgrading Ivy but now it's fine.  Hope it doesn't break again=)

, Patch is ready for review.  Besides fixing offline mode, it also sets a private resolution cache directory to avoid concurrency problems when running Hive tests in parallel on the same machine., +1. Will commit if tests pass., Reattaching latest patch granting ASF rights., Committed to trunk. Thanks John!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1095 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1095/])
