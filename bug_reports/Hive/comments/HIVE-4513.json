[Blocked by HIVE-4500 as it relies on config parameter being introduced in that patch.
, Having this on by default can cause problems if you have same machine and config being used for large number of queries. For example, while doing some stress tests on HiveServer2, the mount with /tmp became full because hive history files (around 20k of them) took 2.5 GB.
, HIVE-4513.1.patch - Uses a proxy class that makes HiveHistory no-op, if hive history is disabled.
, HIVE-4513.2.patch - 
SessionState temp file gets created in same dir as hive history dir, but it was relying on hivehistory to create that dir. Now it independently does a -create-if-not-exist.
, HIVE-4513.3.patch - additional comments
, review board link with HIVE-4513.3.patch - https://reviews.apache.org/r/11029/, HIVE-4513.4.patch 
- add @Override to interface functions being implemented in HiveHistoryImpl
- Removing javadoc duplication in HiveHistoryImpl. It will automatically inherit the documentation from interface.
- Logging the exception in code unrelated to patch, to partly address Brock's concern. Since the code is not part of the patch, I don't want to increase the scope to address that concern.
, [~thejas] Left some comments on RB., Canceling patch for now., Hi Thejas, are you working on this patch?, [~thiruvel] Interesting that you asked me today, I am working on it right now! :)
, HIVE-4513.5.patch - patch addressing review comments. 
Also, removed use of hive history from TestCliDriver.vm and TestHBaseCliDriver.vm as it does not get used. When there is a failure that gets logged in hive history, it also results in client exit code being non zero. So the use of hivehistory there is redundant.  

I will upload the updated patch to reviewboard once it is up again.
, +1 I never found them of much use.,

This message is automatically generated., HIVE-4513.6.patch - addresses review comments. 

Also fixes race condition the race condition that was causing the TestHiveServerSessions.testSessionVars test failure. This race condition gets exposed when hivehistory is disabled, because when hive history is enabled it attempts to create the same dir this way, but on failure it just logs a warning.
, I found another issue while making these changes, - SessionState temp file gets created in history file directory, created  HIVE-5055 to track that.

Reviewboard has the latest patch.
, +1, Thanks [~thejas]. +1. I guess we can close the duplicates HIVE-1708 and HIVE-3779.

We back-ported this to Hive10 and it works as expected. [~cdrome] had some comments on the patch. These fall in the vicinity but should be addressed as a separate JIRA.

1. HiveHistoryViewer.java: Its good as "private void init()"
2. HiveHistoryUtil.java: parseLine() method is not thread-safe. It uses parseBuffer which could be modified by multiple threads. Currently only HWA uses it., > Chris Drome had some comments on the patch. These fall in the vicinity but should be addressed as a separate JIRA.

Created HIVE-5071 to address thread safety issues., [~thiruvel] Thanks for the feedback and pointers to the duplicate jiras. Yes, I think it is better to address thread safety issue in another jira, as it is not a regression introduced by this patch, the issue was there when the function was in HiveHistory.java (but I should have noticed the bug!)

, This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one., This adds the configuration parameter *hive.session.history.enabled* in HiveConf.java and hive-default.xml.template, so it needs to be documented in the wiki here:
