, Took the patch #3 I created for HIVE-10729 and fixed a bug in it and added the test case attached to this JIRA since it repros a problem (but converted the problematic imports into simple loads).  At the moment I can't tell if it is the same problem as HIVE-10729, but likely it is.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12741454 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Failures appear to be unrelated., Fix looks good. Tested in our environment testing one final use case today., [~t3rmin4t0r] do you want to take a look?, Verified the query results match when the Q files are run with vectorization off for Spark, Tez, and MR.

Except for one query result line in vectorization_short_regress.q

Looks like it is an old decimal precision issue...

(see newly created HIVE-11101), (Ooops add comment to wrong JIRA), [~wzheng] Can you give this a non-binding +1?  Thanks, [~mmccline] +1. The patch looks good.

Some trivial comments:
1. There are two imports that are not used in HybridHashTableContainer so can be removed.
2. fixupComplexObjects may have a better name like getComplexFieldsAsList, to be consistent to getFieldsAsList. It's your call.
3. There's one line exceeding 80 chars in unpack method for the two container classes.
4. This comment may be no longer needed (it's been there for a while) // TODO: should we unset bytes after that?, [~mmccline]: the patch LGTM, 1 minor comment to add to Wei's

Make these final, since they cannot be updated during a single use of the join operator.

{code}
+    private boolean needsComplexObjectFixup;
+    private ArrayList<Object> complexObjectArrayBuffer;
{code}

The array lists will still be mutable, but they will never be null if initialized once., [~wzheng] [~gopalv] Thank you for your review.  Patch #2 has changes for review., [~mmccline]: LGTM - +1., Also needs a back-port to branch-1, once the pre-commit tests pass on trunk.,
