[[~leftylev] can you review/+1 this one?, Not Lefty but still: +1 with the minor comment that it is a long line (exceeds 100 chars and violates checkstyle), +1

Lars is right about the line length, but several neighboring lines are also too long so that cleanup could be done later.

(Thanks for reminding me that the limit is 100, [~lars_francke].  I'll keep that in mind as I work on HIVE-6586.), Committed to trunk. Thanks [~leftylev] and [~lars_francke]!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
