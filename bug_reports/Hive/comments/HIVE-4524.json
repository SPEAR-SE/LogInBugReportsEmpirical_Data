[Attaching patch that introduces WrapperStorageHandler in HCat which wraps native HiveStorageHandlers and makes them work from within HCat.

Also, it includes one non-hcat fix to the HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat, where its super.getConf() would throw an exception if called before checkOutputSpecs() was called - I had to refactor out common code to ensure that didn't happen., Hi there seems to be some duplicate effort that's being done as part of HIVE-4331 and this jira. Perhaps a quick chat to resolve this?, Sushanth, Alan Gates , Olga, Francis and I had a meeting over this at Yahoo!. We decided that we would pursue with HIVE:4331 but restore the HCatHBaseStorageHandler for backward compatibility. Let me update the other HIVE:4331 with Design document for HivePassThroughOutputFormat. Sushanth has graciously agreed to pursue HIVE:4331
Viraj, I'm going to mark this issue as a duplicate of HIVE-4331, since it attempts to correct the same problem, although with a different approach.]
