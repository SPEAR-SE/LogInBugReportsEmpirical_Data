[fixes test runs on 17 and 18

we don't have non-localmode tests - but verified offline that auxpath and 'add files' works against a 17 cluster running open source hadoop code., Committed revision 726159.
Thanks Joydeep., HIVE-129. Fix aux.jar packaging to work properly with 0.17 and 0.18
versions of hadoop. (Joydeep Sarma via zshao)
