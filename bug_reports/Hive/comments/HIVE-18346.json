[[~JQu] can you print the complete stack trace ?, How to ï¼Ÿ, What I mean was when you got this error, this was the only error or there was some more statements following it ?
For example 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
Like this ?, The max size for history is
DEFAULT_MAX_SIZE = 500;

and this function maybeResize()  is keeping a check on history size 
It looks like you manually inserted some history records, 
in that case also beeline truncate history size to 3k
-rw-------. 1 user group 3.0K Jan  3 16:17 .beeline/history

am I wrong ?? 
I am not able to reproduce this bug. I think it is handled [~asherman], Thanks [~minions] sounds like you are right, though I am not an expert. Thanks for doing this work and sorry the bug I pointed you to was not so interesting., Thats all right [~asherman] . It would be very helpful if you could point to other beginner bug., Hi [~minions] I'm a beginner myself. I would suggest (1) looking at [unassigned hive bugs|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18371?jql=project%20%3D%20HIVE%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC] (2) using the product and finding your own problems. The beginner sees things that the more experienced people miss!

You should also ask on the dev mailing list for suggestions.
