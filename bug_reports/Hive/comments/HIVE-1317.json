[Uploading a patch changing the way paths are compared. , The test outputs are not deterministic.

About the change in CombineHiveInputFormat, cant the change be pushed to hiveInputFormat instead, and CHIF anyway is a subclass of HIF, Uploading a new patch HIVE-1317.2.patch. This fixes the test. 

Also talk with Namit offline, the CombineHiveInputFormat will get all paths under a partition directory due to CombineFileInputFormat.createPool(job, CombineFilter), in which CombineFilter will accept all files under the partition directory. That's why in CombineHiveInputFormat will we get the full path names from FileInputFormat.getInputPaths(). 
, Ning, I am getting a compilation error after applying the patch -

    [javac] symbol  : variable File
    [javac] location: class org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat.CombineFilter
    [javac]       pString = p.toString() + File.separator;

BUILD FAILED
, Updated HIVE-1317.2.patch with the fix. , Found a bug in my local testing, I will update a new patch once it is fixed. , attaching a new patch HIVE-1317.3.patch that solves the previous bug that failed in grouping partitioning columns., uploading a new patch HIVE-1317.4.patch. Changes include
1) removed the code in CombineHiveInputFormatShim to remove hdfs:// when getting splits.
2) The hdfs:// is striped when constructing CombineFilter to facilitate the requirement in Hadoop CombineFileINputformat.

will commit if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Ning]
