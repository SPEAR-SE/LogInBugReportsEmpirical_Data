[Might have a patch tomorrow or next week..., Hello, I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release., WIP patch. Passes the first basic test, although much more testing is needed., I realized randomly it won't work for the case when no half sized buffer is available. Luckily the TODOs in the test have a TODO for a test for that. Would need another level of recursion at the bottom if we failed to find anything and/or if we failed to lock., Number of tests and fixes, cleanup, implementation for nested defrag. One test still fails and more tests need to be added for special/error cases., I fixed some more things, the patch seems to have some MTT issues. I am not sure if the locking model used for headers is sufficient with the new code that looks at headers directly... previously headers worked without explicit sync due to interplay of different freelist locks and how things were accessed. Now there may be some stale-data races when headers are accessed outside of freelist locks and then re-checked inside a wrong free list lock.  May need some extra sync sadly. Although these may just be ST logic bugs, like all the previous things that looked like races. Will likely update later today., The problem is actually that reserveDefragBlocks calls methods on a free list item without removing it from free list, and these methods in nested calls can also modify the same free list. However, my head hurts now so I'll finish fixing it tomorrow., Updated patch. Concurrency test now passes the concurrency part (incl. with 100s of iters), but forgets some parts of memory making the final verification fail. Need to fix that (marked with a comment), consider a couple additional optimizations, and removing one optimization :), and then clean up., Fixing issues, rebasing, cleanup, adding comments. MTT test ran in a loop for an ~hour with no errors. 
Need to see if two TODO#-s can be addressed (one will actually simplify code in one place, another is an optimization), then remove debug logging. Otherwise ready for review.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12865045 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, LGTM, +1, After some discussion, this patch probably can be simplified (and also made better wrt task thread load).
The code that finds contiguous areas and the code that moves stuff need to be separated. The former will run in-line with allocation when the block is not available. It will not move anything but rather evict everything and take the space. Sad, but unavoidable.
The defrag code will run on a background thread and will not need to bother with contiguous areas, it will merely try to coalesce similar sized blocks together and/or just move stuff left in every arena., Reworked the patch to discard on allocation thread, and only defragment on the background thread. Still need tests for the thread, and testing in the cluster. Lots of the old code is reused from 03 patch and also some old logic from 01(?) patch to move within the same arena.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12867705 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Minimal patch for discarding memory. I've run some perf tests and it seems to be ok. Defragmentation thread is actually not as useful because usually the cache is full. In certain cases it can be useful, esp. if there's gap between queries, but it cannot defragment fast enough during the query. I will attach it to a separate jira on top of this patch. This is ready for review... most of the code is similar/same as the old patch, or reused from it. cc [~prasanth_j] [~gopalv],

ATTACHMENT ID: 12868408 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Ran some perf tests with fragmentation induced. On most queries there are no difference (queries are not designed to be cache-bound so I wouldn't expect perf improvement).
q43 seems a little slower after inducing fragmentation than when min size is set to 256k. Will look more tomorrow; there were some spurious slowdowns during the run, where the 256Kb version was also slower for single instances of some query compared to all other runs of the same query with and without the patch, so q43 could also be spurious, Tested further. The previous degradation on q43 appears to be a fluke. Using brute-force search for eviction and not using free lists significantly impacts cache hit rates, so looks like list-based method is beneficial, I'm not going to remove it.
So, the patch is ready for review
, [~prasanth_j] [~gopalv] ping?, The weekend cache thrash has come out clean - +1., Rebasing the patch. No changes to logic; however it would be helpful to rerun the tests, since the last run was ages ago,
