[tab1 -- data location -- <warehouse_dir>/tab1
after renaming tab1 to tab2
tab2 -- data location -- <warehouse_dir>/tab1 <-- location doesn't change

create a new table tab1 -- now tab1 contains old data (or create fails ???)

This is currently undefined behavior and the solution is to rename tab2 location when a table is renamed.
