[attaching plan, Notice with default setting Reducer 3 getting 2 tasks and with (0.5f), it gets 0 tasks., Attaching the patch for review. Test for the same job; works fine., That was done for min but not for max. The implicit assumption was that max > min and max > 1, min < 1. Can you elaborate how a max of 0.5 is actually helping (instead of for instance changing bytes per reducer)?

Otherwise patch looks good. Would be nice though if you use the same style for both min and max (i.e.: nested Math.max for both or two statements for both)., +1, Addressed review comments from [~hagleitn]

With 2.0f, it was generating 1009 tasks and most of them were not getting enough data; which could have been handled with less tasks. Got around 11-13% improvement with less number of tasks in llap mode (attached images show container mode for debugging purpose).  Haven't changed bytes per reducer in my run, which could bring down the number of reduce tasks.

, reupload to trigger tests.,
