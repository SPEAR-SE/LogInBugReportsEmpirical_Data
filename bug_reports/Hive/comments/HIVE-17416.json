[I've put togerther a small repro test and run it on the active development branches:
looks like master and branch-2 is not affected; however on branch-1 the bug is present.

repro qtest:
{code}
create table t (field_name string);
insert into t values
('e_2300a?fx'),
('e_2300a'),
('x');

select
REGEXP_EXTRACT(UPPER(field_name), '([A-Z]_[0-9]*[A-Z]?)\\??.*', 1) r_field_name,
REGEXP_EXTRACT(UPPER(field_name), '([A-Z]_[0-9]*[a-z]?)\\??.*', 1) w_field_name
from t;

select distinct
REGEXP_EXTRACT(UPPER(field_name), '([A-Z]_[0-9]*[A-Z]?)\\??.*', 1) r_field_name,
REGEXP_EXTRACT(UPPER(field_name), '([A-Z]_[0-9]*[a-z]?)\\??.*', 1) w_field_name
from t;
{code}, I was able to make the test simpler
{code}
select distinct concat(field_name,'xxx') as l ,concat(field_name,'xXx') as r from t;
{code}]
