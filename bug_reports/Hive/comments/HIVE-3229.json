[One example, Do you mean you want the empty strings in column C2 to be loaded as nulls? Actually Hive interprets "\N" instead of empty string as null string. So you should write a literal \N in the columns to represent a null string. You could override the default null string value "\N" with ROW FORMAT ....       ]
