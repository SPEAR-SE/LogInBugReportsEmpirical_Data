[Looks like this works:

ALTER TABLE test_table SET TBLPROPERTIES ('comment'='This is a test table.');

Documentation: 

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-AlterTableProperties

Oddly though, Hive will lowercase the table comment at table creation time, but "COMMENT" and "comment" are handled as two different property names when using SET TBLPROPERTIES, so you could end up with this:

parameters:{last_modified_by=joe, last_modified_time=1348701745, COMMENT=This is apparently the *wrong* comment., transient_lastDdlTime=1348701745, comment=This is apparently the *right* comment.}
, that is *perfect* thanks!]
