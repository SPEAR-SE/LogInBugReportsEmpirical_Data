[Here is the definition in the code for COMPLETE
{code}
    /**
     * COMPLETE: from original data directly to full aggregation: iterate() and
     * terminate() will be called.
     */
    COMPLETE
{code}
, I think you should do like this,
{noformat}
SELECT ntile(10) OVER (PARTITION BY foo), foo FROM test;
{noformat}, I see. A misunderstanding on my side then I guess. So at most it's a documentation issue., This was a misunderstanding on my part. I'll add a sentence to the documentation to clear this up for other., Thanks [~lars_francke].  Was there a reason for the line break that put "SELECT" and "a," on separate lines?  (I removed it to match all the other examples, but you can restore it if it has a purpose.)

{code}
SELECT
 a,
 COUNT(b) OVER (PARTITION BY c),
 SUM(b) OVER (PARTITION BY c)
FROM T;
{code}

Also thanks for changing the formatting of code samples.

* [PARTITION BY with partitioning, ORDER BY, and window specification | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+WindowingAndAnalytics#LanguageManualWindowingAndAnalytics-PARTITIONBYwithpartitioning,ORDERBY,andwindowspecification], Yeah, I thought it was easier to see that each OVER has only one associated function call but I'm not overly attached to the line breaks so if you feel it looks better on one line feel free to change it., Hm, that's a good point.  The line break after SELECT adds helpful emphasis so feel free to restore it, or I will.

A bit of text explaining the obvious would also be good, such as "In this example, the first OVER clause applies to COUNT(b) and the second OVER clause applies to SUM(b)."  Maybe with "only" thrown in., I just wanted to add the clarification and saw that you've been - once more - faster than me. Thanks for helping out!]
