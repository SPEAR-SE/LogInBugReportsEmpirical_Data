[There are probably a lot of dependencies on the current (non-standard) behavior, so as part of implementing this, we also need to

(a) add a configuration option to let the old behavior be re-enabled (but we can set the default to the standard behavior)

and

(b) add support for the IF EXISTS clause (i.e. do this together with HIVE-1165)
