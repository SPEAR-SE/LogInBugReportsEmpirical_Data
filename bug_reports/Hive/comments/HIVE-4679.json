[WebHCat job submission mechanism should allow the user to specify a queue to use.  This way the user can set policies on the queue to make sure (or at least reduce the likelihood) that deadlock won't happen., Looks good +1.
We need to get his into docs as well. We would need to wait for the hcat xdocs to wiki migration for that.
, After applying this patch many of the webhcat e2e tests fail.  Some of them are returning: ./test_harness.pl::TestDriverCurl::checkResStatusCode INFO Check failed: status_code 200 expected, test returned <400>  and some check_job_exit_value failed. got exitValue 5,  expected  0INFO: TestDriverCurl::run() at 1141:Test TestPig_2 FAILED at 1371494116


, [~alangates] Can you attach full output of e2e tests.  There are 6 or 7 failures due to HIVE-4703.

, Never mind, I think I see the issue., HIVE-4679.2.patch specifies <value>default</value> for the queue.name property rather than empty string.

WebHCat e2e tests still don't run clean due to HIVE-4703 but the failures are the same with this patch and w/o., +1 for new patch.
