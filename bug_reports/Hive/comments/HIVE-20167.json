[Also ParseException when executed interactively, slightly different message.

Both error messages report the error at the end of block., I tried to reproduce with

{{create table andrew (}}
{{a int -- here's a comment}}
{{);}}

but that seems to work OK. , Don't ya love it when errors defy reproduction?

This morning I can get this to fail on two different clusters:

{{select 'hello' --  testing hive's stomach for apostrophes}}
{{;}}

while 

{{select 'hello' --  testing hives stomach for apostrophes}}
{{;}}

runs fine.

Maybe a build-specific issue? (These two clusters are probably running identical stacks.)

At any rate, it's not causing great grief. And if no one else is seeing it, 

I think it's good candidate for dynamic procrastination.

Thanks for checking Andrew.

 , OK it is a bit more complex. This code in a .q file does fail:

{{select 'hello'; -- testing hive's stomach for apostrophes}}
{{;}}

but this is partly an artifact of QTestUtil (i.e. test infrastructure). 

I can run that same code from a hue client and it works.

The different clients (BeeLine, Hive cli, qtests) do some work to split commands up before executing them and this is super-annoying and complex code. ]
