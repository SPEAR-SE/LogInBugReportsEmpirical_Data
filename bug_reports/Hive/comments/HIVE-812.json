[HIVE-812.1.patch works for both trunk and branch-0.4., HIVE-812.2.patch: fixed some other places that also called Text.compareTo(Text)
, Do we have any unit tests for shims? Can we run tests using a specific version of hadoop? And, before committing any change, we should run tests on all versions of hadoop that hive plans to support., We dont have any shim specific unit tests right now - I will run unit tests for all 4 hadoop versions before committing this.
But, making it mandatory will lead to a long time to run tests - can we make it run daily as part of hudson or something like that ?, It will make it longer to run tests only before commit. Its probably a good hit to take. We can try to reduce the test time by using ant's parallel task -  http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/parallel.html., I ran the tests in the following order, and it all passed:

{code}
ant clean package
ant test -Dhadoop.version=0.17.2.1
ant test -Dhadoop.version=0.18.3
ant test -Dhadoop.version=0.19.0
ant test -Dhadoop.version=0.20.0
{code}

We are already running tests in parallel using a little different way. The test for one hadoop version takes around 18 minutes with 4 parallel tests, on a machine with 16GB memory and 4 cpu cores.
, I did run the tests with all versions, Committed in both trunk and 0.4 - Thanks Zheng]
