[We should use the ivy:buildlist task to determine the order of subproject builds instead of hardcoding this in the root build.xml file. Problems with the current approach include a) the fact that we're likely to pick up dirty Hive artifacts from the local Ivy cache and b) the fact that it's hard to prevent the subprojects from evolving circular dependencies.
