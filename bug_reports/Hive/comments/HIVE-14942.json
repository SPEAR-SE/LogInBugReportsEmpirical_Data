I was trying to add some unit tests in org.apache.hive.service.cli.session.TestQueryDisplay.testQueryDisplay(). But it looks like that test method is involving dummy queries only. To test the query cancelation I will need some relatively long running queries to be canceled. Given that this change is small and it only affects HS2 UI, I did not spend time setting up a more full-fledged test that involves real queries (like a itest)., 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:
