[[~sseth], target version for this one is still 2.1.0? Thanks, This is targeted at 2.1.0, [~sseth], I am removing 2.1.0 as target because the RC will be created tomorrow. Please feel free to commit to branch-2.1 anyway and fix for 2.1.0 if this happens before the release, or let me know if this is a Blocker. Thanks, [~sseth] Is this issue still critical for Hive 2.1.1 release? We'd like to create a first RC candidate this week., [~sseth], I am deferring this to Hive 2.1.2 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker., I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release.]
