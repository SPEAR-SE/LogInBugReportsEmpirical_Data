[[~jpullokkaran] This is caused by HIVE-8530. Once, I removed that patch from my tree (and HIVE-8575) these above tests passes. Initial investigation seems to suggest that in these cases some literals which are coming in as double to Hive are now parsed as int after CBO. 
Would you like to take a look? 

cc: [~sershe], I'll take a look, Sergey,

   could you get a QA run with this patch?
All of the tests passed (including windowing_expressions)., I understand why this would work (in fact I was going approximately the same way, making the parameter true for some extra cases for double :)) but what is the deeper reason for treating double differently?
Perhaps literal should be number-formatted differently to string instead in case when it's not explicit?, +1, Hive UDAFs seem to treat double's differently than other types., Sounds like this should go into .14 as well. +1 for that.,
