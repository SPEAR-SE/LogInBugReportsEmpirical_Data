[Not returning partition information causes unnecessary map reduce for simple queries causing awful performance., I believe HIVE-1573 is fixed by HIVE-2315, I tested this in Squirrel and after the patch it's showing partition columns in it's UI as a result of "select *"., I missed the comments on HIVE-2315.]
