[run() method of AddResourceProcessor.java not throwing exception if it is not added the jar successfully .Its better to throw the exception to the client if it is not added successfully. Same thing applicable for  "add file" & "add archive" also., Created a patch from eclipse using SVN plug-in, patch prepared with some unchanged lines so i am resubmitting the patch created from the folder structure., This patch changes the behavior of Hive CLI. If a resource is not found, CLI will display an error message saying it is not found (check out the SessionState.validateFile() function). With this patch, CLI will exit with an exception. I think the right approach is to let the HiveServer pass the Session.err back to the client side. This requires changing the HiveServer from the blocking thrift model to nonblocking model. There should be a JIRA exists for that. , Ya sorry i missed the behavior change of the CLI scenario.

Now i attached one patch with the new solution like instead of throwing the RuntimeExcetion return the CommandProcessorResponse with non zero responseCode.

Based on the responseCode of CommandProcessorResponse HiveServer.java(HIVEServer Mode), CliDriver.java(CLI Mode) and HWISessionItem.java(HIVEWebUI mode) will respond.

This way the behavior change won't be there. Pls review this and give u r comments., +1.

Sorry about the delay. ]
