[I don't think column removal is supported by schema evolution yet. cc [~mmccline], I used column removal as an easy example of how to recreate the problem. A user would also run into in in a scenario where there are multiple tables pointing to the same location. If, for example, there is one managed table and one external table pointing to the same location, and columns are added to the managed table, this error would occur on any SELECT to the external table.

This behavior was introduced in 1.2 (as mentioned in the description)]
