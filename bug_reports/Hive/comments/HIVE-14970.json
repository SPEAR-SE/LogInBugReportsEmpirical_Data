I am not sure who knows more about this aspect of bucketing., According to [~gopalv] this is specific to table sample.
Perhaps we should disable or remove SamplePruner entirely, and check other places to make sure that noone else makes this assumption (one file per bucket, in order), [~ashutoshc] [~gopalv] I believe this can also affect BucketingSortingReduceSinkOptimizer - storeBucketPathMapping stores it based on file order]
