[The patch appends a "-k" to the curl command when making requests to https urls. The option allows curl to make insecure ssl connections and transfers., +1
, Looks good to me from reading up "man curl" :

{noformat}
       -k/--insecure
              (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers. All SSL connections  are  attempted  to  be
              made  secure  by  using  the  CA  certificate  bundle  installed by default. This makes all connections considered "insecure" fail unless
              -k/--insecure is used.

              See this online resource for further details: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

+1., Committed to trunk, Thanks, Deepesh! Setting the fix version to 0.14.

[~rhbutani], Deepesh would like to get this included in 0.13 as well. I think it makes sense for inclusion, since it's needed to allow our E2E tests to run in a secure environment. Could we backport this?, +1 for 0.13, Thanks Harish and Deepesh, committed to 0.13., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
