[Another user who is not a supergroup member can also view the table., I have created two users user 'unni' and user 'sachin'. user unni created a table 'test3' so that user sachin cannot view that table. But user sachin is able to grant all permission to the table test3.
I have set
1)hive.security.authorization.enabled=true(in hive-site.xml)
2)dfs.permissions=true(in hdfs-site.xml)
3)dfs.permissions.supergroup=supergroup(in hdfs-site.xml)
user unni is in supergroup group.
The user sachin is even able to revoke all permissions from the owner of the table user unni. User sachin is not a member of supergroup., Just to make sure - does that happen for you when user "sachin" is _not_ in supergroup, or regardless of whether he is in supergroup or not?, Curious if anyone has looked into this bug and decided on it's severity? Bug is almost 1 year old., It happens regardless of whether the user is a superuser or not., I'm having the same issue. ]
