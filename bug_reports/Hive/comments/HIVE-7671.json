[Where did you expect to find it on the Hive website?  Perhaps we should add it to the menu in a noticeable place.

If you look in the latest Javadocs, HCatalog packages are prominently displayed.  In previous releases, though, they seem to be missing -- the package org.apache.hive.hcatalog is empty in the 0.12.0 Javadocs.  The obsolete package org.apache.hcatalog is also empty.

* [Javadocs for Hive 0.13.1 | http://hive.apache.org/javadocs/r0.13.1/api/index.html]
* [Javadocs for Hive 0.12.0 (see org.apache.hive.hcatalog) | http://hive.apache.org/javadocs/r0.12.0/api/index.html]

The Hive wiki home page has a major section for HCatalog and WebHCat documentation.  The introduction also links to the HCatalog and WebHCat documentation.

* [Hive wiki | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home]
** [HCatalog manual | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog]
** [WebHCat manual | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat],  The HCatalog Incubator status page:
http://incubator.apache.org/projects/hcatalog.html
and the summary section
http://incubator.apache.org/projects/index.html#hcatalog
both end up linking direct to http://hive.apache.org/

so there should be some basic information on that page about HCatalog. It can link to the wiki for further info.

I assume the HCatalog incubator releases are of historic interest only now, so please remove the directory:

https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/hcatalog/
