[Looks like the golden file for this test was changed by HIVE-8978 and the golden file now says 561 rows in the stats lines. Running the test still shows the original 12288 rows. When I run this test with vectorization=false, the stats still show 12288 rows, so I think this number is correct rather than the 561 rows. 

[~jxiang], was the golden file (.q.out) for this test generated from the Spark branch? If so, spark may have some wrong results here., Patch to update golden file, About my first comment about spark branch results, maybe not wrong results, but just different stats., That's interesting. When I used TestCliDriver, it shows 12288 rows. When I used TestMinimrCliDriver, it shows 561 rows. Which test driver did you use?, I had only used TestCliDriver (that was the one that appeared to be failing). So that test is run by both TestCliDriver and TestMinimrCliDriver, and different stats results for both?, Looking at itests/src/test/resources/testconfiguration.properties, it doesn't appear that vector_decimal_aggregate.q is run by TestMinimrCliDriver. It is run by TestMiniTezCliDriver though, and the stats in tez/vector_decimal_aggregate.q.out seem to match the one with 12288 rows., I see. +1,
