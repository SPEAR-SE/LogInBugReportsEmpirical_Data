[In RetryingHMSHandler, there are checks for get_table and get_partitions not to log to error, I guess similar thing needs to apply for new method "get_function"., This seems to work and get rid of the stack trace in the log.  

However, FunctionRegistry.getFunctionInfoFromMetastore() still seems to print the top-level error, not sure if its by design. + [~jdere], +1 assuming tests pass, esp. negative cli ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12632374, Hi [~szehon], given that logic in FunctionRegistry.getFunctionInfoFromMetastore() does not propagate the exception I did feel like in the general case we should log exceptions, though I could see us not doing that for that particular error.  I suppose there could be a couple of ways to change getFunctionInfoFromMetastore():
1. Set the logging level to DEBUG (not sure if the message will still show up in the test logs).
2. Add a special catch for for NoSuchObjectException, so that particular error is not logged., 1 would still appear in logs, yeah, just do (2), Yea makes sense, let's do (2) to keep it consistent with getting non-existent table/partition and keep the logs clean., Added a check to not log for NoSuchObjectException in FunctionRegistry., Looks like this was done as part of 60ff41c Tue Feb 25 07:58:52 2014 +0000 Merge latest trunk into branch. (Gunther Hagleitner), sorry wrong jira, Looks like pre-commit queue died last night, I'm resubmitting, has long line, +1 otherwise, Will commit tomorrow and fix long line on commit if there are no objections, Yea, Im not sure where this is in queue, or even if it got lost in queue., well, patch was not submitted :P, I'll wait for HiveQA good point... just submitted the patch, Oh I missed that, thanks.,
