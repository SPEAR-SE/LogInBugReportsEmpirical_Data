ATTACHMENT ID: 12675555
 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thank you so much Mohit! I have committed this to trunk!, Does this need any user/admin documentation?  I'm guessing not.

The wiki only mentions HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH for HiveServer2, not for Beeline:

{code}
# To run the program in embedded mode, we need the following additional jars in the classpath
# from hive/build/dist/lib
. . .
. . .
# as well as hive/build/dist/conf, any HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH set, 
# and hadoop jars necessary to run MR jobs (eg lzo codec)
{code}

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Running the JDBC Sample Code | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-RunningtheJDBCSampleCode], That's right [~leftylev], HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH is only relevant to HiveServer2 (and Hive CLI), but not Beeline.

It was unnecessarily getting used by Beeline, which this jira fixes. So no doc changes should be needed related to this jira., Thanks [~mohitsabharwal].]
