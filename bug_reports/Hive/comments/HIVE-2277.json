Thanks,

, Sorry for the Eclipse breakage.  But rather than pulling it down via ivy, can't we copy the version from Hadoop to wherever Eclipse needs it?  It seems like a bad idea for Hive to have its own version.  Instead, we should say that a particular version of Hive either works with a particular version of Hadoop or it doesn't; and if it does, then it means it can use the corresponding commons-codec version.

(The previous change should have deleted the commons-codec.version definition from ivy/library.properties also.)
, No further work required on this one.]
