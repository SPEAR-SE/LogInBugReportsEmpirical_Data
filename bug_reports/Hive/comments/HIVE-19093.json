[I also noticed the same while working on : HIVE-19133

We are explicitly passing PerfLogger as well to the background thread (as I have commented on HIVE-19133) which is leading to wrong results and race conditions.

 , Closing this issue with the patch added in HIVE-19133.

Driver.run has been removed, and performance logging for compile and execute phase is now done separately.]
