[Uploading patch Hive-912.patch., The changes look good - just a minor comment.
Do you need to change odbc/src/cpp/hiveclienthelper.cpp ?

Also, can you add a test for create table (not ctas) also ?
, are you about the regular create table stmt is case sensitive? I remember putting some unit-tests for that., I think most DDL cases works fine (case insensitive). I have manually tested some and all works.  But I've seen diffs in the POSTHOOK when running unittests. Some examples are uniquejoin.q.out
    [junit] < POSTHOOK: Output: default@t1
    [junit] ---
    [junit] > POSTHOOK: Output: default@T1

My change will be to convert table names to lower case in the createTableDesc at the very beginning of analyzing DDL statement. This will guarantee all code paths using the createTableDesc will see lower cased table names. , Also, I remember Oracle used to support "" for preserving case sensitive stuff.
What will happen in that case with Hive ?, I thought Oracle's syntax would be put double quote around identifiers so that they won't be interpreted as keywords (e.g. "--tablename" won't be interpretated as comment). Hive use the back single quote for that purpose. I don't know whether Oracle preseves case though. 

Anyway, I changed it back to use case-sensitive names in createTableDesc but only convert to lower case when moveTask move to a file. A new patch is attached. Also added a simple test case for non-CTAS in case there isn't one. , +1

looks good
will merge if the tests pass, Can you remove the new table nzhang_Tmp in ctas.q at the end ?
Some of the tests are failing because of that., Fixed the test file as commented by Namit., +1

looks good, Committed. Thanks Ning]
