[Convert the columnName parameter to lower case fixes the bug., Hi [~spena],

Thank you for jumping on this!! I think it's possible for the members of columnNames to be any case. Assuming that is true, then I think that in the constructor of HiveBaseResultSet we'll have to copy the strings to a new list normalizedColumnNames as lower case. Then we use that list to check for existence in that list. The reason I think we should have a separate list is in HiveResultSetMetaData we actually return the name of the column to the user and we should be consistent with whatever case were returning previously...

Thank you!!
Brock, Thanks [~brocknoland]. 

There are some metadata column names that are upper case.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12672682, Attach new patch with small changes on TestJdbcDriver2.java, This looks great! Just one minor issue and I am +1 pending tests.

This does not log the stack trace:

{noformat}
      String msg = "Unexpected exception: " + e;
      LOG.info(msg);
{noformat}
we should change it to:
{noformat}
      String msg = "Unexpected exception: " + e;
      LOG.info(msg, e);
{noformat}

ATTACHMENT ID: 12672786, Thank you very much Sergio! I have committed your contribution to trunk!, Does this need any user documentation?  How about a release note, at least?, I think think this was just a plain old bug but a release note is probably useful since many folks are likely working around this., Thanks, [~brocknoland]!, Included this fix to branch-1.0]
