ATTACHMENT ID: 12867489 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Patch committed.  Thanks ZhangBang.  cc [~pxiong] & [~owen.omalley], you may need to apply this patch (or pieces of it) to your release branches to pass RAT., [~pxiong], you committed this to branch-2.3 so the fix version should list 2.3.0 as well as 3.0.0.  (I don't see a commit to branch-2 for 2.4.0 so far.)

See commit 6afc1bed5ef241eb78f3014c07c5a04a9829c96a., Nudging [~pxiong] to add 2.3.0 to the fix versions.  (See last comment.), Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
