[HIVE-4143 attempted to fix the problem. But problem still exists. ,  https://reviews.facebook.net/D9435 has a testcase which demonstrates the problem and has a fix., Committed to branch. Thanks, Harish for review!, Previous patch was too restrictive, it was leaving the filter in its original location. Whereas what we want is to filter to come up to PTFOp and don't get pushed beyond PTFOp. This is exactly what ScriptPPD does, so we can reuse it. LimitPPD also uses ScriptPPD for similar reason. , Easier to explain via an example. Consider following query:
{noformat}
select s_store_name,
       i_product_name,
       rnk
from (
    select ss_store_sk,
           ss_item_sk,
           rank() over (partition by ss_store_sk order by item_total desc) as rnk
      from (
        select ss_store_sk,
               ss_item_sk,
               sum(ss_sales_price) as item_total
          from store_sales
          join date_dim on (store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk)
          where date_dim.d_year = 2000
            and date_dim.d_moy = 12
            and date_dim.d_dom = 24
          group by ss_store_sk,
                   ss_item_sk
     ) item_sales
) item_rank
join item on (item.i_item_sk = item_rank.ss_item_sk)
join store on (item_rank.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk)
where rnk <= 3;
{noformat}

Running explain before and after latest patch will prove this point. With the previous patch, filter (rnk <= 3) will not be moved and will be applied last after the outermost joins, whereas what we really want is this filter to get pushed up till PTFOperator and applied right after it. Latest patch gets us that plan., Committed to branch. Thanks Harish for review.]
