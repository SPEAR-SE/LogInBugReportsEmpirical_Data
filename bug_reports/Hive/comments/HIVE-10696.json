ATTACHMENT ID: 12732432 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Can we use new Path(path).toUri() for both Win and Unix cases?

What is the benefit of using new URI(path) for Unix?

It would be easier to review if you add RB link to the Jira, [~apivovarov]  Thank you for looking at the change. There are a couple of reasons why I didnt use  new Path(path).toUri() for both windows and linux.
1. It is a slightly more expensive call (which involves some additional parsing) which is unnecessary can be avoided in non-windows since Linux or HDFS always has / as the path delimiter.
2. There can be a case where a user can accidently pass escape sequence in the jar path in unix and instead of getting an exception, he gets a valid URI object which might get exposed elsewhere.

Apart from the minor reasons stated above using new Path().toUri() is fine in both linux and windows.

Thanks
