[HIVE-4559.patch has 2 changes:
1. when copying hcatalog/build tree to dist/hcatalog, set execute bit which ant copy task loses
2. when calling hives 'ant binary' to create .tar.gz, make sure HCat shell scripts have execute bit set.

Tested with ant clean package binary at hive/ level.  All x bits are there., I am not sure how ant directive chmod works on windows. But since there is already a chmod in build.xml which doesnt fail the build on windows, I assume adding another one should be fine. Anyways, perms for these files are non-relevant for windows. But, do we need to worry about similar perms issue for windows script files?
Proceeding with commit for this patch, since above issues (if any) can be dealt with in a follow-up., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Eugene!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2171 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2171/])
