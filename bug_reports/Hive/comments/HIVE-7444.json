[See the discussion on user@hive and dev@hive, April 23-27 2014:

* [What is the minimal required version of Hadoop for Hive 0.13.0? | http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hive-user/201404.mbox/%3cCAJDetJjhb8p_Prjbs5deMERxVMPOJDHrMFd5qvUOtk7qacWEZw@mail.gmail.com%3e], The Installation doc also needs to be updated because it only lists Java 1.6 or 1.7, Hadoop 0.20.x, 0.23.x, or 2.0.x-alpha: 

* [Installing Hive | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+Installation#AdminManualInstallation-InstallingHive], Updated the doc. https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/diffpagesbyversion.action?pageId=27362090&selectedPageVersions=49&selectedPageVersions=46, +1

Thanks very much, [~thejas]!  I put the same information in [Installing Hive| https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+Installation#AdminManualInstallation-InstallingHive]., +1 on the updates. Thank you for taking care of this.

We should state that version 0.15 will be Java 7 or newer since by the time it's release we'll actually only be a month or two from Java 7 EOL and users would be strongly advised to start moving to Java 8.

Brock, bq.  " ... users would be strongly advised to start moving to Java 8."

Should that advice wait for resolution of HIVE-8607 (Java 8 support for Hive) or do we want to mention it in the wiki now with a link to HIVE-8607?, [~mohitsabharwal] and [~spena] have looked at all the java 8 test failures and I don't think they were impactful to users. Is that true mohit and sergio?, That's right, test failures relate to result ordering differences only. There is no impact to users.  , Requirements updated in Getting Started & Installing Hive to include Java 8:

* [Getting Started -- Requirements | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-Requirements]
* [Installing Hive | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+Installation#AdminManualInstallation-InstallingHive]

(We just need another +1 to close this.), +1, Thanks for your perseverance Lefty!
