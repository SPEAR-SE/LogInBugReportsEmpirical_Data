[This applies to foreign keys as well, meaning even a foreign key and primary key cannot share a name., I'm pretty sure most RDBMSes require unique constraint name within one database., Just making it unique within the database seems fine to me., Thing to keep in mind here is unlike other databases, Hive does allow referencing tables from different databases in a single query, so making constraint name unique may have consequences to that., I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release.]
