[Make the progress reporting function a method of FileSinkOperator, instead of only for FSFile class., looks good in general, some nitpicks: 
 - lines 633, 666, updateProgress() was called after commit() and closeWriters(), but it was already been called inside these 2 functions. Should we just remove these 2 lines for simplicity, as well as consistent with the case for abortWriters() in line 644. , remove the progress reporting after each directory.
Rerunning the test suites., Committed. Thanks Siying!]
