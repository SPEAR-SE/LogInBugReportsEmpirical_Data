ATTACHMENT ID: 12742858 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, thanks for fixing this!, Should we also fix {{Hadoop20Shims}} and {{Hadoop20SShims}}?
Should we also protect the call to {{chmod}} in a similar way?, Yes feel free, although I think the former is removed already., [~Yibing], I tried to change 20Shims and 20SShims in our system, for we are not building hadoop-1 any longer, so I decided not put into upstream for lack of testing and some risk (for the code a little different).
For chmod, I think we need not make change for it used for permissions, and permissions should always have values:

{noformat}
/**
   * Get FsPermission associated with the file.
   * @return permssion. If a filesystem does not have a notion of permissions
   *         or if permissions could not be determined, then default 
   *         permissions equivalent of "rwxrwxrwx" is returned.
   */
  public FsPermission getPermission() {
    return permission;
  }
{noformat}, [~Yibing], How do you think? If you still think it is necessary to add to 20SShims upstream, I do not mind adding it and make sure there is no hadoop 1 build errors related to the change. Thanks, Hadoop20SShims seems to still be in code base and built even with hadoop-2 profile, but I guess it might not be used as you mentioned.. let's not worry about this then., Committed to master, thanks Yongzhi!, Thanks [~szehon] for reviewing it. ]
