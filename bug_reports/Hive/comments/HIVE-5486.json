+1, +1 (non-binding), [~prasadm] Can we set the permission to 1777, with the sticky bit? What do you think?, [~thiruvel] IMO The sticky bit is not necessary for the top level directory. Each session will create its own sub directory under it. The permissions of session specific directory is controlled by hive.scratch.dir.permission.
, [~prasadm] Is the problem happening in cases where the parent dir of these dirs does not already exist ? I assume the old code works in cases where the scratch dir is like "/tmp/scratchdir" (assuming '/tmp/' exists with permissions for all users).
, [~thejas] If /tmp/scratchdir exists with permissions for all users, the things work fine. 
Otherwise the first session will create /tmp/scratchdir and its own sessions specific sub-directory under that. In this case the /tmp/scratchdir itself is owned by the first user and created with default permissions (typically 755). Then the subsequent sessions can't write to /tmp/scratchdir

, But this section in old code in HiveSessionImplwithUGI.java was changing the scratch dir from "/tmp/scratchdir" to "/tmp/scratchdir-username" . So the first user (say user1) should create dir "/tmp/scratchdir-user1" , and a different user2 should create "/tmp/scratchdir-user2" . Are you saying that logic wasn't working ?

{code}
141	
  // Append the user name to temp/scratch directory path for each impersonated user
142	
  private void setUserPath(String userName) {
143	
    for (HiveConf.ConfVars var: HiveConf.userVars) {
144	
      String userVar = getHiveConf().getVar(var);
145	
      if (userVar != null) {
146	
        // If there's a path separator at end then remove it
147	
        if (userVar.endsWith(File.separator)) {
148	
          userVar = userVar.substring(0, userVar.length()-2);
149	
        }
150	
        getHiveConf().setVar(var, userVar + "-" + userName);
151	
      }
152	
    }
153	
  }
{code}
, right, that works for the kerberos impersonation, but not the non-kerberos case it uses the common scratch directory. I didn't mention that explicitly, my bad.

, Thanks for the clarification. I have some comments in the reviewboard link.
, Updated patch per review feedback,
