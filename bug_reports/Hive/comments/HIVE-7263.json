[[~brocknoland]  I'm sorry , when I merged with the commit, I saw I made a mistake.

There had been a review comment in HIVE-6394 to not use example parquet class, which is a suggestion of how to implement timestamp.  It was trivial non-functional change, just to write that in Hive code base.  I had actually addressed it an intermed patch, but the final patch did not carry that on.  Putting that back, sorry again about that., No worries! +1 pending tests,
