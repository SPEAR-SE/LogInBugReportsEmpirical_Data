[For example, Hive currently doesn't support the ability to query data stored in S3 (see HIVE-1620), but it will still let you create an external table that specifies an S3 volume for the location:

{code}
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE tests3
(
a INT,
b STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
LOCATION 's3n://FULL/adsexternal/1294963200';
{code}
]
