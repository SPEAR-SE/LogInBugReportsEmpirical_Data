[fix is little bit involved since we don't want to overwrite existing data., Can you remove MIndex.java? I think it belongs to a different transaction?, here is the updated file, this patch changes the way 'alter table old_tbl_name rename to new_tbl_name' behaves which is quite different from before and may affect users that depend on older functionality.

older behavior:
just the table name is changed but the underlying hdfs location (<warehouse_root>/old_tbl) is unchanged.


new behavior:
following changed on a rename for tables that are not created as external tables
- table name 
- move underlying data from <warehouse_root>/old_tbl to <warehouse_root>/new_tbl
- location of table in metadata
- location of partitions in metadata

rename fails in the following scenarios
- a table with a new name already exists
- <warehouse_root>/new_tbl already exists or can't be created
- <warehouse_root>/old_tbl is not accessible
, Committed. Thanks Prasad., Tried renaming table on both branch-0.4 and branch-0.5. Both worked as expected (locations are modified).
