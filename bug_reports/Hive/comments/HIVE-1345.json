[The problem was due to incorrect parsing of the {{columnTypeProperty}} during the initialization of {{TypedBytesSerDe}}. This patch fixes the problem by delegating the parsing logic to the standard routine used by other SerDes - {{TypeInfoUtils.getTypeInfosFromTypeString()}}.

Also included in this patch is a test case that exercises this change and validates that multi-column tables can be created when using this SerDe., +1

will commit if the tests complete, Committed. Thanks Arvind]
