[Other possible optimizations around the multiple copies of HiveConf (separate jiras might be better for these )-
1. Create new HiveConf objects using copy constructor (if its not already done), to avoid parsing the xml files every time
2. Create HiveConf that supports copy-on-write semantics, as hiveconf does not usually change that frequently.
