[Please review, 
(this is my first time submitting a patch to an Apache Project), Thanks [~fpin] for patch. I think better fix might be to just do r.startsWith("select") Can you try that?, Hi Ashutosh,

r.startsWith("select") wouldn't match upper cases, and unfortunately there is no built-in String.startsWithIgnoreCase in Java I believe.

r.toLowerCase().equals("select") would work of course, but I wanted to preserve the initial (futile) optimisation with the r.substring(0,6), so that
we don't cast the whole query to lowercase, but just its prefix., OK. +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Furcy!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
