[Only a rough idea, how about separating the code into several parts?, Tested with this patch locally and it seems to work. I can upload an improved version of the patch if someone can verify this patch and the approach.

Thanks
Hari, Good work, Hari. From looking at the diff between ./itests/qtest/target/generated-test-sources/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/cli/ before and after your patch, I see what it's doing, and it makes sense. We'll wait on the test run to see if it succeeds properly, and whether or not this gets us around the 64kb method problem.

Also, on my local box, the command specified in the bug description works after your patch:

+1 on intent and change, waiting on test results., [~sushanth] Thanks for the review. In patch #2
1. Made minor modification to the previous patch to generate txt file
2. Identified several places where we might run into similar issues in future. I have made changes in all such places which might be an "overkill" for now given the fact that we currently do not run into any issues for tests other than MiniMrCliDriver; however, in the long run, I believe this is a safer approach than getting blocked on unit tests.

Please review and let me know which one of the patches is good to go.

Thanks
Hari,

Hari, Thanks a lot for looking at this!  I'm just curious, is writing the qfile names out to a temporary file necessary, what is the difference with #foreach ($qf in $qfiles)?, [~szehon] The difference is that without the patch, the suite() in TestCliDriver.java would be huge enough to cause code size limit issues. i.e, the following line would be present in suite for each and every qfile executed under the test suite.
  {source}
    if(qFilesToExecute.isEmpty() || qFilesToExecute.contains("$fname")) {
      suite.addTest(new $className("testCliDriver_$tname", setup));
  {source}

i.e, close to 5000+ LOC inside suite() as of today.

I didnt see a direct way of avoid writing the qfile names to a temporary file or storing it somewhere so that they can be iterated at test suite runtime. Please let me know if there is an easier approach I missed.

Thanks
Hari, OK, got it.  I think last patch looks great, wondering if we can have a central method in QtestUtil for these methods (for writing the file, and reading)?, [~szehon] Good point, I have refactored the code to avoid redundancy. Please take a look at patch#3.

Thanks
Hari, +1 looks good to me, thanks for taking care of this.,
