[The mapred.input.dir.recursive itself is not a Hive property, and it is often ignored when user runs some queries (e.g. union) which needs it to be enabled to process some intermediate data files. 
This patch is to enable this property by default. The change is only needed for MR since Tez has done similar in its TezComplier and Spark does not need it.
For example, the following query returns nothing if this property is not enabled:
{code}
set hive.compute.query.using.stats=false;
set hive.optimize.union.remove=true;
select sum(salary) from sample_07 union all select sum(salary) from sample_08; -- returns nothing, wrong

--
set mapred.input.dir.recursive=true;
select sum(salary) from sample_07 union all select sum(salary) from sample_08; -- returns two rows

ATTACHMENT ID: 12834788 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, seems we have encountered this issue, as mapreduce is suffering loading data generated by tez union all, the comment have re-queued it for ptest; I'm unassigning the ticket since it's >1 year since the last change.

which version of Hive are you using? mapreduce is not really recommended nowadays...and I don't think there will be another 1.x release..., [[~kgyrtkirk]]  We use hive 1.2.1, just in fact, mapreduce is though old but always be the most stable engine for Hive. We use hive heavily in production( expand to 5K nodes+), which consist 60% tez, 35% mapreduce(for corner case tez cannot handled), and 5% SparkSQL(the future). 

So the first priority is stable(include data quality and consistency, SLA and so on), we put much patch on our version of Hive.

As tez and mapreduce is mixed, we encountered this issue. And i suppose this is a common issue on production , for reason that HiveOnSpark, HiveOnTez is not stable enough.

 , That sounds awesome [~wanghaihua]!
about this ticket: it seems to me that this setting could be set at the site.xml - am I wrong?
I'm not sure what's going sideways with tez/spark in your production workloads; but I think they have improved a lot lately - w.r.t. being more stable in producing results reliably. 
The problem with mr is that it doesn't got all the new features...because it's already complicated; I think mainly because mr doesn't understand dags.
I would like to suggest to give a try to Hive-3 (or wait for Hive-3.1 - it will get a lot of stability fixes)
note: with query reexecution you can enable fallback to mr in hive3, [~kgyrtkirk] Thanks for your reply.

 

For compability, we cannot idnetified if we set this parameter in hive-site.xml, which influence of tez execution is, on the condition of tez also use FileInputformat for retriving data.

So i saw this would be a good solution which seperated and protected tez engine in our production.

 

For hive version, we are glad to update to 3.0, but for upgrading hive 2.1.1 which i have done before just be a long period work..

 

you can see this work in my blog(Sorry there has only chinese version)   [https://ericsahit.github.io/2017/09/10/Hive%E5%8D%87%E7%BA%A7%E5%85%A8%E5%A7%BF%E5%8A%BF/]
