[It might be more appropriate to have a name as hive-exec-core-$version.jar, I don't think Maven supports that.  The classifier ("core") goes at the end.
For example, hive-exec-0.14.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar.
, yeah, if you're using classifier for that. I thought we could have a different assembly target., I'm far from a maven expert, but using classifier lets other projects refer to this jar as a dependency.  If we name it using other means, can they still do that?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12655955, test failures not related: 2 have been failing for a while now and TestHCatLoader doesn't even use hive-exec., by other project, do you mean projects in the Hive, or external projects? There shouldn't be any problem for external projects. For internal projects, you can put maven dependency as you do for external libraries but using $project.version. I guess using classifier is fine too., Other projects mean Pig, Cascading, etc. I don't mind using either classifier or new assembly target, but seems classifier less intrusive to Hive codebase. +1 for the patch., Patch committed to trunk. Thanks Eugene!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
