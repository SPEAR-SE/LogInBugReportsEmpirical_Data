ATTACHMENT ID: 12798073 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Skimmed the patch. Looks good to me :), Looks very useful, should we put the version of the new dependency in the root pom?, [~elserj] : Thanks! Wanted to be sure that I was using your library correctly-ish. :)

[~szehon] - good point - I'll make a minor modification to add the version to the root pom, and depend on the version variable here.
, bq. Wanted to be sure that I was using your library correctly-ish

Hah! That's assuming I remember too. I tried to make sure the README was right -- I'm sure that's what you used, so I'm sure it's good :), Uploading updated patch with version change per [~szehon]. (Thought I'd uploaded this last week, but don't see my previous upload.), One more minor change to the HiveConf description., +1
I think we should look into setting the component automatically from HS2/metastore startup code instead of setting it via a config.
But that can be a follow up task.
, Iff you make another patch, please spell out HMS and HS2 in the description of *hive.service.metrics.hadoop2.component* (even though they're clear enough from context, and spelling them out seems redundant):

{quote}
+    HIVE_METRICS_HADOOP2_COMPONENT_NAME("hive.service.metrics.hadoop2.component",
+        "hive",
+        "Component name to provide to Hadoop2 Metrics system. Ideally 'hivemetastore' for HMS and 'hiveserver2' for HS2."
+        ),
{quote}, Attached update to reword HiveConf description per Lefty's comment., And Thejas, I agree, I'll work on another patch to try to set this automatically rather than via config., The ptest framework reported a couple of failures that I tried to look into - it looks like setting HADOOP2 as a default reporter in HiveConf is not working on the ptest framework. Setting the default back to how it was.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12800072 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, +1, Thanks, committed to master., Doc note:  This adds *hive.service.metrics.hadoop2.frequency* and *hive.service.metrics.hadoop2.component* to HiveConf.java and adds HADOOP2 to the description of *hive.service.metrics.reporter*.  They need to be documented in the Metrics section of Configuration Properties for release 2.1.0.

* [Configuration Properties -- Metrics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-Metrics], Thanks to [~zsombor.klara] for documenting these configuration properties in the wiki.  I'll remove the TODOC2.1 label.

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.service.metrics.hadoop2.frequency | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.service.metrics.hadoop2.frequency]
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.service.metrics.hadoop2.component  | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.service.metrics.hadoop2.component ]
