[Namit, what do you by "describe div"? There is a test udf_divider.q in the patch. Do you mean more test cases?, We now support describe function_name and describe extended ?


In udf_divider, you need to add that  - and add some annotation in the implementation class to show documentation of the function, The current revision does not support describe function yet. Do you mean the annotation like the following in UDFOPDivide.java?

@description(
    name = "/",
    value = "a _FUNC_ b - Divide a by b",
    extended = "Example:\n" +
        "  > SELECT 3 _FUNC_ 2 FROM src LIMIT 1;\n" +
        "  1.5"
), yes, This patch include the fix in the Hive.g to allow passing UDF's that appear to be a keyword (system defined functions) into "describe function". 

Also added all supported UDFs in the test file describe_function.q., +1

looks good - will commit if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Ning.]
