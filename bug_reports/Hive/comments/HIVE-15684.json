[LGTM - +1 tests pending, Not clear why the report didn't get posted to this JIRA, but it is https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/3096/testReport/
Not related test issues., Committed to master., [~gopalv]/[~mmccline] there's really not a lot of info in tickets like this. Would be nice to know what the effect of this and have a test to repro. Is this pure perf and your picking the wrong big table? Is it going to bomb out because you have the wrong index in vectorization?]
