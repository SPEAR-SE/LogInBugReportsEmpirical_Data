[some logs files from compilation

latest: 
 - tests_jh.log.gz, probably related to: HIVE-3282, HIVE-2348, HIVE-3233, HIVE-2155 and many others... searching "HIVE Semantic Analysis", probably not a blocker, since the application works, in general...
... but it prevents others from contributing to the project, Is there any update to this? I also got the same error when I ran unit tests on just the Hive 11 branch., Test cases are working fine for quite some time now. If you can still repro this, feel free to reopen, providing steps to repro.]
