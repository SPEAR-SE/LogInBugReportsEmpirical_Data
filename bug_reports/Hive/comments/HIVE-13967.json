[It is expected behavior, *values* is a reserved keyword. To use reserved keywords in schema you need to disable reserved keywords feature. You can do that using following :
{code}
set hive.support.sql11.reserved.keywords=false;
{code}, Thanks [~chetna]. 
Do you know why we have reserved keywords for column names? Could it be because the way Hive parses the query? Can we fix that?
In the meantime, I think it would be better to fix the long error exception at least. It would be good to have hive display a simple message than a long stacktrace., Close the ticket as this is not a problem due to SQL11 reserved keywords.]
