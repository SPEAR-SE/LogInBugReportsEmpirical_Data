[Attaching patch. This applies on top of HIVE-5504, and depends on that being committed first., +1 , Marking as patch-available so the precommit test queue picks it up when it's time - I figure 5504 will have been committed by the time this comes up., This breaks the API compatibility. You need to leave the strings., Ah, ok, how about if we reintroduce the strings, but mark them deprecated so that new parameters are henceforth introduced in the enum instead, as in the .2.patch?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12631113, Noting that 2 of the test failures reported are due to the upgrade to 0.14, and one is disconnected from this issue. Also, the new patch does not change behaviour from the previous patch except for adding back in the string constants with deprecation notices, and thus, should not change test behaviour., Patch committed to trunk and 0.13 branch (in list of 0.13 patches maintained by Harish).
Thanks for the contribution Sushanth!
