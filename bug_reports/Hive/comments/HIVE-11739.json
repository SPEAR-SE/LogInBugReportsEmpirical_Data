[So implicit type conversion does not actually occur in the parameters GenericUDFs - it is up to the GenericUDF's implementation to take care of which types it will accept within initialize(). It is a bit different from the old-style UDFs, which Hive will do type conversion to find the best version of evaluate() to use.]
