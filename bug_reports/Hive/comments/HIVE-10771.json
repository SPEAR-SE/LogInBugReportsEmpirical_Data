Unfortunately we don't have much documentation for SERDEPROPERTIES.  The only place separatorChar is mentioned in the wiki is a usage example in the CVS Serde doc.

* [CSV Serde | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/CSV+Serde]
* [DDL -- Add SerDe Properties | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-AddSerDeProperties]
* [DDL -- Create Table As Select (CTAS) | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-CreateTableAsSelect(CTAS)], Doesn't appear so. This is just to fix something that's supposed to work.]
