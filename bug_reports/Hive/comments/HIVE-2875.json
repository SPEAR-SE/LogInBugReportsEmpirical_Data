[kevinwilfong requested code review of "HIVE-2875 [jira] Renaming partition changes partition location prefix".
Reviewers: JIRA

  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2875

  When a partition is renamed, instead of completely reconstructing the path, the partition specification at the end of the path is replaced with the new partition specification.  If the old path for the partition did not end with the partition specification (it is some non default location) an error will be thrown, since we don't have a reasonable way to change the partition location.

  Renaming a partition changes the location of the partition to the default location of the table, followed by the partition specification.  It should just change the partition specification of the path.

  If the path does not end with the old partition specification, we should probably throw an exception because renaming a partition should not change the path so dramatically, and not changing the path to reflect the new partition name could leave the partition in a very confusing state.

, Lot of tests are failing for me.
Can you debug this ?, kevinwilfong updated the revision "HIVE-2875 [jira] Renaming partition changes partition location prefix".
Reviewers: JIRA, njain

  I modified my approach.  Now the partition's new location consists of the scheme and authority of the original location, and the path of the default location using the partition's new name.  This is similar to what is done for partition's locations when a table is renamed.  I ran the tests and they now pass.
