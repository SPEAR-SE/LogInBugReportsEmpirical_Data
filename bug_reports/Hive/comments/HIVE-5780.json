[+1 pending tests, thanks Prasad!, [~brocknoland] Thanks for taking a look. The patch is just fixing the .thrift file which will not make a difference to the build.  The thrift generated code does contain the right declaration, just that it's missing from the IDL. Looks like some rebase/merge issue.
I guess the guidelines we are following for thrift changes is to include the IDL changes only as part of the patch, not the generated code. Please let me know if you want me to upload the generated code as well.
, Regenerating the thrift bindings fails without this patch. Thanks for putting this patch together.,
