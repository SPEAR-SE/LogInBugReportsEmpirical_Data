[Patch on HIVE-8061 should help. Can you give that a try ?, Cool, thanks! I'll give it a try and post result here later., Hi [~ashutoshc], the patch does work, but it needs a heavy rebase since there're lots of changes since then.
Also, after the query the "Column stats" is still "PARTIAL" after I run
{code}
analyze table catalog_returns partition(cr_returned_date_sk) compute statistics for columns
{code}
I also tried to put all the column names after "for columns", and the result is still the same.
Do you know whether this command really work? Thanks.]
