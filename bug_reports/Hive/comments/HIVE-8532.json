[The fix is easy, I think a patch would come soon., [~ashutoshc]

Ashutosh, there is a minor fix we found in hive that misses checking the error code and thus leads higher level oozie action to succeed in spite of the hive query failing.. The planned change is in cli/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/cli/CliDriver.java file where line 126, need to capture return code e.g. instead of  "this.processFile(cmd_1);"  use  "ret = this.processFile(cmd_1);"  Will submit the patch soon. Hope you can help review and commit.  Thx., Sure. Happy to review / commit fix for it., [~ashutoshc]  Can you pl. review the patch?  Thx, [~ashutoshc] Friendly reminder to review and commit the patch.. :), +1,
