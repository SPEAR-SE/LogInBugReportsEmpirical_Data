[Screen shot of how the progress bar would look like., Fix tabs and spaces, Nice addition! Some comments on rb., [~hagleitn] [~gopalv]

For queries with a large number of vertices I can aggregate the vertex by status as shown in the image, this provides a less cluttered view of query progress., Some comments on rb. Looks good. +1. Couple more eyeballs would be good though., [~mmokhtar] Can you please rebase the patch? The patch seems to be broken., [~prasanth_j], This patch adds in-place progress updates in console on top of Mostafa's work. Attaching snapshot for progress table., I am unable to update the patch that Mostafa already posted in review board. So I created a new review board entry. https://reviews.apache.org/r/27420/, Changes to log progress to log file., Vertex status information fixes.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12678756 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Some comments on rb. Otherwise looks good to me. [~gopalv]?, Looks really good. 

!HIVE-8495.demo.gif!, Looks like it didn't like the previous embed.

!ux-demo.gif!, Awesome [~gopalv]. How come we dont' have more kittens playing piano on jira?, Looks great! But STATUS columns shouldn't be left aligned. sigh!, Fixed alignment of STATUS column. Addressed review comments. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12678772 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Tests failures looks unrelated. , +1 for .14 too. I think this makes a big difference in terms of being able to debug and see what's happening., Committed to branch and trunk., Cool tool!  Should this be documented in the design doc?

* [Hive on Tez | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+on+Tez], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, Doc note:  This adds *hive.tez.exec.print.summary* and *hive.tez.exec.inplace.progress* to HiveConf.java.  They are documented in the Tez section of Configuration Properties.

* [Configuration Properties -- Tez -- hive.tez.exec.print.summary | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.tez.exec.print.summary]
* [Configuration Properties -- Tez -- hive.tez.exec.inplace.progress | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.tez.exec.inplace.progress]

I took the liberty of adding "when Hive CLI is used" to the description of *hive.tez.exec.print.summary*, mimicking [~anishek]'s description of *hive.tez.exec.inplace.progress*.  If that's wrong, please let me know (or just fix it).

Edit (09/Mar/17):  Thanks [~anishek] for correcting the description of *hive.tez.exec.print.summary*.

Should the progress bar also be documented in the design doc?
