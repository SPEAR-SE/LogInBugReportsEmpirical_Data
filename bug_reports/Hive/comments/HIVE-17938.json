[[~sershe] can you please review ?
, nit: the comment is still saying that the default is false. I think this part about the default value should be removed altogether.
Can be fixed on commit; +1 pending tests, 2.patch - fixed description
, Nit:  Patch 2 has initial capital "Enable" but the description starts with "Whether to" on the previous line.

Please put "Whether to" on the same line as "enable" so it looks good in the generated template file.]
