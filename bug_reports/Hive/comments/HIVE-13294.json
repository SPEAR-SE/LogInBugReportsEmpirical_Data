[Patch has been uploaded to https://reviews.apache.org/r/44910/ for review., Yeah. The patch looks good. Only minor issues. +1.

We may remove the function {{public static Schema getSchemaFor(InputStream stream)}} completely to avoid leaking if it's only used by {{getSchemaFor(Url)}}. But I know it's public interface that someone may use it. Just a thought., Thanks [~aihuaxu] for review. Yeah, I did not remove the API (public static Schema getSchemaFor(InputStream stream)) exactly for the reason as you said. The user should close the passed-in inputstream in his own application., Uploaded a new patch with fix to a typo and trailing empty spaces.,
