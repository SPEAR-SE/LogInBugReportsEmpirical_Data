[asm dependency only appears in metastore/ivy.xml

DataNucleus Enhancer has a compile time dependency on asm(Hive runs the  enhancer at compile time in order to "enhance" the modeled objects that get stored in the Metastore database).

we should exclude the asm JAR from Hive packages since it's not a runtime dependency., The last time we tried to upgrade the datanucleas jars we had a slew of problems and had to roll it back. So leaving it and DN at the current version and just using it at build time seems like a good option., https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3632 upgraded Hive to use DN 3.2.x. This comes with its own repackaged ASM internally so you don't need any ASM for DataNucleus any longer. Consequently any DN-utilising system can use whichever version of ASM it requires, Thanks, Andy for the update. I think we can now remove asm dependency from hive build altogether then. I dont think we use it anywhere else., Straight fwd patch., +1 assuming tests pass,
