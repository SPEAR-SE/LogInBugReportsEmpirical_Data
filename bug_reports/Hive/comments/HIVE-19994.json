[My guess would be, that somehow a new partition is added to the table concurrently, or something like that happened.

This part of the code is responsible to set the CD to null before dropping a table:

[https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/standalone-metastore/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java#L1426]

The method code:
{code:java}
/**
* Called right before an action that would drop a storage descriptor.
* This function makes the SD's reference to a CD null, and then deletes the CD
* if it no longer is referenced in the table.
* @param msd the storage descriptor to drop
*/
private void preDropStorageDescriptor(MStorageDescriptor msd) {
if (msd == null || msd.getCD() == null) {
return;
}
MColumnDescriptor mcd = msd.getCD();
// Because there is a 1-N relationship between CDs and SDs,
// we must set the SD's CD to null first before dropping the storage descriptor
// to satisfy foreign key constraints.
msd.setCD(null);
removeUnusedColumnDescriptor(mcd);
}{code}, Peter, thanks for the idea!

I've checked the logs and, unfortunately, found no concurrent activity neither in Impala nor in Metastore logs. Will keep monitoring and collecting information.]
