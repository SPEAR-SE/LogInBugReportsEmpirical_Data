[While starting the HiveServer, logger initialized with default properties it needs to be reinitialized with the hive-log4j.properties. so we can follow the same strategy in main() of HiveServer.java(i.e. when Hive is started in server mode) as done in main() of CliDriver.java(i.e. Hive is started in cli mode).

Note:
Logging behavior change is once it is reinitialized  it will log in file rather than on the console.
Currently it is considering consoleappender so all the log messages are coming on to the console.
{noformat}, I will take a look., Uploading a patch that applies to trunk.

Chinna, going forward please submit patches for trunk always. If it is needed for branches, you can upload an optional patch for that branch. , +1 and start testing, Committed. Thanks Chinna!, Backported to 0.7.0.
