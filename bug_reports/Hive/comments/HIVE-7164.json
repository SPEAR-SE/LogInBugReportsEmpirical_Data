[Resolved via HIVE-2702 for HMS. You will need to set property {{hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown}} to {{true}} on the HMS' hive-site.xml to enable this ability, however. It is false by default., bq.  You will need to set property hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown to true on the HMS' hive-site.xml to enable this ability

This could be documented in the wiki, but where?

Some candidates:

* [Configuration Properties  -- hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown]
* [WebHCat Reference -- Put Partition | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+PutPartition]
* [HCatalog CLI -- Create/Drop/Alter Table | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+CLI#HCatalogCLI-Create/Drop/AlterTable]
* [HCatalog -- Dynamic Partitions | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+DynamicPartitions]
* [Running MapReduce with HCatalog -- Write Filter | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+InputOutput#HCatalogInputOutput-WriteFilter], The Scan Filter on the MR+HCatalog page at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog+InputOutput#HCatalogInputOutput-ScanFilter could be an ideal place, although it doesn't cover use of the same filtering technique via Pig or so at the same time., Added TODOC12 label because HIVE-2702 was in the 0.12.0 release.  (Since this jira has the information about setting {{hive.metastore.integral.jdo.pushdown}}, this seems the best place for the TODOC label.), Removed the TODOC12 label and added it to HIVE-2702.]
