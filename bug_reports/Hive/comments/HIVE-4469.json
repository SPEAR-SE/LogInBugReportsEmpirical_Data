[The patch fix following unit tests on Windows:
1. columnstats_partlvl.q
2. columnstats_tbllvl.q
3. exim_01_nonpart.q
4. exim_02_part.q
5. exim_04_all_part.q
6. exim_05_some_part.q
7. exim_06_one_part.q
8. exim_16_part_external.q
9. exim_17_part_managed.q
10. exim_18_part_external.q
11. exim_19_00_part_external_location.q
12. exim_19_part_external_location.q
13. exim_20_part_managed_location.q, The idea is to separate the logic for execute command only for the “diff” when comparing the test result on Windows. In this case, the execution of other command will not be affected and the logic for Linux remain the same. When running the “diff” command on Windows, the output of “diff” will be filtered by a set of pattern, and if all the output lines of “diff” fit the patterns, the return value of the execution of “diff” will set to normal instead of error.(the patterns are a set of regular expression which match the know output inconsistency between Windows and Linux) Also the output of the “diff” will still be printed to the output and log just in case. The advantage of the method is it provide a way to ignore any know inconsistency between the output of Windows and Linux. By adding patterns in the filter, similar problems in the future can be solved in the same way.]
