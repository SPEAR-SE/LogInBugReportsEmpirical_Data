[[~kshitiz8]: BINARY columns already don't do that - what is the type of your BLOB column?, Its string but the values are typically > 20KB, Sorry I meant large string or CLOB type, updated the description., [~kshitiz8]: You can do orc.create.index=false and avoid metadata indexes.

It is still recommended to use BINARY for columns which you want to skip indexes for, which is encoded faster than STRING when the row width exceeds 4kb.]
