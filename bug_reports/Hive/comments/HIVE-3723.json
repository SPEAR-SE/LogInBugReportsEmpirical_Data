[The patch makes sure that calling "destroy" will always close the lock manager (and thus release the zookeeper connection.), Around line 910 if compile returns non-zero value, then also we releaseLocks(List<Lock>) and then return. There also, we should call destroy() instead of releaseLocks., The releaseLocks call happens at various places in the run method. I think that's fine too, since calling destroy would kill the HiveLockManager which is shared between different context objects (i.e.: That should only happen when someone specifically destroys the driver.)

As a side note, compile doesn't seem to acquire any locks - the call is thus just a protection against future versions that could. , Hmm.. make sense. +1 will commit if tests pass., Committed to trunk and 0.10.
