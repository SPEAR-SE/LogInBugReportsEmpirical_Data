[I think we can get rid of sprintf() entirely and start using String.format() which essentially provides equivalent functionality. No point in having a function which is already provided in jdk., Ok sounds good!, Patch removes PTFUtils.sprintf, converts all calls to String.format(), and fixes several errors where the format was incorrect., Removing sprintf is useful, but I am not sure about testcase you added., Hi,

I added that test case to exercise this check:

https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/ptf-windowing/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/PTFTranslator.java#L560

Is that a limitation we should remove?, Ya we need to address this limitation. I would suggest for this jira we just address sprintf issue. Don't add this extra -ve testcase, file a new jira for this limitation., OK sounds good, will do!, Latest patch which addresses the feedback!, Committed to branch. Thanks, Brock!]
