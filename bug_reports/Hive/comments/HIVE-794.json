[I changed line# 172 given above to use COMPRESSRESULT. The resultant plans generated are available at http://pastebin.com/m2c50c318 and http://pastebin.com/m270c79ec, And the final output table is compressed. So, the bugfix has been verified as well., Patch attached. Strangely the "Submit patch" form did not offer me a chance to upload the patch file., Committed. Thanks Saurabh!]
