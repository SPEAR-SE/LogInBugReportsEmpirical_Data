[[~sseth] Can you please take a look?, Also, one other observation is that the state changes to RUNNING_PARTIAL even when live instances is 0. That is triggering this case. 
, +1. can you take a look at the other llapstatus watch mode patch? ;),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12851229 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~sershe] [~sseth]
Added following changes
- when live instances is 0, the state is set to LAUNCHING
- when the state is LAUNCHING, we don't go to llap registry as there won't be any zpaths available yet

This should avoid the issue that Sergey faced with HIVE-15810 (if there is a repro I can verify that).

Can someone please take another look?, [~prasanth_j] would it just ignore the error? would the instanceCache still be usable? not sure how that works., It will not ignore the error, instead it just wraps the error in LlapStatusCliException. 

The exception happens when instanceCache is trying to populate all entries/paths under some root path (workersPath). This root path exists only after 1 node registers itself with ZK. Before the 1 node registration if we try to get all paths under root path, we will get the exception. The change in this patch avoids connecting to registry service when there are no instances running. 

Alternatively, we can move the creation of the root path to init/start service. This way even when getInstances() is invoked it will return empty instead of throwing exception. 
, There was also another request to update the llapstatus tool to set some state in JSON to indicate if the running nodes threshold is met or not. I will update that as well in next patch. , In the latest patch, included runningThresholdAchieved that will be true when the running nodes threshold is met in watch mode. 

Also, created HIVE-15828 for creating root path during registry service init/start.

Patch is up for review again. , [~prasanth_j] how does it avoid trying to connect, I thought it finds the number of instances from the registry? Also they YARN app could be started, containers running, but still stuck in slider init, so I'm not sure how it's possible to find out definitively. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12851253 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~sershe] makes sense. But I am not sure if container start = application start. I was under that assumption. 
I think your patch will still be required. PathChildrenCache ctor can throw exception (ensurepath check) which is not within try..catch block.. and there are many places where getInstances()'s IOException is not caught. Will review your patch :), Committed to master. Thanks Sergey for the review!, There is one other change, ignoring exceptions in watch mode (just log them). Reverted the patch. , It finds instances from Slider first (Yarn registry). It then connects to the LLAP registry to get instances, and matches them against the ones being reported by Slider.
If the Slider registry contains an entry and the LLAP registry does not contain an entry - indicates that the container is starting up / has failed. HIVE-15786 adds additional information to make it easier to differentiate between the two cases, and track what has failed. I'll rebase that once this patch and HIVE-15810 go in.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12851256 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, In watch mode, exceptions are now ignored and retried until timeout expiry.
Also, assumption about container running = application running is removed. , +1 for the latest patch. , Rebased .4 patch., Committed patch to master. Thanks Sergey and Sid for the reviews!]
