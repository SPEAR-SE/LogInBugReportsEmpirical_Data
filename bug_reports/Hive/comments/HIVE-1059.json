[+1. Will test and commit., Committed to both trunk and branch-0.5.
Thanks Paul!, sorry for late comment, but i don't think this works if some one created a table with timestamp datatype using metastore thrift api. or does it?, Sorry for late comment as well. Is there any effort going on to add these types. The language manual http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/LanguageManual/DDL defines these as acceptable types. So should we update the manual?, To address Prasad's comment, I've created HIVE-1111. I haven't heard of efforts to add these types - seems that strings have been working well. I've updated the manual to reflect this.
