ATTACHMENT ID: 12770904 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Failed tests are not related to this patch., Patch has been committed to 2.0.0 and 1.3.0. Thanks [~xuefuz] for reviewing the patch., Doc note:  This adds *hive.conf.internal.variable.list* to HiveConf.java, so it needs to be documented in the wiki.  Perhaps it belongs in the section currently called Restricted/Hidden List and Whitelist.

* [Configuration Properties -- Restricted/Hidden List and Whitelist | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-Restricted/HiddenListandWhitelist]

The wiki does not document three configs in the default value (*hive.added.files.path*, *hive.added.jars.path*, and *hive.added.archives.path*) so they don't need to be updated., [~leftylev] I have updated the wiki, please take a look. Thanks., Looks good [~ctang.ma].  I simplified the heading to "Restricted/Hidden/Internal List and Whitelist" and added an anchor for the previous heading "Restricted/Hidden List and Whitelist" so old links will still work.  Thanks for the doc.

Removing the TODOC1.3 label., Thanks, [~leftylev]]
