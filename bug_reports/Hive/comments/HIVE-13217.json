[Thanks Chinna for working on the patch.

For this line:

    if (minReplication > dfsMaxRep)
	      minReplication = dfsMaxRep;

Is it possible to change it to minReplication = Math.max(minReplication, dfsMaxRep) (for clarity), and also put a comment explaining why?  Thanks, Hi [~szehon],

minReplication should not cross the dfsMaxReplication, so you mean to say it should be minReplication = Math.min(minReplication, dfsMaxReplication).
Patch was updated with Math.min(). Let me know if my understanding is wrong.,
