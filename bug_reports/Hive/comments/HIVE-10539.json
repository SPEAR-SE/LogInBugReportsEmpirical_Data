[[~sushanth] Can you please review this change ?
Having this default set will make it easier and less error prone for users to use hive replication. Its a small change that would be very good to have in 1.2.0 .
, +1 on the change.

As to the inclusion in 1.2, although we've passed the deadline for feature inclusions, this is a trivial conf change - I can make an exception for this. Please note that if you have any further jiras like this, please do check with me asap, because after tomorrow 15:01 PDT, I will be more strict in accepting patches of all sorts as we 
increase the severity bar for inclusion then.

I've added this to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+1.2+Release+Status,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12729297 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, 2.patch fixes the test case. Also includes a change to fail fast when the replication factory is not found. It also now chains the exception that was thrown while trying to load the factory.
, Thanks for the test change, Thejas, I'm +1 on that, but I'm not sure that we need the change to ReplicationTask to change the factory instantiation from an anonymous factory that throws errors on calling .create to simply throwing an exception. That actually undoes a change I added in after review feedback to how it was before the feedback. :)

The difference is that in the former case, we do not try to re-instantiate the factory at every call - we simply fail on the create being called. If we failed the first time because reflection could not instantiate the provided factory, there is no reason it will be recoverable from., (see HIVE-10426 & HIVE-10227 for previous context on replication task factory instantiation), 3.patch - Removing the ReplicationTask change., +1 pending tests.,
