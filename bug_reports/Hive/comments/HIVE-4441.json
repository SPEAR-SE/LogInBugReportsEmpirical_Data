[Find one bug in original patch. Attach HIVE-4441-2.patch., HIVE-4441-3.patch resync with trunk., 

In addUserHomeDirectoryIfApplicable,  I think it will be better to use  DistributedFileSystem. getHomeDirectory() instead of ""/user/" + user + ".
Otherwise, looks good.

There seems to be an inconsistency in the username used in hadoopFsPath(). So far the user param in it has been ignored, and loginuser is used instead. But I think we can address that in a separate followup jira.
, HIVE-4601 includes a fix tom TempletonUtils#hadoopFsPath() respect the passed in "user"

[~daijy]  Are you sure it's a good idea to place this file in different places on different file systems?  Seems like it will lead to confusion.

Is it possible to create a test (e2e I presume) for this?, [~thejas]
DistributedFileSystem.getHomeDirectory() has annoying makeQualified():
{code}
return new Path("/user/" + dfs.ugi.getShortUserName()).makeQualified(this);
{code}
I don't find a hdfs method which can give us the simple form without "qualified"

[~ekoifman]
For s3 file system, if user specify "statusdir=s3://myoutput", user mean for absolute path. However, "s3://myoutput" is a relative path as per hdfs (isAbsolute()==false). But we cannot convert it into "s3://user/xxxx/myoutput" since s3://user does not belong to the user. So here we skip s3/asv filesystem.

e2e tests is included in HIVE-5078 (eg:Pig_9, which we check the location of stdout/stderr/syslog file). Sorry for the confusion., I think this needs to be in the JavaDoc and at least a debug level log statement needs to be added to indicate where the data is actually written., Add comments as [~ekoifman] suggested, Patch committed to trunk., Reopening, patch broke HCat compilation., Okay, the new patch e133571ade486e74f1f39ad1ab06994941ed58d0 fixes the compilation issue. Marking as resolved again.

Daniel, could you make sure that the final patch file is available in this jira?
, The build isn't broken now, but we do have a failing test : TestTempletonUtils.testHadoopFsListAsString now fails with an NPE., As of patch 841a84772d1d17e48d176b2cdf08c1a0e81dfa8f, that test now passes. Marking as resolved again.
