[[~ashutoshc] this should be minor can you pull it in please., +1, Pushed to master, thanks [~bslim]!, Doc note:  This fixes a possible value of *hive.druid.metadata.db.type*, which was created by HIVE-15277 (also in release 2.2.0).  The wiki needs to list both values, so I'm adding a TODOC2.2 label to this issue.]
