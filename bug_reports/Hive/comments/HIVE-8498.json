[Fix turns off multiple children operators for now., LGTM, +1. Pending unit tests. 

This means that correlation operators Mux/Demux will also not work right? Can you create a follow up jira for supporting multiple children and link it to this jira?, The follow up JIRA to vectorize operators with multiple children is HIVE-8513.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12675700
 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Multi children happens in:

- Multi insert queries
- Dynamic partition pruning
- Correlation optimizer

For the first two it would really be better to have vectorization work. Can we fix the actual issues here instead of disabling this stuff wholesale?
, When I did the vectorized dynamic pruning stuff there was no problem with vectorization. It seems that the multi-child case is at least partially working. Do we know why the multi insert case is failing? The fix might not be that difficult. Is it?

I can see how correlation optimizer might be more tricky. That one produces diamond shapes in the plan as far as I remember., Jitendra [~jnp] told me a while ago the vectorization logic doesn't support / wasn't architected for tagging/multiple children.  Part of this may be due to do with the shadow VectorizationContext data structures that track which columns of vectorized row batches for each vectorized operator.

This JIRA is about multi insert queries basic functionality not working -- only rows from first inset being processed.  I don't know if the solution is difficult or not.
, Tagging afaik only comes into play only for demux/mux. It might be easier to fix the multi insert case, especially since I know the event broadcast is already working (and you would disable this). The plan for this multi-insert query should be something like:

ts -> fil[1] -> fs[1]
    -> fil[2] -> fs[2]
    -> fil[3] -> fs[3] 

The problem might be as simple as making sure the TS fowards to all it's children.
It might, however, also be a case of the vectorization code not converting operators correctly.

If it's simple, the best approach might be to put a fix for the multi-insert case, and disable correlation optimizer (tagging) when vectorization is on.

[~jnp] do you have any insights?, Spoke to jitendra. The problem seems to be that the the vector context stuff is keyed off of a table scan. Moving that to table scan + index of child should fix the problem., It might be ok to re-use the vectorization context on the branches of tablescan:
1) Same rowbatch is passed to each branch as table scan is emitting same row-schema to each branch. The temporary columns are re-used across the branches. If same rowbatch can be made to work, there shouldn't be a reason to create a new context.
2) A branch may have an operator that changes the rowbatch and might need a different vectorization context. However, this case is already handled using VectorizationContextRegion.

This issue is being caused because we are not preserving the rowbatch to pass it to other children of table scan. The in-place filtering in the selected vector makes the rowbatch unusable for the other branches.
I will post a patch with this fix shortly.,  The attached patch modifies the VectorFilterOperator to restore the selected  vector before returning. This takes care of restoring the rowbatch after in-place filtering in the filter operator. A test is also included., Similar theme to the VectorSelectOperator restoring the projection arrays afterward.

+1 (non-binding).,
