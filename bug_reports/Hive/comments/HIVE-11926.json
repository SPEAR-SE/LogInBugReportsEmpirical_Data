Thanks in advanced for review., +1 pending on tests. BTW, is there a way to test this?, Thanks [~xuefuz] for reviewing the patch. I did some manual tests against some stats data generated and populated from Impala In HMS. I will poke around to see if there is any case where the uppercase column name might be from Hive itself.,
