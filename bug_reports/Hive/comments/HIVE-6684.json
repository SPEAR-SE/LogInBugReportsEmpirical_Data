[The description doesn't render properly on my browser - the 2nd, 3rd and 5th lines of the example start with three spaces., Added patch with unit test - please review., Patch looks good. Minor nit though, is that in the line
{code}
+    return line.trim().startsWith("#") || line.trim().startsWith("--");
{code}
line.trim() may be called twice, which is unnecessary. Better if just to trim once.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12643133, This bug seems like a good thing to document in the wiki for releases 0.12.0 through 0.13.1, especially considering how cryptic the error message is.  Does it also apply to release 0.11.0 without the -f option?  (In other words, can a query provided with the -e option have multiple lines?)

Currently the Beeline user doc doesn't even mention comments.  This bug & jira could be another note for the -f option here:

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline Command Options |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions], Good point Xuefu. Added patch that only trims once., +1

[~leftylev] Comments are applicable to script from -e, -f, jdbc, or beeline. The bug was probably there since day one.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12646040, [~rem120] Are those test failures above relevant?, [~xuefuz] Those failures do not involve the beeline component, so I would say not., Patch committed to trunk. Thanks to Jeremy for the contribution., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
