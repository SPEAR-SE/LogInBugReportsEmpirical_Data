[HIVE-3688 proposes a patch for many tests. This Jira is only about TestParse., I propose before doing the diff we turn the xml into [Canoncial XML|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_XML]. For example:


{noformat}
[brock@bigboy ~]$ cat test.xml 
<root>
    <attr z="value" k = "value" a=

"value" />
</root>
[brock@bigboy ~]$ 
[brock@bigboy ~]$ xmllint test.xml 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
    <attr z="value" k="value" a="value"/>
</root>
[brock@bigboy ~]$ xmllint --c14n test.xml ; echo
<root>
    <attr a="value" k="value" z="value"></attr>
</root>
{noformat}, It seems multiple tickets are raised to address the same issue. HIVE-1551 and HIVE-4885 were talking about different serialization mechanisms., Thanks [~xuefuz], I had forgotten about HIVE-4885. I'll mark this a dup.]
