[[~pvary], your analysis makes sense. Thanks., The proposed patch:
- Keeping the retying behavior
- NONODE, and NODEEXISTS are not Serious Zookeeper exceptions
- Moved the exit check into the switch, [~pvary] I think the Exception e1 will be eaten, if it is not an instance of KeeperException, after numRetriesForLock with this patch., Cleaned up the code a little.
I think it is more readable this way., LGTM, +1 pending tests.,
