[This patch fix the TestMTQueries bug, and solves a bunch of failing queries from testcase org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.

It substitutes HashMap for LinkedHashMap so that all JVMs have the same output.

The "*.q.out" files are the new expected outputs from the testcases.

Fix is for Hive 0.10.]
