    Rather than repeating the HiveConf.getVar in several places, it would be cleaner to just pass the configuration down into the Utilities method as the new parameter and have it do the configuration check.

    This "anObject" insertion looks like it was accidental.

I meant "I did that before...".

I didn't that before, but changed the way in the patch later. The reason is that the getting the value of localMode is HiveConf.getVar is a hash lookup and and a string comparison.

, I think a profiler would show it as negligible in that context, but I won't argue the point.  Can you fix the other one?
, new patch that removes accidental junks in HadoopShims.java. , +1.  Will commit when tests pass.
, Ning, this ran through cleanly with Hadoop 0.17 (where I verified that it fixes the problem), but on Hadoop 0.20, it results in a lot of test failures.  These aren't just diffs due to missing ORDER BY; values are actually missing from the results.
, Attached junit-noframes.html with the failures (but not the diffs).

Example diff snippet from union6.q:

, This issue is fixed by another patch that fixes the code to extract task ID from file names for hadoop 0.17. It is not an issue in both branch 0.6 and trunk (which dropped support for pre-0.20 hadoop). ]
