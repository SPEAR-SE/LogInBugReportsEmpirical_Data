ATTACHMENT ID: 12674139, I think this looks good. We'll need to get HIVE-8391 in and you can redo the patch so it doesn't include those changes.
Can you confirm testCliDriver_parallel is not a legit failure - does it pass locally when you run it?, Thanks.  I removed HIVE-8391 changes and verified testCliDriver_parallel executes successfully on my laptop.  New patch is #4.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12674374, Forgot to remove timestamp_comparison2.q and timestamp_comparison2.q.out from HIVE-8391 patch #4., +1 if you can also remove the update to parallel.q.out. This test case seems to be failing intermittently on some other patches as well.,
