[Can you add a test for this ?

Also, do you think it is a good idea to convert a subset of tests to use rcfile ?, Will add a testcase. 

>>Also, do you think it is a good idea to convert a subset of tests to use rcfile ?
Yes. We may need to do this soon or later, and right now is a good time. It maybe better if we do this in a separate jira.
What others think? , Added a testcase in the patch for trunk. (hive-rcfile-reader-trunk.2.patch), Yongqiang, I noticed you have added a unit test in TestRCFile.java. Is it possible to add a unit test as .q file? The benefit of doing this is that TestRCFile just test one code path for particular functions. If we change the code path later in the real execution engine, we may not cover the error case, but a .q file will  be more likely to catch the caes., Another suggestion: in RCFileRecordReader.java, next(LongWritable, BytesRefArrayWritable) shares many common code with next(LongWritable). Can you refactor this function to something like:

public boolean next(LongWritable key, ByteRefArrayWritable value) 
  throws IOException {
more = next(key);
if ( more ) {
  in.getCurrentRow(value);
}
return more;
}

This will always keep the logic consistent for the two next() functions., Attached 2 patches. hive-1088-branch0.5-2010-1-25.patch is for branch 0.5, and hive-1088-trunk-2010-1-25.patch is for trunk code., +1. Looks good. Will commit if tests pass., Committed to 0.5.0 and trunk (0.6.0).  Thanks Yongqiang!]
