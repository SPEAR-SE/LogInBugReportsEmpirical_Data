ATTACHMENT ID: 12765997 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~kiran.kolli] The patch looks fine. Is there one or a need for one e2e test case covering the above scenario., JobStatus e2e test already covers this but the server needs to configure templeton.jobs.listorder setting with lexicographicaldesc. The test case is generic that it will cover both orderings., Thanks for the comment. +1 for the change., Patch committed to master, branch-1. Thanks to [~kiran.kolli] for the patch.]
