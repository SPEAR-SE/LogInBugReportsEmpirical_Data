[I have a preliminary patch for this issue. Will upload shortly., [~cdrome] The attached patch looks like it is meant for HiveServer2 and not Metastore. We created HIVE-6741 to fix the HiveServer2 side of things., You are correct. Sorry for the confusion., Please review my patch and give me chance to contribute source~ ^^, I think this is the same issue as HIVE-7620, which was recently committed to trunk. Marking as a duplicate.
Sorry about that [~skrho], hope to see your next contribution soon., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
