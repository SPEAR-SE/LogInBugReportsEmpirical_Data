looks good - will commit if the tests pass, The tests TestHWIServer and TestHWISessionManager failed - can you take a look ?, Found them. One was due to ql testlibs being needed. Also I needed hadoop.lib/**/*.jar not just *.jar. .Earlier versions of hadoop have a jetty-ext dir. , Committed. Thanks Edward]
