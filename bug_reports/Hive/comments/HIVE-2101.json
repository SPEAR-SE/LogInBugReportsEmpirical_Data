[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1534, This is different from the bug above.

The basic problem is that the filters from the join condition are not executed for map-joins., Which is pretty major because hive now auto-map joins most queries., https://reviews.facebook.net/D4359, I agree, this is an important bug.

Navis, Thanks for the patch - I will take a look today., @Navis, some minor comment - can you take a look ?, Addressed comments, +1, Committed. Thanks Navis, In this case, we had tests with wrong results checked in., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1571 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1571/])
