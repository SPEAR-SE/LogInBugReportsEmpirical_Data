[We should be able to remove the artifacts from group "com.fasterxml.jackson.core" (see the patch). Local tests look good for both binary and http mode. However the below jackson classes are from parquet-hadoop-bundle-*.jar and log4j-core-*.jar, which I assume are required for the JDBC jar. So we have to keep these jackson classes in the uber jar. [~thejas] Can you please confirm?

Here are some samples:
1502 Mon Mar 06 15:18:06 PST 2017 org/apache/logging/log4j/core/jackson/SimpleMessageDeserializer.class
  867 Mon Mar 06 15:18:10 PST 2017 shaded/parquet/org/codehaus/jackson/map/AbstractTypeResolver.class, + [~vgumashta],

ATTACHMENT ID: 12856375 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~taoli-hwx] I possibly doesn't know enough about this part....what's the positive side of removing this from the jar? I see there are a lot of excludes already in this pom.xml file...I assume this module's purpose is to provide the jdbc driver - and the many excludes are present because much larger modules were added as dependencies than needed, [~kgyrtkirk] The purpose is to remove as many unneeded classes as possible from the JDBC standalone jar. The unneeded classes not only increased the file size but may cause potential conflicts when user's library contains the same classes.

We have removed a bunch of classes so far recently. Regarding the jackson related classes, they are being referenced from multiple artifacts which are needed. So the patch is just removing part of the jackson classes, a best effort thing., Attached another patch to remove jackson classes shaded from parquet-hadoop-bundle.jar and log4j-core.jar, while keeping the other classes from these 2 artifacts., +1,
