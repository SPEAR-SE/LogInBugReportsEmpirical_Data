[[~ekoifman] Hi. I want to take this issue and I have an almost finished patch, but there is one question for the clarification. Is there some case when acid table have no partitions? 

Thanks, Igor., Hive supports tables w/o partitions.  They can can be made transactional=true.
TestTxn*.java should have examples.]
