[load_overwrite.q currently consists of the same block of queries repeated three times.
The test fails because the block of queries begins with a CREATE TABLE statement, which
fails on the second iteration since the table already exists. I don't see any point in repeating
this block more than once and have removed the repeats in this patch.

Out of curiosity, does anyone know if there is a configuration setting that will make this test
pass without modification? I tried setting hive.cli.errors.ignore=true, but that doesn't
suppress the table_already_exists warning. , Committed. Thanks Carl, load_overwrite.q was introduced in HIVE-1852 and has no repeated blocks.  Maybe Joydeep was experimenting something and accidentally committed it?, @Ning: You're right. I just looked at your patch for HIVE-1852, and what got committed is clearly different.]
