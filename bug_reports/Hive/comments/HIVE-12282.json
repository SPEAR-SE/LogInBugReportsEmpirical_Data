[Looks great, thanks for adding the test. However, I think "stripped" (instead of "striped") is the right word here . cc [~leftylev]
While you are at it, how about using a package private 'final string' for the "[passwd striped]" string so that it can be referenced from the test case. (Just so that a change in string does not break the test).
, Quite right, [~thejas], two instances of "passwd striped" should be "passwd stripped" -- if you ever get tired of coding, there's a bright future for you in tech writing.  (wink), Thanks for capturing the typo. Updated., +1,
