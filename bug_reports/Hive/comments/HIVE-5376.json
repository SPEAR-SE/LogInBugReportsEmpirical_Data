ATTACHMENT ID: 12638360, Hmm... would it be be better to do on metastore side? Both safer, cause someone else like HCat can all the API, and more efficient to get data, Discussed w/Harish. It should be ok to do on client now.
It's better to do close to data (metadata :)) but it will be difficult to achieve because metastore cannot depend on QL during compilation so some proxy class will need to be used, like for getPartitionsByExpr.
Maybe another jira can be filed..., +1,

[~hsubramaniyan] please look into the failure when there is a  DEFAULT_PARTITION, [~rhbutani] The DEFAULT_PARTITION issue is no longer present. It looks like a local setup issue. Please look at the new patch, +1
Filed HIVE-6943 to handle the Constant Expression issue., bq. Filed HIVE-6943 to handle the Constant Expression issue.

... but you meant to type HIVE-6934., thanks Hari, Sergey, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, [~sershe] & [~hsubramaniyan] Could you elaborate the comment on
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5376?focusedCommentId=13960805&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13960805
I do not quite understand what the difficulty is to implement this JIRA at metastore site and why metastore needs QL. 
Thanks., I think whatever that JIRA was doing needs some code from ql module. If it doesn't then the below is irrelevant. If it does, the problem is that ql module depends on metastore module, so the reverse dependency cannot be added at compile time. So, if you look at Expr stuff, it has a proxy class where interface is in metastore, impl is in ql, and it's instantiated in metastore once via reflection. Or someone could unf*** Hive module structure, but that seems like too big of a task :), Thanks [~sershe] for the clarification. ]
