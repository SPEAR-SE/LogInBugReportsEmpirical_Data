[Vaibhav - can you please create a review board for this patch?  Also, I'm a bit confused - won't this hide the output for the rmr regardless of -S is set?  Moreover, the current Hive documentation says the -S will only emit data, but isn't the message from rmr (generally that a file has been moved to the trash) is also data?  If not, should we be consistent and suppress all the output of the shell commands?  , Canceling patch post-review.]
