[I attached a patch HIVE-13960.000.patch which moved {{lastIdleTime = 0;}} from {{release}} to {{acquire}} and also add a variable {{pendingCount}} to make sure only the last {{release}} can change {{lastIdleTime}}., Good to set lastIdleTime to 0 at acquire(). Why do we need to check both  opHandleSet.isEmpty() and pendingCount = 0? When will these two don't match?, Thanks for the review [~jxiang]! Checking opHandleSet.isEmpty() is to protect asynchronous operations because an operation is only removed in function closeOperation {{opHandleSet.remove(opHandle);}}, but not in function release. After an asynchronous operation such as {{executeStatementAsync}} is running, the pendingCount is zero and opHandleSet is not empty in function release called from {{executeStatementAsync}}. So these two don't match in this case, if we don't check opHandleSet in release for asynchronous operation, the session may be expired when the asynchronous operation is still running (before closeOperation is called). Checking pendingCount in release is to prevent another race condition: if a long running synchronous operation is running in {{executeStatement}} and another one is trying to call {{getInfo}} to get the session information, then lastIdleTime will be changed to a non-zero value in function release called from {{getInfo}} and the session may be expired when the synchronous operation is still running., Cool. +1.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12808547 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Integrated into trunk. Thanks Zhihai for the patch., Thanks for the patch [~zxu] and [~jxiang]
From the variable name pendingCount, its hard to understand what it represents. Should we name it activeCalls (or something on that lines) instead ?
If you agree, the change can be done in a follow up jira.
, Yes, renaming pendingCount to activeCalls sounds good to me. Will fix it in a follow up JIRA HIVE-14067. thanks for the review [~thejas]!]
