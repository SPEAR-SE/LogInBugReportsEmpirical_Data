[It is already already to be disabled via one of many flags.. like HIVE_LOG_EXPLAIN_OUTPUT=false, setting HIVE_SERVER2_WEBUI_PORT to 0, or  HIVE_SERVER2_WEBUI_MAX_HISTORIC_QUERIES=0, so wondering is it really necessary to have yet another flag for this?, [~szehon], Above configs are making the web UI to be off as well? Can WebUI have explain output as optional with HIVE_LOG_EXPLAIN_OUTPUT alone?

Basically code change will be && clause instead of ||
if (conf.getBoolVar(ConfVars.HIVE_LOG_EXPLAIN_OUTPUT) &&
           conf.isWebUiQueryInfoCacheEnabled()) {
}, Sorry I am not sure I follow, queryDisplay.setExplainPlan gets called only if HIVE_LOG_EXPLAIN_OUTPUT is true (first if), and then conf.isWebUIQueryInfoCacheEnabled (second if), so its effectively an && statement around queryDisplay.setExplainPlan(explainOutput);?, But current code is calling explain and storing it in the string, which is causing OOM - even though HIVE_LOG_EXPLAIN_OUTPUT is false., We should check only for (conf.getBoolVar(ConfVars.HIVE_LOG_EXPLAIN_OUTPUT) for calling explain. The OR clause with web ui enabled should be removed., Ah got your point., Simple change, attaching patch directly. , +1 for https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12798655/HIVE-13500.patch,
