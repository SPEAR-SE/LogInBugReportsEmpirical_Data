[Small patch. [~spena] can you check if it makes sense?, I presume most of the time is spent on query execution. Can we just keep explain plans for queries in these tests?, It looks good [~sershe]. 

I just noticed that those files are in miniSparkOnYarn.query.files variable as well. Although such variable is not used anywhere on the pom.xml, I think it would be better to remove them in case it is used in the future.

+1. Let's wait for the tests  and make sure they were not executed on jenkins.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12762280 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Tests didn't execute, as planned. Will remove from that variable and commit, The patch that takes care of the other variable, Committed to master. I will file a follow-up JIRA, [~sershe] Whats the plan to reenable this tests?, [~jpullokkaran] see HIVE-11992; they should be investigated for perf improvement. If you are referring to minimr test on CBO, perhaps they would become faster by just moving them away from MR; we are de-emphasizing and eventually removing MR in Hive 2 anyway.]
