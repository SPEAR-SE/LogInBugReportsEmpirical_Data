[I was confused as to how this was introduced. My guess is that HIVE-8257 "correctly" broke this. We were inadvertently using a Hadoop 2 method even when Hadoop 1 was specified., Patch switches from Hadoop's StringUtils to commons-lang's. We already had a dependency on commons-lang, and a 3 line fix is much better than introducing more shim code., Really appreciate you taking a look.  +1 pending tests,
