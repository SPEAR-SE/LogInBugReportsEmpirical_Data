[This doesn't seem to be a bug in ORC, it is a bug in LazySimpleSerDe encoding/decoding - it should ideally be writing \\N and reading out the same data as ORC.

"\N" is a valid string & is not null.

Try 

{{select count(1) from (select '\N' as a from table) tbl where tbl.a is null;}}, Yes, it is better not to use special characters to be serialized, but modify LazySimpleSerDe encoding/decoding may affect the data now]
