[note about: #1; I think '//' is not in the standard comments; so I think it would be better to drop that.. I see only '--' and '/*' / '*/' in sql2011
about: #2: It seems to me that {{limit a,b}} is a nonstandard sql extension; (do we support {{OFFSET n}} ?) ...it seems like {{LIMIT a,b}} is already supported (according to the language manual) and it's kinda logical...

feel free to submit a patch :)]
