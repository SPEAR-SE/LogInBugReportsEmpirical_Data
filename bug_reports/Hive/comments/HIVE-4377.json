HIVE-4377 Add more comment to https://reviews.facebook.net/D1209 (HIVE-2340)

thanks a lot for addressing optimization in HIVE-2340. Awesome!

Since we are developing at a very fast pace, it would be really useful to
think about maintainability and testing of the large codebase. Highlights which are applicable for D1209:

  1.  Javadoc for all public/private functions, except for
setters/getters. For any complex function, clear examples (input/output)
would really help.
  2.  Specially, for query optimizations, it might be a good idea to have
a simple working query at the top, and the expected changes. For e.g..
The operator tree for that query at each step, or a detailed explanation
at the top.
  3.  If possible, the test name (.q file) where the function is being
invoked, or the query which would potentially test that scenario, if it
is a query processor change.
  4.  Comments in each test (.q file)­ that should include the jira
number,  what is it trying to test. Assumptions about each query.
  5.  Reduce the output for each test ­ whenever query is outputting more
than 10 results, it should have a reason. Otherwise, each query result
should be bounded by 10 rows.

thanks a lot

  In general, can you add more high-level comments ?

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:108 Can you file a jira for this, and note the jira number in the comments ?

  Also, in case of RS+JOIN, wont R1 be fired ? Can you add a test for this ?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:685 isn't this an assert

  if no, can u add comments when will it be null
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:689 same thing:
  pRS != null

  always
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:395 Can you add better comments ?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:690 Can you add some examples:

  1. when merge will be true ?
  2. when merge will be false ?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:209 Wont it be simpler to handle the GroupBy case in GroupbyProc instead of the common
  parent class ?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:216 same thing: why are these cases in the common class ?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:251 Can you rename these methods ?
  These are not generic methods anymore.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:264 Why is this in the common class ?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:512 Can you move all these methods in Operator ??

  findSingleChild
  findSingleParent etc.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:719 same as above:

  isn't
  pJoin != null

  always ?

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:209 It was implemented as your suggestion at first but it was very confusing with many redundant codes(There are seven possible cases sharing common rule). But if you prefer, I'll update patch.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:251 processOrderBy?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:254 ProcessGroupBy?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:264 Will be moved to JoinReducerProc.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:512 I was thinking of OperatorUtils or someting. Methods like this would be made continuously.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:685 can be null if there exists operator like ScriptOperator between two RSs.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:690 If there is difference in key/partition/sort-order in common part of two RSs, it's not possible to merge. I'll add comment for that.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ReduceSinkDeDuplication.java:395 I'll try.
