[Thanks for reporting this [~harschware]. I think you are right. I will take a look at this and fix it. I think the objective of the feature was to make beeline connection seemless for the most common use-cases. This is not a documentation issue but looks like a bug in the code. I think we should change the code to look for /etc/hive/conf instead of /etc/conf/hive, Attaching a simple patch for this fix.,
