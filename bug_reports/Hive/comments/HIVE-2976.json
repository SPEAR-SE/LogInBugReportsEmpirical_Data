, @Thomas,

Carl also has a fix for this, albeit a different one at https://reviews.facebook.net/D2937 I am not sure why didn't get published back on jira., The change from Carl will sidestep the issue. The change I made will keep it consistent with the other modules.
, Please note that in any case, maven-build will require that package has run before. That's due to the way the builtins module is setup currently., Thomas's approach is better than mine.

@Thomas: Can you update your patch so that the maven-build target depends on package instead of jar?, Switched the maven-build dependency to package., +1

Committed to trunk. Thanks Thomas and Andrew!, Seems to work fine (Andrew already updated the patch). It would mean though that package runs multiple times depending how you run the build. For reference, test also does not depend on package, you need to run

ant package test
