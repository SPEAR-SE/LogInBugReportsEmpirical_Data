{code}
  @Override
  public boolean pushRecord() throws HiveException {
    execContext.resetRow(); <-- resets input checks
{code}

This is why the cleanup input is being called once per row., Worse, I printed out the identity hashcode of the ExecMapperContext there.

{code}
resetRow: (1043064988) null update to null
isInputChanged: (773110290) null != hdfs://sandbox03.hortonworks.com:8020/user/hive/external/tpch-100/region/data-m-00099.snappy
{code}

Looks like the resetRow and isInputChanged are going to different objects, which is obviously broken.

There's a good possibility IOContext doesn't work correctly when the reader threads are running parallel with the processor threads., Looks like a regression introduced by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7482., This patch addresses the regression but doesn't handle multiple inputs for SMB join., [~vikram.dixit]
Patch which addresses the regression attached., [~mmokhtar]: Probably better to just read exec context off mapOp.getExecContext()., The approach is similar to the other patch, but the IOContext is more complex to deal with in case of SMB Joins.,
