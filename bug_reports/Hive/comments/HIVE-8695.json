ATTACHMENT ID: 12678733 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, [~hagleitn] This is a fix for a test that fails on 0.14 as well (test only change). I think it is a good candidate for 0.14 branch.
, Oh thank you, this has been failing for the past 130 builds. +1 for hive .14., Committed to branch and trunk. Thanks [~xiaobingo]!]
