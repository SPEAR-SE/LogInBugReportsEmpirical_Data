[It appears that tez.runtime.io.sort.mb can not be set from CLI.  It gets unset automatically in the job by Tez's MultiStageMRConfToTezTranslator.
 
However, as per CLI's output it would still retain the newer value .  It would be good to print some message from tez, whenever these values are unset.  Since this is not hive related issue, I am closing this ticket as "invalid"]
