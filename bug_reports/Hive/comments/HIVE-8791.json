ATTACHMENT ID: 12680345 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~brocknoland] can you take a quick look at this?  Thanks, I think we should log those errors at INFO level. Thoughts?, Yep, updated patch, Hey,

I really apologize, I should have mentioned this last time...I was just thinking about this and I am not sure our log message will be as helpful to users as we could be. For example in some setups, users won't know which table is on s3. Perhaps we should add the path to the message as follows:

{noformat}
LOG.info("Skipping ACL inheritance: File system for path " + target + " does not support ACLs but dfs.namenode.acls.enabled is set to true: " + e, e)
{noformat}, Sure, attaching patch with better message., Thank you Szehon! 

Attached patch makes a trivial change of
{noformat}
... true:", e);
{noformat}

to
{noformat}
... true: " + e, e);
{noformat}

+1, Attaching same patch again to trigger the pre-commit test as build was down., 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass
