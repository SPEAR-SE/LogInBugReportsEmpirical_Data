[Session return normally works. I wonder if interrupt is becomes something interrupts the thread in the first place, before returning, [~sershe] - could you please take a look at the patch.

The main change is to check, ignore and reset the interrupt status in TezSessionPoolManager.returnSession

The original interrupt hits Hadoop IPC - which catches Interrupt, sets the interrupt status and throws an IOException. This is during the getDAGStatus invocation.

[~thejas] - this happens when a ^C is issued in the middle of query execution. I'm not sure what eventually clears the interrupt status. Maybe the threadpool?, +1 pending tests,
