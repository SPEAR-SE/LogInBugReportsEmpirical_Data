I hope you can find out some of the reason.

, This issue only related to mapjoin hint. You can solve this by disable mapjoin hint (set hive.ignore.mapjoin.hint = true).
Since hive.auto.convert.join is on by default ,I think it's unnecessary to use this hint.
Mapjoin hint is a legacy feature and has been disabled by HIVE-4042 .
And hive on Tez doesn't support it , too. See HIVE-5778, Thanks for you reply.
We have a lot of querys to use mapjoin.
We'are going to continue to use mapjoin hint before migrates from hint mapjoin to auto-convert mapjoin.]
