[We noticed that the TSocket used by the thrift thread pools are purposely initiated with 0 clientTimeout.  It makes sense to make it configurable to prevent DDOS., [~szehon]: Just a quick question: the {{hive.metastore.thrift.socket.timeout}} is set differently in HiveConf, and in MetastoreConf. Is this intentional?

Thanks,

Peter, Thanks a lot for taking a look!  Sorry I made a mistake as I was not used to the confs being split :).  I left just the one on MetastoreConf, can you see if that is right?]
