[for those who want to reproduce:
{code}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test ;
CREATE TABLE test (key STRING, val INT) PARTITIONED BY (pkey STRING) ;

INSERT INTO test PARTITION(pkey="a")
VALUES ("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3) 
;

INSERT INTO test PARTITION(pkey="b")
VALUES ("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3) 
;
{code}, Actually, I don't reproduce it on Hive 2.0.0, Probably a dup of HIVE-14652, Thanks for the feedbacks.
I have checked HIVE-14652, this indeed is a duplication.

I'd like to close this.]
