ATTACHMENT ID: 12869557 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Committed to master. Thanks for the review, test failures related?
, same failures are happening in master now., Hmm, let me take a look, Reverted for now, Interesting, this eliminates some HDFS counters for PPD, that before were claiming there were N read ops and 0 bytes read. I will probably just commit it with the changes, as given the cache counters it makes sense that there are no HDFS ones, Fixed, Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
