[Hi [~chris_chen], have you figured this problem out? We also encountered it.

To simplify, this query goes wrong when hive.groupby.skewindata=true:
{noformat}
select c_nationkey,count(*),count(distinct c_mktsegment) from customer group by c_nationkey;
{noformat}

This will create only one job, and the GroupByOperator in reduce has mode "complete", which should be "mergepartial"., HIVE-10971 solved the same problem, mark as a duplicate.]
