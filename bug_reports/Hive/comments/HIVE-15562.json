[Patch makes a few changes. Some unrelated to the core issue.
For the core issue, the registration for state change notifications has moved into the main lock.

Additional changes.
- Avoid excessive debug logging in the ZK registry.
- Handle a potential leak in the AM
- Switch around the maybeRegisterForStateChangeNotifications to work correctly with the return value (was inverted)

[~sershe] - could you please take a look?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12846238 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1 if test failures are unrelated.
I am assuming that moving finishableStateUpdate under lock has no other implications for locking..., Thanks for the review [~sershe]. Committing.]
