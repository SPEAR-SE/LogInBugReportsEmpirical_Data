[Then what about the load overwrite data statement? Should it also report an error if no partition specified? , yeah, it should fail as well., The changes looks good, but I had a minor comment.

Instead of 

new SemanticException("need to specify partition columns because the destination table is partitioned.");

add a new ErrorMsg and use that., hive-527-2009-06-12.patch integrates Namit's suggestions. , The changes looks good - I will commit it if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Yongqiang.]
