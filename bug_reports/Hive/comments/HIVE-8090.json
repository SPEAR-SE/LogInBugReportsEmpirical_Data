[Please ignore that patch, A new boolean variable is introduced which checks if the codec is null or of type ZlibCodec. This is substituted in place of the evaluated expression for the boolean operator. Anymore conditionals for this to this parameter should be updated to the new boolean variable.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12668648, My apologies on the previous patch - a bit embarrassing. This one should be fine., [~rpalamut]: You patch turns off this feature for ZlibCodec, which is the only codec which implements the modify() operation today.

In this context, I think I missed a null check within the ZlibCodec::modify() check.

Can you add that there instead of disabling the feature?, Waiting for code review, I followed the comment guidelines in CompressionCodec.java.

/**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
   * Produce a modified compression codec if the underlying algorithm allows                                                                                                                                                                  
   * modification.

   */
  CompressionCodec modify(EnumSet<Modifier> modifiers);

Thus if modifiers are null then no modifications are possible. 
As per the comment the function returns the same object.
Waiting for code review.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12668672, Nice, that's what I meant - null implies no modifications.

I will need to re-format your changes for this patch, please submit patches with no extra whitespace and following the hive code guidelines.

{code}
if(modifiers == null) return this;
{code}

should be 

{code}
if (modifiers == null) {
  return this;
}
{code}

I'll pick this up next week and commit after a re-test.,
