[Hi [~mmccline] I see you create some of the wrong results JIRA related to vectorization. Do you know if they apply to branch-2 as well?, [~vihangk1] No, I have not checked on branch-2.

The trick I use in checking is to modify the "if (!vectorPath) {" in the Vectorizer source to "if (!vectorPath || true) {" to temporarily disable vectorization and then execute the Q file tests.  I look for query result differences in diffs.  Occasionally, differences are due to a lack of "-- SORT_QUERY_RESULTS" in the Q file.  But usually it is a different result but not necessarily the fault of vectorization.  Sometimes it is row-mode that is in error., Thats a good idea. Not sure if we can automate this for our pre-commit. Seems like a good idea to make sure that the results match with or without vectorization. I will meanwhile give it a shot on branch-2 to see if these tests are failing on branch-2 as well. Did you run with all the **vector**.q files? or there were specific qfiles which you targetted. Thanks!, I usually target 'vector.*' but there are a number of vectorized Q files that don't have the 'vector' prefix so to do complete you have to run all.]
