[I'm not sure what "mock" means here. HS1's behavior is autoCommit w/o rollback. If Hive allows autoCommit off, then client is responsible to manage transactions, for which hives provides no gears either. Commit() and rollback() will both throw "unsupported" exception also., I was doubting if the suggested change help JMeter. If so, I guess it's okay to have the change, as it's what HS2 JDBC driver does anyway., The changes make JMeter to works well., Misstype.
The changes make JMeter to work well., I agree with this change. I think it's more preferable to do nothing instead of throwing SQLException("Method not supported").
I have the same problem with Pentaho BI tool (auto-commit).,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12669000, +1, I don't think the behavior of this patch is right.  Since hive does not yet support manual transactions, all statements autocommit.  So, the behavior of isAutoCommit is correct, and setAutoCommit should silently allow autoCommit = true but throw an exception saying the operation is not support if if autocommit = false.

So the patch should look like
```
if (!autoCommit) {
   throw new SQLException("disabling autocommit is not supported");
}
```, That is, the behavior of getAutoCommit (returns true) is correct., That is, the behavior of getAutoCommit (returns true) is correct., See HIVE-6712 for a patch with this change, HiveConnection.setAutoCommit(boolean) is already implemented in the master branch.]
