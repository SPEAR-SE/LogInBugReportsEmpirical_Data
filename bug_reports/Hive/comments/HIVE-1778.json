[Joydeep,

Do you want to use SecureRandom or possibly use an internal static counter for these ids?, whatever works - we could pass in hash the query string and time (perhaps a nanosecond timer) to come up with a better seed for the random generator for example., Perhaps related to HIVE-1019 In that case we use aa UUID which works great for this stuff.]
