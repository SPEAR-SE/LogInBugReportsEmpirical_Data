[Given that table validation is generic for all statements today, perhaps a force flag for alters and drops may make more sense here., Viji, I think that makes sense. Rather than re-architect how serdes work, simply provide the ability for people to correct problems in tables which reference orphaned serdes. Perhaps a "--disableSerdeValidation" flag or something like that., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
