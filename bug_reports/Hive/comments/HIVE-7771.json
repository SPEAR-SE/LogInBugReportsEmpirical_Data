ATTACHMENT ID: 12662665, [~daijy] I added BigDecimal support in SARG creation in this patch. , [~daijy] The predicate object will support BigDecimal now. However during SARG evaluation BigDecimal will be converted to HiveDecimal to match the type of decimal column statistics in ORC. , Added unit test for big decimal support in search argument., +1, works for me now.,
