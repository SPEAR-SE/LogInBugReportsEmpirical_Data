ATTACHMENT ID: 12650509, Failures are unrelated., Committed to trunk. Thanks [~gopalv]!, Where can this be documented?, [~leftylev]: Not sure. 

The (+n,-m) needs explaining, but I do not see any Tez specific documentation for hive on the wiki to add this to., Right, the only place I see is the design doc:

* [Hive on Tez | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+on+Tez]

Ideally we'd create a user doc, but as a quick fix how about adding an update note to the Job Monitoring or Job Diagnostics section?

* [Job Monitoring | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+on+Tez#HiveonTez-Jobmonitoring]
* [Job Diagnostics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+on+Tez#HiveonTez-Jobdiagnostics]

However if an Updates & Improvements section would be useful for other new information, it should go at the end of the design doc and this could go there with a link from Job Monitoring or Diagnostics.

Also, the user docs could have a stub pointing to the design doc., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
