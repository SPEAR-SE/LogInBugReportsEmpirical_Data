[Is there any time line decided for this issue, or any other workaround for it. 
I am stuck with it for a while.
, Hi,

We are using Hbase Avro tables and would like to access to data using Hive. So i modified the code in HBaseStorageHandler, LazyHBaseRow, LazyHBaseCellMap to provide support for Avro schema parsing. All works perfectly and able to see the data with basic query like; select * .... But when i query the hive table with any filter or select only some columns i see the same error that was reported above.
Also the exact same error is noticed when we access the data in hive using the original HBaseStorage Handler. So do not think this is something introduced by my changes to code.
So wanted check if there is any work around or fix available for this. We are using CDH 4.4.  
Any suggestions?, I think this is more specific to CDH hive release, probably due to some incompatible dependencies. I wasn't able to reproduce this with apache stack.

As a side note for your avro support of HBase, you might as well look into the patch on HIVE-6147. It attempts to solve the sam problem., Thank you Swarnim. I will follow up with the Cloudera and see if we have any resolution., Resolving this as invalid, per [~swarnim] previous comment. Feel free to reopen if you are able to repro this on trunk.]
