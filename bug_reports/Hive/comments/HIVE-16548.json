[Hmm... what was the order of these errors? Do you have a repro, or logs?, This happened as a part of regular data population (create table blah ..select) script. Only one query was executed and this happened in couple of queries. Log file is really large to be uploaded here. Will check on trimming it., I can repro this on the same data... looks like the determination of what to read is incorrect, it tries to read from the wrong place because the range from disk is missing.
E.g. we try to get CB (or CBs, due to ORC index related safety margin at the end) at [30615403, 30781251) from the stream at [30572092, 30781251), but the corresponding two chunks from disk and/or cache are [30517488, 30571555) and [30745405, 30781251) - the start of the range, and probably the entire CB we want, is missing from the data. This can lead to all kinds of errors.  Need to investigate why.]
