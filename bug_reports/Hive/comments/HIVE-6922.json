[Would you be able to add a testcase for this bug?, [~jdere] I thought the bug was trivial and due to a casual missing of null pointer check, so a testcase for it would be trivial. However, if you still prefer a testcase, I can add it., Yes, adding the null check is trivial, but I guess it's more important to know why the variable might be null. Otherwise, null check might just hide other bug., [~xuefuz] The reason for the variable being null is that the table is empty and thus no input data. 
{code}
  /**
   * Merge with partial aggregation result. NOTE: null might be passed in case
   * there is no input data.
   * 
   * @param partial
   *          The partial aggregation result.
   */
  public abstract void merge(AggregationBuffer agg, Object partial) throws HiveException;
{code}
"Null might be passed in case there is no input data" in the description for merge() in GenericUDAFEvaluator.
I found existing examples of checking if partial is null. GenericUDAFComputeStats as an example:
{code}
    @Override
    public void merge(AggregationBuffer agg, Object partial) throws HiveException {
      if (partial != null) {
        ...
      }
    }
{code}, Sounds good then. Thanks for the explanation., +1, Seems no auto-generated test report for this patch. Should I submit a review entry?, Auto-trigger of test isnt working now, due to jenkins trouble.  I've moved the host and am submitting this patch manually on the new host, it should give the report soon I hope.,
