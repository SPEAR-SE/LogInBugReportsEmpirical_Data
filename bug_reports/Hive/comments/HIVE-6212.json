[It seemed caused of inconsistency of thrift protocol and I don't think presto supports CDH5-hive. It's not bug of hive., *IT'S NOT A BUG*.

User report say that presto cli was used like this (WRONG) :
{code}
./presto --server localhost:9083 --catalog hive --schema default
{code}

BUT, presto process listen on port 8080 by default. This is defined by key *http-server.http.port* of in file *config.properties*.
By default *http-server.http.port*=8080)

This is the correct command for the configuration of this user (OK):
{code}
./presto --server localhost:8080 --catalog hive --schema default
{code}
, We dont support presto., Contact presto developers. ]
