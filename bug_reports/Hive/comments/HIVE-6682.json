[I suspect that hashtableMemoryUsage is desc is 0, *in, Fix. Attached q file fails w/o fix for me but passes with fix, [~navis] [~hagleitn] do you guys mind taking a look?, Ah, I've missed that. Thanks for finding this. Could make a review board entry?

On TemporaryHashSinkOperator, If "hashtableMemoryUsage" is already added to MapJoinDesc, would it be enough to just copying it in HashTableSinkDesc(MapJoinDesc clone)?, https://reviews.apache.org/r/19363/ although the patch is really small, it's just the q file and result.
What do you mean by the question? That is what is done, right? I added config to make sure it's set, because if it's not the job is going to fail on any real data, RB feedback, +1, let's see the test results., hmm, is HiveQA broken?,
