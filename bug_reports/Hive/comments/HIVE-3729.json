[Fix is to remove the reference to groupByExpression in the empty groupingSet alternative.

This doesn't fix the warnings because of the multiple alternatives. 
Looked at the NFA in Antlrworks; appears to me that antlr will do the right thing anyways.
So this is a cosmetic issue.  But someone else should look at it also., +1
