[The following tests failed:

create_escape.q


and 


scriptfile1.q
smp_mapjoin_8.q

in TestMiniMrCliDriver, Just tried again, the same tests succeeded in my box. Can you post your diff for those testcases?, create_escape.q in TestCliDriver is failing intermittently, but has nothing to do with the current patch, scriptfile1.q and smp_mapjoin_8.q in TestMiniMrCliDriver are also unrelated - filed independent jiras for them also.
, Committed. Thanks Yongqiang]
