[+1, running test, bq. In facebook, we are seeing some intermittent errors, where it seems that either all the partitions are not returned by the metastore or some of them are pruned wrongly. 

It would be good to know if the errors you were seeing were indeed because of partition pruning code in Metastore., We need this log to confirm that, Committed! Thanks namit!]
