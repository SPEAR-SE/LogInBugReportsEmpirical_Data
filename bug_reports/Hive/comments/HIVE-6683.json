[I am also affected by this. It would be nice it it were fixed server side so clients do not have to implement comment parsing. It would also make reusing queries across beeline / hue / jdbc much easier, This is working and fixed on hive 0.13

{noformat}
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> SELECT *
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> -- this is a comment about this value
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> FROM
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> persons;
+-------------+---------------+--+
| persons.id  | persons.name  |
+-------------+---------------+--+
| 1           | name1         |
+-------------+---------------+--+
{noformat}, [~spena] That example is for a comment at the start of the line. Could you please confirm the example as listed in the JIRA description?, It does not work. 
It does not throw an error though, but the results are not correct.

The example is run in a table 'persons' with two rows only.

{noformat}
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select 1 from persons;
+------+--+
| _c0  |
+------+--+
| 1    |
| 1    |
+------+--+

0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select  
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> 1 -- comment
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> from persons;
+------+--+
| _c0  |
+------+--+
| 1    |
+------+--+
{noformat}

Although there are some different errors when using the column names or the *.

{noformat}
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> * -- comment
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> from persons;
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException Line 0:-1 Invalid column reference 'TOK_ALLCOLREF' (state=42000,code=40000)

0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> id -- comment
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> from persons;
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10004]: Line 1:7 Invalid table alias or column reference 'id': (possible column names are: ) (state=42000,code=10004)
{noformat}, Here's the patch that allows you to add comments at the end of the line.

All the following examples worked correctly:

{noformat}
select 
id --id 
from persons;

select 
id, 
name --name 
from persons;

select 
id --id
, name from persons;

select 
id --id
, name --name 
from persons;

ATTACHMENT ID: 12671244, +1, Thank you Sergio! I have committed this to trunk!, Need to add to this page for Hive 0.15.

[https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients], Sergio, I believe the following still fails in beeline

select 
id
from persons; -- a comment after semicolon, Thanks [~Tauruzzz]
Could you create a JIRA, and include necessary information to reproduce and versions?, I have created a JIRA for the issue that Sergey reported.
