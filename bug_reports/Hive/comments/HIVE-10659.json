[cc-ing [~thejas] / [~sushanth] for review. I tested this with the initially committed patch for HIVE-7018 and it seems to resolve the issue that we found in HIVE-10614. Once this patch goes in, we should be able to get HIVE-7018 in as well.

Thanks
Hari,

Thanks
Hari, +1., Committed to branch-1.2 and master. Thanks, Hari!, This should be documented in the wiki.  I'm not adding a TODOC label because we don't have one for 1.2.1, but we could use the TODOC1.2 label.

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Beelineâ€“NewCommandLineShell], Thanks for the spot, Lefty - created new label. Ultimately, though, 1.2.1 will replace 1.2.0, so I guess TODOC1.2 would have sufficed - I added this in the meanwhile anyway., [~sushanth] [~leftylev] Thanks for the previous comments. Sorry for the misleading title here; my bad, I should have mentioned that this fix proposed here is intended to fix the delimiter issue only when beeline is accessed via schematool. I.e, this change is internal and is used only by the hive schematool and need not be documented. For the general solution to the issue mentioned in the jira, i.e. for beeline to support this feature we need to introduce a command similar to DELIMITER used in MySQL client. This will be covered under HIVE-10865 and should hopefully make it for 1.3 release.

Thanks
Hari, Cool.  Thanks Hari.]
