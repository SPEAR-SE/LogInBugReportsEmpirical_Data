ATTACHMENT ID: 12828419 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~ashutoshc], could you take a look? Thanks, LGTM +1
Question: This currently only supports timestamp argument. Shall it also support date and interval? We can add that support later, just want to make sure its not something you missed., You are right, only timestamp is supported as the functions are taken directly from Druid and they work with that type. But actually, we should create a follow-up to extend them; I will do that. In addition, we should create the vectorized counterparts too., Pushed to master, thanks for the review [~ashutoshc]!, Doc note:  floor (<time> to <timeunit>) needs to be documented in the wiki for release 2.2.0.

Added a TODOC2.2 label., Hi [~jcamachorodriguez], as reported by [~ekoifman] and tested by myself, your patch introduced ambiguity into the grammar.
{code}
warning(200): IdentifiersParser.g:327:5:
Decision can match input such as "KW_DAY KW_TO KW_SECOND" using multiple alternatives: 2, 5

As a result, alternative(s) 5 were disabled for that input
warning(200): IdentifiersParser.g:327:5:
Decision can match input such as "KW_YEAR KW_TO KW_MONTH" using multiple alternatives: 1, 3

As a result, alternative(s) 3 were disabled for that input

Could you please take another look? Thanks., Thanks for reporting this [~pxiong]. I am closing this one again, and I created HIVE-14843 to follow-up on this issue.]
