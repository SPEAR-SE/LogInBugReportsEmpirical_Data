[https://reviews.facebook.net/D3261, @Namit: I added some comments on phabricator. Is it possible to have phabricator copy the comments to JIRA? Do we know why this stopped working? If this keeps happening I think we need to revert back to RB since having a permanent record on JIRA is a requirement., @Carl, I will address the comments.

I am not sure, why arc stopped working since yesterday. Let me play around with it.
I agree, having comments on jira is necessary, I addressed the comments.
I could not make arc work with jira.


Copying the old comments from Carl for reference:

I think this should be called 'hive.transform.escape.input' since the fact that this affects the behavior of the ScriptOperator is an implementation detail that is hidden from users.

Please add a test that transforms data containing TABs and carriage returns., Kevin, can you commit it if you tests have finished., Here is a general problem (maybe not related to new change to this patch): there is no way to output "\n" back to Hive. It will be translated to a <new_line>. In a similar way, if the column contains "\n", it will not be escaped so the transform script will have no way to distinguish this from a new line. With this patch, more cases like this will be added. Maybe not for this patch but as a follow-up, we might want to escape \\ too to keep the escaping mapping a complete one.

Other than that, the patch looks good to me., I meaned "Maybe not for this patch but as a follow-up, we might want to escape <slash><slash> too to keep the escaping mapping a complete one.", https://reviews.facebook.net/D3261

Siying, can you take a look ?, Logic looks good to me. I'll run unit tests now. In the mean time, can you add tests to cover those new cases? Cases like escaping '\', and unescaping cases like '\\', ,'\\\t' or '\\\t'?, I think we should wait for the tests to get added before committing this patch, especially since this modifies a public API (i.e. adding a new configuration property).

Also, instead of making this a binary property, would it make more sense to allow the user to specify the list of characters that the ScriptOperator should escape?
, https://reviews.facebook.net/D3261 updated - tests added.

@Carl, It seems little clumsy for the user to specify the list of escape characters.
, Discussed with Namit offline. He is going to add one more test case now., Added more tests https://reviews.facebook.net/D3261
, Tests look good to me. Will run the test suites. Let's open a follow-up JIRA to escape a more complete list of characters., Committed. Thanks Namit!, @Namit/Siying: What's the followup JIRA ticket ID?
