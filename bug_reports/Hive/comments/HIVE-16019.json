[It is related to HIVE-12590. I am not quite sure in that patch why we removed the "col_alias = col_alias.toLowerCase();" from RowResolver.addMappingOnly & get methods. Is it because the that col_alias could probably be a case-sensitive constant value instead of column identifier?
To follow the change in HIVE-12590, I converted the column names to lowercase when processing the TOK_TABLE_OR_COL token in groupby.
[~ashutoshc], [~pxiong] Could you review the patch?,
