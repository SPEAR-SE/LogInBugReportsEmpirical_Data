[I have the same exceptions, when doing any interactions from Hue to Hive.
This problems I have only on kerberised cluster, with Hadoop in Classic mode, and Hue 3.10.
But, everything works fine with Hue 3.9 / non kerberised cluster / Hadoop in YARN mode.

[~WillCup], can you provide any details, of your configuration?, This problem may be related to Hue.

I found hack in Hortonworks community: https://community.hortonworks.com/answers/51998/view.html

By doing some research, I've found that in sasl library that is used in Hue for working with Kerberos, there is buffer with default size equals to 65535 bytes.
But sometimes, Hive produces more than 64 kilobytes of data (i.e. for query "SET -v").
So this problem may be caused by buffer overflow in sasl library.

For me this problem was fixed by modifying desktop/core/src/desktop/lib/thrift_util.py.
Inside function
{quote}
def connect_to_thrift(conf):
{quote}
after saslc creation
{quote}
saslc = sasl.Client()
{quote}
i've added
{quote}
saslc.setAttr("maxbufsize", 2**17 - 1)
{quote}
, Thanks for ur attention. 

I think you are right : this is not related to hiveserver, but hue. I did nothing but rebuild hue, and deploy hue on another host, then everything works fine.....


I don't know the exact reason for now, but not ur Kerberos problem.

Thanks for your suggestion]
