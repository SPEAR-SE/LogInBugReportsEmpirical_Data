[[~ychena], before HIVE-7733, column information was overwritten by last column with same name, which possibly making invalid result. Anyway, the query you've mentioned is not working in mysql either (works in psql, though). Can we resolve this as a not-problem?, [~navis], any idea which jira cause the change of behavior? And Yes, we can close the jira as not-problem. Thanks, Is this jira? https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2723
Thanks, No, it's HIVE-7733. I've almost forgot the context of it but probably it was about enforcing unique column names in the final stage of subquery which was checked when generating select operator before of it.]
