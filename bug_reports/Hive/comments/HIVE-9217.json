ATTACHMENT ID: 12689196 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~jpullokkaran] and [~hagleitn], the test failure is not related. Could you please take a look? Thanks. The main reason for the bug is that,  when we add subq outside union, we will have

UNION-SEL-SEL-FS
                |-SEL-FS

However, the current version only checks if UNION operator has more than 1 children.

The solution is simply to check every operator after UNION.
, add a function to count different FS following [~jpullokkaran]'s comments.,
