ATTACHMENT ID: 12690294 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Looks good. Can you update the comment in else if block (looks like copy-pasted). Also, seems like few of golden files (per Hive QA) needs an update., Regenerate q.out for the "select cast(...) ... limit 10;" case without the filter., Add two more test-cases.,

The other failures are unrelated., +1 
you can edit comments while commiting, Committed to trunk - thanks [~ashutoshc].

This needs a fix in 0.14.1, will open a new JIRA + different patch-sets.]
