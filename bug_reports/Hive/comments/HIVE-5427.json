At a first look, I am not sure why this is happening, a HiveConf and CliSessionState is being used for each test.
, The tests really need a fresh metastore schema for each run. The patch for HIVE-5419 is handling that., Thanks for the update, marking as duplicate for HIVE-5419
, Fix will be part of HIVE-5419
