[Update the .q script files for these test cases so that they can work on Windows:
1. TestMinimrCliDriver: scriptfile1.q
2. TestNegativeMinimrCliDriver: mapreduce_stack_trace_hadoop20.q, minimr_broken_pipe.q
3. TestCliDriver: hiveprofiler_script0.q, I understand your motivation to turn these to python to make them OS independent.

I think we should make these external processes as java.

Switching to python is trading one external dependency for another.
