ATTACHMENT ID: 12669168, [~vikram.dixit] i think you wrote this - do you want to take a look?, [~rajesh.balamohan] If you put the check in that if clause, there may be a race condition to localize the resource before it has been completely written to hdfs. This can happen with hive server 2. If you see the rest of the method, we wait till the size of the file becomes equal to the size expected and then proceed in case the file was already present., ??
That is my change-set up there.

{code}
  private boolean checkPreExisting(Path src, Path dest, Configuration conf)
    throws IOException {
    FileSystem destFS = dest.getFileSystem(conf);
    FileSystem sourceFS = src.getFileSystem(conf);
    if (destFS.exists(dest)) {
      return (sourceFS.getFileStatus(src).getLen() == destFS.getFileStatus(dest).getLen());
    }
    return false;
  }
...
if (src != null && checkPreExisting(src, dest, conf) == false) {
...

{code}

Doesn't that already check for size of file?, Ah! My bad, you are right.

+1, Committed to trunk - thanks [~rajesh.balamohan] & [~vikram.dixit]!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
