[This is the specification of the file format on disk, so it is not really user-facing documentation., Perhaps the user doc could include a pointer to it., That is a good idea, Lefty., Here's a first draft. I need to take another pass over it, but I wanted to get feedback on it., [~owen.omalley] I took a pass over the document. Mostly looks good. Few things
1) Section 4.4: "Runs start with an initial byte of 0x00 to 0xf7". Shouldn't it be 0x7f?
2) Section 4.5.1: "encoded if they type is signed" should be "the type"
3) Section 4.5.2: DEAD BEEF hex code :)
4) Section 4.5.3: I think we should revert the percentile back to 95. Since we only have 5 bits patch length we will not be able to encode lengths >32 which could happen if we consider 90th percentile (512 * 0.1 = 51 elements can be patched).
5) Section 5: The default stripe size is now 64MB. Do we need to mention that in this section?
6) Section 5.1: "DICTIONARY_DATA", "DIRECT_V2", "DICTIONARY_V2" has a stray "\" before _
7) Section 5.2.7: "definition was change" should be "changed", This was added to the wiki.]
