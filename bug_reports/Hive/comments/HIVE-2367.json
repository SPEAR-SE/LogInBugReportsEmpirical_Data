[@Sohan:
I am trying to fix this issue but i am not able to reproduce this issue. I ran the below queries

{quote}
create table grade (userid string,name string,maths int,physics int,chemistry int) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';

load data local inpath '/home/chinna/data/grade1.txt' into table grade;

CREATE INDEX grade_index ON TABLE grade(name)as 'compact' WITH DEFERRED REBUILD;
  
ALTER INDEX grade_index ON grade REBUILD;
{quote}

After the executioon of above queries 3 storage descriptors are created.
After the execution of above queries, if ALTER INDEX query is executed the storage descriptors number is not increased.

Pls check this and post ur queries.]
