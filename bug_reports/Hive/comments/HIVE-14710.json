[[~alangates] [~ekoifman] can you take a look? Thanks , perhaps it should use METASTORE_DIRECT_SQL_MAX_ELEMENTS_IN_CLAUSE rather than hardcode it, +1, hmm, it seems like  METASTORE_DIRECT_SQL_MAX_ELEMENTS_IN_CLAUSE  was added that duplicates METASTORE_DIRECT_SQL_PARTITION_BATCH_SIZE. The latter has the value that makes the code detect the appropriate batch size; it seems strange to rely on another config setting for that - if the user wanted to configure a value they could just set it directly instead of having the code detect it., The same patch for HiveQA; looks like it was ignored,
