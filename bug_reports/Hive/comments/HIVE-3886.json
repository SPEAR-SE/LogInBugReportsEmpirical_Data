[Shreepadma,

See the comment https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1990?focusedCommentId=13044115&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13044115 Only way to solve this problem is via shim for consistent support across hadoop versions. Gunther's patch on HIVE-3428 has it. Can you look at that patch and check if that works for you?, Fixed via HIVE-3428]
