This message is automatically generated., Fair point - SBAP initially did not have any tests because it was difficult to test without multiple users when running from the metastore. Now that it's been made to run from the client side, I should add some tests to it. I'll update it with some., Updated patch with tests., * Rename isRunFromMetaStore to serverMode
* Do Hive.get(getConf()) instead of Hive.get(new HiveConf()) because its expensive object to initialize and we don't multiple copies of configuration to be active in a process.
* Thanks for tests!
, > Rename isRunFromMetaStore to serverMode

Hmm.. One one hand, that makes sense, since client-side running also launches a metastore, just that it is a local metastore. serverMode makes that clear. On the other hand, there's nothing that stops this from being run from that local metastore. The distinction here is whether it is being called from Hive or HiveMetaStore, and as such, isRunFromMetastore is more accurate here. That said, I'm not going to be a stickler about this, so am willing to change it if you still think it should change.

> Do Hive.get(getConf()) instead of Hive.get(new HiveConf()) because its expensive object to initialize and we don't multiple copies of configuration to be active in a process.

Hahaha, I expected this, and was specifically thinking of you when I wrote that, and hunted around in advance! :D Unfortunately, Hive.get does not accept a Configuration, which is what getConf() returns. It needs a HiveConf. If you prefer, I can do a instanceof check to see if the Configuration I have is actually a HiveConf, and if so, cast and give it directly., * Your explanation of that variable confuses me further. Seems, like this code can be refactored for not needing to know such finer details about from which class it was called from. Seems like brittle code. We should explore this more in another jira, otherwise plethora of these booleans makes code very hard to understand since it now results in very tight coupling of state in different classes.

* You got me :) Here also getConf() should return HiveConf, if that touches too many files, its ok to do cast for now, but in another jira we need to refactor this too.,

This message is automatically generated., We do have an issue on how to do authorization, and we need to know whether we're called from ql, in which case we have a Hive or if we're called from the metastore, in which case we do not have a Hive, but we do have a HiveMetaStoreHandler. There is a class called HiveProxy that tries to common-alize this behaviour, but to instantiate it, we need to know whether we're being instantiated from the Metastore or ql. We could solve this by having two separate classes, and the original intent of SBAP was to work from the metastore, but that is unnecessary duplication.

The one other change that I could consider from your request is that for client side auth also, we would run through a local metastore, and thus, we could do the authorization from there itself. I would also agree with that approach, although that requires some beefing up first. That, however, would be another redesign if we wanted to pursue that.

Also, getConf() returns Configuration because the HiveAuthorizationProvider implements Configurable, and we use a hadoop interface in the process. That would be broadening the scope significantly, and if you want to go around changing Configurable to HiveConfigurable all over the place, that should again be a different task to undertake. :)
, Configuration Vs HiveConf is important though of lesser concern to me. But I do feel strongly about two independent mechanisms in ql and metastore with HiveProxy as intermediary. Redesign there is certainly warranted, but clearly out of scope for this jira. Lets take up that one in separate jira.
+1 for this.  , Thanks, Ashutosh. :)

And yes, I'd agree with that. That's another thing on my long-term mental bank that I need to prioritize and push for., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Sushanth!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #480 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/480/])
