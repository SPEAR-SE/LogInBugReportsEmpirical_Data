[[~hardik1808] Could you give some code examples of the usage of your UDF in your code? In Hive, one usually registers a UDF and uses it in the query. Thus, I'm not sure what you meant by calling the UDF in your code or spark session object., [~xuefuz] many thanks for your quick respond. 

*I can provide overview of what i implement as bellow.*

*we have create one class which extends USD class as bellow*

{color:#59afe1}public class Strip extends UDF \{    private static int count = 0;     public Strip()\{       System.out.println(count);       count++;     }
 
      public String evaluate(String str) \{        ...............         .........  return "..." ;    }
 }{color} 

*Also create and Register Temporary function as bellow*
 {color:#59afe1}sparkSession.sql("CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION STRIP AS 'org.packageName.Strip'");
  {color}

*And use this function in query while creating table*
  
 {color:#59afe1}create external table XYZ location ABC 
 AS select STRIP(firstName) AS FirstName,STRIP(lastName) AS LastName,age AS AGE,STRIP(address) AS Address from PQRTable;{color}
  
 Now if i run my code it is working fine it create new table XYZ on particular location, but if you note that i have create one constrictor in Strip class which increase counter and print it.
 So if PQRTable have 10 rows with 40 records then my temp function is called 30 times that is fine but each time it create new instance of Strip class. On console it will print 30.
 what if PQRTable have 40,000,000 records then it will create 30,000,000 instance which is vulnerable thing.

*{color:#654982}I want that, this Strip class should work as singleton class, Because this class extends UDF class, I can not make it externally singleton it will throw accessRestricted exception and i can not use UDF functionality.{color}*
