[Hi [~brocknoland]

The patch looks good. I tested it in my machine and worked fine.
The only thing I could not understand is what happened with the 'currentFileSchema' when we get the UnresolvedUnionException. Is it going to be null?
, Good point, looks like that could cause an issue if the type is a {{char}}, {{varchar}}, or {{decimal}} where file schema is used in {{deserializePrimitive}}., In the attached, in this case, we'll use the record schema as the file schema since the file schema is not appropriate given the data. I also added logging the exception in at {{DEBUG}} level., Looks good, Now the currentFileSchema is the same schema found in the uniow of the recordSchema.
+1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12694647 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, That test failed because the binary file is not in the patch., Patch looks good. One minor observation: if the datum is null, then the datumClazz will be null, and then the logged message will have "null". I'm not sure if this is intended., Yeah unfortunately in that case I don't think we can log anything better. I am going to put the logging in a {{LOG.isDebugEnabled()}} call thought. Will upload in a minute., +1,
