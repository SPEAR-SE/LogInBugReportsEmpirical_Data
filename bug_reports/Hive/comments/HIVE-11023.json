ATTACHMENT ID: 12739893 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sershe], could you please review? Thanks!, +1 Longer term I liked your first suggestion of converting data in RDBMS from DN2 to DN1., Thanks, Ashutosh. Yup, I intend to file a new jira to enable that., Created HIVE-11039 to help convert DN2 to DN1 naming scheme., Committed to branch-1.2, branch-1 and master.

Thanks, Ashutosh!, qq, [~sushanth], does this happen to previous releases as well?, [~xuefuz] : Yes, this will happen to all releases with directSql - which means anything past 0.12, I think. That said, the number of installations that override this parameter should hopefully be minimal.

If people are using datanucleus2 as their identifierFactory version, then:
a) They should disable directSql (can be done by conf parameter, does not need this code fix - the code fix simply automates that for current and future releases)
b) They should retain that identifierFactory - a mixed metastore with both is bad.
c) Once we have a way of migrating them, as with HIVE-11039 filed, we should migrate them out of it.

This parameter should never have been a part of hive-site.xml, I think, since it's dangerous if a user changes it. A "datanucleus1" installation changing the parameter to "datanucleus2" or vice-versa can result in metadata corruption for us.
, Makes sense. Thanks for the explanation., Should this be documented in the wiki?]
