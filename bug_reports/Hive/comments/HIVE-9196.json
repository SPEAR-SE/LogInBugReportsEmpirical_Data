ATTACHMENT ID: 12688788 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~decster] Have you tested this patch fixes your issue? From stacktrace it seems unlikely this patch is addressing the issue. 
[~sershe] What do you think ?, Is the 2nd call necessary? This only needs to be called once per session (perhaps method could use a better name), so it's typically only called in the beginning of some operation like get partitions or get stats.
Otherwise, makes sense, Hi Sergey, What do you mean "2nd call"? I add doDbSpecificInitializationsBeforeQuery in the beginning of getTableStats and getPartitionStats. If you mean getPartitionStats, I think the same problem for getTableStats also exists in getPartitionStats. 
I see in MetaStoreDirectSql constructor, determineDbType() is called and should already set "SET @@session.sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES", but the error message indicates that it's no enough.

  , Hi [~sershe], is my last comments make sense? If not, I can update the patch to remove 2nd call.
