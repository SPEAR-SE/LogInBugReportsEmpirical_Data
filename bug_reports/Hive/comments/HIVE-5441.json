[Review request on https://reviews.apache.org/r/14486/, [~prasadm] You might wanna link: [HIVE-4321|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4321], [HIVE-4923|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4923]. Thanks!, [~prasadm] I may be wrong, but from what I see in this patch, this splits execute into compile and run. I am not able to connect it with: "Async query execution doesn't return resultset status". Could I be missing something? Thanks!, [~vaibhavgumashta] That's correct. The availability of result is determined by looking at fetchtask of the plan (with an exception of explain). Hence the patch is doing a synchronous compilation and async execution. , Thanks [~prasadm]! 

+1 from me (non-binding)., Should this jira be marked PA?, This on top of HIVE-5440 patch which is not committed yet., [~prasadm] I think it will also be useful (another jira maybe) to add a COMPILING OperationState and let the compilation go on asynchronously. , I did consider that, but wan't convinced that it would be useful in context of this patch. The next step could be to expose the compilation via new message (eg Prepare() ) which can be used for both sync and async execution and add COMPILING as a new state. This would be helpful when porting existing JDBC or ODBC applications originally developed for relational databases., Makes sense. Let me create another jira for that. Thanks!, [~prasadm] Another query: so I'm guessing that after compilation, in the use case you pointed to, you're planning to use the presence of fetch task in the plan (like here: https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/service/src/java/org/apache/hive/service/cli/operation/SQLOperation.java#L110) to determine if it will generate a result set before the query is run, and not set TOperationHandle#hasResultSet to true?, That's correct. The existing logic for checking fetch task is not changed as part of this patch., cc [~brocknoland] [~thejas] It will be good to get this in if there are no more concerns. Thanks!, Linking the async JDBC jira, The patch does not apply cleanly on trunk. [~prasadm] Can you please rebase ?
, I have also added a comment to https://reviews.apache.org/r/14486/, Rebased and addressed review feedback., +1, After seeing Thejas +1, I committed this...then realized tests has not run. I am going to kick off tests manually and verify., Tests passed so I won't revert this. Thank you for the contribution Prasad and review Thejas!,
