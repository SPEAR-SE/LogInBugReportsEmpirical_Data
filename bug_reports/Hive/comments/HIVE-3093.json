[You mean something like..

SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM src TABLESAMPLE (BUCKET 1 OUT OF 512 ON key) a LEFT OUTER JOIN src b ON (a.key = b.key) GROUP BY a.key, b.key) x;
, Thanks Navis.
Tried as your advice, but...
Error in QueryHive::query_via_thrift after 1 retries. error=Query returned non-zero code: 11, cause: FAILED: Parse Error: line 1:282 mismatched input 'tablesample' expecting Identifier near ')' in subquery source

Do you have another ideas?]
