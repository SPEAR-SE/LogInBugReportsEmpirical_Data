[Hi,
This seems also related to the work on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1095. 
I'll go through the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6382 to use the same process for also getting the Hive jars into maven.

From comment above it seems that ivy is looking for .tar.gz files? shouldn't these be .jar files?

As a general note the page http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing.html#asf-repo specifies how apache projects can use direct uploads to sync automatically with the central maven repositories.
, This is not actually a bug as far as I can tell. Resolving as "Not A Problem".]
