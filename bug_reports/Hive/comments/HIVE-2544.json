    Is it possible to write a test case, which spins 10s of threads doing operations. Thats not fool-proof but will result in some coverage. Unless you have a better idea for writing test case for this.

    Its LinkedHashMap right now, changing it to Concurrent will violate the contract of LinkedHashMap which you can iterate in same order as your inserts.  Not sure if violating that is alright here.

From my prospective if it passes existing UNIT test the order does not matter.

We could simply just do a concurrent map as well. I am +1 if tests pass. Any other comments?, Unlinking from 0.9, I think the only time the order would matter is in show_functions.q. Lets revisit this., I have included a patch to use Collections.synchronizedMap() this should deal with atomic issues without changing the order of things., @Edward, your patch solves the problem for registering UDFs.

But, it is still possible to get NPEs, if different threads are performing showfunctions and register functions concurrently.
Not sure, if you want to solve it in the same jira.
Otherwise, please file a follow-up jira for that, and I will accept this one., No code change.

Cancelling the patch - once you create a new jira, please resubmit the patch, I ran the tests - they ran fine.

+1, Committed. Thanks Edward, Thanks Bennie too who did the hard work finding the issue., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1548 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1548/])
