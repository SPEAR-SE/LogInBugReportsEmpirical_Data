[Simply, it's not supported., Hive 0.13 supports a few types of subqueries in the WHERE clause, but only for IN, NOT IN, EXISTS, & NOT EXISTS.

* [Subqueries in the WHERE Clause | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+SubQueries#LanguageManualSubQueries-SubqueriesintheWHEREClause], I am trying following query, it is working in Impala but not in Hive. 

SELECT t1.col1 FROM table1 t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 t2 ON (t1.col2 = t2.col2 AND t1.col3 = t2.col3) 
WHERE t2.col4 = (SELECT MAX(t22.col4) FROM table2 t22 WHERE t22.col4 <= t1.col4);

Is there any alternative for this in Hive?, [~Vikash Pareek], perhaps you would get more replies if you posted this question on the user@hive.apache.org mailing list.
