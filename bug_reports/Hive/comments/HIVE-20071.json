[On top of HIVE-20065; because that already covers a the metastore classes - I've not merged these 2 because there might be some issues appearing in the other submodules..., I've attached a small patch which configures an import banner; to prevent future uses of jackson 1.x, We already have a enforcer plugin that can have banned dependencies (direct or transitive). You can refer .2 patch from HIVE-20019 which avoids direct dependency. .1 patch avoids transitive as well. Not sure what the new plugin provides in addition to the enforcer plugin. Maybe we should use enforce plugin for jackson usage as well?, [~prasanth_j] I think that plugin will only react to pom.xml deps...but right now the 1.x lib is accessible without even refering it as a dep...so that people are using it without knowing about it....I would recommend to also do this for the logging related packages....

yes; I think we should set both enforcers....to also prevent the addition of the dep, {quote}bq. but right now the 1.x lib is accessible without even refering it as a dep

searchTransitive in enforcer plugin to true should prevent this right? This is what we do for com.google.code.findbugs:annotations LGPL import. , I've not yet checked but here's what interesting:
{code}
mvn depencency:tree -pl ql |grep org.codehaus.jackson
#comes up empty; meanwhile:
git grep org.codehaus.jackson ql
# has a lot of hits..
{code}
I think someone might have shaded a jackson artifact into one of the deps..., nevermind...I've messed it up (my command have failed)...both avro and jersey pulls in a 1.9 implementation...]
