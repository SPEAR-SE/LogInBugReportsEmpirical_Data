[This might be a problem with the Parquet file format, not Hive., [~gopalv] But as I see, hive ParuqetHiveSerDe will convert empty list to null, I don't understand why hive not just keep consistent with official Parquet write.

Official Parquet read/write can always keep the result unchanged., You might be able to fix it in the top-level with HIVE-13632]
