[Hi [~Ferd], was wondering if you plan to work on this. It'll be good to put the fix in 1.2.1 - the absence of the 2 jars (DummyDriver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, postgresql-9.3.jdbc3.jar) raises a false alarm in TestBeelineArgParsing., Sure, I will work on this issue today., Hi [~hsubramaniyan], [~sushanth], [~vgumashta], do you have some time reviewing this patch? Thank you!,
