[The attached patch addresses the issue described in Description by failing fast in semantic analysis phase with proper error message. , Should partition columns be ignored, instead of throwing exception?, I think throwing exception is better in this case. If user has specified partition column in her query she is expecting that stats will be collected and stored for it in metastore, which is a wrong expectation. , There is already a JIRA for this issue - HIVE-4426. However, HIVE-4426 aims to allow stats collection on the partitioning key. I think this can be useful. I'll be able to start working on HIVE-4426 next week. Let me know if there's interest. Thanks!, Thanks, [~shreepadma] for chiming in. There is definitely interest in that. I will be happy to help review that work., Thanks, [~ashutoshc]. , LGTM. Lastly, could you change the method name "validateColumnNames" to more specific one? , Thanks [~navis]. Renamed the method in the new patch. , +1, 
just noticed that the earlier version of the patch missed out two small issues.
issue 1: case insensitive comparison of specified column name with partition name
{code}hive> analyze table qlog_1m_part partition(year=5) compute statistics for columns YEAR,month,week,type;
FAILED: IndexOutOfBoundsException Index: 1, Size: 0{code}
issue 2: if partition name is not explicitly specified in the analyze query, then table level statistics will be computed. table level statistics on partition column is also not supported yet. Following query illustrates this case (it is same as the query in description except that partition is NOT explicitly specified)
{code}hive> analyze table qlog_1m_part compute statistics for columns year,month,week,type;
FAILED: IndexOutOfBoundsException Index: 1, Size: 0{code}

This new patch addresses these two issues., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Prasanth!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #423 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/423/])
