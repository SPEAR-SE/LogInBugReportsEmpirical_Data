ATTACHMENT ID: 12901206 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, I think the changes to the tests/plans look good.
+1, Thanks for the review [~jdere]. The test failures in the run are independent of changes in the patch., It looks like HIVE-13567 has updated a lot of the qfile outputs, can you rebase the patch again?, Rebased the patch., Committed to master, I've added an addendum commit to correct {{quotedid_smb.q.out}} which has a new explain; becase HIVE-13567 have changed the statistics ; the column stats flag should be complete - which is ok., I've bisected a few more test failures to this ticket (ex:{{-Dtest=TestSparkCliDriver#testCliDriver[bucketsortoptimize_insert_7]}}), and some other spark tests;
possibly they might have been missed in the rebase or had been added in the 5 day timeframe after the test execution., This jira is resolved and released with Hive 3.0 If you find an issue with it, please create a new jira.]
