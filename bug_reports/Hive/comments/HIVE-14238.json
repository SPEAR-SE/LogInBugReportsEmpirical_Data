[[~thejas], do you think this makes sense?, More generally I think we shouldn't do any recursive check on parent dir., Hi [~lirui] Checking the parent dir permissions should be enough as CREATE EXTERNAL will create the location directory if it does not exist, and that requires parent dir permissions. Not sure why recursively was added, but I don't think that is needed., This will be fixed by the changes in HIVE-10022 that [~sushanth] is looking into.
, [~lirui] Thanks for raising this issue.
It should be fixed soon.
, That's good to know. Thanks [~thejas].]
