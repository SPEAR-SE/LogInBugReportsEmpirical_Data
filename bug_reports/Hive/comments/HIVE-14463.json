[Tagging more people from the blame of the file: [~thejas] [~alangates] , Root cause of this problem is similar to HIVE-14424. The query is failing because of :
{code}
java.lang.RuntimeException: Error applying authorization policy on hive configuration: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.plugin.sqlstd.SQLStdHiveAuthorizerFactoryForTest
{code}
The reason the test used to hang was because consumer.receive() is a blocking call. Part of the issue, i.e. hang has been fixed by HIVE-14520 by converting the blocking calls to non-blocking calls. The other issue, i.e. the actual error is fixed by the patch attached., cc [~ashutoshc] for review., +1,
