[re-attaching same file to see if tests will run on it., LGTM - +1., The inner break confused me for a moment.

I like the use of labelled break statements for this, but I can't find that used anywhere other than the auto-generated code, so desisting from rewriting it to 

{code}
      Set<Set<Operator<?>>> components = getComponents(procCtx);
      INNERLOOP: for (Set<Operator<?>> component : components) {
...
          removeEventOperator(component);
          break INNERLOOP;
        }
{code},
