[There are 3 approaches to fix this:

1. Use fully-blown map/struct/array format everywhere. In this solution, users will see the types of complex columns fully-blown instead of a java class, which may not be wanted.
2. Use 2 type strings: internal type string, and display type string. This will make sure users will see types of complex columns as before, but it makes the code more convoluted.
3. Make our TypeInfoParser capable of parsing Java class names. If the TypeInfoParser encounters a Java class name, it will use the ReflectionObjectInspector to get the fully-blown TypeInfo structure.

I am going to take approach 3.
, More debugging shows that the main problem is that we were not allowing "_" in the names of the fields., This patch fixes the bugs., This is a binary file so I have to attach it separately., The patch looks good - but there were failures when I ran the test
input5, input17 and join_thrift, My bad: did not apply the patch correctly
Am merging right now, Committed. Thanks Zheng]
