[The default min/max for server threads in the metastore is 200/1000.  Given that we don't want compaction to eat too many metastore resources it would seem to make sense to set the limit as a percentage of the maximum (maybe 10%?)., Together with HIVE-11685 it probably better to simply rely on _hive.compactor.job.queue_ for resource management and have the Worker just submit jobs to it.
Then we can have 1 polling thread to scan COMPACTION_QUEUE  for running jobs and check with Yarn if they are done.
Number of Worker thread could default to 5 or something since generating a compaction job may take time if there are very many deltas, it should not be used to throttle number of jobs.
