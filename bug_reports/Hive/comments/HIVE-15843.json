[The patch. Need to test in the cluster. cc [~sseth], Hmm, I don't have access to a new enough version of Slider, but I do see the setting applied in the package; and it doesn't fail due to an unknown setting on Slider 0.91, which is something else I wanted to test., The patch looks good to me. Slider build is fairly straightforward from their "develop" branch.,
