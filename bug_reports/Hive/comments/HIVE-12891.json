[Patch Fix: Ensure that paths are expanded to absolute locations., Comments:
  - Do you want to expand all of these paths to absolute? Some of them are HDFS scratch dirs, not sure if we want to support relative paths for those or just java.io.tmpdir
  - Update the config documentation to mention that relative or absolute paths are allowed.
  - Is it easy to add a test for this?, I wonder if it would make sense to catch the exception and wrap in it something to tell the user that relative paths for {{java.io.tmpdir}} are not allowed (if that is indeed the case). Let me know, should be an easy change.

As for the config documentation? Do you mean in [HiveConf|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/b9d65f159d39614f510c64e58d7b09b4cf38f96f/common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/conf/HiveConf.java#L253] or somewhere else?

Thanks, Adding additional patch for validation. Will update with patch notes on successful test run.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12783919 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The problem that this patch addresses is that the value of 'java.io.tmpdir' can be set externally to be a relative path (we're seeing this problem occur in oozie). To adjust for this issue, the above patch uses 'Coercion' to validate/modify the value before passing it to the user. That is, rather than simply creating a one-off coercion, I thought it would be useful in general to have a way to hook into {{SystemVariables.substitute}} to validate or adjust the property before returning to the user.

The template is:

{code}
public abstract class VariableCoercion {
  private final String name;

  public VariableCoercion(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getName() { return this.name; }
  public abstract String getCoerced(Configuration configuration, String originalValue);
  public abstract String setCoerced(Configuration configuration, String originalValue);
}
{code}

where {{getCoerced}} is called on get and {{setCoerced}} is called on set (configuration is passed in if the coerced value is context sensitive). In addition, to add other coercions, simply subclass the above and add it here:

{code}
public class SystemVariables {
  ...
  // HERE: List of coercions:
  private static final VariableCoercionSet COERCIONS = new VariableCoercionSet()
    .add(new JavaIOTmpdirVariableCoercion());
{code}

If a coercion hook exists for a particular name (see {{VariableCoercion.getName()}}) then it is loaded and the raw value is passed through, then returned to the user:

{code}
  public String getCoerced(Configuration configuration, String variableName, String originalValue) {
    if (COERCIONS.contains(variableName)) {
      return COERCIONS.get(variableName).getCoerced(configuration, originalValue);
    } else {
      return originalValue;
    }
  }

ATTACHMENT ID: 12784190 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Hey Barna,

Yeah, feel free to modify the code as you feel necessary. Appreciate your work, thanks!, Uploading new patch.
I left most things unchanged, because I think the original patch was looking good.
I removed one API method that I think is never used (setCoerced on the variable)
and made one API method private (SystemVariables#getCoerced).
Other than that I mostly added unit tests.
I will create a new review request to discuss the comments on the current one.
Thanks to [~sircodesalot] for the work.,

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15170 - testTaskStatus, Committed to 2.2.0. Thanks [~zsombor.klara] for the patch. 
If you want to committed to 2.1.1, please a patch for that branch as well., Should this be documented in the Hive wiki?  It could go in the Configuration doc, although we might need a new subsection for it.

* [AdminManual -- Configuration -- Configuration Variables | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+Configuration#AdminManualConfiguration-ConfigurationVariables], I'm not sure there is a lot of value in documenting this. The java.io.tmpdir setting is not hive specific, it is the same for every java application. And with this change we are only converting a relative path into an absolute one, the actual location of the tmp directory will no change, so this should be completely transparent to the users., Okay, thanks.]
