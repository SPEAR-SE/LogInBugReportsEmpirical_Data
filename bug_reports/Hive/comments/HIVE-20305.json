[[~ekoifman] I see that canUseLlapIo in OrcSplit guards against this:
{code}
if (isOriginal) {
      if (!isAcidRead && !hasDelta) {
        // Original scan only
        return true;
{code}

I actually wonder if this needs to be fixed. This method should allow the scan and somehow propagate the original flag for the split (at least if there are no deltas).
cc [~teddy.choi], As [~sershe] wrote, OrcSplit would guard it by using non-LLAP IO. However, it would be better if we can make LLAP IO work on more cases.]
