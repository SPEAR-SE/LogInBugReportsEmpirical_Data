, getting tired of seeing the build errors because of this. Cant we just use DecimalFormat and print out 4 digits after the decimal (similar to mysql)? We can later add a DECIMAL type which supports user specified precision and scale. I have attached changes to LazySimpleSerDe. , this change might break existing code which may assume large precision. we should make it configurable until we have proper decimal type., Agree. We should not sacrifice the precision in default.

The MySQL function closest to sprintf is http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-functions.html#function_format

Let's add that format function instead, and use it in the test cases to make sure it does not fail again.
, Use round(xxx,12) to make sure there is no precision matching problem in testing.
, Committed revision 751398. Thanks Zheng!, Thanks for the quick commit Johan!
Can you close the issue and put the new line in CHANGES.txt in the "Release note" section?
, The release note is already there. So the Hive way is to close the issue rather then resolve it? Closing it now as requested., Hi Johan, "Resolved" is good enough. Somehow I didn't see the issue was resolved last time. The next time you just need to resolve the issue as usual.
