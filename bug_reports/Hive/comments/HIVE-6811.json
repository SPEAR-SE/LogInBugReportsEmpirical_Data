[Looks like LoadSemanticAnalyzer changes in HIVE-6048 may have caused this, when path string in windows is generated with Path.toUri(), "C:/path" becomes "/C:/path" which seems to have allowed things to work before.  Without the toUri() call, the path remains "C:/path" and the we see the error. , Patch to use toUri() again when generating the path string.  [~xuefuz] does this break any of the other changes in HIVE-6048, or will this work ok?, URIUtil.decode() is the evil that HIVE-6048 and others were trying to avoid. Thus, the patch is likely to break things. One way to try out is to have a file with '+' in its name., Thanks for the input Xuefu.  Actually it looks like the 2 test cases with space/+ in the name pass (load_file_with_space_in_the_name.q, load_hdfs_file_with_space_in_the_name.q), is it ok for this change to be done? Or would you prefer that we do something Windows-specific here and prepend a "/" to the path string if on Windows?, I think I'd be surprised, but I'm fine with the current patch if the tests do pass.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12638204, +1.
I guess URIUtil.decode() is okay to be used here because later the load work is constructed using Path instead of previous String as the source location., TestNegativeMinimrCliDriver.testNegativeCliDriver_minimr_broken_pipe passes for me locally on Linux VM. Will go ahead and commit this., Committed to trunk., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
