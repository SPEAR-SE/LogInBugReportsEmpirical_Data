[Does HIVE-15626 help?, Hi [~xuefuz], HIVE-15626 supports the smooth cancellation of running query when we hit Ctrl+C. But, this issue for the scenario, where no queries are running currently and if we hit either !quit or Ctrl+C, then the beeline client closes but the sessions remain open in the server side. Also, I noticed this issue occurs only with HTTP mode of transport., [~xuefuz] Please review the patch where I closed all open sessions through ShutdownHook., GitHub user sankarh opened a pull request:

    HIVE-15858: Beeline ^C doesn't close the session

    HIVE-15858: Beeline ^C doesn't close the session

----
, +1 for the change. However, I think a patch is expected here to trigger tests., Thanks [~sankarh] for the patch. It looks like we have two places in Beeline code to handles signals like Ctrl^C. 1. SunSignalHandler and the code section which is modified by the patch. Do you think it would be a good idea modify the code so that they are all handled at the same place?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12851831 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, bq.  It looks like we have two places in Beeline code to handles signals like Ctrl^C. 1. SunSignalHandler and the code section which is modified by the patch. Do you think it would be a good idea modify the code so that they are all handled at the same place?

While the description talks about ^C, I think this closing of session is something we should be doing on any reason for exit. So the shutdownhook is the better place for that in my opinion.
For the desired behavior described in HIVE-15626  for ^C, that would need to be dealt with in signalhandler.
So I think it makes sense to handle this two different requirements in two different places.
, Thanks [~vihangk1] for the comment! I do agree with [~thejas] point that these changes are meant for different reasons. , Thanks for the review [~xuefuz]! I shall see the test results right below your comment. Seems few failures not related to the patch. , bq. For the desired behavior described in HIVE-15626 for ^C, that would need to be dealt with in signalhandler.

Got it. In that case patch looks good to me too. Thanks [~thejas] and [~sankarh], [~sankarh]
Added a comment in github pull request. 
Can you also add a unit test case for this ? Doing it for shutdown hook might not be feasible, so maybe create a separate runnable object in Beeline which shutdownhook would invoke, and also that can be accessed from test case. Add a mocked connetion object to Beeline.connections and verify that when this runnable is invoked there are no more connections ? (or something else you can think of)

Added a unit test case and the new patch is attached for your review., Made ShutdownHook as a private Runnable object and also added an unit test case.,
