ATTACHMENT ID: 12846707 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, I'll re-run qtests in my local environment to double check these failures., I've determined that all qtest failures are irrelevant:

TestCliDriver:
  case_sensitivity, input_testxpath, and udf_coalesce all fail without my change
TestMiniLlapCliDriver:
  orc_ppd_schema_evol_3a fails without my change
  orc_ppd_basic passes both with and without my change in my environment
TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver:
  schema_evol_text_vec_part fails without my change
  columnstats_part_coltype passes both with and without my change in my environment

Can I get someone to look at this?, Ping, help? [~sershe] I see you watched this issue, do you mind taking a look at the patch?, +1 will commit later today if noone objects, Committed to master. Thanks for the patch!]
