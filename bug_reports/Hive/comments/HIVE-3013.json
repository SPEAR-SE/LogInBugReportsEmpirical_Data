[@Namit,
Since setting up debugging from eclipse requires few steps. It will also be good to have them documented at wiki for reference at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveDeveloperFAQ With those steps documented we possibly have fewer breakages like this in future. , @Namit: I get a bunch of "missing required library" errors after importing the project into Eclipse. Looks like eclipse-files/.classpath needs to be updated., @Namit: I verified that all of the launch configurations pass with the updated patch. Please +1 and I will commit. Thanks., Review request: https://reviews.facebook.net/D3537
, Attaching an updated version of that patch that allows you to set JVM arguments for Eclipse launch configurations., https://reviews.facebook.net/D3555
, +1 Few comments (posting here, since phabricator has lost ability to post back on jira):

* TestCliDriver.launch seems to work now. I didn't run the full suite of 887 tests, but first few (~20) ran without any failures.
* TestHBaseCliDriver and TestTruncate doesnt launch correctly. 
* Others launch successfully, but only few have all tests passing.
* HiveCLI.launch launches successfully, but doesnt work because of incorrect config.

None of these are related to this jira, so can be handled in follow-ups. Just noting these here for others about what I found out., FWIW, I ran all 887 ql tests from  TestCliDriver. 36 of them failed. Investigating those will require separate kind of work so could be taken up in followup issue., Committed to trunk., @Ashutosh:

bq. HiveCLI.launch launches successfully, but doesnt work because of incorrect config.

It seems to work for me, but maybe I'm just not trying the right commands. When you run it how does it fail?

I don't suppose you still have the list of failures available?, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1480 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1480/])
