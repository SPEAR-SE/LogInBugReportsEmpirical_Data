[It's due to incompatible version of JLine between Hadoop and Hive.
Use this quick workaround :
{{noformat}}
export HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST=true
{{noformat}}
, I think we should close this one as a workaround already exists and it will be fixed by YARN-2815.
Also HIVE-9405 will fix this issue., Thanks [~damien.carol].]
