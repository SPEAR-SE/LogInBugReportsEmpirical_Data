ATTACHMENT ID: 12745809 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~gphillips] Could you take a look at the failed test org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.avro.TestInstanceCache.instanceCachesOnlyCreateOneInstance? is it related to patch?, The test is wrong.  It is relying on the java Object.equals() which requires the exact same object to return true.
This is similar to the original problem with the InstanceCache.  It is relying on the hashCode to determine equality which breaks the hashCode contract.  I will provide the patch for the unit test shortly., Implemented hashCode and equals methods for test class 'Foo' to allow it to work properly within a HashMap.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12745875 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The failure may not be related. It failed on build 4640 too. Build 4640 does not have this patch. , [~xuefuz], could you review the code? Thanks, Patch looks good. One minor comment: Can we use map instead HashMap when declaring the member variable "cache"? I know it's not introduced here, but since you are here, could you fix that?
{code}
HashMap<SeedObject, Instance> cache = ...
{code}, Changed HashMap declaration to Map, [~gphillips] I might be overlooking something but shouldn't the equals method be on the InstanceCache instead of TestInstanceCache? Technically would be awesome to have both hashcode and equals on that class if we are using it directly for doing the comparison in containsKey.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12747430 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~swarnim] The equals method in the TestInstanceCache exists within an inner class 'Foo' which serves to test that the instanceCache returns the correct object.  The instanceCache could probably be a singleton, and shouldn't really require an equals method (unless I am mistaken).

As for the failed test, I'm not clear why it is failing.  Is the format of the patch incorrect?, I think your patch doesn't seem right. For instance, I see changes for the same file in two different places. In the patch, we just need a single diff for each file., Combined diffs from two patches for the same file into a single diff,

{quote}

If I am not missing something, I think that is a dangerous assumption to make. Mostly because currently there is nothing on the InstanceCache that states that it should be used as a singleton[1]. So I would vote that we either specifically mark that by making the constructor on the class private or implement hashcode and equals on the class. Also could be nice to mark those final so that we do not have bad overrides of those?

[1] https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/avro/InstanceCache.java#L38, [~swarnim] I think you are spot on.  I can create an additional ticket to investigate how we can modify the InstanceCache contract to ensure it is not misused.  
I would like to limit the scope of this ticket to address the instance cache returning the incorrect schema if possible.    
Concerning the recent Hive QA failure, the test that failed has no relation to the patch that I am able to discern.  The changes in the provided patch are limited to the avro serde, which is not referenced in the TestStreaming class or any referenced classes. , Committed to branch-1 and master. Thanks, Greg.]
