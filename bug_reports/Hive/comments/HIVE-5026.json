, My bad. I thought I took the latest patch from jira. , [~appodictic] Can you take a look and get this in asap? Trunk is not compiling at the moment, leaving other devs stranded., I do not have time to review this now. If no one else wants to +1 and commit this patch, I suggest rolling back and re-opening HIVE-3926 . I will not be able to get to this until about 7:00 PM eastern tonight., I am reviewing this right now., Patch looks good. Running a few local tests. If they pass I will commit right away since the build is broken already. If anyone disagrees with this, let me know and I will roll back instead., hagleitn has accepted the revision "HIVE-5026 [jira] HIVE-3926 is committed in the state of not rebased to trunk".

  LGTM +1
