This message is automatically generated., Looks like we can change "<exec executable="${harness.dir}/test_harness.pl"" also to "<exec executable="./test_harness.pl"", to be consistent with other targets.

btw, you can add "NO PRECOMMIT TESTS" to the description for patches such as these, as they change only the hcat system tests. That way, the precommit junit tests will not get kicked off for those.
, Thanks Thejas for the quick review. I have attached an updated patch with the minor change., Patch committed to trunk. Thanks for the contribution Deepesh!
