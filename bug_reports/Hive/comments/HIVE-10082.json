[To trigger race condition consistently, make the system faster by inlining deeper into the stack

{code}
./dist/hive/bin/hive --service llap --instances 1 --args "  -XX:MaxInlineSize=600 -XX:FreqInlineSize=128"
{code}, I think patch .1 will fix the issue - although there might be more. Turns out gWorkMap is still a global map albeit restricted by thread now. That means different threads especially if they are quick to execute could step on each other., .2 is a temporary patch. [~sershe] will fix properly w/o the need for synchronization in another patch.]
