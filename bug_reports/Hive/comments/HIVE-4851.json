[TestMinimrCliDriver.testCliDriver_bucketizedhiveinputformat, TestHCatLoader.testReadPartitionedBasic, Hi Brock, have you seen TestMinimrCliDriver.testCliDriver_bucketmapjoin6 failed randomly? The precommit test of my 4827 patch (https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/123/) failed because of this case. But I cannot reproduce it in my laptop. I will also keep an eye on it., Yes I have, it's in the list in the jira description :) After the stack_trace one I feel that bucketmapjoin6 is the most flaky., I have a theory that most of these are only problems with the CPU is busy. I cannot get them to reproduce on my workstation., oops, I somehow missed it...

In bucketmapjoin6, there are 10 buckets for every input table. So, we will have 10 mappers to do SMB join. Will the number of buckets be the problem?, TestNotificationListener.testAMQListener seemed checking arrived messages too fast (on busy, fast machine). Just pre-pending Thread.sleep(100) in tearDown() might fix that., It seems these days most of the flaky tests have been taking care of?, bucket_num_reducers still fails sometimes. I don't know why.]
