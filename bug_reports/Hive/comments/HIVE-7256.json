[This patch creates a new transaction manager and associated lock for HCatalog that extend DbTxnManager and DbLockManager.  This patch depends on HIVE-7249., HIVE-7256.addendum.patch is in addition to HIVE-7256.patch.  Contains fix to TxnManagerFactory so that both types of managers can coexist.  
Contains a fix to HcatDbTxnManager.reconstructTxnInfo() to make it work for read-only transactions (as designed in HIVE-7256.patch).  Adds some more detailed logging.]
