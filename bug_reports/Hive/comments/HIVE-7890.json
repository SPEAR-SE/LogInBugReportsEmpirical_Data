ATTACHMENT ID: 12664580, The patch looks good! Thanks. It ensure MSC is created as an impersonated user., Thank you [~dongc]!!, Looks fine to me. 
HS2 handles the thrift connection to HMS by recreating a new connection for new session in case of impersonation. The HiveDB object was not handled in the same way. This patch is handling that more efficiently.
