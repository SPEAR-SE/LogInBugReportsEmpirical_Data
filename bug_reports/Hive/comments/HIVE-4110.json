[this is going to get fixed with 4081. 
We don't need to set the alias based on the AST tree. 
Just using the internalNames _wcol1, _wcol2,... 
The internal names are used as fields in OI, so this is the safest way to set the aliases. 
Will post a patch tonight or latest by tomorrow.
Let me post the patch also, and then let's discuss. Sorry if this is duplicate effort., Ok sounds good! Don't worry about duplicating work. Finding this one was a great learning experience!, Marking as dup of HIVE-4081 since this will be fixed in that issue.]
