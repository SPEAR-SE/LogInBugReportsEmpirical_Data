[I got the repro (at least for the cast), will look tomorrow, This is by design (sortof). Cache size needs to be increased, it's almost full and too fragmented to accommodate larger-than-usual uncompressed stream that is cached in max-alloc-sized parts. Max alloc in this case is 16Mb, stream is 4-something Mb, but maximum chunk present in buddy allocator is 4Mb. 
Alternatively we could try to break stream into smaller parts for this case, [~sershe]: should this be causing query failures? Right now the query fails., Are you sure? I could see the query fail due to the other bug (cast failure), I filed another JIRA in your name and have a fix for that.
After that fix, the query doesn't fail, only some tasks. If you are unlucky it could cause query to fail., Apparently it happens even in unreasonable cases, Ok, this is the approach we are not going to use for now., The patch., [~prasanth_j] can you review? [~gopalv] you can also review :), [~sershe]: I'll test it & make sure it works., I can test it actually. I think it should also resolve task failures on small repro case (the initial one), this patch is broken, will fix after lunch (or whatever that is now) and reupload., I was not feeling well and didn't have mental capacity to figure out the exact issue on Friday, but the issue is in the old code that breaks stream into parts, making parts smaller just makes it apparent..., Patch that works,
