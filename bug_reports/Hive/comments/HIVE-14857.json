[Hi , this is seems a exception on hive , Hi, Can I modify the jira in order to change it to the hive project or should I create another ticket ?, [~carlo_4002] I just moved this to Hive. Can you please update the affects version field to indicate what versions of Hive you were running. For Tez, I believe you had mentioned 0.7.0?, that's correct, for tez the version is the 0.7.0 and for Hive it is the 1.2.1. ]
