  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/lib/Utils.java:54 More comments here?
  Find Node of specific target type in the stack
  Maybe a more meaningful name, findTargetTypeNode() ?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/MapJoinFactory.java:360 Maybe:
  boolean local = (pos != mapJoin.getConf().getPosBigTable());
  ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive/union_lateralview2.q:2 Is it possible to simplify the query?
  I mean, select less fields, less columns in group by, only keep the simplest query to reproduce the exception.

  Also, do an ORDER BY to preserve the result order, or select count(*) with limit to reduce the result size.

, Hi Navis,

I did an non-committer review. Mostly Good. Leave comments at:
https://reviews.facebook.net/D6051

Also, maybe we could CC Namit in the Revision?

Thanks,

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/lib/Utils.java:54 ok.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/MapJoinFactory.java:360 I think it's same meaning. I'll add clarifying round brackets.
  ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive/union_lateralview2.q:2 ok.

, Non-commiter +1., +1 Running tests., All the tests passed., Looks perfect.

I had a question: do you think it would be possible to remove currUnionOp from the context
completely ? That will simplify things a lot.

I am +1 on this patch as is, you can remove currUnionOp from the context in a follow-up if
it seems possible.

Ashutosh, I am assuming you are committing this patch, since you already ran the tests., njain has commented on the revision "HIVE-3582 [jira] NPE in union processing followed by lateral view followed by 2 group bys".

, currUnionOp might be removed and I've considered it. But I couldn't sure of that (Codes of genMR* are confusing for me). , Committed to trunk. Thanks, Navis. If you figure out a way to get rid of curUnionOp that will simplify the dependency of these function calls, feel free to open a jira and attach patch there.]
