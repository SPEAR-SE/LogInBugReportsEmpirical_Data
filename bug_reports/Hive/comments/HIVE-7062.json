[preliminary patch attached, Has Framework changes + Streaming for Sum and Avg functions + Streaming for Ranking functions.
Still need to do Streaming for Min, Max, Lead, Lag, FirstVal, LastVal, Mostly looks good. Some minor comments on RB, addressed [~ashutoshc] review comments, [~leftylev] documentation note:

{quote}
One of the factors checked for processing Analytic functions in Streaming mode is the 'Window size'
For Streaming mode to kick in window size must be less than the config parameter 'hive.join.cache.size'. Default value for this parameter is 25000.
{quote}, LGTM +1, add check to not allow streaming when there are Lead/Lag invocations in arguments.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12647746, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Harish!, [~rhbutani], will streaming have its own wikidoc for 0.14.0 or should this just be mentioned in a new section for Windowing & Analytics?

It could also be mentioned in Configuration Properties, but that buries the information.  It could go in hive-default.xml.template too.

By the way, Windowing & Analytics is a very skimpy doc.  It links to the spec but that information should be merged into the wiki and updated.

Quick ref:

* [Windowing and Analytics Functions | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+WindowingAndAnalytics]
* [Configuration Properties:  hive.join.cache.size | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.join.cache.size]
* [Windowing Specifications in HQL | https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12575830/WindowingSpecification.pdf], I don't see a need a separate page for Streaming. How about adding a note on the Windowing and Analytics page. 
This is an implementation improvement, not a functional change.

Yes agreed, windowing documentation can be expanded. The Oracle one is really nice: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14117_01/server.101/b10736/analysis.htm 
Don't know when I am going to get around to it though., Okay, thanks [~rhbutani].  I've put this with my doc-by-0.14 tasks., Doc note:  HIVE-7143 & HIVE-7344 also need documentation related to this issue -- min/max, lead/lag, fval/lval (HIVE-7143) & FirstVal, LastVal (HIVE-7344)., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
