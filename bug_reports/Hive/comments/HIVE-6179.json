[hi there,did you got any idea about this issue?, Not yet. Actually didn't get chance to work on this yet. If you like to give a shot, please let me know., I think this is actually about having an API so either (1) the client can get a remote iterator over the list of partitions (2) providing an API which gives only the information required by the client so as to remove bloat or (3) finding a more compact way to transfer this data.

The iterator idea is discussed here: HIVE-7195, Hi is there any update on this.]
