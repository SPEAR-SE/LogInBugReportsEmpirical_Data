ATTACHMENT ID: 12863175 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Test org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[columnstats_part_coltype] succeeded in my local build.
All these test failures are not related to my patch., Can you attach a stacktrace to show the NPE problem?, By the way, is the new method isTaskShutdown used any place?, Thanks for the review [~jxiang]! Currently I didn't have the stack trace, but it is a potential race condition since user can cancel the query at any time, ExecDriver.shutdown may be called at any time to set variable {{rj}} to null. Yes, I plan to use isTaskShutdown function from hook to find out whether ExecDriver is shutdown by user, so we can better monitor the query from outside., Ok, thanks for the explanation. +1, Thanks Zhihai for the patch. Pushed to the master branch., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
