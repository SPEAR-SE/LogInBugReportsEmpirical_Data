[Took care of mac line endings, [~wsxys08@gmail.com] I see the status got resolved to fix. Did this get committed?, I dont see this in svn commit log. Reopening for review., Review at https://reviews.apache.org/r/9129/, Doesn't java.io.File have constants to detect the line terminiator per OS. can we possibly use that?, Thanks, Edward for the review!
Your comment made me think about using {{System.getProperty("line.separator")}} instead. 

Let me post a new patch with that. I am not entirely sure how to test it (apart from running the unit tests). If you have any ideas, please let me know., My previous patch (#3) was accidently based off of patch 2 instead of being based off of trunk. Corrected that in patch 4., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Mark!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop1-ptest #47 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop1-ptest/47/])
