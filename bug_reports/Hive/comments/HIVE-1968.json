[@Joydeep, Yongqiang and I were trying to reproduce the bug but couldn't. We tried different query patterns (1 map-only job + 1 mapreduce job, and dynamic partition inserts) and on small & large data sets. All these worked as expected. So without a concrete example it's very hard to say it is a bug in multi-table inserts. Do you have any chance to dig into your query log and find out the specific query?]
