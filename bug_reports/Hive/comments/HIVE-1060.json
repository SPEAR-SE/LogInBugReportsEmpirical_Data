[Checks for join condition being just a single un-prefixed column of either primitive or complex type, One more question:

Can you find out why the follow-on semantic analysis didn't catch this problem?
The column reference should end up with "ambiguous column" since both tables have this column, but apparently it didn't.
, BTW, there is a standard SQL:200n construct SELECT * FROM a JOIN b USING(key), so we might want to file a followup JIRA for providing the original behavior using the standard (unambiguous) syntax.
, Can you add a test in negative tests ?

Also, do you think it would be simpler to check for "=" instead of the check you have added., Added a negative test. The conditional can also be a function, so a simple '=' test won't be sufficient.]
