[I've excluded the test for now. I will add back when this JIRA is fixed., Thanks for pointing it out, [~brocknoland]. I'll try to take a look., Btw, any idea when this test started timing out? That would be super helpful to bisect things (assuming it was at some point passing -- it was for me when I wrote it, anways)., At least "Started 3 days 7 hr ago", Found HIVE-8944 as well. Might be related., Nevermind, I don't think this is related. Comments over in HIVE-8931., HIVE-8829, update to Thrift 0.9.2, is what broke these tests. Accumulo expects to function with Thrift 0.9.1 and the tests just throws everything and their brother on the classpath.

I'll have to see if I can add some trickery to the test driver to keep the extra dependencies from being added.

, Getting back to this, I'm a little stuck here. Backing up, {{hive-metastore}} is bringing in libthrift-0.9.2 which is breaking things. The qtests ultimately pull from $CLASSPATH to star the Accumulo minicluster (which includes stuff from HIVE_HADOOP_TEST_CLASSPATH), that ultimately comes back to the maven test classpath. Without getting libthrift-0.9.1 somehow on the maven classpath, I don't know where the libthirft-0.9.1.jar even exists on the local m2 repository (and thus can't do any trickery to substitute it in place of the libthrift-0.9.2 dependency). My assumption is that excluding libthrift from the hive-metastore dependency will break the other qtests (but that is only a guess).

Assuming I can't exclude libthrift from hive-metastore, I'm not sure what I could even do at this point aside from introducing a new maven module specifically for the Accumulo qtests (and gives me carte blanche over the classpath). [~brocknoland], any ideas? , Yes the HMS has code which depends specifically on the 0.9.2 version of thrift..., bq. Yes the HMS has code which depends specifically on the 0.9.2 version of thrift...

I meant I'm assuming that the QTests themselves are exercising the metastore in such a way that the thrift dependency is directly needed (and not doing some mock thing)., They actually don't start the server so you might get away with 0.9.1., Finally circling back around on this.

Gave up trying to make the tests work in itests/qtests and moved them to itests/qtests-accumulo where I can properly rip out all of the thrift 0.9.2 dependencies that sneak in all over.

Gets the tests running, but, sadly, apparently something has broken since these stopped running as 3/7 are now failing. Will try to look into why those are busted now.,

bq. The downside is we are going to maintain qtest-accumulo/pom.xml going forward, but I cannot think of a better solution

Yeah, that was the conclusion that I came to. I'm all ears if someone has a suggestion for something better to do, but I couldn't come up with anything., Patch committed to both master and 1.2 branch.]
