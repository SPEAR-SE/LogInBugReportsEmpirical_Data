{code}, Ah, I see the NUL values are already addressed in [HIVE-16625].  Ignore my previous comments., [~aihuaxu] [~ashutoshc], [~belugabehr] Your change is much cleaner. I'm wondering if we have tests to cover SeparatedValuesOutputFormat since by reading the code I'm not sure if they behaves the same., [~aihuaxu] I certainly tried to keep it the same...

Thanks [~belugabehr], Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
