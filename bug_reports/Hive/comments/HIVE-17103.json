[[~jdere] we were trying to bring the behavior close to the SQL standard when we try to address the issue of HIVE-14251. Personally I prefer to bring correctness since we will benefit from it over the time.

Of course I still remember the conversion of int and timestamp and we had to add the configuration  hive.int.timestamp.conversion.in.seconds to address the backward compatibility. 

If we want address backward compatibility, maybe we can do the same?, I think decision of not doing implicit conversion across different type groups is sound.
I tried union for combination of varchar/date and varchar/int in oracle and pg and both failed. So, hive is consistent in its behavior with other systems. 

oracle [1] and postgres[2]  have it documented 
[1] https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/typeconv-union-case.html - Bullet point 4.
[2] https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/queries004.htm - just before examples section.

, w.r.t backward compatibility, users should update their queries since those queries are incorrect not only for hive, but on other systems also.]
