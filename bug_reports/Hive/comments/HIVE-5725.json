[I'd propose we do away with the exec uber jar and utilize the libjars functionality to push the dependencies into the class path., +1 - we are losing days of development work working around this packaging misfeature., +1 this is causing issue to use hive-exec jar, it always having conflicts with jackson jars

, I think the purpose originally for the fat jar was so that we only had to ship a single jar. With HIVE-860 shipping multiple jars will be quite easy., Another +1. We just hit this and it's causing us serious pain. I was surprised that the shaded classes weren't relocated. As it stands today, using the JDBC driver seems to suck in hive-exec at the end of the rainbow, meaning any application that uses Guava (or Jackson, or...) gets burned unless they happen to be using the same version as Hive., +1, Took us this week some time to debug and find out that there is another Guava version spooking around in the classpath of hive which breaks our own code, Is there any update on this jira? Any chance to get it fixed?, This has already been done.]
