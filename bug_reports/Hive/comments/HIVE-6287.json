[Uploading WIP patch. Q file tests are yet to be added., Added q file tests., Making it patch available for HIVE QA to pickup., Attaching RB link., I think that by PPD you mean predicate pushdown. This was not immediately obvious to me. I edited it into the description. It's a good idea to define acronyms on first use. Thanks!, Reuploading the same patch for HIVE QA to pick up.

Thanks [~ehans] for the update to description.,
