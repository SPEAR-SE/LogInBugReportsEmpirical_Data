[HIVE-5539.1.patch - the one line change to remove hcatalog wiki tab
HIVE-5539.generatedchanges.patch - includes changes to generated docs., +1, Wait a moment -- most of the old HCatalog wikidocs are different from those in the HCatalog doc set.  Do you want them to disappear, or will they be added to the Hive wiki?

If they're going into the Hive wiki, where do they belong?  I see two possibilities: 

* Separate the HCatalog overview page into sections like the Hive wiki Home page, such as "HCatalog Manual" for user & admin docs and "Resources for Contributors" for the old wikidocs.

* Add most of the old wikidocs to Hive's "Resources for Contributors" section on the Home page, putting some in Hive Design Docs and others wherever they seem to fit.  Remove "Developer Documentation" and "Storage Based Authorization" because they are redundant.  Put the HCatalog FAQ into the Hive FAQ.  Either update the HCatalog Journal or remove it.

Last May [~cwsteinbach] gave a link to instructions for moving the wikidocs from HCatalog to Hive:  [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF20/Moving+a+family+of+pages+from+one+space+to+another].
, For now, I have linked the old hcat docs from https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog . (See last line).

I have also added mention and link about hcatalog and webhcat in the introduction to hive section in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home

Yes, we should merge the docs into hive page. We will need to look at each doc and see if it makes sense to have them merged into a hive doc page or have it under a separate hcatalog section.
, patch committed to hive-site repo.
Thanks for the review Ashutosh, and thanks for the feedback Lefty!
