[This patch fixes the issue described.  After creating static partitions (insert into ... partition...), the partition directory and its intermediate-created directories now have the parent's permission.  See newly-added test case.

One note- the fix is in Hive.copyFile().  This JIRA also describes another problematic method (Warehouse.mkdirs()).  It is actually not invoked in this particular code path, and probably I can take a look in a follow-up JIRA about it to fix cases where it is invoked.,
