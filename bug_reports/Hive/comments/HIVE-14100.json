[The description states (current_user() - Returns current user nameâ€‚| SessionState *UserFromAuthenticator*), but when using HadoopDefaultAuthentication, it returns the unix username running the hiveserver2 process.

[~apivovarov] What was the original intention of the current_user()? Should it return the user used for the background process authentication (UserFromAuthenticator), or the user used to authenticate the connection (SessionState.get().getUserName())?

Thanks,
Peter, The jira for the original function, Since there was no answer from the original author, and we do not want to break the backward compatibility, a new function is provided to return the logged in user, The patch is ready,

Could you fix the description to say SessionStateUserAuthenticator instead of SessionStateAuthenticator ?

Also, I'm confused here,  isn't the SessionStateUserAuthenticator authenticator passed as the {{hive.security.authenticator.manager}} config when HS2 is started in hiveServer2.cmd ? HIVE-9143 is getting the user from SessionState.getUserFromAuthenticator, so isn't that udf already using SessionStateUserAuthenticator ?

, I restarted jenkins and this patch got kicked out. Reuploading it again for precommit test. , Restarted ptest. Reuploading the patch for precommit tests.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12830633 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Thanks [~mohitsabharwal]!

Description is fixed, thanks for pointing out!

The "select current_user()" command will return the user provided by the configured HiveAuthenticationProvider. For some cases it is the same as logged in user, but some cases it provides the user that runs the hiveserver2 process.

The proposed patch adds a new udf which uses the sessionstate to get the username. This way providing the identifier of the logged in user provided at connection time. I think this is more consistent with the expected behavior for relational databases, but do not want to change the original function, since its' description explicitly states, that it will use the AuthenticationProvider.

I hope I was better at describing the problem now :)

Thanks,
Peter, Thanks [~pvary]], sounds good!

Your patch is getting user name from {{SessionState.get().getUserName()}}

HIVE-9143 is getting user name from {{SessionState.getUserFromAuthenticator()}}
which calls {{SessionStateUserAuthenticator.getUserName()}} which calls the {{sessionState.getUserName()}} (same as your patch).

Just to confirm, you're saying that *if*  SessionStateUserAuthenticator is the not the default (which it is, in {{hiveServer2.cmd}} file ), then
other HiveAuthenticationProviders (like say HadoopDefaultAuthenticator), may return user that runs the hiveserver2 process ?, That is correct [~mohitsabharwal]!

I know some specific distribution, with some specific configuration use other Authenticator than SessionStateUserAuthenticator :), Thanks, [~pvary], LGTM, +1.

Could you fix the jira title to say you're adding a new UDF called logged_in_user() ?
Currently, it appears you are fixing current_user(), Thanks [~mohitsabharwal]!

Changed the title and the description to match the patch :), Pushed to master.

Thanks [~peter vary] for the contribution!, Doc note:  The new UDF logged_in_user() needs to be documented in the wiki for release 2.2.0.

Added a TODOC2.2 label., [~leftylev] Could you please check my English? Updated the documentation for current_user, and logged_in_user.

Thanks,
Peter, [~leftylev] Could you please check my English? Updated the documentation for current_user, and logged_in_user.

Thanks,
Peter, Thanks for asking, [~pvary].  Looks good, I just made a couple of minor edits.

I'll remove the TODOC2.2 label.]
