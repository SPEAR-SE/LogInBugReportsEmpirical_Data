ATTACHMENT ID: 12852234 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1. Ideally we should check for nulls during taskAttempt to containerId conversion. However, Tez does not fail queries if there is an exception while constructing the log URL, Added null check for containerId, Committed to master. Thanks for the review!, Does this need to be documented in the wiki?

* [LLAP | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LLAP], This is not a user facing change. These log URLs are currently only consumed by tez UI. I don't think we need to document this. , Okay, thanks Prasanth.]
