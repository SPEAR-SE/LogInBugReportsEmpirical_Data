[Perhaps HIVE-14014 is relevant.
I tried these examples on master and branch-2.2 and I don't see the error (count returns 25) nor do I see any empty (3-byte) files.  , Thanks Eugene for testing it. I could reproduce this with a 3 node 5.18.0 EMR cluster using the quick launch option. And I've tried a number of other EMR clusters of different sizes and versions and able to reproduce. This could be EMR specific then. I will find a different env to try this on to confirm., [~ekoifman] can you try this on Hive 2.3.4? Looks like this is broken on 2.3.x. I haven't been able to get Hive 3+ working yet, will update here once I am able to run Hive 3.Â  Hive Merge works well on Hive 2.2.1.]
