[[~leftylev] Hive-5775 has original pdf attached to it.
If you want i can get you original word doc., Thanks [~jpullokkaran], I can edit Word docs but lost my ability to edit PDFs when my old laptop died., [~leftylev] I have attached CBO word doc.
Thanks for updating design doc., Text edits are done and a first pass at the graphics, but new graphics are needed because the words aren't sharp.
