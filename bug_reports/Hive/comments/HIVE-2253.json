, changed to git patch, merged to 0.8.0-SNAPSHOT, @Navis, your code changes look good.
Thanks for catching this.

For testing, the convention we have adopted is to have a test file for such a case.
Look at the *.q files in ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive

Add a new .q file (say, mergejoins.q)
Add a explain plan in the .q file to check the number of map-reduce jobs etc.

You can run the test by executing:

ant test -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=mergejoins.q 

Verify that the output file mergejoins.q.out is correct, and check it in
ql/src/results/clientpositive
