, Refer to this method :
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.0.0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/BaseSemanticAnalyzer.java#L322
 tdb.t1 is treated as a table name.
--> 'tdb.tdb.t1' is putted in insertIntoTables of QBParseInfo 
--> QBParseInfo.isInsertIntoTable('tdb.t1') returns false
-->LoadTableDesc.setReplace(!qb.getParseInfo().isInsertIntoTable(dest_tab.getDbName(),
            dest_tab.getTableName()))  setting replace to true.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12876643 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, thanks [~nemon] for discovering this and thanks [~libing] for the patch. However, it seems to me that although hive parse "`tdb.t1`" as a whole table name in AST, when it really processes it, it treats it as tdb.t1. Can u check other db's behavior, e.g., oracle and postgres, mysql for this? I doubt that there is a bug for table name when it contains "dot" in current hive., I think we should firstly decide whether we allow "dot" in table names. I prefer disallowing it, because such names are confusing and seems we have already disallowed such column names via HIVE-10120. Then {{`tdb.t1`}} is considered as backtick quoted full qualified table name (useful when db/table name contains reserved keywords), and it should be treated as {{tdb.t1}} internally. Something like {{`tdb.t1.t2`}} should be disallowed., [~pxiong] and [~lirui], thank you for your comments.
I tried CREATE TABLE statement in MySQL, and found that it treats the `db.tbl` as the table name. And "dot" is allowed in the table name. 
e.g.

{code:java}
mysql> create table xxx (col int);
mysql> create table test.yyy (col int);
mysql> create table `test.zzz` (col int);
mysql> create table `test.test.tbl` (col int);
mysql> create table test.test.ooo (col int);
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‘.ooo (col int)’ at line 1

mysql> show tables;
+----------------+
| Tables_in_test |
+----------------+
| test.test.tbl  |
| test.zzz       |
| xxx            |
| yyy            |
+----------------+
{code}

Back to Hive, if we would like to make it having the same behavior as MySQL, we should change the logic of processing it.
My previous patch is NOT enough and can't handle `db.db.tbl` neither., That is exactly what I am worrying about : Hive may not well support table name with ".". Could u estimate the work that we need to do if we want to support this? Thanks., Sure, [~pxiong], I will work on it. Thank you., [~libing], the following jira may be helpful:

    HIVE-11699: Support special characters in quoted table names (Pengcheng Xiong, reviewed by John Pullokkaran)
{code}, I ran into this issue as well. Do we plan to fix it?, I think accepting {{.}} in the table names would require to get rid of the "split" tricks used at quite a lot of places (most of them will end up at [this method|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/Utilities.java#L2153])...
I think as long as those {{split}} calls are in service; this can't be fixed reliably...
[~ghajos]: this is kinda related to the tableref/handle thing we've talked about...]
