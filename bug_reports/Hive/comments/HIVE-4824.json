[HIVE-4820  eliminates the need to define HIVE_HOME, HCAT_PREFIX env vars explicitly.  
Once this is fixed the rest of the tests in TestWebHCatE2e can be enabled., Another possibility is to just call HCatCli directly from WebHCat - that would simplify the architecure and improve perf of DDL ops dramatically.
One possible issue here is concurrency - hive code is not completely thread safe.  We could use a new ClassLoader for each call to HCatCli - this would work around concurrency issues and will still be a good step forward., real unit tests for webhcat would take too much effort so will instead simplify running existing e2e tests in HIVE-6946]
