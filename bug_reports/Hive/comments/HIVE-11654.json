[After more searching around, it isn't the latest merge but HIVE-10289 that broke these tests.

The broken tests are: TestHBaseStore, TestHBaseAggregateStatsCache, TestHBaseAggrStatsCacheIntegration, TestHBaseMetastoreSql, and TestHBaseStoreIntegration, Some of the failures are fixed by HIVE-11621. I attached the patch for the remaining failures. Note this patch is on top of HIVE-11621., Patch committed.  Thanks Daniel.]
