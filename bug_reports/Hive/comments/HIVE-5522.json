[Changes to configure the DAG to generate splits in the AM.

There was a check on numTasks !=0 - as a result of split generation, which I've removed. Is that required to not generate vertices, if there's no data ?, Added changes needed to deserialize the plan in the AM, Updated patch to use a different encoder, and make use of some custom MRINput changes, which will go in soon.
Will likely upload another iteration to have an option to generate splits in the client., With respect to the numTasks != 0. I've reopened: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-248. I think this should be handled by Tez., Added flags for AM/client side split gen., Committed to branch. Thanks Sid!, This adds *hive.compute.splits.in.am* and *hive.rpc.query.plan* to HiveConf.java., The new configuration parameters *hive.compute.splits.in.am* and *hive.rpc.query.plan* are documented in the wiki:  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-Tez.]
