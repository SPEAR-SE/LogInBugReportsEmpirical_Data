[Maybe Cloudera set it false;
Having checked the code on version 1.1, default it's true
METASTORE_TRY_DIRECT_SQL("hive.metastore.try.direct.sql", true..., Yes, Cloudera set it false, But cli or beeline is still true. We should be consistent with Hive Metastore Server. , Different sessions can see different value;
If you create two cli sessions. you can set it true in one, and set it false in another., i.e.

I mean that metastore can startup with --hiveconf hive.metastore.try.direct.sql=false ,then hive.metastore.try.direct.sql is false.
Cli startup with no args, it will set hive.metastore.try.direct.sql default value , This looks like a setup-specific issue. Cloudera Manager is not part of Hive ;), hi [~sershe]
If this is not hive problem, could you please close this issue?
Thanks, Resolving. Please reopen if you think this is an issue with Hive itself.]
