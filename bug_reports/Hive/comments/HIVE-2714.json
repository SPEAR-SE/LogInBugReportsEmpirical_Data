[jonchang requested code review of "HIVE-2714 [jira] Lots of special characters are not handled in LIKE".
Reviewers: JIRA

  HIVE-2714

  Currently LIKE converts the string to a regular expression.  It tries to handle special characters but many are not correctly handled, e.g. +, ?, |, etc.  That code should just use Pattern.quote.
