ATTACHMENT ID: 12752113 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, patch#1 had correctness issues. Will add more test cases (positive and negative ones) soon. [~jcamachorodriguez] can you please take a look at the current implementation in patch#2 and see if it makes sense.

Thanks
Hari,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12752349 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Added test case. Improved patch#2 to  support optimization where expression contain only constants or virtual or partition columns.

Thanks
Hari, As part of this change we should be able to get rid of {{origPredicate}} in {{FilterDesc}}, no ?, [~ashutoshc] Yes, I believe so. I just left it to be on the safer side until [~jcamachorodriguez] can confirm it.

Thanks
Hari, We need to remove that, otherwise it cant be guaranteed that this patch *really* works., [~ashutoshc] If you see the change in ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/ppr/OpProcFactory.java, you can see that I use fop.getConf().getPartitionpruningPredicate() as the predicate used by the partition pruner.
The test cases added in pcs.q will guarantee that this patch will work. i.e. If you run the 'EXPLAIN PLAN EXTENDED ... IN(STRUCT(..) 'queries in pcs.q without the patch, the plan will be different. 

However, as you mentioned we should combine OrigPredicate and partitionPruningPredicate to one field before this patch can be finally merged. I will do that soon in the next upload.

Thanks
Hari,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12752555 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~hsubramaniyan], I'm still reviewing your patch.

However, I have a couple of remarks.
- Concerning HIVE-11573. With your patch going in, some code that was added there seems unnecessary (e.g. look at the {{extract}} property/flag, which we could actually remove). Further, test properties in pcs.q need to be adapted (min number of OR ops in order to apply PointLookUpOptimizer).
- I agree with [~ashutoshc], we should be able to get rid of {{origPredicate}} now., Addressing [~jcamachorodriguez] and [~ashutoshc]'s comments in patch#4.

Thanks
Hari,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12762193 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~hsubramaniyan], I checked the last patch, I think there are some tests where you set hive.optimize.ppd and you meant to set hive.optimize.partition.columns.separate?, [~jcamachorodriguez] Can you please look at the latest patch, made the required changes.

Thanks
Hari, [~hsubramaniyan], the last version of the patch does not seem to be working properly in some cases.

Some remarks:
* Changes to groupby_cube1.q do not seem part of this patch?
* In pcs.q.out, query in line 666:
{noformat}
explain extended select a.ds, b.key from pcs_t1 a, pcs_t1 b where struct(a.ds, a.key, b.ds) in (struct('2000-04-08',1, '2000-04-09'), struct('2000-04-09',2, '2000-04-08'))
{noformat}
Additional predicate is not derived, and thus partition pruning is not happening: we read partitions '2000-04-08', '2000-04-09', and '2000-04-10'. Any idea why this is happening? Could you check that case?
* We still do not seem to be removing the predicates that are used for partition pruning properly from the Filter predicates e.g. pointlookup2.q.out or pointlookup3.q.out. I think this patch should take care of that too?

In addition, there is a case that was added to PointLookupOptimizer and this patch does not seem to cover. Observe the change in line 179 of pointlookup.q.out: we were prepending a new conjunction to the original predicate for non-partition columns if we were reducing the NDV in the IN clause. Do you think it would be easy to extend your patch to cover this case too?

Thanks,

2. In pcs.q.out, query in line 666:
explain extended select a.ds, b.key from pcs_t1 a, pcs_t1 b where struct(a.ds, a.key, b.ds) in (struct('2000-04-08',1, '2000-04-09'), struct('2000-04-09',2, '2000-04-08'))
Additional predicate is not derived, and thus partition pruning is not happening: we read partitions '2000-04-08', '2000-04-09', and '2000-04-10'. Any idea why this is happening? Could you check that case?
I checked this and this seems to happen in case of shuffle join, I am still investigating this. For map join, this works fine and I have modified the test case accordingly.

3. We still do not seem to be removing the predicates that are used for partition pruning properly from the Filter predicates e.g. pointlookup2.q.out or pointlookup3.q.out. I think this patch should take care of that too?

Thats true, I debugged this and it goes through the change in PcrExprProcFactory.java I had introduced which should have removed the extra filter predicates. I am surprised why this doesnt happen for this particular scenario. Would it be ok to cover this in a follow-up jira since this is not a regression from the baseline.

4.  we were prepending a new conjunction to the original predicate for non-partition columns if we were reducing the NDV in the IN clause. Do you think it would be easy to extend your patch to cover this case too? 

I think this might require some more changes than the initial work since 1. in this current patch I dont necessarily separate each and every column, I club the partition columns into the same struct when possible. 2. I need to let the PCR know that this additional predicate should not be removed if this is a partition column and contributed to reducing the NDV. 

Thanks
Hari, 1. That's what I thought, no problem.
2. OK, this case should be solved or studied as part of this JIRA.
3. That's fine; we can create a new JIRA case for that. But maybe I would remove then the changes in PcrExprProcFactory.java and I would follow-up in the new JIRA, as that code is not working as expected. What do you think?
4. Maybe I didn't explain it properly. The idea is that you would only prepend non-partition columns, and without clustering them, but iff the NDV in the IN clause is reduced. In any case, we can create a new JIRA for this too, and maybe assign it to me? As I see it, the modification to the original optimization that you have just created should not be too complicated.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12769833 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, None of the 16 errors look related to the patch. I tested them locally and they all pass in my machine. [~jpullokkaran] can you please review the latest patch.


Thanks
Hari, +1, Patch committed to master, thanks [~jpullokkaran] for the review., Doc notes and questions:

1)  I added a TODOC2.0 label even though this has Fix Version 1.3.0, because I don't see a commit to branch-1 in email.  (The commit to master is b7986a8fbb950e7f76d70d923cf0d9ebee5e8360.)  Perhaps a branch-1 commit will come later.

2)  What is HiveConf.java.orig and why does the commit to master add a new configuration parameter to it (*hive.vectorized.execution.reducesink.new.enabled*)?  Neither the file nor the parameter appears in HIVE-11634.patch or HIVE-11634.995.patch.  HIVE-12290 added HiveConf.java.orig to master seemingly by accident.

3)  This removes *hive.optimize.point.lookup.extract* from HiveConf.java and adds *hive.optimize.partition.columns.separate*, so the wiki needs to be updated for release 2.0.0 (or 1.3.0 if the patch is going to be committed to branch-1).
, [~leftylev] Thanks for the comments.
1. There are some merge conflicts with branch-1. I am working on it, will commit it soon.
2. HiveConf.java.orig  looks like it is unnecessary, I believe it got introduced by a merge after git commit. It looks like it is introduced by HIVE-12290. [~mmccline] can you please revert the file if this is not required .
3. Yes, we need to update these parameters.

Thanks
Hari, [~leftylev] thanks for spotting inadvertant addition of HiveConf.java.orig
I removed it., Thanks Hari and Matt.  I changed the label to TODOC1.3., [~hsubramaniyan]/[~jpullokkaran] this breaks dpp (see changed golden file in this patch or HIVE-12462). Not sure what the best way to fix this is., FYI it's these changes that mean dpp is no longer working:

{noformat}, [~hagleitn] created HIVE-12666 to track this error., [~hsubramaniyan], did this ever get committed to 1.3.0?  I don't see the commit and besides, the parameter deletion isn't applicable., Hi [~leftylev] My bad about the fix version as 1.3.0. You are right about 1.3.0, it should be marked as 2.0 since there were I believe some merge conflicts didnt allow me to commit this change to 1.3.0 at that time. i.e. the only place where this got committed is the master. In master, the paramater deletion/update is applicable., Doc note:  Adding TODOC2.0 because this adds *hive.optimize.partition.columns.separate* to HiveConf.java, so the wiki needs to be updated.

* [Configuration Properties -- Query and DDL Execution | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-QueryandDDLExecution]

This also removes *hive.optimize.point.lookup.extract*, which was added by HIVE-11573 in the same release.]
