[[~bslim], could you verify that the attached patch fixes the issue with the time column repetition? Thanks, i will verify that, was thinking maybe be we can add some unit test to catch this ?, I wanted to share the fix with you so you could validate it running against Druid, but I am modifying _TestDruidSerDe_ (all Select results in that test contained the same timestamp),to cover this case., Added testcase for this specific error., 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:

ATTACHMENT ID: 12840279 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~ashutoshc], fails are unrelated. Could you review it? I have confirmed with [~bslim] that this solves the issue with reusing timestamp across records returned by Druid select query. I will tackle issue with timezone is a follow-up., Is similar fix needed for other Druid record readers, like GByreader etc?, [~ashutoshc], it is not needed, because all query types have different results format, and _select_ is a bit special because it has the timestamp per result set and per result item (or event). You can see it here: http://druid.io/docs/latest/querying/select-query.html, I see. +1, Pushed to master, thanks [~ashutoshc] for reviewing and [~bslim] for reporting!]
