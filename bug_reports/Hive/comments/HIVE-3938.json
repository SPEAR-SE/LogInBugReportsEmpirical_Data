[This patch refactors add_partition_core_notxn() such that a single event is sent for an atomic partition-set., The review is here: https://reviews.apache.org/r/9105/, Corrected silly error. (Thanks [~sushanth].), Fixed error handling in add_partitions_core() and add_partition_core_notxn_no_events().

Now, failure of add_partition_core_notxn_no_events() is always reported via exception. (The confusion stemmed from MetaStore.addPartition()'s ambiguous failure semantics.), HIVE-4004 tries to fix the status associated with AddPartitionEvent.  The patch for HIVE-3938 does not include the correct status.  Since HIVE-3938 touches the same code as HIVE-4004, does it make sense to merge in the patch for HIVE-4004?, Can you refresh once HIVE-4004 is in ?, Rebased patch., Hey, Namit. Sorry for the delay. (I've been away on leave.)

I've rebased the atomic AddPartitionEvent patch for trunk. I've kept the spirit of HIVE-4004 in mind for the fix. Tests run.

I'd like for this to make it to branch-0.10/, as soon as HIVE-4004 is available on that branch.

Thanks., [~namitjain], [~cwsteinbach], [~dilipjoseph], could I bother one of you to review this fix?

We'd like to get this into branch-10 (apart from trunk). (That implies getting HIVE-4004 into branch-10 as well.) We'd appreciate the help.

Mithun, [~mithun] I can review it.  Could you please upload another review and send the URL.  Thanks., Thanks for stepping up, Dilip. Here's the review link: https://reviews.facebook.net/D9519, Looks good to me. +1 (non-binding)

One thing I will note, however, for the sake of completeness, in that this is a behaviour change, is that this implementation of taking the common table out of the partitions means that add_partitions will only work if all the partitions in parts are in the same table. The earlier implementation allowed a mixed group of partitions. I think this is better though, and atomically adding arbitrary groups of partitions atomically if they're not related is a recipe for other usage problems., Thanks for the review, Sush. :]

Dilip, Namit, et al, would you guys please comment? It'd be great if a committer could review, too., Yikes! I missed the notification from the review. Thanks for reviewing. Please ignore previous comment., Sorry for the delay. I've only just gotten back to fixing this. I've incorporated your suggestions. I'm trying to get the tests going. Will update shortly., Ok, Dilip's comment about support for multi-table inserts poses a dilemma. 

Thus far, HiveMetaStore::add_partitions_core() seems to have assumed (at least in part) that all the parts belong to the same table (evidenced by the logInfo() line). If one might call add_partitions() with parts in different tables, should they all be considered to be part of a single atomic set? Or ought I to categorize them (per table) and send separate Events out?

I'm inclined to do the former (because you retain the ability to break the partition-sets up downstream), but I'm open to suggestions. 

(+ [~ashutoshc], who wrote the initial version of this.), Modified AddPartitionEvent to support multi-table-insert. Partitions added to multiple-tables atomically are now specified in the same event.

I've also combined the changes to HCatalog-609 herewith (since we're in the same code-base). HCatalog's NotificationListener continues to notify only per-table events. So each AddPartitionEvent has potential to launch multiple JMS Notifications, with multi-table inserts., [~mithun] Would you like to rebase this patch on trunk and take care of remaining of [~sushanth] review comments on phabricator ?, Sorry for the delay on this, Ashutosh. I should be able to rebase this patch next week., I've rebased this patch for the latest trunk (0.13-ish).

I've had to remove the support for multi-table add-partitions, because the metastore now seems to check that all partitions in add_partitions_core() actually belong to the same table.

I've modified the TestNotificationListener accordingly., +1
 [~mithun] Can you re-upload the patch with name HIVE-3938.patch That way Hive QA will pick it up to run test suite.

One thing which is disturbing in current code base is (which existed even before this patch) is we are running these pre and post hooks within transaction. General wisdom is to never make calls to foreign system (like MsgBus in our case) from within database transaction. We should try to improve this, though thats probably a topic for another jira., Cancelling patch. Will rename and upload again., Renamed for running regressions.

[~ashutoshc], you're right, we should discuss moving this kind of thing out of the transaction, now that you mention it. A failure to notify doesn't imply that the partition couldn't be added. Client code needs to handle the case that notifications weren't delivered, anyway.,
