ATTACHMENT ID: 12675536, [~csun], it seems that your change will stop MR from generating statistics., [~xuefuz] I'm not sure why. If the execution engine is MR and if {{pctx.getContext().getExplain()}} returns true, then it will generates statistics, right?, Okay. I see your point. Then, for Spark, even it's not explain, it will still do statistic collection. I don't quite understand the change, and let's talk about it Monday., +1, Patch committed to Spark Branch. Thanks to Chao for the contribution.]
