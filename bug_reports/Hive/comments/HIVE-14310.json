[Some test cases for this issue are failing because of HIVE-14324, Patch generated on top of HIVE-14333. With that all the test cases work fine. , [~owen.omalley]/[~mmccline] Can someone plz review this patch? Can't upload patch to RB until HIVE-14333 gets committed. , [~prasanth_j] after creating RB, you can update patch and supply the "base patch" (or use the commandline tool to supply it immediately iirc), Attaching RB link, rbt post and updating patch with base diff worked. Thanks for the tip!, Comments:

* You should not throw if the file schema has more columns than the reader schema. We want to support schema evolution that includes deleting columns.
* You should comment that included, readerFileTypes, and ppdSafeConversion are all indexed by the reader column id.
* The comment about why float -> double isn't support is a little broken. How about:

{code}
// NOTE: Float to double evolution is not safe as floats are stored as doubles in ORC's
// internal index, but when doing predicate evaluation for queries like "select * from
// orc_float where f = 74.72" the constant on the filter is converted from string -> double
// so the precisions will be different and the comparison will fail.
// Soon, we should convert all sargs that compare equality between floats or
// doubles to range predicates.
{code}

Other than that, it looks good., Addressed [~owen.omalley]'s review comments. , +1,
