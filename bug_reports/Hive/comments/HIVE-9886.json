[There's a lot of ws changes in the patch that make it hard to review. I'm usually not against fixing identation etc, but in this case it seems to make the indentation worse in a lot of places., For patch 2: joinOp.getOpTraits().getNumReduceSinks() - 1) -> the traits have to be propagated to all downstream operators after a change like this, no?, I think we should have some follow up jiras:

- Trait set propagation for map join (one side sort column propagation)
- ReduceRecordProc should be able to handle smb
- Think through the assumption that multiple smbs in the same vertex are always merged (smb-mj-smb-mj)

For now the safest might be to set the reducesink count once and not update while transforming the plan. That will allow smb followed by any number of mj in the first (map) vertex, but much nothing else (as far as smb is concerned)., Same patch but with prefix for RB to work., +1, Looks like test results are not getting posted:

http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/2973/testReport/, [~vikram.dixit] can you reupload? to see if we can get a clean run., As mentioned in the comments below, HiveQA ran the tests and the tests had passed but hadn't been posted to the jira. I have committed the patch to 1.0.0 and 1.2.0 as well., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
