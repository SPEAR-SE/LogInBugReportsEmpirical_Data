[Hmm, it works fine for me - both spark branch and trunk.
Which branch are you using? spark or trunk? Is you repo update to date?, you mean the branch? I use the apache original hive.
I don't confirm what you said the repo,I think you mean the maven repository,I use following:

<mirror>  
  <id>nexus-osc</id>  
    <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>  
      <name>Nexusosc</name>  
    <url>http://maven.oschina.net/content/groups/public/</url>  
</mirror> 

I suspect the mirror misses some jar files.]
