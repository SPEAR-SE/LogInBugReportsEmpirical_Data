This is wrong as well ^ remember Hiveworks with hadoop 0.20.0. So post 0.20.0 hacks need a shim., First part of fix.

{quote}, [~appodictic] Thanks, seems you already fixed the issue from HIVE-4343 as well. Is there anything else left I should take a look at?

+1, No. I was a little unsure why only hadoop-0.20 needed the commons-io lib, but I guess it is because things in other versions of hadoop include this. Not sure exactly when it broke but it must have been that way for a while ?,

This message is automatically generated., I see. Looked through the dependencies. You're right both hadoop 1 & 2 line pull in commons-io 2.1 which we use transitively. I think this was broken in: HIVE-4505
, Sorry about introducing another 0.20 build problem with HIVE-4343. I should have verified the 0.20 build.

Regarding the patch -
commons-io version is already defined in ivy/libraries.properties, I think we should re-use that ie in shims/ivy.xml - 
{code}
<dependency org="commons-io" name="commons-io" rev="${commons-io.version}">
{code}
, I see the following error complaining about an import in HiveSessionImpl.java I see that HiveSessionImpl doesn't use the import. Removing the import fixed the problem for me.

{code}, HIVE-4991.3.patch.txt - change to use version number from ivy/libraries.properties , [~appodictic] If you're fine with patch .3 (only difference is to reuse existing property) I'll commit that., [~amalakar] I cannot reproduce your findings. With Ed's patch in place everything compiles for me for 20, 20S and 23. All of them have commons-io on the classpath now., Yes .3 is fine.,
