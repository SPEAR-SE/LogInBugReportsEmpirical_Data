ATTACHMENT ID: 12685956 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I'm pretty sure fails are not related to this. Will be committed shortly after., Committed to trunk. Thanks Ashutosh, for the review., [~navis] I could not find the commit entry in git log and also did not see this change in trunk. Have you committed this patch? I am see this error msg "ERROR metadata.Hive: Table noexisting not found: default.noexisting table not found" spit out from DDLTask for a command like "drop table if exists nonexistingtable". The "ERROR" might look a little confusing here to user. This ERROR msg was introduced by HIVE-7737 to replace the long and annoying exception msg. Would you still plan to commit your patch? Thanks]
