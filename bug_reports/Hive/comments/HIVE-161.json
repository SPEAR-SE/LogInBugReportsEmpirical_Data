[The problem seems to be in

ExprNodeFieldEvaluator.java

at line 96

where we are doing list.size() and not checking if list is null before getting the size.

, I've got the code fixed but it's hard to generate a testcase since only thrift serde will generate NULL list for now.
I am thinking about implementing the CASE statement first.
, Adding to "Query Processor" component., Modified complex.seq to include the case that the list is null., looks ok to me. +1, Committed revision 732571.]
