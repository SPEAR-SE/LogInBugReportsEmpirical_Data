[Looks like the issue was happening because the parameter value is case sensitive. So if I try using {{'EXTERNAL'='TRUE'}} then it works as expected but doesn't work with the parameter value set to "true". Looks like it is by design. [~ashutoshc] Do you think its a good idea to make it case insensitive? If not, I can close this JIRA., Sql is suppose to be case insensitive, so current behavior I think is buggy and should be correct. [~thejas] Any comments?, I agree case insensitive comparison for "true" makes sense.
I assume that is what we do for string to boolean conversion as well. Is that right [~ashutoshc] ?

, This is what I see in {{Objectstore.java}}. It uses case sensitive String comparison instead of Boolean comparison.

{code:java}
if (tableType == null) {
      // for backwards compatibility with old metastore persistence
      if (mtbl.getViewOriginalText() != null) {
        tableType = TableType.VIRTUAL_VIEW.toString();
      } else if ("TRUE".equals(mtbl.getParameters().get("EXTERNAL"))) {
        tableType = TableType.EXTERNAL_TABLE.toString();
      } else {
        tableType = TableType.MANAGED_TABLE.toString();
      }
    }
{code}, Yes, looks like using Boolean.valueOf(mtbl.getParameters().get("EXTERNAL")) would be more appropriate.
, Thanks for the confirmation. Let me provide a patch for this issue then.,
