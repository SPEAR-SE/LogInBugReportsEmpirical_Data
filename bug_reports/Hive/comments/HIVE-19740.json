[This is not a bug but after 2.x {{hive.metastore.event.db.notification.api.auth}} is {{true}} by default so if you just upgrade the version in a kerberized cluster, hiverserver2 will probably not be able to connect to the metastore. As specified [here|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveReplicationv2Development] this can solved by setting {{hive.metastore.event.db.notification.api.auth}} to {{false}} or adding something like this to your core.xml or hive-site.xml:
{code}
<property>
     <name>hadoop.proxyuser.hive.hosts</name>
     <value>HS2_HOST</value>
</property>
<property>
    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.hive.groups</name>
    <value>*</value>
</property>
{code}, [~jmarhuen]

Thanks for the clarification.

I wasn't using kerberized cluster.

Another question I have is that the new auth rule introduced is for hive replication system as mentioned in the wiki page you gave but does start up hiveserver 2 have anything to do with replication?, [~why] that's a good question for which I don't know the answer. The wiki seems to imply those operations wouldn't be needed in simple setups however they seem to be used at startup when hiveserver2 connects to the metastore., it seem proxy user auth check is applicable for both the case 
{code}
HiveMetaStore.java
private void authorizeProxyPrivilege() throws Exception {
      // Skip the auth in embedded mode or if the auth is disabled
      if (!isMetaStoreRemote() ||
          !MetastoreConf.getBoolVar(conf, ConfVars.EVENT_DB_NOTIFICATION_API_AUTH)) {
        return;
      }
      String user = null;
      try {
        user = SecurityUtils.getUGI().getShortUserName();
      } catch (Exception ex) {
        LOG.error("Cannot obtain username", ex);
        throw ex;
      }
      if (!MetaStoreUtils.checkUserHasHostProxyPrivileges(user, conf, getIPAddress())) {
        throw new MetaException("User " + user + " is not allowed to perform this API call");
      }
    }
{code}
as suggested by [~jmarhuen] you eighter  need to add hadoop.proxyuser.hive.hosts/group in core-site or  disable the hive.metastore.event.db.notification.api.auth. otherwise you will see "User hive is not allowed to perform this API call", [~Rajkumar Singh]

Thanks for your explanation. I raised this question because I am not sure what I encountered was a feature or a bug. Now I see this seems to be actually a new feature.

Then the only thing left may be modify the confusing wiki [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveReplicationv2Development] .  As wiki said the new auth rule is mainly for replication operations. ]
