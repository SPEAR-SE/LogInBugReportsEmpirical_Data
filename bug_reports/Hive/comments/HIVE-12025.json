[[~sershe] or [~prasanth_j] could you review?, Can you post RB? it appears that the logic has changed for computeBucketNumber first branch, https://reviews.apache.org/r/39065/
there is no logic changes - this purely refactoring, [~teabot], could you look at BucketIdResolverImpl changes?  I assume that making it consistent with the rest of Hive is the right thing to do., The changes introduced in this patch in BucketIdResolverImpl is the correct way to compute bucket number. ReduceSinkOperator had a bug in bucket number computation regarding negative hashcodes (multiplying by -1 vs mast with Int.MAX). There might be some test failures related to this change but that is the expected change. Since these are util methods, it will be good to have unit tests for these (if one doesnot exist).

Other than that, lgtm +1. Pending tests.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12765297 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, This is definitely an improvement. It has broken a test but I suspect this is because the {{bucket_id}} calculation in {{BucketIdResolverImpl}} is currently incorrect and thus the expectations are also incorrect. This in itself underlines why this refactoring is desirable.

May I suggest the following patch to fix the failing test:
