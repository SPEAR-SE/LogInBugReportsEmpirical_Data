[I get the same error, no matter what file format I use for the source table. I've tried Textfile, Sequencefile, RCFile, and ORC., Could it be that [HIVE-7073] is the origin for this bug?, [~langea], no the culprit is inside the method writeArray.
The wrong data was written.

Patch in progress, Patch to allow parquet-hive to write complex nested type as array of map, map of array as value, array of struct, ..., [HIVE-6914] parquet-hive cannot write nested map (map value is map)

     * Change the way ArrayWritable was filled
     * Now parquet-hive can write complex nested type (array of map, map of array, struct ...)
     * Adding some qtests,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12681303 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~spena], [~brocknoland], [~rdblue]

I will redo this patch using the path available for HIVE-8359. I think there is a link with this one too HIVE-8909. With the previous patch I can read and write parquet complex nested types.
So maybe it will be better to add my qtests to HIVE-8909 and fix the writing bug ?

What do you think ?
, Hi [~mickaellcr],

It sounds good if you use the patch from HIVE-8359 for this bug. Regarding adding the qtests to HIVE-8909, I think that ticket is meant to fix the reading part of different nested types formats generated by Thrift and Avro tools (it does not touch the writing part); so I think it should be good to have these writing tests separated from the reading tests.

, HIVE-8909 tests that parquet-hive can now read this case in its map tests, but it doesn't test the write side., Attaching a qtest and data file that verifies [~spena]'s fix for HIVE-8359 fixes this bug. The qtest relies on HIVE-8909 to read the data., Updating qtest patch to drop all created tables., +1 pending tests,
