[[~jdere] Can you please review the change. 
Now that we support move files from one file system to another, we can remove the following code in LoadSemanticAnalyzer.java

{code}
    // only in 'local' mode do we copy stuff from one place to another.
    // reject different scheme/authority in other cases.
    if (!isLocal
        && (!StringUtils.equals(fromURI.getScheme(), toURI.getScheme()) || !StringUtils
        .equals(fromURI.getAuthority(), toURI.getAuthority()))) {
      String reason = "Move from: " + fromURI.toString() + " to: "
          + toURI.toString() + " is not valid. "
          + "Please check that values for params \"default.fs.name\" and "
          + "\"hive.metastore.warehouse.dir\" do not conflict.";
      throw new SemanticException(ErrorMsg.ILLEGAL_PATH.getMsg(ast, reason));
    }

{code}

Thanks
Hari, I think this looks fine. Can you add a test - you might be able to add a qfile test using a path with pfile:/ as the load file., [~jdere] Patch #2 with test case.

Thanks
Hari, +1 if tests look good,
