[FYI [~jpullokkaran] [~ashutoshc] [~julianhyde], Most likely introduced by new version of Calcite snapshot.
[~julianhyde] i thought was going to push old snapshot back.

We would need to analyze these failures separately before bringing in the new calcite version., I saw a whole bunch of failures on HIVE-9436's run.

A couple are as in : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9436?focusedCommentId=14289984, I've put back the old snapshot (from Dec 19th). So, these changes should go away.

These differences are a preview of what will happen when Hive moves to Calcite 1.0.0. Calcite's RC1 vote is going on right now, and closes at 10pm Pacific on Sunday.

Can someone from Hive please evaluate the test failures and cast a (non-binding) vote? If you discover a show-stopper cast a -1 vote. I don't want to make a release that cannot be used. If issues are discovered after the vote has closed we won't be inclined to make a make a new release in a hurry. :), The attached patch (HIVE-9454.1.patch) works around CALCITE-566. It provides an executor so that constant-reduction rules can be executed.

The other test failures are, as far as I can tell, changes to generated plans and are either improvements or cosmetic changes. This patch does not fix those., [~julianhyde] there seems to be other exceptions (not just Derived Table removal) like subquery_in_having.q.

I haven't debugged the root cause., [~julianhyde] Can we get any justification on calcite using hive as a test bed? This issue effectively stopped whole hive dev process for three days (Build #2486 ~ #2502,  except time for re-testing all of them) and there seemed not any confirmation that will not happen again. , It's unfair to say I've been "using hive as a test bed". We have a test suite for Calcite that we're quite happy with. It serves its purpose -- it keeps Calcite from regressing.

You want to release Hive, so you need a release of Calcite. I am trying to do integration -- identify the incompatibilities between Hive and the new version of Calcite -- before we make that release. If that doesn't get done, you might well end up with a release of Calcite that is not suitable to make a release of Hive.

I have been telegraphing for some time on the Calcite dev list that a Calcite release is imminent. I made a release candidate on Thursday and started a vote. Given that Hive uses Calcite, at least one Hive committer ought to be actively participating on the Calcite dev list, participating in that vote, and doing integration testing.

The only integration testing that happened occurred because I pushed a new snapshot. That shit was going to hit the fan at some point between now and Hive 15. It's actually a good thing that it happened now.

I'm coming round to the idea that it is a bad idea for Hive to develop on a snapshot of Calcite. But what are the alternatives? Given that it takes at least 6 days for an incubator project such as Calcite to make a release,  development could very easily become stalled by a small bug or missing feature in Calcite. The ideal would be a Hive-specific snapshot of Calcite, controlled by Hive developers, but (a) Apache nexus doesn't seem to allow multiple versions of snapshots, (b) the Apache release process doesn't allow releases on snapshots, and (c) this would require proactive efforts by Hive committers to integrate with Calcite ahead of a Calcite release. Whatever we decide, it needs more proactive involvement from the Hive side.

There is an urgent need for a decision on the Calcite 1.0 release vote. We have sufficient votes for a release, and I could close the vote in just over an hour, but I won't. There is a non-binding -1 from [~jpullokkaran] due to incompatibilities but we haven't figured out whether the cause is on the Hive side or the Calcite side. I'd like to close the vote as soon as possible, but I need Hive developers to either log bugs or let the vote pass. "We haven't had time to do integration testing" (I'm paraphrasing a little) is not a valid reason for a -1., bq. I'm coming round to the idea that it is a bad idea for Hive to develop on a snapshot of Calcite. But what are the alternatives? 

In the past we've used SNAPSHOT of some deps on trunk (including myself). I am thinking we should agree that once we remove the SNAPSHOT dep of Calcite, we should not allow SNAPSHOT deps on trunk. If anyone wants to use a SNAPSHOT they would have to do so on a branch.

In short: Use a branch., bq.  need Hive developers to either log bugs or let the vote pass

[~jpullokkaran] [~jcamachorodriguez] - is this something you guys could tackle?, [~brocknoland] we have started analyzing failures. There is already one Calcite bug filed., New patch based on Julien's, containing also the changes on golden files using Calcite-1.0.0-RC2., New patch that address filter_join_breaktask, filter_join_breaktask2 failures.
Patch refers to Calcite RC2; Patch needs to be modified for Calcite version and repository before checking in.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12695538 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~brocknoland], I think that's what we can do. Currently the vote on the RC3 of Calcite 1.0.0 is going on.
As soon as Calcite 1.0.0 is released, we can commit this patch updating Hive dependencies to use that version and fixing the compatibility issues that had arisen., Calcite RC3 is looking good. With a little luck the RC3 vote will pass PPMC vote on Tuesday and IPMC vote on Friday., Calcite RC3,
