ATTACHMENT ID: 12633685, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks Vaibhav!
, [~rhbutani] I think HIVE-6627 and HIVE-6626 should also get in if we're keeping this for 13. Or else this should be deferred.

[~thejas]: What do you say?, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
