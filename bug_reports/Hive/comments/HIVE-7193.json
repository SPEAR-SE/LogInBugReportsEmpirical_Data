[Hi Developers and Watchers

I have the same problem. The way I see it that we are only authenticating if its an user, but with no support for group and filters there is no way to manage access.

I am using Hive on Amazon EMR and enabling LDAP only provides a little advantage. 

Please consider this Issue for fix.

~Venkat V, I am attaching a design doc based on my understanding of what is being requested here. Please review the document and provide any input you may have. Thanks,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12733705 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Attached is an updated doc with the new design. The goal of the design is not only to make LDAP Authenticator more feature-rich, but to also make it generic enough to make it work with all LDAP implementations available while keeping the number of parameters to be configured to a small set. When needed, code made assumptions based on popular implementations but also provided a safety valve (customQuery) that will get around this assumption.

Please provide feedback. Thanks, The failure is a qtest failure where the expected output does not match the real output. This failure is not related to the patch I uploaded.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12737449 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~ngangam] Overall, the patch looks good to me. I still have some questions, could you help clarify them? Thanks, Incorporating additional suggestions from the review board. A big change it to revert treating Atn Providers as services (singleton instances thru the life of the HS2). These instances will now be created on every Atn request. 
The concern was that we dont know what the user-coded CustomAuthenticationProvider could do. Since this is user-written code, we have no control over what it can and cannot do. If each request takes a long time, we could have a bottleneck. Similarly, the PAMAuthenticator could become a bottleneck too.
So the decision was to have the AtnFactory be consistent across all forms of Atn., Thanks [~ngangam] for the patch. It looks good to me. Regarding to the concern you had whether the AtnProvider should be changed to be implemented as a singleton, I agree with you that you would not address it in this patch for following reasons:
1. The existing code does not implement AtnProvider as a singleton. Making such change might have some backward compatibility issue. For example, what if a user has already implemented and used a CustomAuthenticationProvider which is not for a singleton?
2. The patch only adds several additional read and processing of HiveConf properties in LdapAuthenticationProviderImpl constructor. Compared to LDAP authentication itself, its overhead should be trivial and it should not be a performance bottleneck.
3. In case it turns out the performance is not desirable due to AtnProvider instantiation, we might consider moving some static logic from constructor to a static block to improve runtime performance. Or open a separate JIRA to initiate the investigation to performance implementation (including singleton etc). But this patch will mainly focuses on the LDAP enhancement.
4. As for your concern "dont know what the user-coded CustomAuthenticationProvider could do", even if you change the AuthenticationProviderFactory and allow it to be implemented as a singleton, but like you said, we still have no control how he implements the singleton.
----
In addition, the enhancement including its new configuration properties should be properly documented.

, For some reason, the pre-commit test run did not pick up the patch. I will cancel patch, and re-submit to kick it off. , Still dint work. I will delete and re-attach the patch as a .4 version., Re-uploaded the patch hoping the pre-commit tests will kick in.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12740128 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The SINGLE test failure is not related to my patch. It failed in the prior run too. Appears there is a mismatch in the query output vs the q.out file. So I think we are good., +1, Doc review (parameter descriptions):

*hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupDNPattern*
{code}
+        "COLON-separated list of patterns to use to find DNs for group entities in this directory \n" +
+        "use %s where the actual group name is to be substituted for.\n" +
+        "For example: CN=%s,CN=Groups,DC=subdomain,DC=domain,DC=com."),
{code}
Please add a period at end of first line and start second line with initial capital "Use ...."  Also, why is the example a comma-separated list when the description says colon-separated?

*hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupFilter*
{code}
+        "COMMA-separated list of LDAP Group names (short name not full DNs) \n" +
+        " For example: HiveAdmins,HadoopAdmins,Administrators"),
{code}
Again, end the first line with a period.  Remove the space at beginning of second line.

*hive.server2.authentication.ldap.userDNPattern* 
{code}
+        "COLON-separated list of patterns to use to find DNs for users in this directory \n" +
+        "use %s where the actual group name is to be substituted for.\n" +
+        "For example: CN=%s,CN=Users,DC=subdomain,DC=domain,DC=com." +
+        "COLON-seperated list of Base DNs for User entities in the LDAP directory"),
{code}
Again, add period to first line and start second line "Use".  Why is the list comma-separated?  Does the fourth line belong somewhere else?  (It misspells "separated" too.)

*hive.server2.authentication.ldap.userFilter*
{code}
+        "COMMA-separated list of LDAP usernames (just short names, not full DNs) \n" +
+        "For example: hiveuser,impalauser,hiveadmin,hadoopadmin"),
{code}
Add period at end of first line.

*hive.server2.authentication.ldap.customLDAPQuery*
{code}
+        "A full LDAP query that LDAP Atn provider uses to execute against LDAP Server \n" +
+        "If this query return a null resultset, the LDAP Provider fails the Authentication request \n" +
+        ", succeeds otherwise." +
+        "For example: (&(objectClass=group)(objectClass=top)(instanceType=4)(cn=Domain*)) \n" +
+        "(&(objectClass=person)(|(sAMAccountName=admin)(|(memberOf=CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=com)" +
+        "(memberOf=CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=domain,DC=com))))"),
{code}
Add a period at end of first line.  Second line:  "If this query returns ..." (add the s to return) and move comma from start of third line to end of second line (or move "request" to third line).   , Thank you for the review.
Q. Also, why is the example a comma-separated list when the description says colon-separated?
A. The example shows a single pattern for users for LDAP. Each attribute in LDAP DN is separated by COMMA
    "CN=%s,CN=Users,DC=subdomain,DC=domain,DC=com"
    However, it is possible that a ldap directory could have users in different trees. The pattern for baseDN for each tree is separated by COLON.
   For example "CN=%s,CN=Users,DC=subdomain,DC=domain,DC=com:CN=%s,OU=IT,DC=domain,DC=com"

The same is true for group patterns. Does this help? Thanks, Yes, I see.  Thanks [~ngangam].  Could the parameter descriptions include this information?, Attaching new patch with doc changes from Lefty's review., I'm getting 404 "Oops, you've found a dead link" for patch 5., Sorry, I just deleted it seeing you latest comment about including additional info in the parameter description. Should all of the above info be in the description? Thanks, Well, I'd like to see commas & colons explained in the description but maybe that's just because I'm ignorant about LDAP.  If you don't think it's necessary, it can still be added to the description in the wiki.  And of course it's available here., Sorry about the duplicate comments.  I'll review patch 5 tomorrow., I intend to enhance the LDAP section wiki docs about using these new properties in detail, with examples. I just holding out until this patch gets committed. I figured thats where most users will look when attempting to use this feature. Would that suffice? And leave the patch 5 as-was for now?, Great, then in Configuration Properties the parameters will be linked to the LDAP section.  Thanks Naveen., Re-attaching the patch with Lefty's suggestion. I will include full details when I update the wiki docs for LDAP Configuration. (Thanks Lefty),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12741055 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, This test seems flaky. It failed with patch v4, and passed with patch v5 and failed again with patch v6, although there are no code changes between v4,v5 and v6 of the patch, just doc changes (javadocs and hiveconf parameter descriptions). The failure does not appear to be related to my fix. , Committed to Hive 2.0.0 and 1.3.0. Thanks [~ngangam] for the patch, [~csun] for code review and [~leftylev] for the doc review., Doc note:  (Removed TODOC2.0 because we only need to document the initial version, which is 1.3.)

This adds five configuration parameters, which need to be documented in the HiveServer2 section of Configuration Properties.

* hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupDNPattern
* hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupFilter
* hive.server2.authentication.ldap.userDNPattern
* hive.server2.authentication.ldap.userFilter
* hive.server2.authentication.ldap.customLDAPQuery
* [Configuration Properties -- HiveServer2 | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-HiveServer2]

[~ngangam] wrote up the general documentation here (thanks, Naveen):

* [User and Group Filter Support with LDAP Atn Provider in HiveServer2 | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/User+and+Group+Filter+Support+with+LDAP+Atn+Provider+in+HiveServer2], Doc note:  The configuration parameters are documented in the HiveServer2 section of Configuration Properties, so I removed the TODOC1.3 label.

Setting Up HiveServer2 has a link to User and Group Filter Support ... (see link in last comment)., [~ngangam] Thanks for the useful enhancement. Any tips on testing the changes here? I am trying to figure out if there could be a good way to add a UT to test this., Thanks [~vgumashta] When I had put this feature, most of the testing was done manually because I couldnt get Apache Directory to work the way I wanted to automate the unit tests. I finally cut over to UnboundID to use for unit tests in HIVE-11866. This jira adds a framework that uses unboundID in-memory LDAP Server for testing HS2's LDAP Atn and some basic tests. I havent gotten around to adding tests for HIVE-7193 but I just created a jira a couple of days ago HIVE-12079 (linking to this jira now). I will add UTs for ldap filters soon. I will CC you on the RB when its ready., Thanks [~ngangam].]
