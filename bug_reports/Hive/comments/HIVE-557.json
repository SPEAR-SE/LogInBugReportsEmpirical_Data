[just talked to Zheng - need to catch all Exceptions from mapoperator and not just hiveexception .., Modified ExecMapper and ExecReducer to catch all Exceptions and set "abort".
, committed. thanks Zheng!, The "close()" is called in the "finally" block in "MapRunner.run()". If there is an out-of-memory error, Hive won't be able to catch it (because we only catch "Exception" now), so abort is NOT set to false, which is wrong.

We need to catch "Throwable" instead of "Exception"., Changed Exception/HiveException to Throwable to places where we are setting "abort = true"., commited again. thanks Zheng.]
