[This patch fixes the problem. It also fixes the bug in PartitionPruner that fails with "WHERE ds = '2009-01-01'".
, This one is the same as HIVE-437.1.patch, but it only contains code changes (NO test and result changes)., Talked with the team offline and make some changes:

1. We will now output an error if an identifier in the expression can be both a table alias and a column.

2. The Expression GraphWalker's process will return NULL for a table name. Originally we were returning a String for table name, and exprNodeDesc for others, which is not good.  I didn't change the PartitionPruner in the same direction, because we are going to refactor that code completely pretty soon.
, Passed all tests., looks good. 

PartitionPruner still uses old code - exprNodeTempDesc. Can you write a comment there saying that his is temporary and will be removed anyway
once PartitionPruner moves to the walker framework ?

I will commit it after that. Also, I dont think this needs to be merged to 0.3 - is that correct ?, Added the comments in PartitionPruner.java as Namit suggested.
Yes, this only needs to go to trunk.
, Committed. Thanks Zheng]
