[Patch adds a command line option to schematool to specify that the language should be explicitly created:
  "-dbOpts postgres.filter.pre.9", Makes sense. I think that long term we might want to annotate specific commands with "-- IGNORE FAILURE" and then process the file statement by statement.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12673282, Instead of having the user supply an option dependent on Postgres version, changed to the patch to automatically run a "pre-upgrade" script that creates the language, but any error is ignored.

Kept the dbOpts option as that is useful when we add any db specific options.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12674279, +1, Thank you Mohit! I really appreciate the work done here to improve this framework! Committed to trunk,., [~hagleitn] is this ok to backport to 0.14.1?, Yes, I think this should be backported to 0.14.1. [~sershe] can you do the honors?, bq.  Kept the dbOpts option as that is useful when we add any db specific options.

Does dbOpts need to be documented, or is it for future use?  Any other documentation, or is this just a bug fix?

* [Hive Schema Tool | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Schema+Tool#HiveSchemaTool-TheHiveSchemaTool], backported to 14, Thanks, [~leftylev]. Yes, this a bug fix, so no documentation is needed for it.

The "-dbOpts" option was added for future use. However, the option does appear in the schematool usage output:
{code}
 -dbOpts <databaseOpts>             Backend DB specific options
{code}
I'd just document it when we add options for this arg. What do you think?, bq.  document it when we add options for this arg

Agreed.  Thanks [~mohitsabharwal].

Edit (19/May/17):  The problem with that approach is that the option never got documented.  So I've added a TODOC1.0 label.  Here's where the doc belongs:

* [Hive Schema Tool -- The schematool Command | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Schema+Tool#HiveSchemaTool-TheschematoolCommand]

Some new options are being added in 3.0.0 by HIVE-1010, so I'll add a note there asking to include this doc., Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
