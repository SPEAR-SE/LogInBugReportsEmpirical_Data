[The work around for this is to set WEBHCAT_CONF_DIR.  Two things should be done to fix this bug:

# Make WEBHCAT_CONF_DIR have a default value that matches the directory structure of our release packages.
# Document the use of WEBHCAT_CONF_DIR in the docs., Changed webhcat_config.sh to check webhcat-site.xml (in addition to webhcat-env.sh) when calculating default value for WEBHCAT_CONF_DIR.

Tested manually by changing templeton.port in uild/dist/hcatalog/etc/webhcat/webhcat-site.xml.  Templeton then listens on this port., Documentation Note:

If WEBCHAT_CONF_DIR env var is not set WebHCat will try to look for config its files in default locations.
It will look for webhcat-env.sh and webhcat-site.xml in ../etc/webhcat and ../conf relative to webhcat_server.sh and /etc/webhcat.

, Looks good . +1
