[[~hopperjim], I have run this with multiple versions and it does not seem to be a problem (for given example I get 75000). What is the result that you get?, [~jcamachorodriguez] it seems you have disabled the hive.optimize.index.filter that's why you are getting a correct result every time, with ppd enable and hive.optimize.index.filter true you will get the count 14999 for query over orc table because the ORC predicate expression pushed to ORC Split is wrong for NOT BETWEEN operator.
{code}
 [INFO] [InputInitializer {Map 1} #0] |orc.OrcInputFormat|: ORC pushdown predicate: leaf-0 = (BETWEEN c 0 100000), leaf-1 = (BETWEEN c 25000 50000), expr = (and leaf-0 leaf-1)
