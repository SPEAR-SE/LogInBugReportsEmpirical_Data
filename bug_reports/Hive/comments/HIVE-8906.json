[Both of these have already been fixed (in HIVE-8873 and HIVE-8845) and checked into the 0.14 branch.  The right solution here is to fix this with a 0.14.1 release., Looks like the Hortonworks HDP 2.2 version that was just released uses Hive 0.14.0 as well. Any suggestions for reliably building apps against that combination?, For HDP 2.2 I used the Hortonworks repo where I didn't have the snapshot issue., Resolving per Alan's comment above.]
