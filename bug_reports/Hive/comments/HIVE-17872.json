[[~vihangk1]  [~stakiar] FYI
, Actually there are two settings, datanucleus.autoStartMechanism and datanucleus.autoStartMechanismMode. The mode is the one that should be set to 'ignore'.

The datanucleus.autoStartMechanism should be set to non-null to initialize auto-start and looks like it should be class name.

So I was wrong and HIVE-14152 is correct., This jira is resolved and released with Hive 3.0 If you find an issue with it, please create a new jira.]
