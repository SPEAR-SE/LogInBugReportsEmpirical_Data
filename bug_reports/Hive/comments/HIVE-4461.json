[+1 , I checked in the patch in 0.11 branch to proceed with RC. Patch doesn't apply on trunk however. Alan, can you also upload a trunk version for it?, This patch is on top of changes for HIVE-4387, which were only checked into branch 0.11.  The assumption is that we'll fix the maven publishing of HCatalog properly when we rework HCat's build system to match Hive's., Marking this as resolved, as per Alan's comments.]
