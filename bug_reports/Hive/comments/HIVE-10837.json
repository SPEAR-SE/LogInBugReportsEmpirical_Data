[I've came across this issue on HiveServer2 1.1.1 used via Beeline on CDH CDH-5.4.4-1.cdh5.4.4.p0.4. The problem wasn't limited to inserting, a plain select failed as well. I queried a quite a big partitioned tabled backed by SequenceFiles of Protobuf. Each partition has about 6B records and it around 700GB. Query on a single partition was ok, but querying eg. 30 partitions fails (~19TB). Note that the same query executed via Hive CLI 1.1.1 works ok. The resulting number of rows is really small (the number of partitions, eg. <= 31). The HQL query string itself is small., Also the problem is that this error message does not provide any information what went wrong. Also I was unable to find any HiveServer log files., Cloudera recommends increasing the HiveServer2's heap size

so that's what I've done (from 256M to 8G) and it seems that it helped.

BTW: I noticed that Cloudera increased the default heap size for hive roles in CDH 5.5 which is maybe related to this.]
