[Modified the title of this JIRA to reflect the issue after further testing.

Here's the test setup -

> find . -type f
./th12a/testHiveMetastore.hql
./th12a/testHiveMetastore.sh
./th12a/testHiveMetastore.txt
./th12b/testHiveMetastore.hql
./th12b/testHiveMetastore.sh

> Ran script in th12a dir - noticed derby.log and TempStatsStore dir being created in th12a dir
> Ran script in th12b dir - table t2 has data, so MySQL Metastore is used ; verified in HDFS as well

So, the issue is - derby.log and TempStatsStore dir are created in th12a dir when using MySQL Metastore, Steps to test ...

0.  have a proper hadoop, hive (with mysql metastore) setup
1.  unzip attached th.zip
2.  run bash script in th12a dir - notice derby.log and TempStatsStore dir creation in th12a dir - this is the issue
3.  run bash script in th12b dir  - to verify table t2 has data in it (you can verify in HDFS as well)

Issue is - derby.log and TempStatsStore dir are created when using mysql metastore., Not a Problem, as we can avoid creation of derby.log and TempStatsStore by setting hive.stats.autogather to false.]
