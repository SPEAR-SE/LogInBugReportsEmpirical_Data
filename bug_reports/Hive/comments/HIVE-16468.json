[This change introduces 4 new properties which can be set when running the BeeLine tests:
- test.data.dir - The test data files should be uploaded to the server to this dir, so the LOAD DATA commands will work
- test.beeline.url - If we would like to run the tests against an existing cluster we should set this parameter. Otherwise the miniHS2 server is started
- test.beeline.user - The username which is used for connecting to the cluster
- test.beeline.password - The password which is used for connecting to the cluster
, Hi [~pvary] Took a quick look. Overall looks good. Just a few questions:

1. {{System.err.println(HiveConfUtil.dumpConfig(miniHS2.getHiveConf()));}} --> Is there a way to log this in debug mode only? If it is not trivial I think it is okay to keep it as it is.

2. Were you able to run BeeLine tests against a cluster?, Thanks for the review [~vihangk1]!

1., After many runs I found it more confusing than helpful to log out the full configuration, and do not found an existing methodology for logging something only in debug mode
2., Yes, happily I was able to run them against our nightly cluster.

Thanks,
Peter, LGTM +1 Thanks for the patch [~pvary], Retriggering the Pre-Commit build with the same patch,
