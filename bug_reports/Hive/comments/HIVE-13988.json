ATTACHMENT ID: 12809325 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~ashutoshc], could u take a look? The test case failures are legitimate due to golden file updates. I will file a follow-up jira to deal with the case when source table is not empty. thanks., With this change there will be no MoveTask whenever limit 0.  This is problematic for both data & metadata. Insert query with limit 0 may still result in creation of new partitions which will get skipped after this change. Insert overwrite with limit 0 implies deleting all the existing files which will also not happen after this change. You need to generate a MoveTask even with limit 0., [~ashutoshc], your comments are valid. Could u take another look? I tried to only use move task but it seems more complicated than i thought. Move task is followed by stats task and we also need to make stats work. Thus, I only make very limited optimization, i.e., when there is only one "insert into", we skip the task compilation. Please see attached q files for examples. Thanks., semantics for insert into is more like upsert than insert, meaning it will create a partition if it doesn't exist and if exists it will add into it, so you need a MoveTask even for that., [~ashutoshc], could u give an example? I do not see any change of metadata/data if insert into with a limit 0....,
