[Another possible place to look at is SQLOperation catching Throwable., This is targeting 2.0.1 but has no patch. Should it be moved out to 2.1.0?, Removing 2.1.0 target. Please feel free to commit to branch-2.1 anyway and fix for 2.1.0 if this happens before the release., I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit if this can be resolved before the release.]
