[Hive does not search column properly if row resolver of previous operator is expressional (rs or gby). If some equivalent logic is added, this issue could be resolved. 

Attached patch is just a simple scratch., navis requested code review of "HIVE-2709 [jira] Semantic Analysis failed for GroupBy query with aliase.".
Reviewers: JIRA

  DPAL-625 Semantic Analysis failed for GroupBy query with aliase

  In the SQL ,

  "select empno from test t group by t.empno"

  type of query work fine where as in hive ,below exception

  "org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.SemanticException: line 1:7 Expression Not In Group By Key ename".

  For the above, column_name with aliase work fine i.e

  "select t.empno from test t group by t.empno" is work fine.
