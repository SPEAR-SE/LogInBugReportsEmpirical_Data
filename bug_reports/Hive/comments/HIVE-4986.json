[[~subrotosanyal] This does look like a bug. Is setting core-site.xml/hdfs-site.xml in path a suitable work around for this issue ?
, Hi [~thejas],

That work around will probably work. There is one more problem with this piece of code.
{noformat}if(schemaString.toLowerCase().startsWith("hdfs://")){noformat}
What if the FileSystem type is something else like maprfs or s3? I think the code will break at that point.]
