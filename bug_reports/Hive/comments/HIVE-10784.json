[Hi [~biosetup],

Scenario 1 and 3 able to reproduce and 2 is not reproducing, can you upload a script file for scenario 2.
Attached a workaround patch to fix scenario 1.
, I wonder the code changes both from HIVE-9877 and HIVE-10541 might have already addressed your observed issue., Hi [~biosetup],

I have tested mistakenly with 1.2.0.. It is working in 1.3.0 version.. Thanks [~ctang.ma], This is fixed in HIVE-9877 and HIVE-10541]
