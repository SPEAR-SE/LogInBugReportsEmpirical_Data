[Fixed error in the cwiki page., Are we following a new process here ? Why create jiras for wiki edits ? We don't follow the review process for it, and wiki already have a change comment log. Things like fix version doesn't make sense for wiki, not sure if we should include it in hive release documentation.

, Thanks for contributions to improve the hive documentation. I really appreciate that. 
I am just asking if we need to create jiras when we are not checking in some code changes.
, I didn't know the process. I had some doubts when creating the jira, but created it anyway, saying a documentation component. Now I'm thinking we should probably just go straight and edit the wiki., I think as we move the documentation to be version controlled (as discussed in mailing list), it would make sense to create jiras for the changes and track it with releases. Until then I think it is best to edit wiki directly. 
Thanks again for helping improve hive documentation, we need to invest more in that front!
, bq. Why create jiras for wiki edits? We don't follow the review process for it, and wiki already have a change comment log.

[~thejas] do you mean each wikidoc's page history, or does the Hive wiki have an overall change log somewhere?  (That would certainly be useful.) 

We need a doc review process.  Really.

I think jiras are a good way to publicize edits that need review, even though those jiras tend to get ignored.  Jiras are also good for requesting help to fix wiki errors.  Should such issues just go to the mailing lists?]
