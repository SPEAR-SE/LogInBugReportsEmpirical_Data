[I believe that check was put in because it used to fail if the number of maps was 0. Obviously, if you take out the check, you had better add a test case of both reduces != 0 and reduces = 0 when maps = 0.

That said, it is probably better to run the reduces with no input than the current behavior, which tends to surprise users., This was fixed a long time back. In hive, an empty input is created to start a dummy mapper]
