ATTACHMENT ID: 12857033 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Hmm... it seems dangerous to delete that file - should it at least make sure it's a smaller/equal sized file that we are replacing?
And log a warning.
If there's an independent bug with path collision it can nuke the file silently., I'm not sure what the danger is. This is to fix a bug. If the bug is valid and the fix is reasonable, I'm not sure why we need to worry about other possible, future bugs which might manifest. Such bugs demand their respective fixes rather than relying on this bug not being fixed., I'm not saying this bug shouldn't be fixed. However, if there's future bug, currently it would fail with exception while with silent delete it could delete data/produce incorrect results.
So I suggest we add a log statement to this fix, since this is not a normal condition, and also add a sanity check... given that we expect to be deleting the output from another copy of the same task, checking file sizes might be a good sanity check., Patch #1 incorporated [~sershe]'s comment above., +1 pending tests; file status can be retrieved only if rename fails; can be changed on commit,
