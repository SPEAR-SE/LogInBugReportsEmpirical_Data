, @Kevin: I'm able to reproduce the failure by running TestNegativeCliDriver.max_dyn_parts. I'll plan to dig into this more tonight.
, It looks like Ivy is picking up an older copy of the hive-metastore JAR from the local Ivy cache. I was originally able to reproduce the failure on trunk, but it now consistently passes after I manually removed the hive-metastore JAR from my .ivy2 directory. I also modified the Hive build job to run the very-clean target, and it now passes:

, Thanks Carl. Yes, the build now relies on ivy for dependencies between hive modules, so it is critical that the cache does not go stale., Should this be closed as 'not a problem' ?
, This issue is fixed and released as part of 0.10.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
