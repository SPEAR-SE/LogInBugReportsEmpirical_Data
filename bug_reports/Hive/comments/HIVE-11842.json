ATTACHMENT ID: 12756271 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sershe], I have run some performance analysis locally and depending on the query, compilation time might be even 20% shorter. The reason is that once we enter in the method, we will not rebuild the operator path for each pattern that we are trying to match (being String based operations, this is quite expensive). In turn, the memory footprint will be a bit larger, but we should be safe as it is delimited by the min between the max pattern length and the max path length., Pushed to master, thanks for the review [~sershe]!]
