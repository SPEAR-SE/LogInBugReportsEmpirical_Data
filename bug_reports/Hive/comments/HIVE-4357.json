[We need to include "beeline" in the iterate.hive.tests property defined in build.properties. Otherwise TestBeeLineWithArgs will not get executed during test runs., @Rob: I noticed this while testing HIVE-4268, but was able to work around the problem by executing the test with the following command: ant test -Dmodule=ql,beeline -Dtestcase=TestBeeLineWithArgs. Can you please create a patch that makes the change I described above and submit it for review? Thanks., Trying out the change now, will submit a patch if the tests execute and pass
, Added beeline to the test list in build.properties
, Patch for review at https://reviews.apache.org/r/10553/
, @Rob: please make the review request public. Thanks., Test udf7 in ql (probably one of the last ones in ql) fails for me because of conflicting junit versions in the CLASSPATH. I had to do a little trickery to get past that but could then verify that the beeline tests are executed and pass.
, +1. Will commit if tests pass., @Rob: I apologize for not committing this in a timely manner. I committed HIVE-4497 instead since beeline depends on JDBC and should follow it in the test order.]
