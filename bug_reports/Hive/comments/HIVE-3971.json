[https://reviews.facebook.net/D8343, patch available in both phabricator and attachment, I am not sure if this indeed is the root cause, because this is deterministic cause and the test cause would have always failed, not randomly. Further if this was the reason, test case itself would only fail, but currently it doesn't fail but causes the crash of TestNegativeCliDriver., Good point. Am not sure either. Am sure it is related to classnotfound
