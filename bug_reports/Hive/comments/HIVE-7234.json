The test failures do not seem to be related to the patch., [~xuefuz] Could you take a look when you get some time., Left some minor comments on RB., [~singhashish] Thanks for looking into this. Here are my high-level comments.

1. In the description area, could you describe how to reproduce the problem (such as query that you use, steps that you take)? I tried but wasn't able to reproduce.
2. I don't feel that we need to handle decimal's NULL differently from other data types., [~swarnim], thanks for reviewing. Answered your comments on RB and updated patch based on reviews., [~xuefuz], updated description. Let me know if you are still not able to repro it., A few minor comments on review board., Updated based on review comments on RB.,
