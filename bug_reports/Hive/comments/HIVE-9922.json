[I tried to compile  hive1.1, it had the same issue., I'm facing the same problem when compiling Hive 1.1.0 on MAC.

I found the jar file but cannot down it:
http://repo.spring.io/libs-release/org/pentaho/pentaho-aggdesigner-algorithm/5.1.5-jhyde/
, the repo below can get the jar:
http://conjars.org/repo/org/pentaho/pentaho-aggdesigner-algorithm/, [~LueChen] Can you tell me what command are you trying to run. I am able to run everything successfully on mine., mvn clean install -U -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Phadoop-2,dist, mvn clean install -U -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Phadoop-2,dist, I have downloaded the jar and install it to my local maven repo, and now it's OK. 
thank u.]
