{\code}, To fix this bug, Demux will be modified to be aware that rows associated with a key are ordered by the tag. When Demux see a row with new tag coming, it will know that rows with tags which are less than this incoming tag can be processed.

Taking the example in the description, with this fix, inputs of JOIN2 will be ordered by the tag. When Demux sees a tag with 1, it will ask GBY to process its buffer, and then GBY will ask JOIN1 to process its buffer. Before Demux forwards a new row with the tag of 1 to JOIN2, all rows with the tag of 0 will be forwarded into JOIN2., yhuai requested code review of "HIVE-4952 [jira] When hive.join.emit.interval is small, queries optimized by Correlation Optimizer may generate wrong results".

fix

If we have a query like this ...

SELECT xx.key, xx.cnt, yy.key
FROM
(SELECT x.key as key, count(1) as cnt FROM src1 x JOIN src1 y ON (x.key = y.key) group by x.key) xx
JOIN src yy
ON xx.key=yy.key;

After Correlation Optimizer, the operator tree in the reducer will be

     JOIN2
       |
       |
      MUX
     /   \
    /     \
   GBY     |
    |      |
  JOIN1    |
    \     /
     \   /
     DEMUX

For JOIN2, the right table will arrive at this operator first. If hive.join.emit.interval is small, e.g. 1, JOIN2 will output the results even it has not got any row from the left table. The logic related hive.join.emit.interval in JoinOperator assumes that inputs will be ordered by the tag. But, if a query has been optimized by Correlation Optimizer, this assumption may not hold for those JoinOperators inside the reducer.
