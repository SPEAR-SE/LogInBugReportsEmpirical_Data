[This seems to be fixed in HIVE-2 and above. Still interesting to see which patch has fixed it. 

, [~shenavandeh] Thanks for checking but I'm not sure HIVE-2 is related to this issue. 
Do you mean simply Hive version 2 instead of JIRA ticket HIVE-2?, Hello,
I meant , this query runs perfectly in hive version 2.0.0 and version 2.0.1.
It fails on hive version 1.12.0 and below.

Sorry for confusion.

, I should specifically add, in my case , this fails only if the data is
stored in compressed files ( gzip , bzip2, etc ) . The same dataset , If
uncompressed, the query runs perfectly.
