[Look at the patch for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4106
I will have a workaround for now for the above patch, but can you verify that the
merged tree looks correct ?, navis requested code review of "HIVE-4371 [jira] some issue with merging join trees".

HIVE-4371 some issue with merging join trees

Navis, I would really appreciate if you can take a look.

I am attaching a testcase, for which in the optimizer the join context left
aliases and right aliases do not look correct.

WHY DID I GET THIS EMAIL?

To: JIRA, navis
, [~namit] I've not been following SMB/BMJoins for months and afraid I could be on the road.

I've attached a small patch excluding aliases belonging to other join, which makes the test case run. (but not verified the result)

And in the test query,

select count(*) FROM bucket_small a JOIN bucket_medium b ON a.key = b.key JOIN bucket_big c ON c.key = b.key JOIN bucket_medium d ON c.key = b.key;

the last "JOIN bucket_medium d ON c.key = b.key" means cross join?, I am not sure about the last test case.
Why is left Alias (es) and right Alias (es) not correct for that ?, [~namit] Ran all tests and passed. I cannot see anything wrong in aliases of QBJoinTree. 

{noformat}
TS1(b)-RS1\
TS2(c)-RS2-JOIN1-RS4\
TS3(a)-RS3/         JOIN2
          TS4(d)-RS5/

JOIN2 (L=null, R=d, Ls=[a,b,c], Base=d) 
{noformat}

In this, posBig should be 0(d) or 1(null), not 2(c) in other join context., navis updated the revision "HIVE-4371 [jira] some issue with merging join trees".

  Added test case
