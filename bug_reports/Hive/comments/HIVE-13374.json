[[~pxiong] This is the issue that I talked you in Hadoop Summit Tokyo 2016.

I hope that hiveserver2 will become stable.

Thanks., Thank you for comment.

By the way, I work at LINE.

I'm not sure if Yahoo Japan faces this problem., [~pxiong] If this is resulting in longer compile phase time, HS2 would block other query compiles before 2.0 (HIVE-4239) , as there was a lock around compile phase.
Thats likely one part of the issue.

The other part seems to be memory consumption is very high when very large number (10s of thousands) of partitions are queried.
