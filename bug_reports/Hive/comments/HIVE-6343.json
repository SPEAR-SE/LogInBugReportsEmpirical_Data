[This could be useful for HIVE-6047 - any necessary jars needed for permanent udfs could be placed somewhere on hdfs, available to all clients, and clients can be configured to pick up these jars based on the hive conf., Attaching patch v1. One thing I'm unsure about is how many times the remote file will get downloaded.  I would assume that any local processes spun off by the client would attempt to load the jars in hive.aux.jars.path (and thus download remote jars again), Hadoop tasks should not try to load hive.aux.jars.path, since they use -libjars, right?]
