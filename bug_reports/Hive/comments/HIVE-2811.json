  UTF8 here

  Most OS has this value by default, but in some cases (on apache build machines) it has a different value making inputddl5.q test to fail. This variable should be exported while running the tests.

, @Ed: Can you please attach a copy of the patch and grant license rights to the ASF? Thanks!, Done. Are we going through all those fabricator steps just to have to put up the patch again by hand? Is there some fabricator setting I can check for this?, Unfortunately, yes. I think John is looking into making arc do this automatically. In the meantime, sorry for the inconvenience., ashutoshc has commented on the revision "HIVE-2811 [jira] Export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 to environment while running tests".

INLINE COMMENTS
  build-common.xml:67 Is it en_US.UTF8 or en_US.UTF-8? I think latter.
