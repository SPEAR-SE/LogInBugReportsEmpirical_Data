[TxnHandler.isDuplicateKey() method is checking wrong SQL code
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/error-messages-server.html
MySql has > 1 with ideantical msg
it's currently checking 1022 which has msg "Can't write; duplicate key in table '%s'"
but the one MySql comes back with is 1062 "Duplicate entry '%s' for key %d"
there is also 1586 with "Duplicate entry '%s' for key '%s'"
I don't see anything that explains which is produced when..., [~wzheng] could you review please, I see we're relaxing the !isDuplicateKeyError logic. Just want to understand why we don't throw exception for duplicate key errors? There are a dozen errors with "duplicate something" in the link above.., if you look at the logic where isDuplicateKey() is used, the idea is to lock a record with specific value and if it's not there, then insert it and then lock it.  Since you cannot be certain 2 entities are not going through this same process, the logic catches the "duplicate key" and proceeds but raises an error if it's any other error., I see. Since MySQL document is as messed as Hive's, this is our best effort to capture "duplicate key/entry" type of errors.
+1, patch 2 is the same - previous one disappeared form build queue,
