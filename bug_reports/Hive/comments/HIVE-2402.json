[I'm curious:  why is it not possible to actually support an empty string as the like pattern?  It's not particularly useful, but should be no different from any other wildcardless pattern.
, By default patterntype is complex so it is expecting Pattern object but in this scenario pattern object is null so it is throwing nullpointer exception. Default patterntype can be NONE and in parseSimplePattern() it will be assigned with right type.,
