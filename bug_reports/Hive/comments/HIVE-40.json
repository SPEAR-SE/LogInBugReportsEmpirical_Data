[Is this fixed now?  From http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/UserGuide:

Apache Access Log Tables

{noformat}CREATE TABLE apachelog (
ipaddress STRING, identd STRING, user STRING,finishtime STRING,
requestline string, returncode INT, size INT)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.dynamic_type.DynamicSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
'serialization.format'=
'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.thrift.TCTLSeparatedProtocol',
'quote.delim'='("|\\[|\\])',
'field.delim'=' ',
'serialization.null.format'='-')
STORED AS TEXTFILE;{noformat} 
, I see you actually wrote those examples, so I'm probably misunderstanding the problem.

It seems the issue here is that Apache logs have three quote characters (double quote, left bracket, right bracket):

{noformat}1.2.3.4 - - [26/Nov/2008:17:59:27 -0600] "HEAD / HTTP/1.0" 302 - "-" "-"{noformat}

Specifying these characters as a regex is messy due to multiple levels of quoting.  We could have a parameter that takes one or more single characters (rather than a regex):

{noformat}'quote.chars' = '"[]'{noformat}
, Yes, agreed.  Above and beyond that, I think it would be even better to just have an apache log format deserializer that could just take the log format string and do the right thing. This is mainly a stop gap measure but could be improved for sure.
