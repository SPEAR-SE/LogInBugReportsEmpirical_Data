[Been a while since I submitted a Hive patch, let's see if this works..., everything looks good; but I'll assign it to you :)
+1 pending tests, Tests haven't run, did I name the patch wrongly or something like that?, (Pinging [~stakiar] for help.), You attached the patch correctly. Unfortunately, Hive QA feedback typically takes at least 24 hours (typically 1-2 days). Mainly because we run Hive QA for a single patch at a time and it takes about 2 hours per patch. If it doesn't response by EOD tomorrow, I'll take a closer look at the Jenkins job., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

ATTACHMENT ID: 12927733 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Is there anything I should look at here? I can't even find the logs for the test failure, and I also don't see how any test would be affected by my change..., [~vanzin] not really...I wanted to commit it; but if you don't mind I would like to have your email address (#$% GDPR) to attribute the contribution to you., found it... :D
pushed to master. Thank you [~vanzin]!]
