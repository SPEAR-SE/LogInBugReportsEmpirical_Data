[Both Hive and Impala seem to have the issue, so also created https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-4250, It seems this is already fixed on the master branch:

{code}
select from_utc_timestamp('2016-10-30 00:30:00','CET');
+------------------------+
|          _c0           |
+------------------------+
| 2016-10-30 02:30:00.0  |
+------------------------+
{code}

If that is the case and you can confirm then please resolve the Jira?, Tested in CDH5.11, confirm fixed, but not sure which JIRA has the fix in the upstream, will just resolve it for now., Thanks for letting me know [~zsombor.klara], and apologies for the delay.]
