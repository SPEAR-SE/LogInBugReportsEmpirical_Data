[Nice catch, Brock!

The code line you referred to seems off the description that you gave. In addition, s it hard to construct a test case?, Thank you for pointing this out! The line of code is: https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/Operator.java#L567

I tried for an entire day to get a test for this but could not reproduce outside of the production environment. I did however, test the fix in the production environment and it worked well.,
