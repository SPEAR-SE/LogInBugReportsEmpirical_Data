[FYI [~vkorukanti], [~vkorukanti] I think the appropriate change would be to do a 
{code}
conf.setBoolean("dfs.permissions.enabled", false); 
{code}
before starting miniHS2. We open JDBC connections as different users and the default value for hive.server2.enable.doAs is true. , bq. I think we need to be a sleep in TestHS2ImpersonationWithRemoteMS.setup()  after MiniHS2.start()
MiniHS2.start() already invokes a sleep loop.
, [~vkorukanti] Please ignore my suggestion - I think it will mask the issue.
