[It is the same to HIVE-15517 [~sterligovak].
Is it right ? [~pxiong], Sounds the same problem. Could u try 2.1.1 and see if it reappears? thanks., [~pxiong]  HIVE-15517 is not fixed on 2.1.1, should we pick it up on branch-2.1?, [~ferhui] ,sorry my bad, it is said that it is fixed in 2.2 while 2.2 has not been published yet..., [~sterligovak] resolve it as duplicate. Please reopen it if it is not fixed]
