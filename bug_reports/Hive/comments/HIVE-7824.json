[We could probably remove the first part of the patch (part of HIVE-7823).  Also do you think it should be more serious level?, I think it might be reasonable to use a higher level but since I don't know everything that will be logged there I think INFO is a decent starting point. That way if somehow this is too verbose it can easily be turned down?, Actually I think you are right. Anything that is caught and rethrown as an ExecException is not something which was expected. Let's do WARN., Thanks, +1,
