[HIVE-4831.1.patch - change to pick a different directory for use by zookeeper mini cluster , Hi,

As opposed to choosing a random directory, I think we should have a little utility method that ensures we are creating a directory which does not exist. Guava's Files.createTmpDir() is google example.

Brock, Thanks for your patch Thejas! This is a small and unobtrusive change so I am generally +1. But I think we should have a deterministic way of getting a new directory as opposed to a random method. Cancelling patch until feedback is addressed., [~brocknoland] Thanks for your feedback.
HIVE-4831.2.patch - I could not use Guava Files.createTempDir as it does not take a baseDir argument, so I added such a function in Utilities.java .
I will mark it patch available after some more testing.
