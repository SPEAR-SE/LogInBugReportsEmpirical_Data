[returnObjectInspector should always be created, otherwise will throw NPE as demonstrated here. Patch which does that. Also, included a test case which fails without patch but passes with the patch., Making Patch Available as ready for review., +1, A lot of tests are failing.

TestContribCliDriver
TestCliDriver  etc.

Please fix them and then resubmit the patch, I think for coalesce it makes sense to have atleast two arguments. It returns first non-null of its argument. If there is zero argument there is nothing to return and if there is one argument it has to return that whether its null or not. I updated the patch to throw exception if there are less then two arguments., But, will this work?
I mean, what happens to:

select coalesce(null, null) from src;, Correct, this still fails for this query. But, if you only have non-null arguments it will fail for any udf not just coalesce. Fixing that requires work in GenericUDFUtils which is used by many functions and thus will be a bigger change and requires more testing. So, I suggest we go ahead with this and open up another ticket which will address the problem of all null arguments for udf., bq. But, if you only have non-null arguments
should be read as But, if you only have all-null argument, @Namit,
Any comment on this one?, Marking Patch Available., +1


running tests, Actually, coalesce returns first non-null argument.
With your patch, coalesce('x') will error out, which is not correct, This is getting worked upon at HIVE-2726 through an alternative approach.]
