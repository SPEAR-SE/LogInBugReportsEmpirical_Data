ATTACHMENT ID: 12768155 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, HIVE-12597 renames many of the same settings and resolves some of the concerns addressed by this patch. I will continue on this after that is committed, otherwise there are too many conflicts. For now, saving a temporary partially-resolved patch., This patch should allow specifying units for these settings (e.g. "4Mb"). This can later be expanded to other settings as needed., [~prasanth_j] can you review? This is a mostly trivial patch (as of the .02 iteration :)). It adds size variables to HiveConf, similar to time variables, and has some test ctor changes to avoid creating configs., +1, The same patch... HiveQA didn't run for whatever reason,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12783213 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to master and branch-2.0 (fixed the test, it was a one-line test change, forgot to switch to new ctor the way I did in other tests)., No doc needed:  The configuration parameter changes in HiveConf.java only introduced SizeValidator() for parameter values.

For the record, these parameters were changed:

* hive.llap.io.allocator.alloc.min
* hive.llap.io.allocator.alloc.max
* hive.llap.io.memory.size]
