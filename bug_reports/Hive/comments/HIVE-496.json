[Fixing another null bug in UDFCaseWhen, UDFDateAdd and UDFDateDiff also can throw similar NullPointerExceptions if the arguments to evaluate() are NULL. Can you verify that all UDFs have a protection against invalid arguments?, Fixed similar problems in all UDFs., looks good. running tests., Thanks Zheng!]
