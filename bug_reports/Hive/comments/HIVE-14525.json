[The "loggy kind of lines" contains the query, which is the subject of the other issue., ok.  lemme back up for a sec.

would people agree with me that stdout is reserved for *results* and stderr is where everything else goes? like info, debug, errors and warnings and anything else that comes up?  This is especially relevant for csv and tsv style output (machine readable.) for pretty output with ascii art around the results (human readable) it isn't quite as critical.

i'm curious if there is disagreement here.

for context i'd like to create a tsv file and i'd like to use beeline. :)    i suppose the de-facto method would be to use insert overwrite [local] directory and rsync the thing back to the cient - but i was hoping i could do it all through beeline.
, The prompt and other debug info is echoed to stdout only if --silent=true is not set.
These are supressed if on commandline -f file AND --silent=true are present.

Beeline cannot detect command line output redirection. , good to know. thanks.

>The prompt and other debug info is echoed to stdout

     that's what i have a problem with - stdout.  instead, i submit beeline should echo that stuff to stderr.    I want to see to progress and all the log info -  that's great stuff to have - it just can't be to stdout where *results* go!   pretty sure is standard linux etiquette.  I'm not crazy! :o, The ConsoleReader class should not echo back to stdout when consuming a line with readLine method.

If ! isSlilent we echo it back with .info() method with prompt.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12824871 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Missing spaces. See review., Will not pass existing tests with verifyCMD method., Hi Miklos,
Thanks for the quick work on patching this up!

I haven't had a chance yet to look at your patch yet but that said i did encounter some other twists wrt to reading from stdin - and then what happens on stdout.  Figured it be good to get your thoughts.


case #1.  -f switch.   consistent with above problem i described.  you may have fixed this though it is using the -f switch and not stdin in this case.
{quote}
    $ cat test.sql
select
"foo",
"bar"
;
   $  beeline -u dwrdevnn1 --showheader=false --outputformat=tsv2 >stdout 2>stderr -f test.sql    #-f switch
   $ cat stdout
0: jdbc:hive2://dwrdevnn1.sv2.trulia.com:1000> select
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> "foo",
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> "bar"
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> ;
foo     bar
0: jdbc:hive2://dwrdevnn1.sv2.trulia.com:1000>
0: jdbc:hive2://dwrdevnn1.sv2.trulia.com:1000>

case #2 . stdin  .  In this case EVEN THE REAL OUTPUT has ". . . . . ."  in front of it - unlike case #1 above.

{quote}
$ echo -e 'select\n"foo",\n"bar"' |  beeline -u dwrdevnn1 --showheader=false --outputformat=tsv2 >stdout 2>stderr
0: jdbc:hive2://dwrdevnn1.sv2.trulia.com:1000> select
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> "foo",
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> "bar"
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> foo      bar
0: jdbc:hive2://dwrdevnn1.sv2.trulia.com:1000>
{quote}

case #3   -  when beeline run from cron (or in a case where there is no tty)  I simulate this by ssh'ing to localhost and running query.

{quote}
$ cat test1.sh
#!/bin/bash
beeline -u dwrdevnn1 --showheader=false --outputformat=tsv2 >stdout 2>stderr <<SQL
select
"foo",
"bar"
;
SQL

$ ssh localhost "test1.sh"

$ cat stdout
0: jdbc:hive2://dwrdevnn1.sv2.trulia.com:1000> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> foo        bar
0: jdbc:hive2://dwrdevnn1.sv2.trulia.com:1000>

(all newlines are gone. and the echo'ing of the actual SQL is missing - so all you get are the two different kinds of prefixes. )

i'll review you patch probably tomorrow but wanted to get you this information now.  case #3 (running from cron) is the kicker we just ran into today.

thanks again Miklos.
