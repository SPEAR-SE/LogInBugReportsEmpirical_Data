[To avoid any performance issues, the SERDE modifications will not support embedded record delimiters in quoted strings . For example if the source data uses newline (UTF-8 0x0a) as the record delimiter, the modifications will not do anything specifically to handle that - nor will they  disallow it. 

As handling of embedded record delimiters requires changes to the underlying input format, I am not proposing to handle embedded record delimiters with these modifications. , Initial patch for changes

Adds 4 new properties to LazySimpleSerde

"field.doublequotes.as.quote" (true/false - default false)
"field.rtrim"; - (true/false - default false)
"field.ltrim" - (true/false - default false)

and uses "quote.delim" to specify quote

Currently support is for read only and applies to CHAR, VARCHAR and STRING inside in CSV style data

ltrim and rtrim options will allow both string and non string data to be parsed correctly when leading or trailing spaces or tabs are present. For strings ltrim/rstrim will skip whitespace either side of quotes if quote enclosures are being used.
