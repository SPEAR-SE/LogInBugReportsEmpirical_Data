ATTACHMENT ID: 12782506 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, None of the test failures here are related or regressions. [~alangates], could you please take a quick look at this patch?, +1, Committed to master. Will port other branches soon., [~sushanth], you also ported this to branch-1.0 and branch-1.1 so shouldn't releases 1.0.2 and 1.1.2 be added to Fix Version/s?

AFAIK that's the only way to keep track of all the dot releases., Agreed. I was going to verify if it should have been 1.0.2 or 1.0.3 , and 1.1.2 or 1.1.3, and so didn't update then. Doing so now., Should we put a table of releases on the Downloads page?  (I've been thinking of listing all the releases and branches in the wiki, but the Downloads page is more likely to be updated in a timely manner.), Not a bad idea. I typically go to https://hive.apache.org/downloads.html to get this info. Having that be a table rather than a list we scan through will be more useful as we have more of a release history, as we're starting to have., Just adding some info so other people don't have to go through all the effort I did to find this JIRA. Hopefully it will make it easier to find when you google "CVE-2015-7521"
