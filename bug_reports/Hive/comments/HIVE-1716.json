[I tried debugging this one yesterday and noticed that if I kill the scribed daemon, then the test works.  Is it possible that a zookeeper-enabled scribe running on the machines in question is causing port conflicts?  Try running on a freshly restarted machine to confirm.

, I confirmed that this is due to a conflict with ports opened by existing services; I'm adding a patch which makes the test ports dynamic., https://reviews.apache.org/r/385/

Note that I did not make the zookeeper ports dynamic since we have not seen an issue there yet, but we may need to do that as a followup if we hit it.
, looks good to me, Committed. Thanks John]
