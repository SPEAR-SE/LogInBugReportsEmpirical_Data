[preliminary patch. Need to set up cluster to test this (and later remove logging), haven't done so far, Nm, it iterates work graph incorrectly on review now. , Will attach updated patch today which fixes the issue and also another one with NPE in getSplits, patch that provides files to AM and vertices, and also makes sure correct configs are set to avoid NPE. 
The part for AM may change in response to better Tez APIs..., Updated patch. Note that this depends on a feature in yet-unreleased Tez 0.4; if that ships first I will update pom, otherwise it will be split into two patches. We will commit restart-AM path here, and relocalize path separately in Hive 0.14,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12637961, Pacth with the test. Test with one of the Tez's own files (or guava, which is what I tried first) passes. However, the conflict test fails, so it's not really valid. DAG passes despite having guava-named, or tez-named, bogus jar added to resources. 
Given that I saw it work in cluster I wonder if some test setup issues are causing this. Do you guys have an idea? I will look tomorrow otherwise., Splitting the patch; this part has the original workaround and doesn't depend on new tez apis, this is the diff btw https://reviews.apache.org/r/19789/,
