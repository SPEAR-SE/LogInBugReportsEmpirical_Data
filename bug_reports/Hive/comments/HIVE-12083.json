ATTACHMENT ID: 12765951 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The patch looks good to me. Thanks for adding the tests! +1

I have two follow up questions, which could be addressed in separate jiras -
1. Should we short circuit for empty partitions case as well in the client side ?
2. Does the case where table has not partition columns also use the getAggrColStatsFor method ? If that is the case we should not be shortcircuting this way. [~ashutoshc], > Should we short circuit for empty partitions case as well in the client side ?

I think that makes sense and we should. I didn't initially because I hadn't evaluated the calling codepath to see if there was a difference between a null return and an empty return for AggrStats from the HMSC for the empty partNames case. Now that I've looked through that in some detail, I am for it. I will update the patch.

> Does the case where table has not partition columns also use the getAggrColStatsFor method ? If that is the case we should not be shortcircuting this way.

I thought of that, but irrespective of whether the client short-circuits, the metastore server will short circuit anyway, it's only a matter of a difference between returning null and an empty object., Spoke to ashutosh about this - going to make one more change - in addition to the short-circuit on the client side, the desired behaviour on the client side would also be to return an empty AggrStats rather than returning null., Patch updated.,
