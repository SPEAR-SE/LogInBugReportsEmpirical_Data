ATTACHMENT ID: 12826941 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~jdere] [~prasanth_j] ping?, Looks like rollMasterKey() normally seems to be called automatically by some daemon thread for the non-llap case .. is that something that can be done for llap too or do things work differently in the llap case?, I'm not sure why HS2 calls it automatically. It should not be needed - ZK key manager has its own background threads.
[~thejas] [~sushanth] do you know why rollMasterKey is called?, [~jdere] I think we can address this in separate JIRA if it's an issue, anyway. The patch itself should fix the problem., [~ashutoshc] do you remember this stuff? Why does HS2 have to call rollMasterKey explicitly, when the ZK key manager is supposed to do it itself?, +1, Committed. Thanks for the review!]
