[HIVE-7003.1.patch - did the switch in "swtich" !
cc [~leftylev]
, Thanks Thejas.  (Big grin from the nitpicker.), [~leftylev] Can you please do an explicit +1 :)
Thanks for catching this, having typos in README does not look good!
, +1  (a switch in time saves nine), Patch committed to trunk. (Don't think its necessary to wait further for this typo fix!)
Thanks for the review and the humor Lefty!
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
