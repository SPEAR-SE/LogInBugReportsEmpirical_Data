[We have a few tickets open, we really need to move all this stuff to a real parser so we can properly deal with things like ';' or comments like this or whatever. It is painfully hard to work around all these type of things and we never get to the root of the problem., sqlline (see my notes in HIVE-987) deals with comments correctly in a fairly simple fashion., avoiding the issue by removing comments., @iryoung: I think it's going to be really hard to make a regex work for this purpose.

{code:java}
  private String removeComment(String line) {
      return line.replaceFirst("--.+$","").trim();
  }
{code}

This regex is going to mangle SQL such as the following:

{code:sql}
SELECT a, '--' FROM tab;
{code}
