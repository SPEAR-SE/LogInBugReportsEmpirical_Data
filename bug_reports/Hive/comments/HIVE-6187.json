[It's working on trunk., Weird. The Hive we're using is provided in CDH 4.5.0-1.cdh4.5.0.p0.30 from Cloudera., I can confirm that this functionality is currently working on trunk, and also that it's broken in the 0.12.0 release. I'm not sure when it was fixed, and there doesn't appear to be any test coverage that will prevent someone from breaking it again in the future.
