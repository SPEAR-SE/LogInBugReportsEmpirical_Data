ATTACHMENT ID: 12638168, This patch seems to do nothing, since it adds a test that is marked ignore.  Also it appears to reference an internal bug number in the ignore statement., [~alangates] You misread the patch.  It removes the method with Ignore annotation, thus the 'super' of it will actually run with ORC, Thanks Eugene for correcting my misread of the patch.  Patch checked in., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
