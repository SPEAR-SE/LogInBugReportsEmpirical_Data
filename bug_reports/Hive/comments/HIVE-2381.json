[I have executed this scenario 
select id from sampletable where id > 100;  
sampletable contains id's < 100 so  my result set is empty and when i try resultset.next() it is not throwing any exception.    

Can u post what is the scenario., Excuse me for my poor English..

I experienced the same error when I used JDBC Driver through Pentaho Report Designer 'Preview'.

Maybe, below is error occuring point.

    } catch (HiveServerException e) {
      if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) { // error code == 0 means reached the EOF
        return false;
      } else {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving next row", e);
      }
    }

In Pentaho Report Designer, Users can set Max Preview Row.
So I set the max preview row number smaller than the actual row number the hive table had, 
then the error did'nt occured.
But when I didn't set the max preview row number, always the error occured.
I think the HiveQueryResultSet class's 'next' method can't recognize EOF.
