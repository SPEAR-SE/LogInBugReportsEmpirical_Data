As a note Hive should be offering a src only release and a convenience binary rather than two binaries, one with the source and one without.  See the thread on general@incubator discussing this:  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201203.mbox/%3CCAOFYJNY%3DEjVHrWVvAedR3OKwCv-BkTaCbEu0ufp7OZR_gpCTiA%40mail.gmail.com%3E  I think this can be solved later and need not block this release.
