[[~gangtimliu] I would love to hear your thoughts on this! Thanks in advance!, [~mgrover]

I am a little confused. Please correct me. The current logic is not restrictive. 

For example, it is legal for the following case: 
set hive.mapred.supports.subdirectories=true;
set mapred.input.dir.recursive=true;
set hive.optimize.listbucketing=false;, Hi [~gangtimliu], really sorry for dropping the ball on this. I do see what you mean by the legal cases but is it legal to do this:
{code}
set hive.mapred.supports.subdirectories=false;
set mapred.input.dir.recursive=true;
set hive.optimize.listbucketing=false;
{code}
, Hi [~mgrover]

No problem.

Not sure it is valid if mapred.input.dir.recursive is true but hive.mapred.supports.subdirectories is false.

cc [~namitjain] would you please confirm?
