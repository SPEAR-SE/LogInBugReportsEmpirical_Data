ATTACHMENT ID: 12846093 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Looks good. There's some TODO which would need to be removed. Haven't looked at this from a synchronization / thread visibility perspective., Ping?, Don't see a new patch / comment since my last comment... ?, I can remove TODOs on commit. I was assuming "Haven't looked at this from a synchronization / thread visibility perspective." was why there was no +1 yet :), +1, after removing the TODOs, Committed to master.]
