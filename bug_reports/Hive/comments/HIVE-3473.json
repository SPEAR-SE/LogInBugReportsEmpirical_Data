[I have also seen this test failing inconsistently. It passes on same machine in one run, but may fail on another run. Also, apache junkins build server also reports this test failing inconsistently., Unable to reproduce this failure in isolation.  Ashutosh reports no repros when running the full suite, nor has this failure been seen in the last ~dozen jenkins builds, since build #2028.
Will keep watching for another occurrence, but otherwise not actively investigating.]
