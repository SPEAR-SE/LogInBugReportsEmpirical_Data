[In current implementation "select distinct a,b,c" is silently translate to "select a,b,c group by a,b,c". So "select distinct *" is translate to "select * group by *". But * is not handled correctly when processing the GroupBy expressions. Should add some checking when translating select distinct to group by. , A simple patch to notify user that select distinct * is not supported at present., We found "select distinct * " very useful when removing duplicate rows in a table. But It's often a big headache to write down all column names in distinct statement when there're many columns. I created another bug for supporting this feature and supplied a patch waiting for comments. @Namit Would you like to provide some suggestions to my solution?, Dupe of HIVE-3199]
