ATTACHMENT ID: 12704842 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~xuefuz] , [~csun] could you review the change and commit it if looks fine? Thanks, Patch looks fine. However, I don't quite understand why we are also removing the following:
{code}
-  CONSTRAINT `PARTITIONS_FK2` FOREIGN KEY (`SD_ID`) REFERENCES `SDS` (`SD_ID`),
...
-  CONSTRAINT `TBLS_FK2` FOREIGN KEY (`DB_ID`) REFERENCES `DBS` (`DB_ID`),
{code}

This doesn't seem related to LINK_TARGET_ID., I think it's just removing the ending ',' , not removing the complete line., Got it. +1, I wonder if a upgrade script is needed for this change as well. For an example, if the user is using HIVE-1.1.0 with Mysql and his TBLS and PARTITIONS table definition have this column, though the data for these columns might be null. But when he upgrades to HIVE-1.20 with this change and migrates the existing data of these tables to the new ones, will you see the issue?, Here is my plan: I will find a way to check if the two tables have LINK_TARGE_ID column or not, if have it, I will drop the column. Is that a safe plan? Thanks, [~ychena], do you know when this column was introduced in the script? If we leave as it's, what's the side-effect of it? Thanks., This column is introduced by 0.10.0 only for mysql, this inconsistency cause some customers that upgrade from 0.9 versions worried. The
side-effect other than uncomfortable is some migrate issues as Chaoyu said. For better supportability, we'd better fix it in the future releases. , New patch with drop columns from old version if exist. Please review.  Thanks,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12705423 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~ctang.ma] ,[~aihuaxu] or [~xuefuz] could you review the changes? Thanks, [~ctang.ma], what's your thought on the latest patch?, +1 (non-binding). Now Hive 1.2.0, whether is freshly installed or upgraded from previous version, should be in sync in term of LINK_TARGET_ID column in TBLS/PARTITIONS tables., +1, Thanks, Chaoyu!, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Yongzhi., Thank you [~xuefuz] & [~ctang.ma], This change breaks schematool upgrade - See HIVE-10614, I think the change here was in the right direction, however it breaks the preferred way to upgrade hive (using schematool). This is a release blocker for 1.2.0. .
A patch to revert the changes here has been uploaded to  HIVE-10614 . I think we should go ahead with that, and reopen this jira after it is committed. Once the schematool/beeline breakage is fixed, this change can go back into hive. 

, As this patch has not gone into a release, it is easier to track the issue by reopening this jira.
Closing HIVE-10635, As mentioned in HIVE-10635 -
In HIVE-10614, we had to revert HIVE-7018 because it was not schematool compatible and it would prevent upgrade from 0.14.0 to 1.3.0 when run via schematool. We need to redo HIVE-7018 work once the script introduced for HIVE-7018 is schematool compliant., Need code review. , From what is described in HIVE-10614, the schematool can not support stored procedure with compound statements which is the only way to support if statement. For mysql does not support drop column if exists, so now what I can do is assuming the LINK_TARGET_ID is in the old version DB(which should be true). Attached HIVE-7018.3.patch is the best I can do. How do you think  [~thejas] and [~hsubramaniyan] ? Thanks,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12731966 - PreCommit-HIVE-METASTORE-Test, Hi [~ychena] I have made changes to support mysql Stored procedures via schematool in HIVE-10659 . Once HIVE-10659 goes in, I believe your initial fix for this jira can be rebased and merged into master. I am not sure if patch#3 is sufficient here.

Thanks
Hari, [~hsubramaniyan], thanks for the information. I will remove patch#3. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12731966 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build,  Now that HIVE-10659 is committed, it should be possible to get this one in without breaking schematool upgrade. [~ychena] Can you please rebase the original patch and provide it for master, 1.2.1 branches. [~sushanth] Can you please make note of this jira for 1.2.1 inclusion.

Thanks
Hari, I think we should not have this for branch-1.2, since there are metastore schema changes (even if it is mysql-only), so as to not have schema differences between 1.2.0 and 1.2.1.

It should be okay for master though., [~hsubramaniyan] and [~sushanth], I attached HIVE-7018.3.patch for review. This is for master. Thanks.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12734314 - PreCommit-HIVE-METASTORE-Test, [~ctang.ma], could you review the change? Thanks, [~ychena] have you verified that it works with SchemaTool with [~hsubramaniyan] HIVE-10659 fix?, [~ctang.ma], I tested my script with schematool, it works fine. And the patch passed the precommit build for metastore, so I think it is well tested. Thanks, +1, Thanks [~ychena] for the patch, it has been committed to 1.3.0 (branch-1). But I think you also need create a separate patch for 2.0.0 (master branch)., Patch 4 for master (2.0.0), Hive Chaoyu, I attached HIVE-7018.4.patch for 2.0.0  Thanks,
