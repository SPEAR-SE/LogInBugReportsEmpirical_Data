[[~brocknoland], I am wondering what this test was trying to assert, that 2011-1-1 should be invalid to Hive?  Hive uses java.sql.Date to parse dates, so whatever is valid to Date, is valid for Hive, in the implementation.

It doesn't seem like we should make it invalid on purpose for backward compatibility, now that Java7 supports dates of this format.  So I am wondering is this JIRA asking to find an equally invalid date format for Java6/7 for this test then, or remove it?, Perhaps we can just remove this test. Looks like date_literal3.q has us covered:

https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/test/queries/clientnegative/date_literal1.q
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/test/queries/clientnegative/date_literal3.q

[~jdere] any preference here?, No preference, you can go ahead and remove it., Sounds good, thanks.,
