[As we have released with support in HiveConf, we should continue to support its use there. After this proposed changes is implemented, we can stop documenting the HiveConf usage.
, [~vikram.dixit] [~thejas] Do you think we can have this for 14? , I think we should include it in 0.14. This is a safe backward compatible change, and it would be good to start supporting the right format.
, Fixed a misplaced comment., +1
Thanks for fixing this before more users start using the deprecated format!
, +1 for 0.14,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12673851, [~thejas] I don't think the test failure is related, but since all tests are not running, I'm not sure if this should be committed yet. 
Although I do see all the test from the following packages pass:
{code}
org.apache.hive.jdbc	
org.apache.hive.jdbc.authorization	
org.apache.hive.jdbc.miniHS2	
org.apache.hive.minikdc	
org.apache.hive.service	
org.apache.hive.service.auth		
org.apache.hive.service.cli		
org.apache.hive.service.cli.operation		
org.apache.hive.service.cli.session		
org.apache.hive.service.cli.thrift		
org.apache.hive.service.server
{code}

I doubt if the patch affects any other tests., Yes, those packages should have all tests that can be affected by this change. I think we can go ahead and commit.
, Patch committed to 14 and trunk as all of the tests for jdbc/HiveServer2 seem to be running . Thanks for reviewing [~thejas]!, Sorry missed out adding "reviewed by". , What documentation does this need?  Suggestions:

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Connection URL When Hive Server2 Is Running in HTTP Mode | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-ConnectionURLWhenHiveServer2IsRunninginHTTPMode]
* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Connection URL When SSL Is Enabled in HiveServer2 | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-ConnectionURLWhenSSLIsEnabledinHiveServer2]
* [Setting Up HiveServer2 -- Running in HTTP mode | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Setting+Up+HiveServer2#SettingUpHiveServer2-RunninginHTTPmode]

Also, how about a release note?, [~leftylev] Just added the release note in the description (wasn't able to format the release note text box properly)., Very thorough release note, thanks [~vgumashta].  Should the release note field point to the description, or will people just look there anyway?, [~leftylev] Done. Thanks again!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
, I just documented this in the wiki on both pages [~leftylev] mentioned.]
