[Could you provide the query which induces the situation you've described?, 1. The query can be simplied like this:
Select * from 
(select   *  from   TableA  Union all select * from TableB)  a
2.  TableA and TableB is consists of other select query.  
3.  And I set the hive parameter is : 
set hive.auto.convert.join=false;
set hive.optimize.skewjoin = true;
set hive.skewjoin.key = 500000;
set hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize=50000000;

, The problem is ,the union operate will be resolved two steps(A,B). The two steps have one child steps(C) ,C will aggregate A and B steps.
And in skew join condition task , c will be selected without any check that its parent steps(A,B) have been completed.]
