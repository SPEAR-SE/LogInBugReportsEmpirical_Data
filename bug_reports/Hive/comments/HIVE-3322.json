[The configuration property hive.mapred.mode currently controls the following behaviors:

{quote}
The mode in which the hive operations are being performed. 	
In strict mode, some risky queries are not allowed to run. They include:	

* Cartesian Product.	
* No partition being picked up for a query.	
* Comparing bigints and strings.	
* Comparing bigints and doubles.	
* Orderby without limit.	
* Buckets are not a multiple of each other in the tabled being joined, and the user asked for bucketed mapjoin.

Users should have the option of enabling/disabling strict mode individually for each of these operation types. They should also have the option of a enabling a global strict mode that controls all of these properties by setting hive.enable.global.strict.mode=true.
, I have to say I thought about this but having one var for each feature does not seem that attractive to me either. It is also a migration headache, like if you are depending on mapred.strict.mode to warn of Cartesian products and we introduce a new variable the user is no longer protected., Should we have a hierarchical configurable options ?

hive.mapred.mode has the behavior as Carl mentioned above. The defaults for this parameter should be such that they are
acceptable to a wide variety of users. However, the user should have the option to overwrite each operation individually.]
