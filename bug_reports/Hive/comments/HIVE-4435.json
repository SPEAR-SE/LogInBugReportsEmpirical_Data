[The fix is to use hash functions that are pairwise independent. More on pairwise independence and family of hash functions - http://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/COURSE/S12/handouts/lec5.pdf, review board: https://reviews.apache.org/r/10841/, Attached plot of relative error vs. number of distinct values after the fix. 
Dataset: TPC-H of varying sizes up to 10TB
hive.stats.ndv.error = 5% (standard error for the estimator)
Column types: String, Long, Double, Can a committer take a look at this?, Ping :), Sorry for the delay. +1 Will commit if tests pass., Thanks Ashutosh!, Following tests failed: 
* compute_stats_double.q
* compute_stats_long.q
* compute_stats_string.q

I am assuming since we have better estimates now, we just need to update .q.out files for these. Can you verify and if so can you update the patch with it?, Canceling patch since current patch is resulting in test failures., [~ashutoshc]: I've updated the .q files in the patches. Thanks!, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Shreepadma!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2132 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2132/])
