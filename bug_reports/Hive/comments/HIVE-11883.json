ATTACHMENT ID: 12764174 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 
Although it doesn't cover mixed case {{TRANSACTIONAL}} I believe that is rare., committed to branch-1 and master.  Thanks [~ashutoshc] for the review, Doc note:  The "Table Properties" section of the Hive Transactions wikidoc needs to be updated for this change, with version information.

* [Hive Transactions -- Table Properties | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions#HiveTransactions-TableProperties]

The DDL wikidoc doesn't need any change -- it just shows lowercase "transactional" and refers to Hive Transactions for more information.  (However it does need revision for HIVE-8308, which made "NO_AUTO_COMPACTION" case-insensitive in 1.1.0.)]
