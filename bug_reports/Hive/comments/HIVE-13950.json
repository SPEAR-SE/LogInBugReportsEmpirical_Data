[I think I found the source of this infinite loop. I edited the beeline executable like the following:

{noformat}

. "$bin"/hive --service beeline "$@"
{noformat}
In addition, by commenting the lines I  also solved a bad access to the command history. When pressing arrows "up" and "down" was giving me this:
{noformat}

{noformat}, I think this JIRA is partially solved with Hive 2.1.0. Its also related to the following ticket: 
- [HIVE-12834|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12834]
, Hi [~BigDataOrange] Wondering if this is similar to HIVE-14049. Is this issue fixed or still reproducible?]
