[Can you combine HIVE-2042, HIVE-2043, HIVE-2044 and HIVE-2046 patches into single one? Because all of them are trying to fix opened streams in error scenarios. That would ease reviewing and testing as well., Sure Amareshwari, I uploaded a patch by combining these issues HIVE-2042, HIVE-2043, HIVE-2044 and HIVE-2046 into one patch.

Next time onwards i will logically group the comments and i will upload the patch., Looks good to me.

@Amareshwari, what do you think ?, Looks fine to me also., Running tests. Will commit if tests pass., I just committed this. Thanks Chinna.]
