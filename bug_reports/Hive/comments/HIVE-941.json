[Not sure if it's related or not, but HIVE-765 is another bug relating to the hive server failing., Thanks Bill. I linked HIVE-765 as part of this JIRA. They are not exactly the same issue, but I'll attached a new patch for both issues shortly., Hive-941_2.patch fixes both HIVE-765 and HIVE-941., Committed. Thanks Ning]
