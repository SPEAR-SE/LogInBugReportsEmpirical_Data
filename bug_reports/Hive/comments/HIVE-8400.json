[[~gopalv] , can you take a look at this?
Thanks!, [~vikram.dixit] Could you please take a look at this ?
, [~pankit]: Is this intended as a fix for 0.13.2 or 0.14?

When I run {{hive --service hwi}} it prints out {{ls: cannot access ... /dist/hive/lib/hive-hwi-*.war}}., I think this should go into 0.13.2 since this is something that is broken. Correct me if I am wrong., This patch fixes this issue by modifying the pom.xml files for hwi and packaging modules. The hwi jar file is still built and packaged but instead under the 'classes' maven classifier.,
