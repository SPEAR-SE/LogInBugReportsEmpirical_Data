[In addition to be defined in one place, they should be case insensitive.  Right now transactional has to be lower case, and NO_AUTO_COMPACT has to be upper case., This patch moves the constants into hive_metastoreConstants.  Since everything in there is lower case, it moves NO_AUTO_COMPACT to lower case.  For backwards compatibility, it will still accept it in upper case.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12680321 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Alan!, Doc note:  Case insensitivity needs to be documented (with version information) in the Transactions doc and the Create Table section of the DDL doc.
