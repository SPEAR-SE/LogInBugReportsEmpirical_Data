ATTACHMENT ID: 12778540 - PreCommit-HIVE-SPARK-Build, [~jxiang], [~szehon], could you help review the patch? The test result looks good. I tested the patch with Kerberosed HBase and it worked. Thanks., +1 lgtm.  One question about the log message, I might be not understanding it, but are these properties from hbase configuration file instead of hive configuration?, Good catch. Yes. It's hbase configuration. I'll change the log message., Committed to Spark branch. Thanks for the review, Szehon.]
