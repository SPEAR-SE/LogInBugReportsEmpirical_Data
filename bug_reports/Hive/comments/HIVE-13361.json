[Ideally we want, compression buffer size stored in stripe footer instead of file footer which can enable concatenating files of different buffer sizes. For now, we can add an option to writer to enforce the requested buffer size instead of estimating it for concatenation use case. , This patch needs the attached orc file. This orc file is generated before HIVE-11807 with around 30 columns with 256KB buffer size. Same file if created after HIVE-11807 will have 128KB buffer size. , [~gopalv] Could you please review the patch? It's mostly test diff., If the approach looks good I will commit the orc binary file first so that it will be available for precommit test run., LGTM - +1.

I like the new log line, that makes sense to log the buffer sizes on the writer., Not sure why precommit did not pick up the patch. Reuploading again.,
