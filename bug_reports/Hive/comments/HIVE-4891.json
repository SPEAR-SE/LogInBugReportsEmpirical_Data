[I suspect there are some funny issues when partitions are not the same format, this is a newish feature and we may not have as much coverage as we need., I am not able to reproduce. Tried the scenario below, get correct results. 
Can you provide us details on how to reproduce.

{noformat}
CREATE TABLE part( 
    p_partkey INT,
    p_name STRING,
    p_mfgr STRING,
    p_brand STRING,
    p_type STRING,
    p_size INT,
    p_container STRING,
    p_retailprice DOUBLE,
    p_comment STRING
) 
;
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '.../hive/data/files/part_tiny.txt' overwrite into table part;

CREATE TABLE part_partitioned( 
    p_partkey INT,
    p_name STRING,
    p_mfgr STRING,
    p_brand STRING,
    p_type STRING,
    p_size INT,
    p_container STRING,
    p_retailprice DOUBLE,
    p_comment STRING
) 
PARTITIONED BY (ds string);

alter table part_partitioned add partition(ds='2010');
alter table part_partitioned partition(ds='2010') set fileformat sequencefile;
-- have to do this, otherwise sets partition's format to textinputformat
alter table part_partitioned  set fileformat sequencefile;
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE part_partitioned PARTITION (ds='2010') 
SELECT * from part;

alter table part_partitioned add partition(ds='2011');
alter table part_partitioned partition(ds='2011') set fileformat rcfile;
-- have to do this, otherwise sets partition's format to textinputformat
alter table part_partitioned  set fileformat rcfile;
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE part_partitioned PARTITION (ds='2011') 
SELECT * from part;

-- tried these, give the right results
select distinct p_mfgr from part_partitioned where (ds='2010' or ds='2011') and p_size < 10;
select distinct p_name from part_partitioned where (ds='2010' or ds='2011');
{noformat}, This could not be reproduced with more recent hive. Marking it as cannot reproduce. 

Fengdong, Please let us know if you feel that there is anything missing in the steps followed by Harish, or if you are able to reproduce the issue with hive 0.12 branch or trunk.
