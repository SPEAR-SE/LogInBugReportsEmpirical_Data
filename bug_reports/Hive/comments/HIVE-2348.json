[Hi,

The same query is not working in oracle and it is throwing below message

 Error: ORA-00904: "SUMCL_FLOOR": invalid identifier

But same query is working fine in MySql

This type of queries should support in HIVE?
because in oracle it is not working and mysql it is working (Need some suggestions)

Here problem may be the column alias. This query is not throwing any exception..

select offer, level_id, sum_cl_score FROM xxx GROUP BY offer, level_id, sum_cl_score ORDER BY offer, level_id, sum_cl_score limit 1000000;

Column Alias with group by is failing :

select offer, level_id, sum_cl_score as sumcl_floor FROM xxx GROUP BY offer, level_id, sumcl_floor limit 1000000;

FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: Line 1:89 Invalid table alias or column reference 'sumcl_floor': (possible column names are: offer, level_id, sum_cl_score)

Column Alias with order by is passing :

select offer, level_id, sum_cl_score as sumcl_floor FROM xxx ORDER BY offer, level_id, sumcl_floor limit 1000000;, @Chinna
Thank you for looking. My problem is compounded because we are using multiple catalogs at times so many tables and columns are aliased. So I can not just drop aliases because then I would get failures with ambiguous column references :) From an end user prospective this makes things difficult., @Edward
For above use case you can change the query like this it will work. No need to drop the aliases

select offer, level_id, sum_cl_score as sumcl_floor
FROM xxx
GROUP BY offer, level_id, sum_cl_score 
ORDER BY offer, level_id, sumcl_floor limit 1000000;]
