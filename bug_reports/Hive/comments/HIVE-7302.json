[.1 has a draft.

2 things:

a) [~vikram.dixit] is this the right place to disable?
b) we need a way to test this. I am considering adding autoparallelism to the explain plan - maybe just the extended one. So we can add some tests to make sure this doesn't break., I discussed this with Gopal today and I think that is the right place to replace it. I tested this on the bucket map join tests I am currently modifying and getting the right behavior.

Showing this info in the explain extended plan is a good idea. One issue would be if during execution we actually change the number of reducers in tez, the number shown may not have any real meaning apart from saying there was an estimation.,
