[cc [~ekoifman] , Looked into this a little deeper and realized that HIVE-13335 changed {{TxnStore.TIMED_OUT_TXN_ABORT_BATCH_SIZE}} from 1000 to 50000. The test {{TestDbTxnManager.testLockTimeout}} is using this value to create 50017 locks and waiting for some time so that they expire. This is causing the test batch to time-out since it takes very long time. The test batch timeout currently is 40 min and it takes a lot longer than that., Attaching the patch to fix the test. We don't really need to change the debug message in TxnHandler to log lockInfo to trace. With this patch the log file generated is 80 MB and the runtime of the test is ~110 sec. Both the disk space and runtime are reasonable., Just to give one more data point if we change the debug message to trace the hive.log reduces from 80 MB to 4 MB. So may be worth to consider changing that too. [~ekoifman] Can you please review?, +1 I'm pretty sure logging could be reduced too :),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12856030 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Changing the log level for LockInfo objects in TxnHandler to trace as per [~sershe] comment above. , Hi [~spena] or [~sershe] Can you please commit this patch soon? Right now each pre-commit run is persisting about 30 GB of logs and the disk space may run out again soon., Pushed to master. Thanks, Vihang!]
