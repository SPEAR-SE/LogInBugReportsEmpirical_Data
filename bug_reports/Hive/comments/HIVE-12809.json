ATTACHMENT ID: 12782629 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~mmccline]: can you take a look at this patch? This is aimed at keeping noNulls=true if at least 1 column fed into a coalesce is a constant., +1. The initial noNulls set for the common case is kind of a separate change from the first-column shortcut, right?, Yes, two invariants.

If any column has noNulls, the final output has no Nulls
If first column is non-null & repeating, the final output is the first column + isRepeating retained., Yeah, just wanted to make sure I understand the patch correctly. +1 still :), Pushed to master & branch-2.0, thanks [~sershe]
