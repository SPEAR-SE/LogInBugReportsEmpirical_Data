[In addition to fixing the bug mentioned in the issue description it also introduces an enhancement that makes the sasl.qop parameter in the JDBC URL optional. When specified it'll try to connect to the server with the specified QOP, when not specified it'll negotiate with the server to find a server supported QOP.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12724832 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I got exact the same 16 failures when I did other precommit tests, so the test failures are not related to the patch. , [~ychena] or [~aihuaxu] So if that is the case can you please review the patch and let me know if any changes are needed?, + [~xuefuz] to review. Seems Xuefu did some work on this., [~mkazia] Regarding "JDBC driver ignores the SASL.QOP", is this a known issue or a limitation of the driver? Would the driver work the same with/without oozie? Can you show any doc/reference on that?

 , [~aihuaxu] If you are going to use the Hive JDBC driver from any framework that relies on Delegation tokens to authenticate to HS2 that has SASL.QOP to set to anything other than "auth" you'll have this issue. In my case it just happened to be oozie. Yes the driver would work the same with or without oozie. I have not seen any hive docs that says that QOP should not be set for DIGEST authentication mechanism. AFAIK Java supports QOP on DIGEST authentication mechanism, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/ldap/security/sasl.html., The Hive wiki only mentions QOP in two places:

* [Setting Up HiveServer2 -- Integrity/Confidentiality Protection | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Setting+Up+HiveServer2#SettingUpHiveServer2-Integrity/ConfidentialityProtection]
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop], Seems like a reasonable patch.

+1, +1, Committed to master. Thanks, Mubashir!, Thanks [~xuefuz]. 
[~leftylev] Do we need clarity on the language in the current documentation that says QOP is supported only for Kerberos authentication? Do we consider delegation token authentication in Kerberos enabled HS2/HMS as Kerberos authentication or pure Kerberos service ticket based authentication as Kerberos authentication?, bq.  Do we need clarity on the language in the current documentation ...

This question is beyond my technical knowledge.  Can someone else answer?  (See the doc links a few comments back.), [~mkazia], please feel free to update the doc., [~mkazia], you'll need wiki write privilege:
