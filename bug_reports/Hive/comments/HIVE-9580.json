[The issue is caused by: we always assume that the join keys have the same data type and save the one from the first table, then apply it when we serialize and deserialize the hashtables to/from files.

It causes the issue when dealing with varchar datatypes. In table A, the column could be varchar(10) while in table B it could be varchar(20). Some times we write the incorrect data to the files if the varchar length of the first table is small.

[~szehon] You have worked on join. I'm thinking that we should always choose the one with the largest length. When joining types like smallint and int, we should choose int. , Seems Hive can handle the join over any kind of data types. , For join on varchar or char columns, currently we don't implicitly convert the keys since they are of the same type with different lengths. While during the query run-time, we assume all the keys are of the same type and will also choose the first one as the type to be used to parse all the keys, which are causing the issue.

The patch applies the the common type for all the keys even all the keys are of the same type. Also change a type comparison to use equals() rather than ==.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12724233 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Attached the new patch to fix testCliDriver_mapjoin_decimal unit test failure. The other failures seem to be unrelated., [~szehon] Can you help review the code change?, Hi Aihua, looks like this works, so you are making all the varchars (and even char) in the join comparison to be the maximum length to avoid this issue.

But I'm not too familiar with this code, I think [~jdere] is the varchars expert, forwarding to him to take a look as well., That's right. For the key comparison, it will call UDF to do the key conversion if we are comparing different types, or I think we should pick the common type as the key type if the type conversion is not needed for the data types including char or varchar with different lengths.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12725576 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I think this looks fine. I would just say to make sure there are tests to cover the types that would get affected by this change (char/varchar/decimal joins), which it looks like there already are., Great thanks, +1, The failed test cases above seem unrelated.  TestCliDriver.testCliDriver_union_view seems also caused by some other changes., Committed to trunk, thanks Aihua!, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
