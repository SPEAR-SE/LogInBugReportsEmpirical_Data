ATTACHMENT ID: 12812911 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, +1, Pushed to master, branch-2.1. Thanks for the review [~ashutoshc]!, Sorry to jump on this so late, but why are we okay with accepting that indexing just doesn't work? Are there no follow-up Jira issues to attack the problem and work on supporting indexes with Tez?, [~poeppt], this issue was about giving a meaningful error message for the user. I did not create a JIRA issue for making indexing work in Tez, please feel free to do so so we can keep track. Thanks]
