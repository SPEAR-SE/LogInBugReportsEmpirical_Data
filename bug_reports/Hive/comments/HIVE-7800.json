[Included patch is a trivial fix that simply checks for both the existence of the column in the parquet file as well as checking the column index position to make sure the file contains such a position.

In the event the check fails, the column is not included and null values are produced for the missing column, which is the expected behavior.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12663141, Working on one other issue, so pulling this back for now., Updated patch provides exact schema size as table which is expected by the inputformat, The previous implementation had an issue that is only triggered in rare cases where the first split of a task does not contain a row group.  This forces the initialization of the value of the input format to be the size of the table (ArrayWritable), but the next row group will produce a value only as wide the columns available in the file.

The new patch pads the resolved schema to ensure a matching size and masks the name of the column so there no possibility of conflict with named columns within the file., Updated patch to address a rare split case.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12663887, [~dweeks-netflix] Can you please rebase this patch? [~xuefuz] could you perhaps review this or do you know someone who could?, I pulled the original patch because the implementation changed.  I believe [~brocknoland] made some changes and I'll need to rewrite this to accommodate.

I'll get an updated patch., This looks good to me. [~dweeks-netflix] can we add a .q file test to ensure we don't regress?, Linking to HIVE-8120., [~brocknoland]  The most recent patch isn't sufficient.  I have a patch that moves the logic into the init method, but it was written against parquet-hive which is now significantly different than the current hive implementation.  I need to update this patch to reflect those changes. , Updated patch that resolves index access issues., This patch actually resolves a few different issues:

1) If the file schema size and table schema size differ across partitions, it no longer throws an index out of bounds.
2) There was an odd case where if the calculated input splits resulted in a mapper not processing the first split (due to the row group boundary checking), the array writable used to back the materialized rows would be initialized as the full table length as opposed to projected column length.  In the column index access case this caused problems due to not being able to handle that case.
3) There was a check included previously that didn't allow the file schema to vary from the table schema (i.e. could not request a column that doesn't exist in the underlying file).  This doesn't allow for schema evolution and was removed.  Columns missing from the file schema should be null padded in the final result. , One more in the list

4) Certain operations (group by + order by) lose the hive schema in the configuration, so the table information isn't available in the 'prepareForRead' and column index access resolution didn't work.,
