[Review: https://reviews.facebook.net/D9867, [~navis] can I get you to review this one? It's the last union_remove test that's failing on hadoop 2., [~hagleitn] a comment on phabricator, Thank you [~navis]! New patch is on phabricator. Still running tests, will report back with results., Ran full test suite and no failures. I think patch 4261.2.patch is ready. [~navis], can you take another look?, There are some more places like GenMapredUtils#262, #331 and.. would it be better to make a method adding root task to GenMRProcContext?, [~navis] GenMapredUtils#262, #331 - those are removing tasks from the root, after adding the dependents, so they shouldn't need the check, right? Are there other locations your're aware of? I thought I caught them all., [~hagleitn] You are right. Let's get it in., Committed to trunk. Thanks Gunther!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #162 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/162/])
