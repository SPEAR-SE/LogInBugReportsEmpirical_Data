[Nitpick:
{code}
+      MapJoinObjectCtx ctx = MapJoinOperator.getMapMetadata().get(new Integer(metadataTag));
{code}
Use Integer.valueOf() instead since this is going to be called multiple times with the same integer number.


Also just to make sure, MapJoinOperator is a singleton so that getMapMetadata() can be defined as a static function?
is it possible to have 2 MapJoinOperator in the same mapper? (let's assume their join keys are different so they cannot be merged)
, incorporated Zheng's comments.

MapJoinOperator is a singleton - if the joins do not merge, there is a FileSink after the first MapJoin, +1. Will commit if the test passes., Talked offline with Zheng who told a minor performance problem. Fixed that.]
