ATTACHMENT ID: 12853897 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Patch looks good to me. Just wondering if the failure on TestSparkCliDriver.testCliDriver is related. (I hope not.), [~xuefuz], thanks for the review. I check the log of failure test cases, and it isn't caused by this update., +1, Committed to the master. Thanks [~colin_mjj] for the contribution and [~xuefuz] for the review.]
