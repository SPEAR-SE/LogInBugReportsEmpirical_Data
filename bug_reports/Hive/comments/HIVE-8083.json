ATTACHMENT ID: 12669446, The failure look unrelated. This test TestHCatLoader#testReadDataPrimitiveTypes passes in my setup with this patch., Patch committed to trunk. Thanks to Prasad., Does this need user doc?  If so, it probably belongs here:

* [Hive Default Authorization (Legacy Mode) -- Names of Users and Roles | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Default+Authorization+-+Legacy+Mode#HiveDefaultAuthorization-LegacyMode-NamesofUsersandRoles]
* [SQL Standard Based Hive Authorization -- Names of Users and Roles | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization#SQLStandardBasedHiveAuthorization-NamesofUsersandRoles]

A release note would also be helpful., Thanks, Lefty. It does seem that this has doc impact, especially regarding hive.support.quoted.identifiers. [~prasadm], could you please comment on this?, [~leftylev] Thanks for pointing that out. Just updated the wiki., Docs look good.  I added links back to this jira and removed the jira's TODOC14 label.  Thanks [~prasadm]., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
