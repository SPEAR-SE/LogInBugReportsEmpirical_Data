[[~vikram.dixit] Can you look at this patch and let me know if there are any other places in hive where we might unnecessarily send password information to Tez/Yarn jobs.
cc-ing [~thejas] for review.

Thanks
Hari
, Thanks for the patch Hari!
 # Looks like additional changes would be needed for the MR case
 # Setting the value to null would result in an error. See Configuration.set. Maybe set to emtpy string instead ? If I remember right there was not a good way to remove the configuration that works in both 1.x and 2.x .
 #  conf.setVar(HiveConf.ConfVars.METASTOREPWD, null) is more concise/readable than -  HiveConf.setVar(conf, HiveConf.ConfVars.METASTOREPWD, null);
, [~thejas] Thanks for the review.
1. Made changes in MR job conf as well
2. Changed the value to empty string
3. conf.setVar() is not possible since conf is a jobconf. I can use conf.set(HiveConf.ConfVars.METASTOREPWD.name(), "") .  However, I stuck with HiveConf.setVar() since it is used in other places in the same file.
Please let me know if you think I need to change this., Added this to sparkTask as well in patch#3, +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12728941 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I am able to reproduce the issue related to SparkCliDriver locally which goes away once I undo the change in SparkTask. After all, it might be true that Hive on Spark requires this information or I should be making the change elsewhere in spark code path. I am reverting the change in SparkTask.
