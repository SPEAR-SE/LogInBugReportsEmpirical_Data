[By default, the scratch dir can be based on date etc. so that it can be easily cleaned up, What about 2 failed and rolling back 1) also failed? This could happen if the CLI got killed at any time between 1) and 2). 

Another option is to use the traditional 'mark-then-delete' trick that you mark the partition as deleted on the metastore first and then clean up the data. In case of any failure, redoing the drop partiton will resume the data deletion process. It is also easier from the administrator's point of view that you can periodically check the metastore for deleted partitions (which are left uncommitted) and re-drop the partition. , If  "2 failed and rolling back 1) also failed", then the data is in trash scratch dir and the table's metadata is there.
But "2 failed and rolling back 1) also failed" will rarely happen. Most concern here is to deal with hdfs down and housekeeping operations.

For 'mark-then-delete', I think the main problem is there is no administration daemon process or helper script for it. ]
