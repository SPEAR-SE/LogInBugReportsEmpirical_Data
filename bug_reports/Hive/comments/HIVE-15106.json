[This is a bug in Constant propagation optimizer. It does "unsafe" casting that causes data corruption in some cases. 
It was fixed for Hive 2.x by patch HIVE-12749. I don't see a patch for Hive 1.x line.

Please keep in mind that there are several very simple workarounds:

1. set hive.optimize.constant.propagation=false;
2. select event_ts from test_order where to_date(event_ts) = to_date('2016-11-07'); ]
