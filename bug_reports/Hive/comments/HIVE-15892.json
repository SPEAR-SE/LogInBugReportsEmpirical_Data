[New error message needs work -- it doesn't prescribe a solution.

Add test?

Also add code for BytesBytesMultiHashMap, too?

ATTACHMENT ID: 12852498 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~jdere] [~gopalv] Can one of you review please.  I tried writing a test but either it takes too long or runs out of memory..., Looks like this throws a more user-friendly error message - but this condition will still fail the query? Is there a way to get the query to not fail? Or is it that this table should not have been selected for hash join in the first place?, Yes, it will fail the query.  I had a long conversation with Gopal and we think this is the best thing in the short/medium term.  Very large hash tables are not very efficient.  We need to encourage people to have smaller hash tables though a runtime error is obviously not ideal., ok, thanks for the explanation.
+1, Thanks [~jdere] and [~gopalv] for your help.
Committed to master.]
