[I have executed this query.

select a.rollNo,b.rollNo from student a join student b on a.rollNo=b.rollNo group by a.rollNo,b.rollNo;

The above query has spawned 2 MR jobs.
After the execution of the query, org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.Context.clear() method is deleting the ScratchDir of the query., Looks like scratch did is not being cleaned at lot of locations. Another such location:

1. ExecDriver.java's execute() function.

Here, if it is created before launching a job and there is error in job launch, it is not cleaned in exception before returning :



    try {
      if (ctx == null) {
        ctx = new Context(job);
        ctxCreated = true;
      }

      emptyScratchDirStr = ctx.getMRTmpFileURI();
      emptyScratchDir = new Path(emptyScratchDirStr);
      FileSystem fs = emptyScratchDir.getFileSystem(job);
      fs.mkdirs(emptyScratchDir);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
      console.printError("Error launching map-reduce job", "\n"
          + org.apache.hadoop.util.StringUtils.stringifyException(e));
      return 5;
    }


Here, ctx.clear() needs to be called in exception.
