[[~ErwanMAS]: +1 I am able to reproduce this issue.
A workaround to this is to 'set hive.optimize.sampling.orderby.number=1;'. After this setting it returned correct results., Can we retry with the latest? I don't see such issue on the latest 2.0 version., i have the issue , with the lastest source from git .
I use MR as engine .


, {noformat}
set hive.optimize.sampling.orderby.number=1;
{noformat}

does not work , it will not use 3 reducers to do the sort, Internally when the query is compiled, an order by is added and we are trying to do a parallel order by for this case. Ideally maybe we can do another reduce to merge the result. But that probably is big change. I will force it to use 1 reducer for this case just the same as hive.optimize.sampling.orderby=false right now., Attached first patch: when there is a groupby operator, we should not use sample optimizer to have multiple reducers which will lead to incorrect result. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12788323 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, In some cases of group by, we need only one reducer to return right result. The sampling optimizer breaks this logic.
The patch looks good.   
+1, Pushed to master. Thanks to Yongzhi to review the code.]
