[Hi Josh,

I am bumping into the same issue, did you find a way to handle this?

Andrew, I don't think 'ESCAPED BY' will solve your problem.  From what I have gathered, 'ESCAPED BY' translates into a SerDe property that indicates the escape character, which is default '\'.  It does not allow you to specify which characters you would like to escape.  

Looking at the source code that initializes LazySimpleSerDe.SerDeParameters, only the default separator chars (char codes 1, 2, 3) are flagged as needing escaping.

I have data that contains newlines as well, and as a workaround I pass the column through the regexp_replace function like:

regexp_replace(<my column>, "\n", "")

which eliminates the newline chars during deserialization.  However I don't like doing this and would appreciate alternative solutions if there are any.  Anyone?, I think Luke is right -- maybe the bug title should be changed to simply say "data with newlines won't work in Text/LazySimpleSerDe tables"?

I haven't tested it, but would STORED AS SEQUENCEFILE tables be immune to this problem?, HIVE-11785 added the support of escaping the newline and carriage return for LazySimpleSerDe and it should fix this issue. So the intermediate result with LazySimpleSerDe will escape newline and carriage return and later LineRecordReader can handle each line properly. ]
