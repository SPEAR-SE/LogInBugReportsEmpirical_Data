[Patch v1 which addresses this issue.  When lookup up the FunctionInfo for a permanent UDF from the FunctionRegistry, check if the classloader can resolve the UDF class, and if that fails then load the JARs necessary for that permanent UDF., RB at https://reviews.apache.org/r/19435/, [~rhbutani] Is this a bug that would be able to get into Hive-0.13?, Patch looks good. I wonder if we can write a test case for this, that will be good.,
