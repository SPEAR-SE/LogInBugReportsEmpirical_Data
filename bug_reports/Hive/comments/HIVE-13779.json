[I think the behavior has always been like this - it looks like TimestampWritable.toString() (which is used when converting to String) has logic to remove the trailing 0 from a timestamp value if the fractional portion is 0, whereas the java.sql.Timestamp type will keep a trailing 0 even if there is no fractional portion (1.0, 99.0, etc). We aren't losing any data here.]
