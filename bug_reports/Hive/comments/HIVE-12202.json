[I've checked to see that {{AcidUtils.serializeDeltas}} is being used correctly in conjunction with {{AcidUtils.deserializeDeltas}}. It appears that {{serializeDeltas}} does indeed create {{DeltaMetaData}} instances with an empty list for the statement IDs for delta paths containing only {{$startTxnId}} and {{$endTxnId}}. However, the deserialization process in  {{AcidInputFormat.DeltaMetaData.readFields(DataInput)}} incorrectly sets {{stmtIds}} to {{null}} at line 152 if no statement count was serialized. Hence {{AcidUtils.deserializeDeltas}} then gets tripped up by an NPE at line 371., Some clarification: in my earlier comment, by 'no statement count' I mean a statement count < 1. Also, I believe this is a bug and a lack of resilience to incorrect usage of the API., Attached patch [^HIVE-12202.0.patch]., And another clarification to an earlier comment of mine: when I said 'a lack of resilience', I meant 'and not a lack of resilience'. Apologies, not quite with it today!,
