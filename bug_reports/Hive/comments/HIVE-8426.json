[[~chengxiang li] This seems a dupe of HIVE-8362, where some discussions are present. From test output (http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-SPARK-Build/200/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli/TestCliDriver/testCliDriver_parallel/) it seems this problem may be present for trunk also, which might be due to concurrent move task., Thanks, [~xuefuz]. I would work on other issues now and back to verify this issue after Jimmy fixed HIVE-8362., Fixed via HIVE-8362.]
