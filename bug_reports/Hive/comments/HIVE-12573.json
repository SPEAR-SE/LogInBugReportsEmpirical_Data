[The predicate was not cleaned correctly after all; expr is the same object in both operators , so == wasn't distinguishing two cases for cleanup, and TS was not cleaned up.
Unlike filter cleanup, this only has cosmetic effect... fixing the cleanup and the out files.

[~hagleitn] can you take a look?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12775423 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures are unrelated and DPP tests no longer fail. [~hagleitn] ping?, [~hagleitn] [~sseth] ping?, I don't believe the effect is only cosmetic. Having an un-executable synthetic predicate left over in the TS operator breaks anyone trying to implement filter pushdown. However, this was introduced by HIVE-12462, which I don't think is the right fix in the first place. Makes sense to find out what's happening there before proceeding with this., Fixed somewhere else, as far as I remember.]
