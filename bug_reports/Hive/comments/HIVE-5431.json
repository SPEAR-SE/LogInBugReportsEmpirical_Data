[Attaching fix patch. This does not yet have any tests, I'll have to think on how to implement a test for it, and will update with one.

In the meanwhile, though, since this is a pretty significant bug (HBase users that simply do a select * in hive 0.12 will get an exception), I want to get some eyeballs on this for verification.

[~viraj], [~ashutoshc], could you please have a look at this?

[~thejas], please be warned, this is likely another candidate to push through into 0.12 in the last minute., Hi Sushanth,
 Thanks for finding this bug. Somehow the unit tests do not catch this error as you mentioned. I +1 on this patch.
Viraj, Updated patch moving around code for it to be cleaner., [~thejas] & [~ashutoshc] : Writing a test for this proves to be difficult because it can't be written as a .q test, and instead requires me to create a hbase table outside of hive and then read using hive in a job to demonstrate the bug. I've manually tested this bug and this patch.

Would you prefer to spin 0.12 RC0 without this patch, and then add it along with a testcase at RC1 timeframe, or would you prefer to take this patch now and open another jira for a test? I'm okay with either approach, and will assume the former and leave this open. If you prefer the latter, then please feel free to close/commit and open another jira for that. I'm going to go ahead and mark it as patch-available, though, so that the automated tests at least pick it up and run a full run with this patch., +1 , 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass
