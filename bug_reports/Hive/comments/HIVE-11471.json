[[~pxiong] [~jpullokkaran] [~jcamachorodriguez] fyi, We already expose datasize/row count estimates in explain. Given that our cost model is based on cardinality right now, what else are you asking?, I mean the total cost of the plan... it's hard to estimate from row counts/etc. on various stages in big explain., [~hagleitn], i am not sure, but I guess [~sershe] is asking the cost (cardinality) of a query plan that is specified by the user. If that is the case, i think the user can just turn off CBO and give Hive a query and run explain, it will show the cost. For example, the plan that is given by CBO for a query which joins A,B,C tables is A join B and then join C. The user can turn off CBO and write the query like A join C join B, then run explain will show the cost and the plan. The user can compare it with the plan that is given by CBO., The background is that, if the user is going to run queries that can be written multiple ways, that are either expensive, or are run on a busy cluster (so one run is not a good indicator of perf), they want to compare these rewrites before running. I think having it work just in CBO case is also fine... as long as the cost computation is consistent (i.e. comparable) between different queries, it can simply be output in the explain plan in CBO case, I think]
