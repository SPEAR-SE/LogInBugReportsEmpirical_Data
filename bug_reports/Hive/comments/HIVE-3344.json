[@Namit: The options necessary to do this have gotten a little convoluted. I verified that this works:

ant clean package -Dhadoop.version=0.23.1 -Dhadoop-0.23.version=0.23.1 -Dhadoop.mr.rev=23

Please take a look at the version specific properties in build.properties for more info.
, To make things a little simpler we could try adding a couple additional property files with version specific information, e.g:

build-0.23.properties:
{noformat}
hadoop.version=0.23.1
hadoop-0.23.version=${hadoop.version}
hadoop.mr.rev=23
{noformat}

And then trigger it like so:

ant -propertyfile build-0.23.properties

or

ant -propertyfile build-0.23.properties -Dhadoop.version=0.23.0
, Created a section on wiki for hive compilation on hadoop 23

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-Compilehiveonhadoop23, @Carl, were you able to get the test running on hadoop 23 ?

If I want to test a particular .q file for hadoop 23, what is the exact command to run ?, Was fixed by Ashutosh's patch]
