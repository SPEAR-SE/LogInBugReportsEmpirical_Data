[Patch attached., While this is a change to a schema file, it should be okay to commit to branch-1.2 as well, since the earlier schema file could never have been applied correctly, and thus, thus does not change the status quo in an incompatible manner., +1, I don't think we need to wait for precommit tests on this one, they won't be impacted by this change.
, Ah, just noticed that you already have 'NO PRECOMMIT TESTS' in the description.
, Thanks for the review, Thejas! Committed to branch-1.2, branch-1 and master.
