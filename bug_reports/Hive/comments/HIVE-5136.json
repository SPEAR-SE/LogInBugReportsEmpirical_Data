[I'm not setting this as patch available because it'll break things until HIVE-4388 and HIVE-5112 are committed. I'll regenerate this patch after they're committed and then set it to patch-available., [~sushanth] with HIVE-5112 committed I'd like to commit this. 

Any chance you can upgrade hadoop in the hcatalog pom to match HIVE-5112 and regenerate the Complexpb file you found in HIVE-5112? That way we'd have all this fixed in one go., Oh wait, nevermind. I see this is patch on top of HIVE-4388. In that case I think we can close this because I will just regenerate the file in HIVE-4388. It needs some work anyway because it's going against a moving target (pre-release hbase 0.96)., Yup, I think that makes sense to regenerate this in HIVE-4388 itself. We should be able to close this.]
