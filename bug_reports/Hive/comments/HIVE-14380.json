ATTACHMENT ID: 12820842 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, I'll confirm, but I think these failures might be unrelated., Yeah, looks like these tests are busted on master. :/ Just checked on a fresh checkout.

All except {{TestHiveMetaStoreTxns}}. That test seems to run for me (even with my patch applied)., Thanks [~mithun] for your contribution. I committed this to master., Thank you very much, [~spena]. I have a related fix on the metastore server-side. I hope to make time to raise a JIRA for this soon., bq. I have a related fix on the metastore server-side.

Looks like my fix for the {{HiveMetaStore}} is obviated by HIVE-14688. I'll leave my fix out., Thanks for checking about the metastore fix [~mithun]!
, [~mithun], could you please help to share branch-1.2 patch?, Sorry I missed your message, [~cltlfcjin]. Here's a patch that applies to {{branch-1.2}}. I've had to pull in part of HIVE-7476 for this.]
