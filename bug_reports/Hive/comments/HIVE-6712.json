[This patch changes the behavior of setAutoCommit to allow setAutoCommit(true) to succeed silently and setAutoCommit(false) to throw an exception and fail, as all Hive transactions automatically commit and hive does not yet support manual transactions (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions#HiveTransactions-Limitations)., +1, looks good to me.,
