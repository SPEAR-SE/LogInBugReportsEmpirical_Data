[Patch attached., I see that new FileSystem is created but never closed so I don't see how this addresses the issue.  , [~ekoifman] We are using a local variable fs inside the while loop, so at the end of while loop the local variable can be garbage collected. When the process is running low in memory, it will run garbage collection that eventually close the file system. This solves the problem when fs is declared outside of the while loop so that fs can never get garbage collected. Does it make sense?, [~shanyu], are you arguing that you don't need to call {{FileSystem.close()}} or {{closeAll()}} ?, [~ekoifman] Please see the updated patch that calls close() explicitly on the filesystem object., +1, Thanks for the contribution [~shanyu]]
