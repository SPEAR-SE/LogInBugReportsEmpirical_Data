[This reverts the identifier factory to the same as datanucleus 1.1., This patch was tested with a metastore database created prior to the datanucleus upgrade. In our configuration, we have

{code}
<property>
  <name>datanucleus.autoCreateSchema</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>datanucleus.fixedDatastore</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
{code}

so that no automatic schema changes will occur. The following commands were run without errors: create table, add partition, create view, create view, drop table, and drop view., +1., Committed.  Thanks Paul!
