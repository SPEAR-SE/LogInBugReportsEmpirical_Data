[I find that this bug only happens when you have an empty table., When the local mode is enabled, the query context always returns the scratch dir path of the local file system which gets pushed down into the job. That's what causing the problem. The 'empty' file created for the empty table/partitions should be created on the same file system as table.
, Thanks for response. We switched to server mode and problem was gone. I think this task might be closed., Local mode redirect to local dir path of the local file system]
