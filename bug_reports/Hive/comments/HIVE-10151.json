[[~alangates], could you review please

we also have GroupByOptimizer which can enable use of BucketziedHiveInputFormat but as far as I can tell it only applies if table is bucketed and sorted which is an invalid combination for ACID tables, I think a qfile test to make sure that the data is properly handled in this scenario would be good, since the TextTxn2 test just makes sure the query parses executes but doesn't check output.

Other than that, +1., both tests do a select after insert to test the data., committed to branch-1,2 and master.  Thanks [~alangates] for the review, This patch introduced a call to {{FileStatus#isFile}}, which is only defined in Hadoop 2.x, so Hive could not compile with {{-Phadoop-1}}.  I posted an addendum patch on HIVE-10444 to fix it.  If it's better to track it as a new jira separate from HIVE-10444, please let me know.  Thanks!, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
