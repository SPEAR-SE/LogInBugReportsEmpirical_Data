[TestHadoop20SAuthBridge has a compile error. But the test will continue regardless this error. This test will not be tested and you cannot see it in test report. I am trying to make the build stops when compile error happens (HIVE-4979). Then HIVE-4980 will fix the compile error., HIVE-4980 has fixed the compile error in TestHadoop20SAuthBridge. We can see it in the testreport, e.g. https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2275/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hive.thrift/

Shall we resolve this jira?

btw, I still cannot fix HIVE-4979 with a small change...
, I'd love to see this one resolved. Do you want to take it up?, TestHadoop20SAuthBridge was not tested because there was a compile error which was reported in HIVE-4976. HIVE-4980 has fixed the compile error. I am resolving this jira as "Duplicate".]
