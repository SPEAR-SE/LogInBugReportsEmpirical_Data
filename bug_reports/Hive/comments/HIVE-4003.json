[Thanks Thomas. Could you point out how one can reproduce the error?, I updated today the hive version to git master of my cdh cluster (4.1.2) to get this patch HIVE-3699.
, Can you add a test ?, Sorry no, I'm not familiar with the code and I have nothing usually to do with java.
, Ok, in that case, I can take it on from here. Thanks for your contribution, Thomas!, Thank you Mark., Any updates on this issue?, Marking "Patch Available" to get a test run.,
