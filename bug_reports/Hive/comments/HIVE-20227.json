[Since hive doesn't seem to require glassfish:javax.el it could be excluded., [~ashutoshc] Can you take a look?, Ran TestHBaseCliDriver locally to confirm that there are no failures., +1, the patch name is wrong and precommit will fail. Also, we don't have a profile for branch-3.1 yet as far as I know. Let me create it, created the profile for branch-3.1., [~vihangk1] Thanks! We don't really need to run full ptests on this patch ( I have already ran TestHBaseCliDriver tests locally). I intend to upload another patch for master where we can run the full tests., Okay. Sounds good., [~vgarg]
This is committed to branch 3.1, but not to branch-3 and master.
Do you plan to commit to branch-3 and master as well ?
, [~thejas] Yes I'll push this to master and branch-3., Pushed this to branch-3. Master already has this change via HIVE-19579]
