[Attaching a patch that puts the tests in a parallel structure so that each one is run.  Tests are still run serially by setting parallelism to 1, but a side effect of parallel is that each of its components is run even if one of them fails., Looks good to me, I've faked a test failure and am running tests. If tests continue to run, I will go ahead and commit.

One important note to people visiting this bug later - the patch provided is for hcatalog/build.xml, not the root build.xml., Tested, works, and in fact, will also bypass and continue if there is a compile error in one group of tests. Potent! I'm waiting for the test run to finish to see if the overall test task results in a "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"(not expected) or a "BUILD FAILURE"(expected)., +1, tests ran fully and ended with a BUILD FAILURE. Will commit to 0.11 and trunk., Committed. Thanks, Alan!, Thanks Sushanth., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2080 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2080/])
