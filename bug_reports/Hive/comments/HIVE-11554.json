[[~pauly] The baseline you posted above has been fixed by HIVE-11077. Now it will say "PREHOOK: type: ALTERTABLE_EXCHANGEPARTITION"., Modifying target version to add 1.3.0 since this is not a regression and 1.2.2 is a minor version update. If i'm able to put commit this before 1.2.2 RC is cut, I'll commit this to 1.2 branch]
