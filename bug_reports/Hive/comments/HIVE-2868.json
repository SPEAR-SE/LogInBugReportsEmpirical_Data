[I just checked this behavior for an internal table, using Hive 0.8.1 and 0.10.0. Both worked as designed. Is there really a bug? If not, should this item be closed?, You are most likely running into HIVE-3062. [~mcazzari] and [~deanwampler], if you get a chance, can you please try with the table name being in all lower case, it should work as expected.

FWIW, HIVE-3062 got fixed in recently released hive 0.10, Fixed in hive-0.10.0]
