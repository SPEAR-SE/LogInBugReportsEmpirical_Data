[Review request on https://reviews.facebook.net/D11019, I will assume its bit hard to write junit test case for testing concurrency. But was wondering if you thought about writing test case for it. Else, can you provide info on what manual testing you did to verify the fix?, [~prasadm] It will be good to get this in. I just want to make sure you have tested this fix., [~ashutoshc] my apologies for missing the comment earlier.

We found the issue in one of our internal integration tests with Cloudera Manager. The exec hook retrieves the query start time hookContext.getQueryPlan().getQueryStartTime()which sometimes used to return bogus timestamp values. The problem didn't reproduce with the patch.
, I see. Can you rebase the patch? Lets get it in., Rebased patch, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Prasad!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2-ptest #41 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2-ptest/41/])
