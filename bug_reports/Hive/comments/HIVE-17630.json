[[~dmtolpeko],can you help me to answer my doubts?Thank you, I will check this., At this page [http://www.hplsql.org/resignal],Example 1 and Example 2, actual results and sample results are inconsistent., [~dmtolpeko],Where do you find a problem? Or what parameters I need special settings?, So far I can just confirm that the problem exists, for some reason there were no unit tests for resignal and the logic was broken at some stage. I will try to fix it., [~dmtolpeko]
Dear dmtolpeko, I have a question. Can we use HPL/SQL in production environment now? what is your advice?
thanks.]
