[Attached patch modifies the tests so that it doesn't run into the jdk bug., Would you be able to fix groupby3_map_skew.q as well, which looks like it also has a similar issue? For that one maybe you could replace:
SELECT dest1.* FROM dest1;
with:
SELECT c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, ROUND(c8, 5), ROUND(c9, 5) FROM dest1;

And hopefully the values generated do not show differences between the jdk6/7 formatting.,
