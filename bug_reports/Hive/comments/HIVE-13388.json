[[~sershe] [~vgumashta] Can you take a look?, Need to sync with whoever added the original thrift files that added this code. Is it HIVE-12442?, I've checked with [~rohitdholakia] (HIVE-12442) and [~sinchii] (HIVE-12862). Both of them confirmed the generated files can be added to the repo.

Basically HIVE-12442 introduced service-rpc/src/gen/thrift/gen-py/__init__.py, and HIVE-12862 introduced service/src/gen/ and files under it.,
