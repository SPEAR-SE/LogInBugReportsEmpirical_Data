[You can think of these situations as being like a CAST.

Let's say the old column char1 (type CHAR(50)) had its data type changed to STRING or VARCHAR(50).
Then changing the column data type is as if an implicit CAST has been added like:

CAST(char1 as STRING) or CAST(char1 as VARCHAR(50))

I think those casts drop trailing white space.]
