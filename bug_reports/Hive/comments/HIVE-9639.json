[[~willddy] Could you provide the stack trace?, sorry, I have no way to do that. But, this is very easy to reproduce in Hive 1.0, I do a refresh installation of Hive v1.0 and Hadoop 1.2 today. There is no such issues. In this case, I think the issue is because of the environment I used previously.

The issues happens when I have multiple version of Hive running in the same clusters (v1.0 and v.0.13.0). Troubleshooting can start from this step., This issue is about the same thing I guess. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5902, [~willddy] Could we clsoe this issue ?, If this is a known issue for multiple version of installation, are you going to fix it? If not, you can close it.]
