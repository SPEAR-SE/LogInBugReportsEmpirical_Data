{code}, +1, Committing it shortly to avoid the false alarms in precommit tests.

, [~thejas] Is precommit test runs on hadoop-2? Newly updated are all wrong in hadoop-1 and the result of hadoop-1 seemed right., [~navis] I should have generated this against hadoop-1. When you say wrong, do you mean the results are what were there before this patch or something different. 
[~prasanth_j] - I believe there is some difference in the stats results in some OS, is that right ?

, The diff in the attached patch doesn't seems to related to OS specific. OS specific diffs are mostly related to total file size., [~navis] Can you upload the diffs you see with hadoop-1 ? The switch to hadoop-2 in pre-commit tests was made only recently after 0.13 release. AFAIK, the precommit tests didn't show up failures for these testes with hadoop-1 after this was committed.
