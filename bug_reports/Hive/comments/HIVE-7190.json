[Will attach a patch in a bit, feel free to assign the Jira to me as I don't have the right to do so yet., Attaching the initial patch.

Approach in the patch is similar to what Oozie does to handle this situation. Specifically, all child map jobs get tagged with the launcher MR job id. On launcher task restart, launcher queries RM for the list of jobs that have the tag and kills them. After that it moves on to start the same child job again. Again, similarly to what Oozie does, a new {{templeton.job.launch.time}} property is introduced that captures the launcher job submit timestamp and later used to reduce the search window when RM is queried. 

I have validated that MR, Pig and Hive jobs do get tagged appropriately. I have also validated that previous child jobs do get killed on RM failover/task failure.

To validate the patch, you will need to add webhcat shim jars to templeton.libjars as now webhcat launcher also has a dependency on hadoop shims. 

I have noticed that in case of the SqoopDelegator webhcat currently does not set the MR delegation token when optionsFile flag is used. This also creates the problem in this scenario. This looks like something that should be handled via a separate Jira., Review board: https://reviews.apache.org/r/22329/ , Rebasing patch against latest hive trunk., Addressing Eugene's feedback. , +1, +1
