[[~rajesh.balamohan], this sounds related to HIVE-15467?, [~pxiong] - Yes, on task failure the node gets into disabled state. Will debug more on this., Basically, re-enabling the node was not kicking off correctly in {{NodeEnablerCallable}}. It was trying to get {{ServiceInstance}} based on node identity from {{DynamicServiceInstanceSet}} which internally was not returning the instance correctly.

This was causing issues in re-enabling the node in {{NodeEnablerCallable}}. Attached patch checks for "workerIdentity" in {{DynamicServiceInstanceSet}}.  Tested this in small scale cluster.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12845369 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, How does this patch fix the issue described? Is the problem in getCurrentData call?, 
Yes, issue is with "PathChildrenCache.getCurrentData(name)". This internally stores "path, childData". But currently code passes "getNodeIdentity()" which would always return null. Hence it was not able to re-enable the disabled node.


{noformat}
For example, PathChildrenCache has the following keys and values

Keys: [/user-rbalamohan/llap0/workers/slot-0000000000, /user-rbalamohan/llap0/workers/worker-0000000416]
Values: [ChildData{path='/user-rbalamohan/llap0/workers/slot-0000000000', stat=101148,101148,1483486257760,1483486257760,0,0,0,96572092669136166,36,0,101148...

But as per NodeEnablerCallable, it ends up requesting based on nodeIdentity. Hence the issue. Here is the log snippet

2017-01-03 18:33:16,343 [INFO] [LlapSchedulerNodeEnabler] |tezplugins.LlapTaskSchedulerService|: Attempting to re-enable node: {machine-105:40396, id=f5c2afe6-79bb-4636-8357-6b9158bef4d2, stc=24}

Patch fixes the issue by checking for nodeIdentity., +1, Thanks [~sershe]. Committed to master.]
