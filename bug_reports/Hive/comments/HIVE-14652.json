[The partition pruning is performed correctly and the partition is added to inputs, locks and all, I think this is partition condition remover. IN like this would return true (i.e. match any row?) and then not true will become false... great.
, The fix (and also a refactor of the class to not have a million-line method).
I have a vague feeling that most of the logic in this method is  bogus, but it may be just because I am missing something, because it apparently works. The main question is, why do we evaluate UDFs on partition values from the pruned set for the filters that we purport to remove, if we have just used the same filters to prune the partitions, so one of the two should be true - either we cannot eliminate the filter, or the final result of all the expressions is known to be true (or not matter). So we'd insta-bail as soon as we'd see any disagreement after evaluation; or have a walk state that indicates the value doesn't matter.
I don't really know if that's the case or if I'm missing something here. 

So for now the fix is to change the new IN logic introduced by HIVE-11424 to follow the same twisted logic. 
Let's see what that breaks.

The problem is that HIVE-11424 changes IN to true if there's a column on the left side, but, as described above, this IN was used to filter the partitions, so in the NOT IN case, IN is guaranteed to be false. So, while the "regular" logic would have confirmed that and then applied NOT to the false constant, the current code  results in NOT being applied to the true constant.

EDIT: I think the old IN logic for UDF on the left hand side might also be broken the same way, need to take a look, Thanks for looking into this [~sershe].

The problem seemed to be there for IN clauses before HIVE-11424 went in, which just added the case for single column. In fact, as you said, it is expected that logic for multi-column (struct) IN clause is broken too.

I think the source of the problem is in the assumption for the IN logic about the WalkState, as it considers that TRUE means that the condition can be removed (comment in line 423 in the original code, line 359 after applying your patch). WalkState seems to be a global overview on the results of the children expressions, thus that assumption is not correct.

I checked the patch and changes look good to me, but I have a couple of questions.
1. Does the patch still consider the dynamic partition pruner generated synthetic predicates for IN clause with a single column? Previously there was some special handling for this case, but it does not seem to be there anymore. Maybe it is handled generically as any other predicate?
2. I would extend the patch to cover multi-column IN clauses so we fix all the issues. That would mean extending the logic in lines 359-364 after applying your patch (it seems straightforward), and adding an additional test case.

Concerning the logic behind pcr. If I understand your question correctly, the answer is that we need to evaluate them because partition pruning does not necessarily correspond to the filter condition. For instance, consider a table with partition column _b_, and the given predicate _(a = 5 and b = 1) or (a=3 and b=2)_. We can infer that we only need partitions _b=1_ and _b=2_. However, we cannot remove any part of the predicate if both partitions exist. In turn, if only _b=1_ exists, then final predicate would be _a=5_.

Btw, we had some discussion with [~ashutoshc] about moving pcr to the logical optimization phase (Calcite), but till the return path is in place, we cannot complete this task.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12825591 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, No tests fail, surprisingly enough. I wonder if the entire in path could be removed and just go to regular function handling ;) , Updated the patch to do the check first, and also to remove the special handling for the UDF. Do you know why this special handling was needed? 
What would be a good query to test the intended effect before and after? I've run auto_join19_inclause and filter_in_or_dup (tests added with the code), but they don't exercise the lhs UDF path, as far as I see from the added logging.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12826067 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Hm, looks like the code did handle some things differently, pcs, etc. changes are related, struct predicates are no longer removed. I am taking a look., Adding the struct handling separately from IN. This restores the predicate removal in most of the tests; one of the filters restored in pcs appears to be restored correctly, the removal was only valid by coincidence, as a mixed predicate has the same condition in this query.,
