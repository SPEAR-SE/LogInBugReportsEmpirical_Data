[Fix by making the constants configurable via the existing hive.groupby.mapaggr.checkinterval and hive.map.aggr.hash.percentmemory, Use new settings to avoid overlap with existing row-mode settings (which have slightly different meaning). Added unit test., https://reviews.apache.org/r/15095/, The implementation is much more aggresive now:

 - shouldFlush test the in-use vs. max at each batch boudary, not only at checking limit. Checking limit is only used to decide when to probe/adjust the average variable row size
 - the flush is called in a while loop until it shouldFlush returns false, ie. it flushes as much as necessary to stay within the prescribed bounds. Progress is being monitored to prevent infinite loop.
 - the checking limit is configured via HiveConf  hive.vectorized.groupby.checkinterval
 - the flushing percent is configured via HiveConf hive.vectorized.groupby.flush.percent

, Added hive.vectorized.groupby.maxentries (1000000) to cap the max number of entries before triggering a forced flush., [~gopalv] I think you have encountered this bug in wild. Would you like to review this patch ?, [~ashutoshc] I  ran into this in our tests and the fastest version of those settings were to flush 100% of keys every 10k keys.

I have reviewed that patch and it looks good enough. The default values for those variables are still up for discussion, but now for us it could be set in hive-site.xml instead of being hard-coded., getting jenkiss to work, +1, This is .3.patch reloaded so that the builder sees the change and gives it's +/- 1, [~rusanu] Can you re-upload this patch so that Hive QA gets to run on it., Patch was no longer applying, I updated it and made sure it applies and compiles, test pass, 6th time is a charm, the .5 patch failed in QA build https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/1551/console during the subversion sync:

ATTACHMENT ID: 12614897, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Remus!, Doc note:  This added *hive.vectorized.groupby.checkinterval*, *hive.vectorized.groupby.maxentries*, and *hive.vectorized.groupby.flush.percent* to HiveConf.java. They are documented in the wiki, so I'll remove the TODOC13 label.
