ATTACHMENT ID: 12855289 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Will have to update this patch after HIVE-15644, Committed patch to master., Should this be documented in the wiki?  If so, does it belong in Hive Metrics?

* [Hive Metrics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Metrics], [~prasanth_j], should these metrics be documented in the wiki?  And should other LLAP metrics created by HIVE-9801 also be documented?, [~leftylev] Thanks for pointing out! Yes. I think metrics added for LLAP should be documented. Will update the docs shortly., [~prasanth_j], this patch is in branch-2.3 but not in branch-2.2 (due to changes in release numbers since the commit) so the fix version should be changed to 2.3.0.

I added a TODOC2.3 label for the documentation, just as a nudge.]
