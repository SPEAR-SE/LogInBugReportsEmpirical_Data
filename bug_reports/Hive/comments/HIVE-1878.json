[This patch sets version=0.7.0-SNAPSHOT and year=2011 in the build.properties file.
, +1.  Will commit when tests pass.  Can you update this page accordingly?

, Committed.  Thanks Carl!
, why to add the "SNAPSHOT"? I think when we do the release, we will cut a branch. No?

This made some noise to some local scripts which always use the latest open source trunk, which rely on all the jar files., SNAPSHOT follows the Maven convention for unreleased binaries.  We recently ran into a case where Amazon referred to their binaries as 0.7, even though it hadn't been released yet, so this should help avoid that confusion in the future.

When we cut a release branch, we'll remove the SNAPSHOT designation as part of publishing release candidates.
, So it is added to avoid confusion with Amazon's naming...It is still confusing because it still looks like the amazon's 0.7 is a 0.7 release, It's added as a best practice to avoid similar confusion in the future.  For the specific case of Amazon, we're in communication with them via email to get them to correct their web pages (specifying SNAPSHOT and the specific revision they based their build on).
, +1 for having SNAPSHOT in version string. As John noted it aids Maven to figure out latest builds (called snapshots) and thus ability for upstream projects to pull correct hive jar from maven repo from there build system., @John: I updated the HowToRelease page.]
