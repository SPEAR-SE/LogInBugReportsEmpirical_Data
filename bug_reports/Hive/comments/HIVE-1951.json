[changing the test file for a quick fix.

Will open a new jira for the real problem.

The problem here is that hive should process all comments in CliDriver. Hive comment can be followd by any other commands (not just hive query command)., opened jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1953 for the real problem., Committed. Thanks Yongqiang]
