[[~sfroehlich]: Could you please provide the log line which printed out the connection url? (Do not forget to mask the password :) ).

Thanks,
Peter, Thank you for reporting the bug [~sfroehlich].
One part of this issue, the logging out of the jdbc connection string, has already been fixed in HIVE-12235. Could you maybe upgrade to a version of hive already containing the fix? (so Hive 1.2.1+), [~zsombor.klara],
Thank you for the information. This is helpful.
It would be great if you could bring the fix also down to Hive 1.1.x as a security fix. Not many commercial Hadoop vendors using Hive 1.2.1 in their commercial Hadoop distributions. So the upgrade to Hive 1.2.1+ is not a real option for us.
But maybe this issue will be fixed separately in the impacted commercial distributed Hive versions., [~sfroehlich]: You could take a look at here: https://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/cdh/5/hive-1.1.0-cdh5.7.0.CHANGES.txt or here: https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.3.4/bk_HDP_RelNotes/content/fixed_issues.html.
