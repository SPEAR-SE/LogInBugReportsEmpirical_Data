ATTACHMENT ID: 12668272, This looks good. +1 if you remove invalid_map_index.q since it looks like that test is no longer valid with your changes to map index., Removed invalid test(invalid_map_index),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12668700, testParse_union is failing due to HIVE-8072, and running TestJdbcWithMiniHS2 locally does not show any failure. The only difference from the previous patch is the removal of invalid_map_index.q, which was causing the only failure in the previous patch.
I am +1 on this patch., Committed to trunk, thanks Navis!, Does this need any userdoc?  (It should have a release note at least.)

Perhaps it belongs in the Joins wikidoc.  A version note could also be added in Hive Data Types.

* [Hive Joins | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Joins]
* [Hive Data Types -- Complex Types | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-ComplexTypes], Updated [Hive Data Types|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-ComplexTypes]., The doc looks good, thanks [~jdere]., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
