[[~alangates] [~daijy] fyi, My original plan for this was to make use the transaction server that we'll need to add for HBase metastore anyway (most likely Omid).  But given that we see a lot of contention on the sequences in the RDBMS world in ACID it might make sense to rely on HBase simpler check and put rather than the transaction service here., This patch does a couple of things:
# It introduces the concept of raw tables in HBaseConnection.  This allows HBaseReadWrite to use checkAndPut for tables that aren't part of the transaction manager.  This is important because none of the transactions managers we're thinking of using (Tephra, Omid) support checkAndPut (nor is it clear how any txn manager could).  Thus once a table is declared raw it cannot be used in a transaction with any of the tables that would be used in transactions.  Currently only the sequences table is declared raw.  Currently it is only used to store master keys.  In the future we'll use it to store sequences for ACID.
# It changes the sequences table to have a row for each sequence.  Originally it had one row with a separate column for each sequence, which is a horrible design as it means every sequence has to lock the same row (yes I did that).
, Hmm. Can increment API be used in the txn managers? that is separate from checkAndPut. See the patch at HIVE-12892, See comments on HIVE-12892 on why increment won't work in that case.  In this case where I'm explicitly circumventing the transaction management it would be viable.  Is it better than checkAndPut?  I don't care which we use here.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12786166 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Based on the discussion over on HIVE-12892 I'm going to drop all the goofiness here about raw tables that circumvent the transaction manager.  I think that will be more trouble than it's worth.

But I still need to fix it so that we have one sequence per row not one per column.  I'll change the JIRA title and description and post a new patch., New patch that corrects issues with sequences to be one per row instead of one per column.  Also switched new CURRENT_VERSION table to be sequence based instead of its own table., cc [~sershe], +1,
