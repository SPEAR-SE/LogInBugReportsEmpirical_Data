[Also, in the README it says "We have provided upgrade scripts for Derby and MySQL databases."
We should included the additional supported databases.
The paragraph  about replacing old copies of hive-default.xml can be removed, since we ignore that file.

(Thanks to Carl for reporting these issues)., I also checked additional jars in 0.12 to see if any of them needs to be included in NOTICE, and I didn't find anything that needs inclusion. jsr305 is a dependency of guava. bonecp is Apache Licensed, and does not have additional attribution requirements. 

"The NOTICE document is for additional copyright and attribution statements those licenses may require." from http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html#best-practice
