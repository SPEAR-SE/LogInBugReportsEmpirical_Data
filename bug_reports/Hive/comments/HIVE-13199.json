[[~gopalv] Could you take a look this?, +1.. Does this also affect 2.0? I assume all the logging fixes need to be backported to branch-2, I am not sure yet. HIVE-13110 seems to have committed only to master. This patch should have been part of HIVE-13110. , I think we should backport both to 2.0.1. Otherwise, the logging doesn't work there, does it?, I think it will get picked from hive-jdbc-standalone jar as it shades the world. ,
