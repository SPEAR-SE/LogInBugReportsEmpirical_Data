[This patch only adds decimal support in the udf GenericUDAFComputeStats.
The changes to metastore and thrift APIs are still needed., I have most of the metastore and API changes... will finish tomorrow and post and addon patch. Perhaps a q file to test will also be needed, the metastore work and the the q file.
Note that fields for decimal (varchar) already existed in the schema since HIVE-1362, they just weren't used. So upgrade scripts are not necessary.
Most of the patch is generated code..., https://reviews.apache.org/r/19552, The extra unused field were added in HIVE-1362 precisely to avoid upgrading the schema.,
