[For now, just fixing the test to handle the new schema string returned by the hive server. Going forward, we should remove dependency on DynamicSerDe (and hence the need to create the old schema string)., The schema "struct result { string cnt}#cnt#string" looks ugly, but Raghu mentioned we will clean it up later.

Raghu please note this in the follow-up jira. Also, we might want to take a look at Avro's way of representing schema (using JSON to represent the schema).

Testing now. WIll commit when succeeded.
, Committed. Thanks Raghu!, I am going to repurpose HIVE-538 to clean up the implementation of the getSchema call. The idea is to provide a standard serialization format so that clients in different languages can easily parse the query results. , it's a good way use json through Avro here, but making things more complex.  
serde(although is not a rpc), thrift, avro, 3 duplications of works.  ]
