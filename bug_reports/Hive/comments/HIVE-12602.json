[Attaching high level patch to fix the issue. \cc [~sseth], [~sershe], This feature is not supported on non-HBase metastore at all. If there's embedded HBase metastore it should still work thru Hive.
Moreover, if ObjectStore is able to initialize, it will work fine, the calls will just do nothing.

I think this is not an issue... probably a comment for a setting could be expanded to say that first, for now it's only supported on HBase metastore, and then, if this is set to true, AM must be able to init the metastore (addendum: if local metastore is used, or connect if remote metastore is used), i.e. jars need to be shipped. That would cover all cases and so this becomes a user error., *hive.orc.splits.ms.footer.cache.enabled* will be documented for HIVE-11553, so I added a crossreference to this issue in the doc note there.]
