[I am not sure anyone has tried hive in the Mapred.NEXT setup yet. I do not know enough about the infrastructure to comment definitively , but it sounds like it would be nice if the processes hung around for a few moments after completion so Hive client could check in to them. Strange though because you would not expect a hive job to hang around long then a typical map/reduce job.

It would be great if you can give a stack trace and find what point in the hive code is hanging.]
