[Removing 2.1.0 target. Please feel free to commit to branch-2.1 anyway and fix for 2.1.0 if this happens before the release., Fixing this as part of HIVE-14721., Reopening as putting this with HIVE-14721 is causing issues with applying patch in precommits. Will commit this separately., [~thejas] I've removed the code that used this jar (in tests) as part of the work on improving test cases. Can you review this?, +1, Committed. Thanks [~thejas], Reverted as this caused HIVE-14955.]
