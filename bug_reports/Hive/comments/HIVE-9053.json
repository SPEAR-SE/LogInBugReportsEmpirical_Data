ATTACHMENT ID: 12687078 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~ashutoshc], I think the test failure is unrelated and the patch is safe to check in. Could you please take a look? Thanks!, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Pengcheng!, [~prasanth_j], could you please review and help me commit "patch-013" to hive 0.13 branch? Thanks!, Looks like a fix we should include in hive 0.14 branch as well.
, [~pxiong] can you create a patch based on branch 1.0 instead of branch 0.14., [~vikram.dixit], as per your request, the patch is attached. Please let me know if there is any problem. Thanks. , Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
