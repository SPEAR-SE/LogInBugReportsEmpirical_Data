[Thanks, Ed for picking this up., Having to run very clean takes a lot of bandwidth and a long time. I will prioritize this., HIVE-3092 subsumes this. So, this is no longer needed., Interesting. I upgraded to trunk last night and still had to run very-clean to get a package build to be correct., bq. still had to run very-clean to get a package build to be correct.

What problem did you face which went away when you did {{very-clean}}, Stated problem doesn't exist on trunk any longer., This issue is fixed and released as part of 0.10.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
