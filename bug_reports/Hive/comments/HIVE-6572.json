[Patch attached.

[~owen.omalley], could you please check this patch real quick?

[~rhbutani], I would like this patch to also be included in the hive-0.13 release, since it fixes some erroneous config usage introduced in the 0.13 timeframe, and we don't want to have a release with them, which might make this behaviour something we have to support in the longer run., Review board link : https://reviews.apache.org/r/18878/, [~ashutoshc], I'd appreciate your eyes on this for a review as well. :),
