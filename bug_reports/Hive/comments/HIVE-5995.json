[[~xuefuz] looking at this commit history https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/771fceec84bc4c7f13465e0cfd2a7f580e7945a1#diff-65a6d9e7aa2b97ae5b4e6f2f7e81c63f
 your change inserted a blank line at line no:585. This causes failure of decimal_precision.q in precommit tests. I just regenerated the test output file. Any idea why that blank like was inserted in your commit?, [~prasanth_j] Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I believe this was caused by a merge. My bad. Your patch looked good. +1.

I will commit it right way after tests run., HIVE-5598 removed last dummy line. Seemed caused by that., Committed to trunk for quick fix. Thanks, Prasanth!]
