ATTACHMENT ID: 12616792, [~xuefuz] Have done what you commented on RB., +1, Patch committed to trunk. Thank Yu for the contribution., This should be documented in the wiki in [Show Partitions|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-ShowPartitions].

For example: 

{quote}
SHOW PARTITIONS \[db_name.]table_name
{quote}

and: 

{quote}
SHOW PARTITIONS \[db_name.]table_name PARTITION(ds='2010-03-03');
SHOW PARTITIONS \[db_name.]table_name PARTITION(hr='12');
SHOW PARTITIONS \[db_name.]table_name PARTITION(ds='2010-03-03', hr='12');
{quote}

I'll add \[db_name.] to the wiki examples if you okay the changes here.

Also, does similar syntax work for SHOW TBLPROPERTIES, or does it have an "IN | FROM db_name" clause?  (See [Show Table Properties|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-ShowTableProperties].)  All other SHOW statements have some way to specify the database., Thanks for pointing doc impact, [~leftylev]. My bad for forgetting this.

Your change seems correct. This JIRA only addressed "show partitions". Based on the code, however, it seems "SHOW TBLPROPERTIES" doesn't take db_name. To be consistent, I think it's better we add that also. I created HIVE-5956 for that matter., Doc done, with version information:  [Show Partitions|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-ShowPartitions].]
