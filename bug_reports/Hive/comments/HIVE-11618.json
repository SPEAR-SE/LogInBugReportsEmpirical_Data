ATTACHMENT ID: 12751818 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks [~owen.omalley] for the patch.

The patch looks good. I understand how you want to keep this code simple by returning one type for a group of same primitive values. Just one small feedback. What about adding some comments to {{CovertAstToSearchArg.getType}} and {{PredicateLeaf.Type}} for future reference about simplicity? Other developers might see this lack of data types, and they will be eager to add those. , [~owen.omalley] I'd like to commit this patch so that we can continue with the FLOAT types.
Is that ok?, [~spena] Thanks for reviewing and committing this.

You're right that we should add a comment to PredicateLeaf.Type that explains the rationale for the list of types.]
