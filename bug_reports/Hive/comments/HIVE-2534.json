Review request for hive, Yongqiang He and namit jain.


Summary
-------

Fixes an issue with HiveIndexResult where the constructor would fail if the file system for temp directories differed from the default file system in the conf.

Instead of getting the file system from the conf, it gets it from the paths.

Thanks to Yongqiang for identifying the issue and suggesting the fix.


This addresses bug HIVE-2534.
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2534
