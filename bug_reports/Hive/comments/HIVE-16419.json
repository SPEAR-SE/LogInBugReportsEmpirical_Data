[In HIVE-14837, we were trying to shade the hadoop core classes into the JDBC standalone jar so that the JDBC program does not need to specify the hadoop dependencies. However later on we found some issues with it which was hard to tackle with, e.g. the JDBC program using core-site.xml which contains hard-coded class names. So the best solution would be not including the hadoop classes and ask the user to explicitly specify it.

cc [~thejas], [~pxiong], [~vgumashta] Can you also take a look at the patch? Thanks!,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12862898 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~taoli-hwx]: does this patch make -standalone jars need additional jars to work as a jdbc driver?, This change is basically reverting change from HIVE-14837. The hadoop jars do need to be added in classpath with this change. The reason that we are reverting this change is because we were running some issues with the shaded classes. For example, the un-relocated class name is specified in core-site.xml, while the standalone jar contains the relocated/renamed classes, which causes CNF issue., +1, [~taoli-hwx] ...I might misunderstood your commend...but I think that if the "standalone" driver needs additional jars; that effectively makes it not standalone :), If you think it is a blocker, [~vgumashta] and [~taoli-hwx], could u commit it to master, branch-2 and branch-2.3 asap when it is ready? thanks., Committed. Thanks [~taoli-hwx]]
