[[~ashutoshc] I discussed this with [~jcamachorodriguez] today and it looks like Hive does group by before doing left semi join anyway. e.g. {noformat} select a from t1 left semi join t2 on t1.a=t2.b {noformat} will generate GBY on t2.b before doing Left Semi Join. 
Is there any improvement which physical Left Semi Join operator has in this case ?, yes.. there is. You may note (from the plan in attached patch) that Gby is only in mapper, not in reducer. This is possible since LSJ operator understands the semantics, such that GBy in reducer is obviated. Net perf win here is to not compute GBy on reducer side., [~ashutoshc], patch makes sense, and by doing transformation at the end, there should not be any interaction with other rules that might prevent some optimizations from triggering. As a side note, it might be worth extending the original Calcite rule, since we have a native HiveSemiJoin operator in Hive that we might want to use instead of the Logical instance.

In addition, there was a flag in HiveJoin that was used to know whether a Join was a Semijoin or not; if I remember from previous discussions, this was done this way because 1) many rules only apply to Join (and not to Semijoin), thus we would not like to prevent some optimizations in Calcite from triggering, but 2) we still want to calculate stats differently for these cases. However, I am not sure if we take into account this flag when we translate back to Hive? Should we either take into account or extend the rule to transform HiveJoin + isSemijoin=true to HiveSemiJoin?, Did some investigation and found HIVE-15234 Resolving that first will better inform this issue., Updated patch to add rule to generate HiveSemiJoin nodes.,

Is there a Calcite issue to make SemiJoinRule use a custom RelBuilder? Could you create it/link it to this issue? We should try to include it in new Calcite release.

You might want to run locally _auto_sortmerge_join_2.q_ to double-check that it is not related to the patch., We can use CALCITE-1495 for changes in this rule. _auto_sortmerge_join_2.q_ is a flaky test. It fails intermittently even locally. Its a poorly written test since it depends on memory of system. 

By the way, I also added the flag {{hive.enable.semijoin.conversion}} for the rule. 
Pushed to master.  , Doc note:  *hive.enable.semijoin.conversion* needs to be documented in the wiki for release 2.2.0.

* [Configuration Properties -- Query and DDL Execution | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-QueryandDDLExecution]

Added a TODOC2.2 label.

Edit (16/Feb/17):  HIVE-15894 changes the parameter name from *hive.enable.semijoin.conversion* to *hive.optimize.semijoin.conversion*, also in release 2.2.0., See commit 7a30ac4abd7f861fc7ba694e43693420ba01745c for the final patch, which isn't the same as those attached here or in the review board.]
