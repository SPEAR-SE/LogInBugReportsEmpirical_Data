[The inputs and outputs from the ReadEntity and WriteEntity are passed to the hooks.
However, the StatsTask may have updated these objects. 
Isn't it possible that the hooks (post execution) will see a stale version of this data ?
And, if these hooks update these objects and write them back to the metastore, 
the Stats changes will be lost.]
