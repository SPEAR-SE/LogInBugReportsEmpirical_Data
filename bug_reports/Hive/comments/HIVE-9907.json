select 1 , '中文1' , '中文2'
from dual ;

that is ok .

but update ... values ( '中文' )  is not ok 

this problem make me crazy . , any one can tell me what i can find this problem cast by which  class ？, i found that

 DEBUG orc.OrcRecordUpdater (OrcRecordUpdater.java:insert(331)) -   
org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazybinary.LazyBinaryStruct bs = (org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazybinary.LazyBinaryStruct) row;

        List ls = bs.getFieldsAsList();
        for (int i = 0; i < ls.size(); i++) {
            LOG.debug(" lfh insert ls " + i  + " = " + ls.get(i));
        }


 lfh insert ls 0 = -�_2, Attached patch solved this issue, pls check., I'm confused on what is being reported here.  The initial descriptions seems to say that this doesn't work with insert values, but there's a test (insert_values_nonascii.q) that explicitly tests this case and passes.  Does this just not work on some OS or JVM configurations?  A later comment implies this doesn't work with update.

In general the patch looks good, but I'd like to know exactly what we're fixing first.  The patch should address insert values, but won't help update.

Niklaus, I've assigned the JIRA to you.  The next step is for you to mark it patch available so it can be run through the tests., 1. Aleksei Statkevich had fixed this bug (see HIVE-11721 and HIVE-12207).
2. In addition, If you're using Hive CLI or Beeline, you should export LC_ALL=zh_CN.UTF-8, because both of them use JLine ConsoleReader, Whose characterset encoding depends on your system configuration.]
