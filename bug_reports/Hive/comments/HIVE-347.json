[The changes look good. I think the Error Message will confuse users since they see a partition predicate. I think error message should say something about incorrect type or quotes., +1 looks good.

Can you change the comment to remove mention of 'date string' since that's not always the case?, done
, committed., There was a problem with the above patch. TRUE and unknown is unknown, therefore the patch was breaking for the following case:

select .. from T where partCol = value and col = 1;


col = 1 will be null even for 'value' partition, therefore 'value' partition will also be unknown.


The basic problem is that there is a implicit int to string conversion I dont think this can/should be fixed.
will upload a new patch undoing the patch, +1

looks good to me.]
