[Targeting 2.0.1 for now, depends on an unreleased Tez patch., [~sseth] can you take a look? This uses the new API, +1, Jenkins run on HIVE-13097., The bugfix would require upgrading 2.0.1 to Tez 0.8.3 and porting a bunch of other changes. Moving out; LLAP on HBase is not an important enough scenario, and the other tokens (e.g. for HDFS) are still propagated correctly.]
