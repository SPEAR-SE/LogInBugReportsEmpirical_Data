[Hi there,

Any update on this old bug? We are trying to use Hive serde to read some thrift data that contain sets. Also curious any reason it has stayed open for three year?

Thanks!
Feng, Is there any objection to supporting "Set" type? If no, I will work on a patch and post it here., +1 on implementing this data type!, Cool, I will work on a patch to add "Set" support., Finished first version of the patch that covers the read path. Tested using our thrift data with sets and it worked fine. 

We'd like to use the complex thrift struct added in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3323 for the unit tests. It'd be nice if someone take a look at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3323 first. Thanks!, Hey [~pengfeng] - now that HIVE-3323 is closed can you update the test & post this patch for review?, Posted patch to reviewboard: https://reviews.apache.org/r/7124/., Hey Hive committers - can one of you please take a look at this patch? We'd love to let users start using sets!, I get the feeling that it could be a larger change then just this patch. We can now group on collections etc and I an curios if UDF's that return a Set which will now be treated as a list, will suddenly start returning a set, and what that will mean. I will start poking around with this a bit., Patch is stale an no longer applies.  ]
