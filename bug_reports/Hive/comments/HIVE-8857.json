[Calcite 0.9.2-incubating was released shortly after Hive 0.14 froze, having spent ~6 days in the voting process. It is virtually identical to the 0.9.2-incubating-SNAPSHOT posted at https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/calcite/, so you could drop it in as a replacement., There are two things here: Having a SNAPSHOT dep in a release is a problem to begin with, but having a hive release with broken dependencies on maven central is even more problematic. How am I as user supposed to know, that I need to add a "random" snapshot repository to get my hive working?]
