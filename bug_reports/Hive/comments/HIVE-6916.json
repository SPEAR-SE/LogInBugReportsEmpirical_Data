ATTACHMENT ID: 12640558, [~xuefuz] can you please help review this?, I put a couple of minor comments on RB.

One thing to clarify though, the purpose of this JIRA is to make imported data file inherit the target directory's permission, regardless where we got the original data file, either exported or hand-made. Thus, it has nothing to with export. Is my assumption correct?, Thanks for the review.  I can address the first comment.  For the second comment, the FileUtil is actually in HDFS, and there is a separate one in Hive.

It is actually going to be for both export or import, as the use-case is user also want inheritance on the folder/files after hive exports to another location., Got it. Thanks for the explanation.

I left additional comments on RB for your consideration., Thanks for the review.  Sorry forgot to upload the new patch., +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12640875, Failures not related to the patch.  Interestingly, testRetryingHMSHandler reproduced the 'out of sequence' thrift issue, looks like concurrency bug., Patch committed to trunk. Thanks to Szehon for the patch., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
