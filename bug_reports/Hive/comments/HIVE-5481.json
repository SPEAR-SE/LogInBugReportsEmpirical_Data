This message is automatically generated., HIVE-5510 make , HIVE-5510 make similar changes. We can wait for HIVE-5510 check in and close the ticket., currently all webhcat e2e tests pass on trunk with Hadoop1 even w/o this patch.  How do you explain this?, [~ekoifman] It could be because of [HIVE-5510|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5510] due to which the values returned were a mix of TempletonController job and the launced job (and possibly the job completion was for the launched job), which I believe will now be changed to return the values only for the TempletonController job. Thus, TempletonController job should always succeed unless it's a -ve test for the TempletonController job., Fixed in: [HIVE-5510|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5510]]
