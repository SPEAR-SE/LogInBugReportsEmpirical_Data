[Current HIVE implements the NDV using Flajolet-Martin algorithm. In this algorithm, it assumes that we can have a a hash function hash(x) which maps input x to integers in the range [0; 2^{L-1}] and where the outputs are sufficiently UNIFORMLY distributed. 

Thus, if we assume an UNIFORM distribution, the density of the NDV should also be the same. Moreover, since we already have the min/max as well as NDV for each partition, we can calculate the density for each partition. We use the average of the density of all the partitions for the aggregation. This method is not only independent of the # of partitions which runs fast, but also is easy to extended to extrapolation cases where we miss the status of some of the partitions.

This patch also address the bug in HIVE-9717, Awesome :) 
I am happy we can fix this.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12699583 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~mmokhtar], the test failure is unrelated and it passed on my laptop. Could you please try the patch? It could be applied on trunk. Thanks., [~pxiong] if there is a review request for it already, can you post a link here?, +1 code changes look good., address the metastore configuration flag,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12723797 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The failed test "TestHCatClient" is unrelated and it passed on my laptop. [~ashutoshc], could you please take a look? I think it is ready to go. Thanks., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, [~pxiong], Doc note:  This adds *hive.metastore.stats.ndv.densityfunction* to HiveConf.java, so it needs to be documented in Configuration Properties for 1.2.0.  Presumably it belongs in the metastore section but it's also relevant to statistics so a cross-reference would be helpful.

* [Configuration Properties -- MetaStore | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-MetaStore]
* [Configuration Properties -- Statistics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-Statistics], This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
