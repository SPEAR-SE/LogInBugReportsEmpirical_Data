[I don't know how to bypass such issue, but I know that setting {{mapreduce.job.name}} manually can put Hive jobs in restricted Yarn pools.  So, if authorization is enabled, I assume that a check was added to avoid users specify a Yarn pool that they're not allowed to use. Instead, Hive might assign a pool that you're allowed to use based on the HS2 user name., @Sergio Pe√±a
Many Thanks ! I solved the issue by set hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist.append=|mapreduce.job.*|mapreduce.map.*|mapreduce.reduce.* .
From the document I know hs2 limits set parameters when security is enabled . By default mapreduce.job.name is not in param hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist .
