[Let me clarify: 
It should ask for username  if -u parameter is given without username AND (no -n connection parameter given and 
(no javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName given and no ConnectionUserName parameter found.))

For password prompt:
if -p given without value
OR (-u parameter is given with no passwd  AND none of javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword and ConnectionPassword found.)

[~vihangk1] Am I correct?

, Is this related to HIVE-13589?, I think this JIRA can be closed. Earlier I thought that when you use beeline -u <url> to connect using Beeline, it should prompt for a username/password and not assume that username and password is empty string. But it seems like this is by design and should not be changed. Otherwise it might break backwards compatibility. Existing scripts which rely on this behavior might break. HIVE-13589 is a different use-case where if the user likes he/she can provide the password on the console using the password prompt (without showing it on the screen) for security reasons when using beeline -u <url> -n <user> -p syntax., I have no access to close it., Closing as per discussion above. Thanks [~mcsanady] for following up on this.]
