[A temporary solution is to use org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader() instead of OrcStorage(). But it will be great to store the real field names in ORC data files.

* the field names inside nested structures are preserved even if we generate the ORC via Hive, [~prasanth_j], is that fixed in newer versions?, Yes. HIVE-4243 is the jira that fixes it., [~ericsun2], which Hive version are you using? Can you backport the patch yourself?, Hi [~daijy], we are not yet on 1.2.1

I will ping [~freepeter] to see if we can backport this fix.

Thanks a lot!]
