ATTACHMENT ID: 12730072 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The failed test seems not related to this patch., Committed to trunk.  Thanks Chaoyu!, This has also been committed to branch-1.2 and branch-1.0 for upcoming releases 1.2.2 and 1.0.2.

The commit to branch-1.2 is 37e1f833ea1aece3b1e744e6d6db55fdb1514573 (Sept. 1) and the commit to branch-1.0 is 7bc067a64802fbaa72996e8ef41e2134d71c5c14 (Sept 24).

Fix Version/s currently says "1.3.0, 2.0.0" but I don't find a commit to branch-1 for 1.3.0 in email, searching by jira number or subject line.  Is it in the branch?, [~leftylev] Thanks for checking that. I was able to find the commit in branch-1 and 2.0.0 both with commit hashcode 8fb805225c9d6960c7d39d862de6b3326650551c

    HIVE-10571 : HiveMetaStoreClient should close existing thrift connection before its reconnect (Chaoyu Tang via Szehon)
{code}
, Thanks [~ctang.ma].  My email message with that commit ID only shows master -- how strange.

The backports for 1.0.2 and 1.2.2 should also be listed in Fix Version/s so that release notes can pick up this jira when those versions are released.]
