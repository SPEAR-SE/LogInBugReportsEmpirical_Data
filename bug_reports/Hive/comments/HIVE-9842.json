ATTACHMENT ID: 12702257 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Removing fix version of 1.2.0 in preparation of release, since this is not a blocker for 1.2.0., Reattaching same patch for precommit. 
[~sushanth] ok for 1.2.1? This enables cleanup of HS2 state due to improperly closed session/failed operations. The feature exists already, this patch just enables it., Unless the patch is a major API change or changes db schema, all patches are currently on auto-approve for branch-1.2 as long as the committer adds it to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+1.2+Release+Status .

Please go ahead and add it to the list and backport to branch-1.2,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12735738 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Don't you have to change the TimeUnit for the validator too?, [~hagleitn]
The TimeUnit in validator is just the default time unit, that gets used if the user just specifies a number without units. Changing that would be backward incompatible change.
, Patch 4 sets session timeout to 7 days to account for scenarios like long weekends, sets operation timeout to a day and doesn't let session timeout kick in till all operation handles are not cleaned (either due to operation completing, or removed due to timeout).

[~thejas] do these defaults look good? , After some discussion with [~thejas] changing the default op timeout to +5 days. This implementation will need some improvement though as it decouples session/operations wrt timeout and does not update op timeout when checking for op status; will create a followup., +1, Committed to master and 1.2.1. Thanks [~thejas], Doc note:  This changes the default values of four HS2 configuration parameters in 1.2.1, so I added a TODOC1.2 label (because we don't have a TODOC1.2.1 label).

The new defaults should be documented, with version information, here:

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.server2.session.check.interval | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.server2.session.check.interval]
* [Configuration Properties -- hive.server2.idle.session.timeout | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.server2.idle.session.timeout]

* *hive.server2.idle.session.check.operation* isn't documented in the wiki yet, but it belongs in the same section.  It was introduced in 1.2.0 by HIVE-10146.]
