[This one is basically a duplicate of HIVE-2708 and also reported against Hadoop as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-6312 If you look at the latter you will see that we can reproduce this problem on our cluster with Hive 0.14.0 and 1.1.0 using YARN scheduler.

There is a patch against 0.14.0 - https://github.com/radimk/hive/commit/3e5c7c47af69b27dfae4c1280a89346e843bd5f3
and against 1.1.0 - https://github.com/radimk/hive/commit/bf4d047274fb3fddd9bcfe8432154cda222e6582

What do we need to do to get it accepted or to help with any alternate way how to fix this issue?, My cluster is hadoop 2.6.0, hive1.1.0, with the same bug, I tried recompile the code of https://github.com/radimk/hive/commit/bf4d047274fb3fddd9bcfe8432154cda222e6582 
and replace the output jar(hive-exec-1.1.0.jar) of hive, but this did not worked, i dont know why?

I think this problem happens because of not enough space left in HDFS. Try to increase your cluster's data storage or decrease replication number in Hadoop: dfs.replication=1. If you num your cluster on Amazon EMR, then by default replication number is 3 in case of 6+ EC2 instances (I might be wrong here as I don't remember exact number, but you can find it on amazon aws website).

With best,
Valera, [~myltik] Please look at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-6312 again. Our problem is not caused by lack of space on HDFS. It is a race condition in code that reads status of job., Looks like the problem was because of lack of disk space in HDFS. This was caused by replication factor variable set to a value > 1, so to process 1TB of data we had to have 2TB of disk space in HDFS, which we didn't have.
Sorry for late reply., hello,everyone!
This problem maybe very easy to slove if we were met the same problem.
please see this
