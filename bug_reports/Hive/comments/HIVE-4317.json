[i checked the problem, it seems the java.beans.PersistenceDelegate.mutatesTo(Object oldInstance, Object newInstance) will return false even the oldInstance and newInstance is same class name, but because the classloader is different,it will lead to the class different.
i found the add jar will change the classloader by create new URLClassloader, so i modified the code by reusing the old classloader, i verified, by this way, the classloader will not change. i still not know why the classloader will changed in the cocurrent scenario.
i provide one patch, hope you people can review and give suggestion., this issue is similar with hive-2706, hive-2666, pls reference ., I think JDBC connection is not thread-safe and should not be used like that., Where is the SOE occurring? I.e. jdbc client, HS1, HS2, etc?

Please add a review item for this patch, this is described under "Review Process" here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute, Cancelling patch since there are questions about this occurs and an open request for a RB item., I can confirm that this also happens in Hive 0.12 and is fully reproducible.]
