[[~prasadm] The change looks good. Is it possible to stick the tests in one of the existing test case classes though? 
, [~vaibhavgumashta] Thanks for taking a look.
The problem is the nosasl transport mode. It needs to be set via system property (till HIVE-6665 is committed) and 
restart the server. That's what I had to add it to a separate test.
, [~prasadm] Thanks for the patch. Looks good to me.  +1

I have rebased it for the latest trunk.
, HIVE-6715.3.patch - In current trunk, setting the auth property via conf for MiniHS2 is what works  (HiveAuthFactory no longer creates a new hiveconf). Updating test case.
, [~vikram.dixit] This is a useful bug fix. It is also small and should not be destabilizing. If it is not too late, would like to include it in 0.14 .
, +1 for 0.14, Thanks [~thejas]!,

, This looks like it doesn't need any user documentation ... but I want to be sure., It is a bug fix. No documentation required for this one.
