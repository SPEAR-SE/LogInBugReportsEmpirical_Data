[Uploading patch HIVE-1039.patch. This fixes the issue where only 1 moveTask was added when multipole local directories appear in a multi-insert., looks ok - but can you add the following tests:

1. hive.merge.maptasks = true
multi table insert query (map only)

2. hive.merge.maptasks = false
multi table insert query (map only)


3. hive.merge.maptasks = true
multi directory insert query (map only)

4. hive.merge.maptasks = false
multi directory insert query (map only)

5. hive.merge.mapredtasks = true
multi table insert query (map-reduce)

6. hive.merge.mapredtasks = false
multi table insert query (map-reduce)

, Uploading new patch includes unit tests mentioned above. , @Ning, can you test union for same table (map only) with a multi table insert also ?, Namit, do you mean something like this?

from (select * from src  union all select * from src) s
insert overwrite table src_multi1 select * where key < 10
insert overwrite table src_multi2 select * where key > 10 and key < 20;

, This is needed for 0.5 also, Discussed with Namit offline, and found a larger issue in multi-insert for table as well if hive.merge.mapfiles=false. The problem is that each TableScanOperator will create a new task as currTask. Any operator that takes multiple parent topOp should merge the tasks into one. Currently GenMRUnion1 does not merge currTask, that's why cause this problem. We decided to fix this issue in GenMRFileSink1() as it is now in this patch for 0.5.0 and I will file another JIRA for trunk to merge tasks in GenMRUnion1. 

The HIVE-1039_3.patch contains the fix for the broader problem mentioned above, and a minor fix for checking hive.merge.mapredfiles together with existance of reducer. Also more tests are added to cover multi-insert involving UNION and all combinations of the two hive.merge paramters. , +1

looks good - will commit to both 0.5 and trunk if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Ning]
