[May be we can add a line here https://hive.apache.org/downloads.html once we release 3.0. [~ashutoshc] What is the best way to highlight this?, [~ekoifman] Can you provide the text which should be highlighted?, The on-disk layout of Acid tables has changed in Hive 3.0.  Any Acid table partition that had Update/Delete/Merge statement executed since the last Major compaction must execute Major compaction before upgrading to 3.0.  No more Update/Delete/Merge may be executed against these tables since the start of Major compaction.  Not following this may lead to data corruption.  Tables/partitions that only contain results of Insert statements are fully compatible and don't need to be compacted.]
