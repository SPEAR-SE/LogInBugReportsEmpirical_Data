[Could you rebase the patch? , Nice patch! It'd be great to get this in., Linking to HIVE-4675 as we could improve the parallel build speed given this change., navis requested code review of "HIVE-4290 [jira] Build profiles: Partial builds for quicker dev".

HIVE-4290 Build profiles: Partial builds for quicker dev

Building is definitely taking longer with hcat, hs2 etc in the build. When you're working on one area of the system though, it would be easier to have an option to only build that. Not for pre-commit or build machines, but for dev this should help.

ant clean package build OR
ant -Dbuild.profile=full clean package test --> build everything

ant -Dbuild.profile=core clean package test --> build just enough to run the tests in ql

ant -Dbuild.profile=hcat clean package test --> build only hcatalog

, Rebased to trunk and registered to phabricator for a review. 
Removed "hcat" profile (not possible to deploy solely by HIVE-4278) and added "nohcat" profile(was HIVE-4728), [~navis] thanks for the rebase and sorry for dropping the ball on this. i think if we're not doing the hcat only profile, the patch can be a little simpler. i've ran all build combinations i could think of: .2 seems to complete all of them.

Kicking off a full run now. Will report back with results., Test came back clean for me. I think .2 is ready., Committed to trunk. Thanks Gunther!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop1-ptest #75 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop1-ptest/75/])
