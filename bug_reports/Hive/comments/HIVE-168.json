[A couple of minor comments:

1. mergeTask function is actually also doing a splitTask, so we should name it appropriately.
2. setCurrTasks is done twice (inside mergeTask and also in the callers). We should just get rid of the calls in the callers.\

Also please file a separate JIRA to make the explain output better (so that the tasks and seen in the order of dependencies instead of the order of names).
, done and filed the new JIRA
